{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A real gem of a camera ... but don't expect image quality miracles", "Author": "Pseudorandom Parents", "ReviewID": "RE4YPJUVDOWFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the last 6 years I've used a couple of compacts which I've since got rid of after upgrading to DSLRs (Canon XT and then 40D). For a while I was waiting for a compact that I could carry with me anywhere I want, and particularly to parties and other social occasions where bringing a DSLR is really not an option.When this camera was announced it really looked like a dream compact for me. Fast, wide and optically stabilized lens is ideal for low-light indoor shots. The design is stylish and beautiful, the camera is quite compact and it has all the controls an advanced amateur would need.Further the sensor is essentially as big as they get in compact cameras and with almost reasonable 10mp (still about 5mp too many but not as bad as 12-15mp you would get in any other compact with a comparable sensor).I've had the camera for a couple of weeks now (and shame on Amazon for not having it in stock a month after it appeared in some other big stores). I like it a lot and the camera delivers on most of Panny's promises. Here are some of the experiences.1. The image quality is certainly and noticeably better than the ulracompact cameras (like Panny's own FX series). It is however still a compact camera ... meaning there is visible noise even at ISO 80 and lots of noise at ISO 400. However noise reduction algorithms seem to be doing quite a good job and ISO 80 pics look very nice ... sometimes almost like a DSLR. And even at ISO 400 most shots are good enough to keep. In general the output from this camera is comparable to my 40D at 8 times the ISO (that is 80 on LX3 is about 640 on 40D and 400 LX3 is a bit better than 3200 on 40D). Fortunately, with fast lens and image stabilization I almost never need to use ISO above 400.2. The camera is very responsive and the autofocus is fast and seems accurate.3. Changing ISO through the menus is a bit of a pain but a variety of useful ISO regimes are provided. In general controlling all the options is not very easy ... but I guess that's the compromise you get with such a small camera with a large LCD.Update: it is possible to simplify ISO changing by reassigning a button for this purpose. The drawback of this is that now reviewing pictures becomes more cumbersome.4. Aspect ratio switch on the lens is more useful than I thought ... saves quite a lot of cropping.5. Shooting in RAW+jpeg is fast enough to be usable.6. The camera is quite a bit bulkier than it might seem (and the given dimensions are misleading since they do not include the lens and other protrusions from the main part of the body). It is not shirt-pocketable both because of its size and weight ... but fits fine in a jacket pocket or purse.7. The macro capability of the camera is really excellent.8. Having user customizable preset regimes on the dial is very useful and quite a luxury not present even on Canon XSi DSLR (shame on Canon!)Overall it's a great compact camera: in my opinion certainly the best on the market by a margin (I've studied the market very thoroughly). It is in the same league as Canon G-series (which I owned back when they were the best and liked a lot) but fits my current needs much more than a Canon Gx. I also think it's a real bargain at around $400.But it is still a compact camera with a sensor 1/8 area of most DSLRs and 1/20 of full frame (mostly pro) DSLR. So those expecting miracles like close-to-DSLR quality or usable ISO 800+ might be disappointed.==================================================================A quick update in response to a comment:1. At widest setting of the zoom there is quite significant distortion especially noticeable in 16:9 regime. There is also noticeable loss of sharpness in the corners. This might not look good in some shots (like if a straight like or someones face is close to the border) but nothing too bad for most of the shots.2. HD video is very good for a compact. There is no zooming, no auto focus and sometimes exposure adjustments are not very smooth. So I'd not recommend to treat it as a camcorder. But overall it gives detailed  and reasonably smooth video (well not quite 30fps smooth). I've just made a quick comparison with Canon HF10 dedicated compact camcorder (which is as good as they get these days). In bright light LX3 cannot quite match the 1080p detail of Canon. But in relatively dim light it is about as good. Also LX3 has a huge advantage in wide angle. All dedicated consumer camcorders have widest angle around 40mm which is much worse than 24mm of LX3.Another impression which I have with LX3 and certainly did not have with other compacts is that it is a tool worth learning and investing some time and experimentation. My pics with this camera keep improving even the first ones were already decent.For anyone interested in sharpness and noise level comparisons with some cameras you can check out[...]=======================================================================Update Dec 17: Finally Photoshop and Lightroom started to recognize LX3 raws. The quality of my pictures is now even higher: colors much more pleasing and noise reduction less \"blotchy\". Overall this camera gives results well beyond what I thought to be possible for a compact camera. So it still has my highest recommendation.Update Jan 27, 2009.The single most annoying thing about this camera is its lens cap. Having to remove it slows you down. Attaching via a string leaves it dangling ... which detracts from the aesthetics of the camera and can add a bit of extra shake. Without the string it's likely to get lost ... and I have not seen any replacements on sale. Anyway, fortunately, creative peoples found out that Ricoh LC-1 lens adapter can be easily modified to be used on this camera. I've did this and it works much better than the original cap. I've uploaded some pictures of the result to the product images. Use google to find the modification instructions.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!", "Author": "William V. Mcclung \"ncbill\"", "ReviewID": "R3QP06IWB5WRUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me establish some credentials.  I have been making photographs for 57 years, for personal satisfaction and for work.  For 24 of those years, I also ran a part-time wedding photography business.  I have been using digital cameras since 2001 and have owned many Nikon digital SLRs (D100, D200, D300) and a number of compact digital cameras.With that out of the way, let me simply say, \"the Panasonic LX3 is the BEST compact digital camera I have ever owned and, in my opinion, there is nothing else currently in its class that even comes close.\"  I feel so strongly about the merits of the LX3, I am purchasing another one to put up for future use.  It's THAT good!Yes, its a bit pricey ..... no, it will not replace a DSLR for some things ..... no, it is not for everyone.  Because of the limited zoom range (35mm equivalent of 24mm to 60mm), I would not recommend the camera to those who might need more zoom for outdoor sports, etc.  But, if you can live within the zoom limitations, you will find the 24mm wide angle, amazing low-light capability and VERY effective stabilization system to be priceless.The \"iA\" setting (puts the camera on \"fully automatic\") is the best I have ever seen, allowing anyone to routinely make outstanding images.  For experienced photographers, the LX3 opens up a whole new world for compact cameras, used when it is not possible or convenient to carry a DSLR or used as a back-up or companion camera for your DSLR.I purchased my LX3 in September 2008.  Since then, my D300 and other cameras have likely felt very neglected!  I have posted some sample images on this page.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic LX3", "Author": "P. Stripling", "ReviewID": "R14VYPB8KBEHMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Panasonic LX3It's not a world-shaking camera, but it's a good one. I give it 4 stars.I've been taking pictures for pleasure since the 70s. I've owned a Nikon rangefinder, a Yashicamat 124G, a Pentax 67, and a variety of Nikon SLRs since back in the ancient days of film. Most of my cameras have been fully manual: set the focus by hand, set the zoom by hand (if there is a zoom), set the aperture and shutter speed by hand. All those cameras have separate lens caps, too.I've also owned several all-automatic point & shoots, and I now own a Nikon D-70, which is my main camera these days. I got my LX3 a couple of weeks ago, and I've devoted a good bit of time to reading the manual and putting the instructions to use on the LX3.My understanding of most items is that they're all the product of compromises. Some of the compromises work for me, some I can live with, and some are deal breakers. The LX3 has its compromises: the zoom is 2.5X; when you take a video, the camera locks the zoom and focus when the recording begins. I'm more aggravated by this latter compromise - I'd prefer to be able to zoom in and out while making a video, but it's not a deal breaker for me.The small things I like are the slides and dial for some controls instead of buttons or menus. A sliding switch to turn it on means I don't accidentally hit the power button when I meant to press the shutter release. The slide for the flash means I really have to mean to raise the flash -- it doesn't pop up accidentally because my fingers were in the wrong place. A slide fastener for the battery/SD access means (I hope) a more secure fastening of that door. There's a slide switch to select picture mode or view mode. I also like the rotating dial for modes. I can turn the camera on with it set to video, even though I last used it for still photos. No drilling down through menus as the event passes me by. I use the dial to determine exposure mode (P, A, S, manual, and custom) before I turn the camera on or while it's coming on. In the dark and without my reading glasses, I can see my mode in the LCD; if I change it, it shows me an animation of the dial selecting the modes. I like this, since I can't always read the icons on the dial.The major selling point for me, though, is the ability to think about what I'm going to do and to do that. This is a camera that rewards thoughtful photography. Do I want to show the slide on a regular TV, a computer, or on Hi-Def TV? I can choose the aspect ratio accordingly by using a slide switch right on the lens. Is the background a distraction so that I want to blur it out? I can choose my aperture and let the camera set the shutter speed. Do I want to take a snapshot of someone? I can choose to have the camera find the face and set focus and exposure on that. Is someone in bright light? I can set the flash to -1 or -2 EV and soften the shadows without overpowering the sun. Is someone backlit? I can choose spot metering and use the focus function and joystick to put the spot to be metered right on the subjects eyes and get a good exposure.I have set up a couple of specific setting combinations and saved them as custom modes. I can select them using the mode dial (one is selected without further ado; the others require a quick selection from a menu that pops up - slows me down, but not too much).With my Nikon FM2, all settings are totally manual, and the camera is set up to make it easy: aperture is a ring on the lens and shutter speed is a dial on the body. Twist another ring to focus on the screen through the eyepiece. On the LX3, things are different, so it takes some getting used to. Shutter speed and aperture are manually set using the joystick, so it's not an immediate result. Focus is also done using the joystick and looking at the LCD, and I'm not happy with that yet. Maybe I will be. So far, though, I'm happier setting the focus using the focus button and the joystick to put the focus dot on what I where I want the focus to be and letting the camera handle it. It's slower than my FM2 but faster than using the joystick to manually focus. (And more accurate so far.)User interfaces are personal. If you don't like the interface on the LX3, you won't like the camera. I like it fine. I'd prefer to have the menu drop me back in to the last-used selection, but it starts at the top every time. I'd prefer to be able to press the menu/set button and have it scroll to the next menu item, but I have to use the select buttons instead. Overall, I give the user interface high marks; there's a quick menu accessible from the joystick which gives you quick access to often-used items.Some observations: it's a light camera, but it's not small. The dimensions are for the body of the camera, but the lens, even when the camera is shut off, extends from the body almost another inch. My wife has a Canon G9, and the volume of the two cameras is identical if you take the LX3's lens into account. It won't fit in your shirt pocket. I've used lens caps for so long, it's a non-issue for me. I have no problems with the removable lens cap. The Hi-Def videos are excellent. I shoot in RAW all the time; conversion to JPEGs is not much more burdensome than shooting in JPEG, and having all the photo information available to play around with rewards any extra time it takes. Your mileage will vary, but all the options I have available on the LX3 makes using RAW a good decision for me.Another observation is the barrel distortion at 5.1mm. I've photographed quadrille paper at 5.1mm and 12.8mm at all three aspect ratios. At 5.1mm, barrel distortion in the graph paper is quite obvious. However, in the real world I never notice the distortion in my wide-angle photos or videos. I'm sure other people will notice and be put off by it. The distortion can be corrected by some photo editing applications if it bothers you.Further, the LX3 has a distinctive lens flare pattern: if you shoot into some specular lights, you get a vertical line up and down the entire photo for each light.If you use your point and shoot for snapshots, I'm not sure the LX3 is worth the big bucks. Leaving it on automatic and JPEGs doesn't seem to me to be worth $500. If you want to make photographs instead of taking snaps, I think this camera is worth comparing with others of its ilk (the Canon G9, for example [or better, the G11 when it comes out]). The LX3 does not make photos equal in quality to DSLRs, but it's much more carriable - and having it on hand when you want to make a photograph means you actually get the photo. For me, the value in the camera lies in having all the choices I get to make in 35mm photography (and DSLR) without having to lug the big iron around all day. It won't replace my D-70 anymore than my other P&S; cameras did, but it's a very worthy adjunct. I would have preferred a much smaller camera, but I'm willing to compromise on the size to get the capabilities of the LX3.JUNE 2011 - I broke the battery door off. I called Panasonic to get an estimate, and I learned that there is a flat-rate cost for all repairs of $275, regardless of the problem. $275 to replace the battery door, and as far as Panasonic is concerned there's no way around it. My local professional camera store says they're prohibited by their vendor contract with Panasonic from doing repairs. I have to send the camera to the authorized repair center for the flat-rate cost.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Digital Camera I've been waiting for!!!!!!", "Author": "Amazonian \"MM\"", "ReviewID": "R3F5E6QQ6B7UVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "O.k. Let me start off by saying that I bought this camera via 17th Street Photo's actual store in the photography district on 17th street here in New York City. I called (on Sept. 10th 2008) before I went to the store and I spoke with a super friendly man named Doug who told me that they got the silver and black ones and that they had 50 each. So, I went down there and immediately bought one. They have a 7 days no questions asked return policy so I tried it out like a crazy man. Keep in mind that if you mention the fact that on EBAY they have the price listed at $475, they will honor it in the store even though they have it priced at $499. Anywho, the purchasing experience with them was excellent.By the way, I've been waiting for Amazon to have this camera too. I pre-ordered both of them (black and silver), and never received an email saying that they were finally available to purchase. So, I took things into my own hands and found it myself (which is explained above).So, onto the previous testing and my current camera:Before purchasing the LX3, I bought the fx500 from Panasonic (from amazon.com) and the Fujifilm f100 (from B&H;) in order to try those out. I wanted to try the fx500 because of the 25mm wide angle lens, 5x optical zoom, and to see what recording movies at 1280 x 720 at 30fps was like.  And, I tried the f100 because I was told at B&H; that the f100 was the best non-noisy camera to shoot indoor shots without flash (FYI the best movie option on the f100 was at 640 x 480 at 30fps so I had no desire in trying that).  I'll get to the results in a minute.  Before those two, I was a Canon Powershot sd500 owner for more than 5 years and loved the camera, but I needed a new one for my honeymoon that is coming up on 10/12 for Hawaii.Results of testing:FX500:  25mm wide angle was awesome, 5x zoom was nice but focusing was a problem even after trying to focus 3 times (keep in mind my hands were steady as a rock so it wasn't due to camera-shaking).  the movie quality at 1280 x 720 at 30fps was a nice improvement from my powershot sd500's 640 x 480 at 30fps, but in the end the actual quality and sound wasn't as eye popping improvement.  Picture quality was very noisy, no matter all of the tinkering that I tried.F100: yes, the picture quality indoors without any flash with this camera was better and less noisy than the fx500, but I ultimately did not keep this camera because of the poor movie quality, wide angle only goes to 28mm, the LCD is small and it's resolution is horrible.So, sorry for the wait, but I thought I'd be as thorough as I possibly could about my review before the review.LX3:Keep in mind, I'd say that I'm an advanced beginner digital photographer. So, after owning the LX3 for almost a month, I simply have to say that I am SOOOOOOOO happy to have finally found the digital camera I've been looking for.  I've read all of the digital camera websites out there, gone to the brick and morter stores to ask specialists directly, gone out and purchased digital cameras to test hands on, etc. etc. to finally come to the pleasure of owning the LX3.What I was look for was a compact digital camera that had:-Excellent wide angle: at 24mm, it's the widest I've ever used, and I cannot go back to a camera even with 28mm ever again.  the 24mm on this camera is SICK!  it blows 28mm out of the park.  I haven't noticed any barrel distortion at 24mm.  if wide angle is the main thing you are looking for in a compact digital camera, LX3 is where you will need to stop.  and it doesn't stop there.  if you get the lens adapter and purchase the wide angle lens, you'll be able to even go to 18mm!!!!.  I haven't gotten that yet.  Oh, I definitely do no mind that this camera doesn't have insane optical zoom options. I'm totally happy with the 24mm-60mm range.  I found out that I personally didn't even use the zoom options that much when I had the sd500 canon that it's range was 35mm-115mm.-Low f-stop: Finally the LX3 is the camera that steps up to the plate to offer an f-stop starting at 2.0.  The slowest you'll see on the other comparable camera companies are at like 2.8.-Excellent indoor no flash quality: If you use the \"iA\" mode in a low light situation it will most likely automatically use ISO400 to take the picture and in the darker parts of the photo (like shadows, etc.) there will be noise, which is common anyway. But, if you use the \"P\" or \"A\" modes and change the \"+/-\" with the \"Q.Menu\" joystick, it will lighten up the photo and reduce the amount of noise. I found this out on my own, and I've been INSANELY pleased with the difference. So, all in all, in indoor low light situations, I now use either the \"P\" or \"A\" mode over the \"iA\" mode.-1280 x 720 HD movie quality:  The fx500 had 1280x720 HD quality at 30fps, while the LX3 has 1280x720 HD quality at 24fps.  And honestly, the LX3 resolution LOOKS and SOUNDS much better to me than the fx500.  Movie after movie that I take, they look and sound amazing. i LOVE the movie HD option on the LX3.  My advise, I bought two 16gb extreme 3 sdhc cards from amazon and I'll have no worries about recording speed and space issues.-Easy to use manual controls: It took me no time to learn them. Easy breezy for a photographer at my level (again: advanced beginner)-Easy to hold: I actually use the around the wrist cord that came with my powershot sd500 and that's fine.  The LX3 comes with a around the neck strap (which I don't use). It does not come with an \"around the wrist\" cord. Maybe I'll use the \"around the neck\" strap for days that I would go on hikes or something like that.  This is NOT a pocket camera.  More of a \"around the wrist\" camera.-3.0inch 460k resolution LCD:  Best LCD for a digital camera I've ever used, and it's AWESOME.  I'd rather have this than a 3.0inch 230k resolution touch screen LCD that the FX500 had.-South of $500: Bought it at $475, no sales tax....and the LX3 met all of those requirements.CONS: You do need a cap for the lens (it comes with one and a cord to attached it to the camera).  Initially, I'd say that was the only semi-annoying thing, but I've already gotten used to it, and it's no biggie at all.  It's a little tough taking vertical shots, but again ... not a big problem at all.Any questions let me know.  I've easily taken north of 2000 shots already of all different types.  Honestly, I'm insanely pleased with this camera.  Oh, I read in another review about noise at iso400.  If you really want to keep a shot taken in iso400 indoors without flash and there is still noise in it, there is an AMAZINGLY helpful plugin used in Adobe Photoshop that you can get called \"Imageonic Professional Noiseware\" that does an amazing job in totally removing it.Mark.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "High quality in a small package.", "Author": "M.

For digital, I use a Nikon D200 and this Panasonic DMC-LX3. I just went on a vacation to Zion National Park last month and just brought my Leica and Panasonic with me. The bulky Nikon was left at home. The Panasonic, with its f2.0 lens, gives excellent quality pictures, usable up to ISO400. That's equivalent to an ISO800 speed for a comparable camera with  f2.8 lens. The camera does occasionally show purple streaks on the LCD preview when I focus under a bright back light condition, but the streaks don't show up in the picture. Not a big deal and tolerable to me. Hope Panasonic will have a firmware fix. Otherwise, it's a gem.UPDATE: More than a year later, the camera still works like new, no problem, no surprises. I played with the video option. The image quality, although at 720P, is definitely not as good as a dedicated HD camcorder, like the Canon HF11, but it's acceptable.", "Date": "November 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Ideal if you like wide and you like control...", "Author": "Ken Walsh", "ReviewID": "R2HL1S3VFCXJU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is already a lot of info out there on this camera, so I'll just quickly highlight a few things, mostly from the perspective of someone who normally shoots with DSLRs.- Unlimited control - You can control just about anything on this camera, and a surprising amount of it very quickly through the \"quick menu\" accessed through the joystick.- Wonderful wide angle lens - The 24mm equivalent field of view at the wide end is wonderful for landscapes, street photography and tight quarters.  The fast F/2.0 max aperture and IS make the camera an awesome low light performer.  I have a Fuji F30, long considered the king of compact low light cameras, and in reality the LX3 is able to get far more low light shots than the F30.- Excellent user interface - Coming from almost exclusively using Canon cameras I was concerned about another user interface to deal with.  I love the LX3 interface, it is so intuitive and transparent that I'm amazed that I often can get settings the way I want faster than with my SLRs.- Excellent RAW shooting - The camera has a fairly decent RAW buffer (about three shots) and doesn't slow down at all in RAW shooting.  Remember, it is still a compact camera and thus shot to shot time is longer than an SLR, but the point here is that the speed is the same regardless of whether you are shooting RAW or JPEG.  Most of the few compacts that shoot RAW suddenly become glacially slow if you actually try to use the RAW mode - not the LX3.Those are probably the four things that made me fall in love with this camera.  Be advised of course that it isn't the perfect camera for everyone.  If you tend to shoot in auto all the time (and the LX3 does have an excellent auto mode) you really won't be using a great part of the LX3's advantages.  If you aren't comfortable working with the relatively restricted 2.5x zoom range you might also be frustrated and would probably be happier with cameras that have longer zoom ranges either by being larger (Canon G10, Panasonic FZ28) or by making a few more compromises in the lens design (Panasonic TZ5).This camera really is a \"photographers\" camera that gives you not only complete creative control, but most importantly easy and transparent control through its wonderful user interface.Even the variable aspect ratio setting, which I thought was sort of gimmicky when I read about it, has proven to be a feature I use almost continuously.  The LX3's novel implementation of this (the different aspects preserve the diagonal angle of view rather than just cropping down one of the other aspect settings) is wonderful.The size is wonderful, it is truly pocketable unlike the Canon G10 (of course the G10 has other benefits).Being a wide angle junky I actually did purchase the wide angle adapter lens for this camera.  Wow, wow, wow.  I always thought these accessory type lenses were a silly idea, but this one gives an 18mm equivalent field of view and the optical performance is stunning for such a wide angle lens.  My Canon XTi and 10-22mm no longer need to be hauled around for ultra-wide shots.Finally, to repeat a point made by many, this is NOT a DSLR replacement.  It can't do everything a DSLR can.  It does have way more manual control than almost any other compact, it can shoot RAW much faster than most compacts, and its imager size and pixel density are better than the vast majority of compacts.  That said, it doesn't offer the fast autofocus of an SLR, the deep RAW buffers and fast frame rates of an SLR, nor high ISO performance anything like an SLR.  But it is a camera that performs admirably in many of those departments and most importantly it does a great job of getting out of the photographers way just like a SLR.  I have now taken the LX3 on two dedicated landscape shooting trips instead of my SLR, so for some tasks is can be a replacement and for others a complement.  Don't expect miracles, but do expect to be pleasantly surprised if you've shot with other compacts.As long as you are aware of the restrictions of the 24-60mm focal range you just simply can not get a better compact camera.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good camera. . . coulda been a GREAT camera.", "Author": "Tsur", "ReviewID": "RIR39YRJ91KU7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good little camera. I thought long and hard before I gave it only three stars. But, despite it being better than any other compact, I still have lots of criticism.The good:The image quality is very strong. Not as good as the DP1/2, but that camera is a disaster in nearly all other regards. With F/2 and and 400 you'll likely get the indoor shot you need. And when that fails, 800 is tolerable. The LX3 is a zippy performer too. While a little slow on the startup, the auto-focus is decently quick (could be better) and the shot to shot performance is quite good. The full-auto mode is good too. Hand the camera over to a novice and he/she will get a good shot. Love the aspect ratio.The meh:The zoom range is a little limited. But I'm not too bothered by it. Other than macro, I can't imagine the manual focus ever being usable. I'd gladly give up some screen real estate for a viewfinder (even an evf). An integrated lens cap would have been a nice touch, as would a wrist strap. It'd be nice if the RAW format were more open. At the time of this review Aperture doesn't support it at all and Lightroom only kinda supports it.The bad:My main complaint is the interface. It's not awful. In fact it's probably better than most compacts. But this camera had so much manual potential, only to be let down my too many darned buttons. The user programable setting are a good example. It has four presets. But only two of them are really useful. The other two require you to turn the dial, hit the select button, navigate down and then confirm; you just missed your shot. I wonder why it would be so difficult to have two or three more dials on the camera to control shutter, aperture and ISO? Instead, we get the worlds tiniest joystick. Again, by the time you've actually changed a setting you probably missed the shot. Also, why is a manual focus that goes around the lens so hard to implement? It's such a wonderful convention that is almost never seen on a compact.The wrap up:I do really like this camera. It's a good RAW shooter with good quality; all in a compact package. But, I hope that Panasonic really concentrates on the fundamentals for the LX4. A viewfinder and a couple of dials or knobs would have made this a four star camera for sure. If they managed to squeeze a larger sensor in too, it would be the best camera of all time.The unrelated:Shame on Amazon for allowing price gouging from their partners. Currently (April/May 2009) the LX3K is quite scarce. I ended up paying a reasonable $50 over MSRP. But during the shortage the camera has been on sale for as much as $750 ($250 over MSRP!). Capitalism, the free market and supply/demand are all good things. But I'm a little offended that Amazon would allow their customers to be bludgeoned by such heavy pricing.

I am especially pleased with:1) Uncanny flash performance - the flash looks like a joke, it is so tiny, but it really does the job.

(I bought spares but don't expect to ever need them).3) Gorgeous LCD - best in the business, viewable in any light.4) Virtual film types - there are several effects to choose from.  My results have been startling - especially the dynamic B&W; and Vivid Color settings.5) Quick Menu - a tiny joystick gives instant access to many popular settings.  Very cool and uncomplicated.6) Multiple Exposure - you can use this for impressive artistic results.7) Fit and finish are like fine jewelry, it's a pleasure to hold and to useOther reviews have hit the basics, but these are a few of my favorites that may not be obvious from the other reviews.Kudos to Panasonic for making such a ground-breaking product even when the competition is so good.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best little camera you can buy. Period.", "Author": "Edward V. Hawk", "ReviewID": "R2IETKFK979SL1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So everyone knows DSLR's are fantastic these days, and the images you can get with these (provided you use expensive glass) can be downright amazing, but what if you just want a really usable (and I mean usable) camera you can bring with you wherever you go?This is that camera. There IS a catch. You have to get decent at RAW editing to get anywhere near the results you can get out of this camera. Yeah, the dynamic B&W; mode is pretty good, and I've shot low light jpgs at shows (no flash), but to get real results from the camera, you're going to have to get your hands a little dirty. The results I can get from this in RAW are just simply amazing for a camera this small. Yes, amazing. I don't throw that word around; but the color depth and sheer detail you can get in 5 minutes worth of work will just make you all smiles.What I don't like about the camera: Not much, but there are a couple of things I could point at that might make it a bit more usable.1.) It doesn't have much of a zoom. Ok, lame complaint, because I actually do understand somewhat that the laws of physics dictate how much of a zoom range you can have on a lens of a given size, without having image quality suffer. This is silly; if you need a zoom camera, this isn't what you should be looking at.2.) No viewfinder, save an aftermarket one. Ok; this actually bothers me sometimes. In bright sunlight, or very low light, a cheesy optical viewfinder would be helpful. Yes, it would also make the camera larger too.3.) The onboard flash sucks. It's cool that you can throttle it down, but if it could tilt up to be a bounce flash, it would be really, really useful. As it is, it always seems to be either too bright, and washes everything out, or too dark. It's a good thing this camera has good ISO performance at 400, and acceptable at 800; with the f2.0 aperture, it can take pictures in VERY low light, and still look great. Oh, and the hotshoe mount will accept a full sized flash :)4.) Lack of a focus ring. Of course, without a decent viewfinder, that wouldn't be of much use, and we're moving away from what the camera is, so I understand the lack. The manual focus on the camera is quite decent, I should mention.4.) That's it. Nothing else not to like about the camera. If you need a zoom lens, or the lack of a viewfinder is a deal breaker for you, go with the larger Canon G10/G11. The DMC-LX3 works better for my needs, being a 24mm f2.0 lens, and having unbelievable RAW data to work with.What I do like about the camera1.) It's small; purpose built. You won't draw crowds using this camera. It's almost friendly. It looks quite nice too. I can stroll through the city, taking pictures of folks, and they just don't seem to mind as much as when I'm doing the same with a DSLR. So for low key urban photography, this is actually BETTER than a DSLR (what, a compact camera does something better than an DSLR?).2.) Fantastic lens. Can't say enough about it, for the price point, and camera size, it's awesome. Really wide angle, if you like landscape or urban photography, it's the perfect focal range.3.) Best low light compact camera on the market, period. Yep, I'll stand by that. It SMOKES the G10/G11 in low light; I love going to see local bands in small clubs; these venues aren't very well lit, but you can get right by the stage. This thing takes fantastic pictures in low light. I don't care what the reviews say either about ISO 400 or ISO 800; check the images out in RAW, and then say ISO 800 isn't usable. Speaking of which;4.) ISO performance. ISO 800 is a little bit grainy; but the best thing is, that it is a usable grain, not some watercolor chromatic that just ruins everything. I say ISO 800 is just fine for color photographs; it can even make gritty B&W; images look better (cleaner is NOT always better)5.) Ridiculous RAW performance; the camera is fast and responsive, even when shooting full sized JPEG and RAW. Never seems to really bog, and when it does; it still will buffer what your doing. Really amazing for a camera this size, and it makes RAW the only image format I even think about using. The amount of detail; color, edge retention, contrast; try this camera out with Adobe Lightroom, and you'll see what I mean, and you'll have a blast to boot.6.) Multiple image formats; at first, reading it on paper, I thought it was just a gimmic; 4:3,3:2, & 16:9 formats didn't seem like they'd be that useful. But I was completely wrong, and that is the most used switch on my camera; it actually does change the way you'll compose photographs; what was one photo at 16:9 is completely different @ 4:3 or 3:2, landscape vs portrait, etc. Another fun feature : )So, obviously, I like the camera; I've owned it for almost a year now. Best small camera ever made, IMO; this will probably be the benchmark classic folks talk about for years. Yes, I'm quite serious about that, I don't believe these days digital cameras are outdated every 6 months; this one will be quite current for years. If you need a low light, low key, wide angle camera with awesome RAW performance, just pull the trigger. 2 thing's I'd get while buying; a fast 8GB or higher card, and an extra battery (the generic one they sell here is just fine), and you're good to go.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "New Firmware makes a great camera greater", "Author": "D.

If you're in the market for a top of the line P&S; camera you should know all of these models.  The LX3 goes head-to-head with both of them and, in my opinion, wins the battle regardless of being a little bit older than both.Everyone has their criteria, their wish list of what they want from a camera.  Here are mine so anyone reading this knows why I prefer the LX3 over all the other top models.1. Low light ability.  The LX3 has a f/2.0 lens and is great in low light.2. Fast enough frames per second (fps) to handle taking photos of moving kids.  The LX3 goes at more than 2fps, about double the speed of both the Canon G11 and S90.  In fact, a slow fps is the Achilles heel of all current Canon P&S; cameras.  They're back in the dust compared to the Panasonic.  And Casio trounces them all.3. Ability to shoot RAW - all the top models have this.4. As wide angle a lens as possible - 24mm on the LX3, wider than either Canon.As a general rule, I just prefer the Panasonic menu layout more than I like Canon's.  One example:  When you're in scene mode on the LX3 the camera shows you icons for all your choices.  You move from icon to icon to get the one you want.  For example, fireworks or portrait. On the Canon G11 each icon has its own screen and you flip through them until you get to the one you want.  This is just one example.  The G11 just feels less intuitive.There are only two major things I wanted from a P&S; camera that I didn't get with the LX31. Articulating screen that allows you to shoot from all sorts of angles (in crowds, at your feet, self portrait, etc.)  The Canon G11 has this and it's the top reason I bought it in addition to the LX3.2. Acceptably long zoom.  The LX3 only goes out to 60mm which is essentially in the \"normal\" range and not even close to telephoto.  But I don't really need the longer zoom in most situations.The G11 also has a bigger and probably stronger metal body.  This is a wash.  The LX3 you can pocket, not so with the bigger G11.The LX3, as noted by many many other reviews, also has a lens cap problem.  How Panasonic missed the boat on this one I have no idea because its flaw is so obvious and so easily fixed.  You're going to lose the lens cap.  There are workarounds, one including adapting a Ricoh lens cap that attaches to LX3 and opens & closes as you turn the camera on or off.  So add another 15 bucks to the price of the camera for that.The really killer ability of the LX3 is the Dynamic B&W; mode.  If you learned to shoot using 35mm B&W; film this one feature will invigorate your creative inspiration like no other.  Many amateur reviewers point out that you can just convert anything you shoot in color to B&W; on your computer.  But it's just not the same.  In the moment you see the results of your work and it will give you ideas for more shots that never would have come to you if you were shooting in color.  I absolutely love this function on the camera.If you look at shot by shot comparison reviews between the LX3 and the Canon G11 or S90 you'll find some that show obviously better shots from the Canon.  I've tested these cameras and I know those reviews aren't completely honest.  I've found that if you just grab the camera and shoot in straight auto that in many situations the Canons will take a better photo.  However, if you tweak the Panasonic it will take an even better shot.  For example, I have a dimly lit livingroom where I shot in auto with no flash on both cameras.  The LX3 came back with a dark unpleasing image.  The Canon picked up the light and looked acceptable.  I switched the Panasonic to \"candlelight\" mode and it beat anything I did with the Canon.Some pro reviewers have noted that the LX3 cannot compare with the dynamic range of the Canon G11 or S90.  That might be true.  If this is a problem for you then maybe you won't want the LX3.The LX3 is a photographer's camera.  It has obvious flaws, but it's still what I prefer over anything else currently on the market.The rumors are that Panasonic will release the LX5 (they'll apparently skip the number 4) around mid-2010.  Let's hope they'll fix the lens cap issue.  Should be easy.  Expand the zoom, improve the noise levels . . . and add an articulating screen (Panasonic won't do this - that's Canon's thing - too bad) and it would be about perfect.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compact that thinks it's a DSLR", "Author": "Hotspur", "ReviewID": "R2939Z5ALKTGM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a lot of digicams including a Canon 20d with a slew of \"L\" lenses.

This is not a point and shoot and allows me to be as creative as I want to be (I can finally get a nice bokeh with a compact!).

It may seem like a difficult compromise to make until you remember that you can always zoom with your feet. Give 24mm a try.** Update **Six months later, I'm still extremely happy with my LX3. I used the camera extensively over a week long tour of Japan (Tokyo & Kyoto).* 24mm-60mm is perfect for an urban environment. I didn't feel constrained by the lack of zoom at all* f/2.0 is great for evening shots. I got a number of sharp shots with my LX3 that turned out blurry on much more expensive dSLRs using the kit lens.* The LX3 is pocketable if your pocket is a jacket pocket. I ended up carrying my LX3 in my hand most of the time.* Hold on to the lens cap while your are shooting for extra security. I don't like camera straps or wrist lanyards since they tend to get tangled and in the way. I found that I was shooting with the LX3 in my right hand and the cap (still connected to the body by its lanyard) in my left. This provided extra security against dropping the camera.* Image quality is great, but the biggest win is that you can keep the LX3 with you all the time.* I didn't need to use my Gorillapod at all, though it would have been helpful for night shots.* Video mode is pretty good. I've avoided the low-resolution video feature on previous cameras, but the LX3 seems to produce fairly decent video.* The mode dial is way too easy to turn. I lost a few pictures because I bumped the mode dial into aperture priority mode at f/8.0. Be careful before you shoot!* The controls are convenient and easy to use. The focus button is great in MF mode. The MF-AF Macro-AF switch saw a lot of use, as did the aspect ratio switch. Except for the mode dial, usability is great.Now that the LX3 and Leica D-Lux 4 sell at the same price, you might want to look at the Leica before you click buy.Another camera worth checking out is the new Olympus E-P1.

Definitely worth a look while LX3 prices remain high.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "LX3 Impression & Tips", "Author": "-Ashi-", "ReviewID": "R1JG1T776E80E9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are plenty of reviews of this excellent camera.  What I'm going to do here is providing some user feedback and tips on how to fully utilize this camera.First of all, this is a professional's camera (or at least like me, a serious amateur).  You can use iA mode for point and shoot, and most scene modes are good enough, but you can't get the most out of it by using it that way.  There are other cameras which can achieve that purpose and cost much less.To begin, I would suggest read the manual fully.  The manual is not the best I've read, and the grammar is awkward and seems translated, but it does provide very important information.  After all, this camera can overwhelm people with features.Get familiar with q.menu joystick/button.  This thing can save a lot of time.  Some complain about the lack of a dedicated ISO button or dial, which this camera's closest competitor, Canon Powershot G10 provides, but the feature is just under the q.menu button.  Important features such as ISO, white balance, metering modes, etc., are also under here.I would suggest set an ISO limit to cap at ISO 200, which this camera allows.  Also turn the flash power to the lowest setting.  With f2.0 aperture, I rarely use flash anyways.I agree with others before me, the lens cap is annoying.  I also agree the camera should allow turning off all beeping sounds except for the focus confirmation.  Panasonic's setting menu can be cryptic, but fortunately there is the q.menu button.Aspect Ratio dial is absolutely wonderful. 4:3 is very good for digital photo frames of the same aspect ratio, as well as for computer monitors.  3:2 is best if you intend to print them on paper, as most shops print them in 4x6, which is the same ratio as 3:2.  16:9 is best for HD TV or widescreen LCD monitors.Get a 150x SD flash memory.  I personally use OCZ 8GB SDHC flash memory.  Or you could opt for two pieces of smaller memory chips, depend on your habit.  Fast memory = faster capture and less waiting time, if you intend on using RAW+Jpeg a lot.  Also recommended is getting yourself a second battery.  If you shoot a lot of photos like me, the battery will last less than a whole day. It is not bad, but you definitely do not want to lose any opportunity when a magic moment comes.I wish there is a continuous depth of view.  Neither this camera nor Canon G10 allows that, which is rather bizarre, considering these are very high-end cameras.  My ancient Canon PowerShot S1 IS instantly provides feedback on the impact of changing aperture and shutter speed, which has given me a lot of creative warrants.  To be fair, most DSLRs don't have that feature either.  Canon's SX10IS, however, is able to do it.  Not a big deal for some, but I find it inconvenient having to press the shutter button half way first before able to see if the picture is going to be overexposed or underexposed than I intended.Get Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2.  If you intend to shoot your picture in RAW, and do a lot of post processing, this is a gem.  You can get a 30-day trial on Adobe's website, but I think you'll most likely end up buying it.You'll need a tripod.  ISO 80 is susceptible to shaking under low light condition.  It is more intolerant to handshake even with MEGA O.I.S turned on, compared with my Canon PowerShot S1 anyways.It's a very good camera for low-light and landscape.

I am an average camera user, and have had a FZ50, FZ1, TZ1, & FZ8.  This model is the Gem of gems.  I now have just this camera & a Sigma SD14 which I will be bequeathing to someone.  Given all the cameras I have owned-why does the LX3 beat them all?  If I had to say it in a sentence-it would be the high quality of the picture I get without any post processing. I know digital photographers don't seem to mind PP.  I think it's a pain where I sit down.  And i don't buy the argument that with 35 millimeter film cameras-having owned my share-that much PP was done when you had the film developed. Some-yes; a lot no way.So what does this have to do with the LX3?  Simply that for me this camera over all takes the nicest pictures I have seen without a lot of encumbrances.

I owned one for several months but found myself afraid to use it because of it's diminutive size.  It also just felt and looked so nice that I was constantly afraid to use around my kids for fear of getting it banged up. The quality does feel that good.  Otherwise, I had no qualms about it's picture taking abilities.  One day I got a chance to hold a Canon G10 and it's size, weight and tank-like build just felt so good in the hand.  I immediately sold the LX3 and bought the new Canon G11.  It took only a few dozen pictures for me to realize I loved the LX3 so much better.  In all, I took maybe a thousand pictures with it and most of my pictures were soft or slightly out of focus (defective?).  Fortunately, I was within the return period and able to return it.  So here I am, back to being a proud LX3 owner.I won't reiterate the technical specification and superior performance of the LX3 because that has already been done by many novice and professional reviewers.  There are a few features that I really like: 1) Ai mode, 2) Dynamic B&W;, 3) 16;9 and 4) Macro function.  There, short and sweet.  My main gripe is that Panasonic OEM accessories are still hard to get and overpriced when you can find them.  Don't buy the hot shoe viewfinder!  I had one for my first camera and found it a waste of time and money.These accessories for Panasonic Lumix LX3 that I highly recommend:1) Two-piece leather case with strap from seller \"linsaifeng\" on the four letter site.  Inexpensive, sturdy, excellent quality and perfect fit.  Haven't had a chance to touch and feel the OEM case from Lumix but can't imagine the quality being better.  And the price?  Forget about it.  If you really must have a case that says Lumix on it then go ahead and pay $100.  If you could do with out the logo then this one will cost you $20.2) CamGrip camera grip - This is a little 3\" rubber hand grip that screws into the tripod mount. Sweet! I don't leave home without this.  Adds tremendous stability and holdability.  One handed video recording is a breeze.3) Manfrotto ModaPocket - A tiny, adjustable stand that screws into the tripod mount.  Small enough to leave on all the time (if you are not using a fitted case). Perfect for table top shooting and macro shooting.  I love this and it's quality and beauty match the LX3.  Oh, and it has a tripod mount so I can use the Cam Grip with it!4) Lensmate lens adapter.  Priced maybe a little more than the OEM adapter but it's quality is excellent.  I use this on my camera full-time with a 46mm filter.5) Richard Franiecs hot shoe mount shutter release cable adapter.  A little expensive for what it is but it allows you to use a shutter release cable for night shooting and Panasonic does not sell one of these.6) Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag - I found this top loading bag to be perfect for the LX3 when used with the adapter on full-time.  Also has enough room for an extra battery, the ModaPocket and the Cam Grip. Has a belt loop and top loading design so the camera can be stored and retrieved quickly. Perfect for hiking, or places where you don't want the camera hanging from you neck all the time.7) Goby mini flexible tripod - This can be a little frustrating to use when you are trying to get level shots on a flat surface.  However, I have the smallest one and have found an incredible amount of ways to use this. It really shines on uneven surfaces where it's flexible legs can adapt. I have used it at the tidepools on uneven, slippery rocks, have mounted it to fences and gates, have mounted it to the seatpost of my bike to make videos, it wraps around poles, hand rails, etc.Hope you find this review helpful.

With basic photographic knowledge this little camera delivers outstanding jpeg images and even better tiffs should you shoot in the RAW mode. Set in the intelligent auto mode and anyone can use it. Set in the aperture mode and advanced users can get very creative with the f2 Leica lense. This camera is identical to the Leica D-Lux 4. It just costs about $400 less. And this camera is really fun to use. Has a joy stick, high definition view screen, 1950's quality construction and with a really fast SD card installed (buy a fast one; don't use your old one) performs very quickly. I cannot stress the need for a fast SD card enough. This may sound a little juvenile, but with an extreme SD card, the LX 3 knows you have fed it hi-test and not regular, 22 karat and not 10 karat, prime rib and not hamburger. For me, the LX 3 is truly a jewell. Leica and Panasonic have teamed up and shown us that \"old world craftsmanship\" is not dead here. It can be put in your coat pocket. I like mine. Think you would like the LX 3 too.Update: Have used the LX 3 for 3 months now and am pleased with the images this camera produces. iPhoto easily tweaks the images to my liking (highly saturated color and contrast) and the few 8 X 10 enlargements I have made are most pleasing. My only complaint is no optical viewfinder. But reflections on the LCD monitor when shooting outdoors is just a fact of life with the LX 3. However, ware a black jacket or tee shirt and you will dramatically reduce these reflections on the LCD screen. No kidding.June 2009-6 month of using:Use this camera for shooting indoors at social events and outdoors at night. Set the camera in the shutter preferred mode at 1/25 sec at ASA 400. Don't use the flash and hold the camera as still as possible. A tripod works good here. Images will be washed out, but there is enough information in the image where photoshop or other good imaging program will render a nice photo. You'll be surprised at how little light is needed. It is trial and error but worth the effort.December 2009 update. The LX3 continues to please.

I wanted it to be pocketable, have awesome image quality, especially in low light, and I wanted it to have sensible manual controls. I would not be the only user, though. My wife, not a trained photographer, would be using it a lot with our child. I set out to find a camera to fulfill this tall request... and we have not been disappointed with the LX3.I'll start with the complaints. This thing is not going to slide into my pants pocket. It's dang close, but it will fit in to many pockets easily, including cargo pants and jackets. The lens (something I'll rave about soon) protrudes too far from the camera body. Other complaints: the interface isn't the world's most convenient (but far from the worst I've seen on a camera) and some of the physical controls are annoying, like the tiny joystick you use to make changes to various settings. It takes more time to set manual settings than on a dSLR.The camera is not phenomenally light, though, that comes across as a plus as well... this thing is constructed out of metal like a tank. It feels solid and wonderful in your hands. The USB cable is not a standard mini-usb connection. I worry one day I'll lose it. It's not the only camera I own with a unique cable, though.Last beef that's only partially Panasonic's fault: the RAW format is not yet compatible with Apple software. I use the camera with iPhoto and will be moving to Aperture eventually. Currently I have an 8GB card and am shooting RAW plus JPG and just keeping JPGs for now. When the sw update comes, I'll have to go through a curate all those. Speaking of software, there's a firmware update available now, that looks like it takes many hoops of jumping through to apply. :(OK, those are really all my qualms. Everything else is pretty much great, though $400 was more than we initially wanted to spend.Pluses: the lens is great. Shoots in really low light. Hurray for real Leica glass on a point-and-shoot! 24mm means a nice wide angle, without giving a fish-eye effect. This doesn't have a super-ultra zoom, but I didn't want or need that.Full control over the camera, if you want it. If you know what you're doing, you can really go artistic with this camera. If you prefer the camera to do the thinking, it usually makes really smart decisions. My wife usually uses the iA (full auto) or occasionally one of the scene presets, and it very rarely makes a bad shot. If it does, it's usually too much flash... but that's often what you get from auto settings on a camera anyhow.The LCD is gorgeous. Everyone is wowed by it when I show them a shot.The HD video is nice. It saves as a standard QuickTime, not some crazy file format. However, you have no control over camera settings when you shoot video. I'd love to control aperture here.Sensor: hurray for Panasonic taking a break from the megapixel wars (more MP doesn't necessarily = quality) and giving us a sensor low on noise! High ISO settings work well on this camera. Past Lumixes have been criticized for high noise. This camera is not particularly noisy. Of course, with out my full size RAW images and full on editing, I'm not done checking this out.The body looks and feels awesome in black. Feels retro and really current at the same time. Great shape for shooting.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera. I evangelize it to others looking for a high-end, small sized camera. It's great for a DSLR shooters who want a smaller second camera.

The photo quality is terrific, the build quality is great, the size is perfect, and it has all the manual and automatic controls you could ever need.First let me start by saying that I have always wanted a Panasonic digital camera, most Panasonics have always had great lenses, a good interface, great built quality, and image stabilizers.  I never bought one, though, because photo quality was subpar, with lots of image noise and noise reduction mushiness.  The LX3 is the first Panasonic camera I have bought and I love it.The best aspect of the camera has to be that lens.  It's super-wide at 24mm and is great for indoor shots, and landscapes.  Moreover, the maximum aperture of the lens is f2.0 to f2.8 and really helps in low light allowing a faster shutter speed and avoiding the flash, while macro shots benefit from the greater depth-of-field.  The lens is also sharp from corner to corner, and the jpeg processing removes any barrel distortion and fringing.  The only downside to the lens is the 60mm reach; so take that into consideration before buying.The rest of the camera is no slouch either.  The sensor is a bit bigger than most point and shots and has a modest 10-megapixel resolution.  Panasonic claims to have kept the megapixels at 10 to increase sensitivity and decrease noise, and it has worked to an extent.  If you don't expect SLR quality at higher ISO speeds you'll be pleased.  From ISO 80-200 I have no complaints with image quality.  There is plenty of detail, good exposure, and natural looking colors.  Above ISO 200 to about ISO 400 it's still plenty acceptable and depends on the subject matter and lighting.  Anything above ISO 400, in my eyes, is for emergency use, or photos that are not very important.  At that point most of the detail is mushed away and noise is pretty high.  Of course, if you prefer to do the processing yourself you can always shoot RAW.The camera is a good size, not large, but definitely not a pocket camera either, the protruding lens sees to that (see my included picture).  Build quality is great; most of the camera is made of metal (even the front of the lens cap).  The 3\" screen on the back is bright and clear with a high resolution.  There are manual controls for pretty much every function, two custom white balance settings, and two custom setting on the mode dial.  Of course there is also a fully automatic mode and plenty of scene modes as well.  I especially like the different film modes to tweak your results, and the two custom film modes, which even give you control over noise reduction.  The aspect ratio switch on the lens let's you shoot in 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9, and the camera also allows you to bracket in the three ratios.The only minor negatives I have about the camera is as follows: 1) The lens retracts too quickly when you switch into review mode, delaying the next shot, 2) The lens cap can be finicky to put on, the release buttons are quite small, 3) There is no sensor to prevent the camera from extending the lens when the cap is on, I always turn it to playback mode when I turn it off just in case, 4) The battery door, and playback/record switch don't feel as sturdy as the rest of the camera, 5) The flash release switch is small, 6) The camera can be slow when going from record to playback.All in all... despite the few flaws it's an awesome camera, and a great companion for my digital SLR.03/23/09 Update:  Still love this camera.  I'm able to get sharp photos when shooting at 1/4 seconds at wide angle.  The stabilizer is very effective.

WU", "ReviewID": "RL89PCACZZS80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of searching for a \"perfect\" point-and-shoot to complement my other heavier gear, I think I have finally found a close approximation of THE solution. I am not going to go through the usual pros and cons of this machine, as most have already been covered by other reviews. I just want to touch upon the issue of the much hated separate lens cap.Yes, I do hate to deal with a separate lens cap, tethered or not. It was not clear to me but once I saw the camera I understood why Panasonic had this \"overlook.\" Well, it was not an overlook, it was an unfortunate design compromise. And the key term here is \"f2.0\".This is their flagship point-and-shoot, so they can't use a smaller sensor. To draw enough light onto that sensor to create f2.0 they need some lens real estate. If you look at the lens barrel (the smallest section of the telescopic mechanism), you'll see that the lens actually goes almost all the way to the edge of the barrel. Now take another P&S; camera with an integrated lens cover and see how it works and ask yourself, where and how could you integrate a lens cover in LX3 to cover the entire area of the lens?Sure they can make the barrel thicker, but that will directly impact the overall size of the camera. And I thought we wanted this thing to be quasi-pocketable. Given the current form factor, I won't say integrating a lens cap is impossible but it would certainly take some major innovation.Another side effect of this large lens is that the mounting hole for the tripod has to be pushed to the side, another victim of f2.0.So, it all boils down to this. If you want a fast lens in a pocket P&S;, you can't have that integrated lens cover. You can't even mount your tripod at the center of the camera. Well that's just too bad. Sure, people have different priorities, but my money goes to the fast lens. I'll live with the lens cap, for now.PS. I have seen an external integrated lens cover for LX3 made by a third-party. It looks like a pizza cut into three  pieces that get pushed open by the lens when extended. Pretty clever idea but very ugly in my opinion. It looks like a cannon popping out from an ambush. I'll stick to my lens cap and risk losing it.", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera for indoors (others better for outdoors)", "Author": "wcc2", "ReviewID": "R26CXUJUB5ZGKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for people considering the LX3 versus the Canon G9/G10.I just came back from a month long family vacation in Australia. Since I was going to be traveling with my 2.5 year old, I didn't want to lug my DSLR (a D70 w/ 18-200 and a 10-20) but wanted to take a DSLR backup camera. I bought the LX3 here at amazon a couple months ahead. But since it was going to be a long trip with many photo ops, I also borrowed my brother's G9 for the trip (and while there also borrowed an Australian friend's G10 for half a day).Short answer: If you can afford it, buy both. Canon G9/G10 is for outside. The Lumix LX3 is for indoors.The G9/G10 is a great walking around camera - in full sunlight. Its greater range of zoom is invaluable and I found that it handled very well (easy to set controls and compose shots in a hurry and no lens cap to slow you down). Also in full, bright sun; when it's hard to see the LCD, it's really nice to have a viewfinder. The G9/G10's downfall is its slow lens: in partial shade it couldn't offer a shutter speed fast enough to freeze my 2.5 yr old son as he dashed around even at ISO800.The LX3 totally dominates in low light - indoors it crushes the G9/10. It can take amazing shots in almost no light. We were at the Sydney Aquarium and while people - even those with DSLRs - were blasting away with their flashes (which mostly bounced off the tanks), I got some surprisingly good pictures without the flash and all hand held. Also indoors, the LX3's limited zoom is not a liability; you're close to your subjects already. I also found that a viewfinder is less useful inside, so the lack of one on the LX3 is not an issue. So in museums, stores, restaurants, etc. the LX3 is/was invaluable.Overall though I took 95% of my shots with the G9, but that's because we were in Australia - in the summer and at the beach. Now at home, any time I know that we'll be indoors, I take the LX3 and leave the DSLR only for shots at home (when I often set up my SB-600 as a remote flash). I view digital cameras as a portfolio; no camera can do it all: I've got my DSLR, a ELPH-sized pocket camera, and the LX3 as my indoor backup camera. If you are going to get the LX3, do a youtube search for the Ricoh LC-1 - a nice accessory to eliminate one of the LX3's achilles heels.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A JOY!", "Author": "Mo", "ReviewID": "R372MJVU7CPVAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally found the digicam to replace my DSLR.

My other Panasonic is a LZ8, which is an inexpensive but fantastic P&S.; I have 2 DSLRs also. It is by far the best P&S.; At ISO 100, images from LX3 are comparable to my 10MP DSLR, which is about 4X more expensive. I have been wanting to buy this camera for over about a year but the price has been higher than I want to pay. I was able to get it in a narrow window earlier this month but it has since gone back up.Really sharp lens at f/2.0. It is one of the best lenses on the market. Period. One of the drawbacks of digital P&S; is the relatively large depth of field. It is difficult to isolate the main subject from the background. At wide open aperture of f/2.0 (or f/2.8 at the long FL end), the LX3 has a relatively shallow depth of field. It is one of the best features that makes it really stands out among higher end P&S.;It has an extremely powerful and easy to use manual focus. With the magnified area, it is easy to do manual focus. Furthermore, it is possible to choose the focus area. This feature is especially useful for macros. I have never used short FL for macros before, using the macro feature opens up an entirely different possibilities.It has a usable ISO range up to 400. At ISO 100 or below, it is hard to find fault. Noise is visible but acceptable at 400; it is comparable to ISO 1600 on my DSLR. Beyond 400, noise is too high for me. This is an unfortunate fact about small sensor P&S.; LX3 has a bigger sensor than most P&S; and so its noise performance is already better than most. With a fast lens and built-in stabilization, it is not always necessary to use high ISO.It is possible to export RAW images but I have not yet tried it; btw I use RAW exclusively for my DSLR. IOW, I might be able to squeeze still a little more out of the LX3. The option of using filters (polarizer, IR, etc) is usually not possible for most P&S.; LX3 let you do just that. You can buy an adapter to use a variety of add-ons. It is a system that you can grow.Now on to the not so great part. I really don't care about the different aspect ratios. I can crop on a computer. I prefer to have the battery compartment separate from the SD card. Control during movie is non-existent. Zoom range is limited but it is not a big deal for me.Overall, it is a great camera.

I'd much rather have a compact point and shoot to take to restaurants and carry in my pockets, and take out the dSLR for actual hobby photography. But I loved using the LX3.

Granted, the zoom range on this camera isn't great (only 2.5x) so I believe that this camera is more geared towards those who are into landscape photography. Combined with the optional Panasonic DMW-LA4 Conversion Adapter (~$25) and the Panasonic DMW-LW46 Wide Conversion Lens (~$150), I found a winning combination by allowing me to have an even greater wide-angle coverage at 18 mm.This was particularly important for me as I was going to Hawai'i and I wanted to capture as much beauty, detail and information the Islands had to offer and the LX3 did exactly that. The adapter also allows attachment of filters - another added bonus, so one can capture flowing waterfalls, include a protective UV filter and polarizing filter.Even with the conversion lens attached to the LX3, it is still significantly cheaper (and lighter) than buying a DSLR and a wide-angle lens. For me, I get the opportunity to visit many places and the last thing that I want to do is lug around a DSLR with me. The LX3 is more like a compromise between a compact camera and the DSLR.The LX3 also shoots HD-video but I use that less often. I enjoy subjecting the LX3 under complex light conditions as well as low-light conditions. I rarely need to \"enhance\" any images as the colour, detail and quality of such pictures are instantly fabulous.  This camera performed exceptionally under low-light conditions with the aid of the beautiful and fast f 2.0 Leica lens. The LX3 has less auto-options visible on the dial (but easily accessible under the menu options) forcing the user to use his/her imagination while composing the shot. Thus, for beginners, this is a nice prompt to encourage their photography skills and creativity.Some things I LOVE about the LX3 in a nutshell.1. Aspect ratio dial = easy to change from 16:9 to 4:3 etc.2. Focus dial = easy to focus manually in both normal and macro modes.3. RAW = greater flexibility in post-picture processing.4. Great battery life.5. Easy access to important menu functions using the jog dial. Note, if your hands are not dainty, it might be difficult to access the button closest to the screen.Here are a few things that people complain about but my thoughts on them.The lens cap: I do not have a problem with removing it from the lens. If you have a DSLR, you have the EXACT same feature.Poor flash: The bright f2.0 lens is so great at capturing light under low-light conditions, rarely do you need to use the flash. Use a tripod or buy a flash gun. The LX3 is equipped with a hotshoe!Some things I would love to see in a future incarnation of the LX3 (The LX3 has been out for more than a year (as of May 2010) so there could be a new model coming out soon?:1. Increased zoom let's up from 2.5x optical zoom to 5x or more! (If you decrease the MP down to 5MP, you will get 5x zoom).2. Ability to zoom whilst shooting video.One thing that might swing it for you: I have been stopped numerous times by people asking me about this camera while I have been out. It's such a great feeling to know you have a unique camera. It's such a rare build combining internal complexity and external simplicity into an all-round beautiful camera.Final thoughts - If you enjoy landscape photography, shoot regularly under low-light conditions, enjoy simplicity and obtaining beautiful results, this is the camera for you. Although the LX3 is geared more towards the more advanced photographer, beginners will enjoy the delights of this camera. It costs almost twice the cost of a typical point and shoot camera but the pleasure of being able to capture an image under extreme conditions absolutely warrants this camera as a MUST HAVE.

However, its lens is not as wide as the LX3's, which is very important to me as a travel shooter. The S90 has no means to use filters, again a shortcoming in my opinion. Also, the S90 does not shoot in 3:2 aspect mode, which the LX3 does easily by simple moving a switch.If you're looking for a great travel companion, the LX3 will sure to please.

Most small cameras suffer from extreme contrast issues and lack of dynamic range. The LX3 improves on that quite a bit. With my Panasonic TZ3 which this replaced, noise was a big issue in many shots even at ISO 100. Noise has been reduced considerably in the LX3. I don't shoot at high ISO values so can't speak for that. This LX3 tends to overexpose and blow out highlights so I'm shooting a full stop below normal for most outdoor shots.I'm shooting RAW+JPG. The JPG files are very good, only when shooting with reduced contrast and saturation settings. RAW gives more flexibility for post processing and for nearly every shot I get better results after PP than the JPGs.The included Silkypix software is adequate for post processing of RAW images but it's not the easiest or fastest software to use. So I'm hoping for a compatibility release for Apple's Aperture. (As of early 2009 the LX3 is not supported by Aperture.)I'm a little disappointed in HD video results because 24 fps isn't fast enough for smooth panning. As long as the camera is pointed in one direction, video quality is very good. As soon as I move it around, the image gets jerky.All in all, I'm very happy with the LX3.

I was held back initially by the outer limit of the lens [about 60mm].  Then I had to wrestle with whether to buy the D-Lux 4 instead.  I decided the cost difference was not worth it.The LX3 is delightful. I am very pleased with the results.  The camera is portable and fun to use.  The OIS feature is very effective.  The ability to quickly change formats is handy.  I enjoy the square format option.  It reminds me of my Hasselblad days.Some have expressed concern about the lens cap. It is not a problem. Virtually all of my cameras (Canon, Nikon, Leica, Hasselblad) have had lens caps, not built-in lens covers.  I don't use the tether since it just gets in the way.  I put the cap in my pocket or in a camera bag, just as I have done with other cameras.It is great fun to use the different film modes with this little camera.  It is charming to use black and white at a wide angle and fill the frame with an interesting composition, such as people interacting in a room.  The 24mm view is a very attractive feature.  So is the f/2.0 wide aperture.  It invites low light photography. I generally use the aperture priority setting.Just as with my M6TTL, I can just go out with my little camera and make lovely pictures without getting wrapped up in the technology.  Of course, with the LX3, I can quickly change the film or the format.  I tend to do less fiddling and concentrate on the image, not the technology.

It feels tough, scratch and the size is smaller and lighter than its competitor Canon G series. It fit in my winter coat easily. The silver version I have looks very classy and shiny.Like other advanced compact cameras, LX3 allow users to set aperture, shutter speed and focus manually. Like digital SLR camera, we have aperture priority (A), Speed priority (S), iA (inteligent auto mode), SCN (Scene selections), Movie mode, Automatic without flash (P) mode, two custom settings and off course full manual mode.The intelligent mode (iA) is great to recognize the scene and adjust the setting automatically for us. For example, when I am shooting at night, the mode dial automatically adjust to night scene. The image comes up great without blown highlight unlike other entry level compact camera.The other great thing the camera has to offer is the ability to choose aspect ratio for image and also video. For me it is a great creative tools for any photographers. The aspects ratio we can choose for image is 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9. For movie: 4:3 and wide screen 16:9.Image Quality and Video QualityThe main difference between this camera with Canon G series or other compact cameras is the famous leica lens is able to go down to f/2-2.8. This big aperture ensure the camera to take picture in dim light with lowest iso sensitivities as possible. The result is cleaner look.Even when I took picture in very big aperture of f/2, the depth of field remain very large. This is because the relatively smaller sensor compared to digital slr camera. I feel this is one of great advantage over digital SLR camera where the depth of field was so shallow in lower aperture lens. The lens is also wider than other advanced compact out there (24mm). It is superb for low light indoor large group picture.In addition, MEGA OIS (optical image stabilization) help to combat hand shake. I am able to take picture without blur up to 1/15 shutter speed easily.About the noise, The result is relatively clean up to iso 400 which is about equal to iso 800 in dslr camera. In iso 800, the noise start to be a problem. It is about equal to iso 2400 in dslr camera.Regarding to movie mode, I haven't try it extensively but looking at samples that other took, It was very clean and smooth. The built in microphone did the job well too.The DownsideThe not so good about this camera is the lens cap. Not like other compact, that have built-in lens cap. The LX3 lens cap could be annoying. Also some of the buttons and joystick might be too small for people with a large finger (fortunately I have thin and small fingers).Built-in flash is provided but the result of the image with flash is not good. Luckily it has hot shoe for external flash.There is no viewfinder (external viewfinder is optional but very expensive aprox. $140) but the hi-res 460k LCD screen are sharper than any entry-level dslr camera out there.The last one is the zoom, it is limited from wide to standard length). So users that interested on taking picture from a far (wild life, airplane, candids) will be disappointed.In conclusionThis camera certainly is a very unique camera because it is superior for low light (compared to other compact cameras) and have a very wide angle (24mm) which is the best for landscape, large group picture and indoor.For beginners: if you love to take wide angle pictures and don't like to take telephoto pictures then take this cameras. You'll love it. It has many useful application such as family events, travel landscape and even macro.For Digital SLR users and hobbyists: Because its portability, there is no excuse on not to take this camera around with you in anytime. You will be surely do not miss the moment. While the image quality is not up to par to digital slr camera with \"PRO\" grade lens, but this camera do produce sharp pictures for regular print or web.In addition, for all users, the movie mode it provide will be very handy to capture some high quality video clip.

It also has a very bright and clear screen, which is a pleasure to compose shots with, even in sunlight.For those waivering on the LX3 due to its small zoom range, I have not found this to be a problem.  Either walk closer to your subject (always a good idea) or reduce the megapixel size and you then have 4.5 X optical zoom to work with.I highly recommend this amazing camera - it is in a class by itself.Update (4/13/11):  I recently purchased a Nikon D3100, an excellent starter DSLR.  I have been taking images of identical scenes with both the LX3 and the Nikon.  My  results indicate that (to my eyes) image quality is almost identical.  This reinforces how superb a camera the LX3 is.  Of course, the Nikon has advantages over the LX3, two that I noticed immediately:  1. the Nikon's viewfinder makes composition much easier, and 2. the Nikon easily produces incredibly shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh, which makes taking artistic pictures a snap.  My friends who have viewed my Nikon images tell me they are better, more creative and more artistic than with the LX3, which may be the case, but I still love my LX3 and plan to keep using it.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great camera for control freaks and pointy-shooters alike", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R34BC9BT8NCT7I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a week before my honeymoon, on the strength of its specifications and the positive reviews.  We wound up getting some great indoor and outdoor pictures of Barcelona, and couldn't be more pleased with the camera.  My wife, who isn't interested in fiddling with aperture and shutter speed, used the excellent Auto mode; I was able to get some nice results with the aperture and shutter priority settings.This camera has an excellent lens - the wide-angle end is as wide as you're likely to need, and the zoomed-in end is sufficiently tight for most uses.  The maximum aperture of f2.0 gives you more flexibility with exposure time than any other point-n-shoot of which I'm aware.  Coupled with a sensor that's usable at reasonable ISO, and with auto-stabilization, the fast lens lets you take fantastic indoor shots with available light.  The included flash is pretty powerful, but I almost never used it.The only things I didn't like about this camera were its lack of an optical viewfinder (you can purchase one that fits in the hotshoe) and the need for a lens cap.

If you love the versatility of a SLR, but don't like the bulkiness then this camera is purrfectt for you ! It is the highest end compact camera that you can get. Only other that comes close is the Canon G10; Which has problems with poor LCD quality and average sensor.The sensor on this camera is HUGE and is of the top quality. This camera is so feature rich, there is no comparison to any cameras available in the market. I have owned it for a few months and comprehensively evaluated it.1. I did a test on the sensor and it has excellent dynamic range which is the contrast between bright and dark areas.2. The camera has superb color reproduction. It was surprising to see the colors retained even in low light situations.3. The most interesting feature for me was availability of manual focus ! I have not come across any other compact camera that even has that feature. It is also very easy to use.4. Overall the camera menu and user interface is excellent and very logical.5. There are a tonne of standard modes for capture that any amateur or enthusiastic photographer will find useful.6. The camera is also capable of capturing High Definition video in 16:9 mode, which is great if you have a HD TV. (sound quality though was not to impressive)7. One of the very few compact cameras that allow you to capture images in RAW format.8. There is an intelligent mode which adjusts the camera automatically with the conditions. I will admit to have tried it when I am too lazy and it works quite wellThings I don't like:None that really bother me.1. However, it is annoying to have to remember to put lens cap ON everytime you turn it OFF. I am used to canon cameras that have automatic lens covers when the camera is shut down. However the lens in this camera is HUGE compared to any Canon camera (compact) I have used.2. The other annoyance is that movies are shot in .mov format, which is not the most versatile format. However, with little search you can find programs that could convert then to avi or wmv files.3. The Panasonic software is average, but again there are so many other softwares that you can use, why even bother.4. If you are very SLRish, you will notice that the \"RAW\" images appear to be slightly processed since there is some image processing that occurs on the sensor board.Bottom line: This is a great camera for most SLR replacement or learning more advanced photography.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "New England Book Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1P7RW1J0BMML1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the camera about one week and it meets the expectations I had from reading many reviews.

Many of you might have some questions. How much do I love my new LX3 after 3 months? Love gets cold, some say. Let's see if that's the case.Oh, I still have plenty of love for my LX3. The fact is, when this love lasts, I start to know what she can or she can't do, and that just becomes easier for both of me and the camera.First of all, I have to tell you this is the first electronic equipment that I actually read the whole user guide. The 1cm focus range, the manual controls, and the cool f/2.0 lens are among the things I really like about this camera. Plus that compact size, there are a lot of general occasions people will find this camera extremely useful, especially when a DSLR is not present.And that says it all, when a DSLR is not around, this camera is the king of the house.From my album on Flickr you probably have already noticed I shoot a lot of different objects. Especially when I am on a trip, I won't start saying, I am going to shoot landscape today. Or I am going to shoot party scene today. Or anything like that. As I view photography as a way to record life, life has many dimensions. Our photographic objects change quickly, to portraits, to landscape, to macro, to low-light, to anything we, as photographers, would notice.And that, with my laziness, make me rely on the auto mode in shooting. Too often there is no time for me to massage the camera bottoms, play with the settings and then shoot. Pathetic, maybe, but point and shoot is what I usually do.That becomes a problem for the LX3. Something about how the computer was set inside. Though I keep updating the firmware, the camera, in more than one occasion, took too long to recognize the scene and left me with no picture. I know this is a common problem for compact small cameras, all brands have it, especially I usually leave only seconds for the camera to shoot. It pushes me back to my old reliable DLSR.The other problems are the picture quality. Sure, I have tried both the Canon G10 and the Nikon competitor. LX3 by far has the best picture quality with the lowest noise. However my Pentax K100D has only 6MP yet it has better smoother pictures, sort of, maybe I should upgrade to K20D. \u00baThe third problem, actually not from the LX3, is that recently I just took two photographic trips to New Orleans and San Diego. When I am on a trip like that, I would definitely use my DSLR. That's why most of my latest uploads onto my flickr album are from my Pentax.Now here comes the sliver lining.1. The camera is compact and can go places where a DLSR cannot go.2. The camera can take high def video.3. The camera can be put into a jean\u00a1\u00a6s tight pockets (ouch~~~!).4. You don't need to, or you can\u00a1\u00a6t, change lens on a trip.

Yamashita", "ReviewID": "R2YYMURSLO5QEY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take pictures at social gatherings and in situations where I did not want the bulk, size, and intimidation factor of an SLR digital camera. In many situations people are more relaxed when they see me with a point and shoot type as opposed to a pro SLR digital camera. By the way the DMC-LX3 is by no means a \"toy camera\" in its performace and operational characteristics. The DMC-LX3 lets me take pictures and get good enough quality without wishing I had the Canon 50D or the 7D in these situations. Having a decent understanding of photography, I've always wanted features such as a hot shoe for external flash, and full manual control even on a point and shoot camera. I rarely use auto or program mode and set the white balance manually. I've used the auto program mode on this camera and found it to be satisfactory overall in performance, and typical of the many compact cameras such as the Canon and Sony brands.One of the things that impressed me was the ease of use in manaul mode in setting the f-stop and shutter speed. You don't have to go into sub menus to do that. The display is at the bottom of the screen showing the f-stop, shutter speed, and the exposure meter. Setting these parameters are easy using the small joystick like control button on the right side of the cameara next to the LCD display. One minor complaint was that the exposure meter disappeared from the screen after about 10 seconds. A half push of the shutter release, or the \"take the picture\" button brings it back on the display. Other than that quirk, I found that the menus were laid out in a logical manner, so I was able to get around quickly to set up the camera for what I needed in a particular shooting situation.The LCD is sharp and has good resolution, however I don't believe that the color temperature is entirely accurate. It tended to render on the warm side. This isn't a deal breaker though, just as long as you are aware of this, and don't use the screen to set color temperature of the shooting scene.The image stabilization works great and give one the ability to shoot using slow shutter speeds with available light. I'm a big fan of image stabilization (IS) as it allows for sharp pictures under most all conditions with the exception that if the subject moves there is nothing IS will do to fix that. Image stabilization gives you freedom from the tripod in more situations and allows one to travel light and work more candidly with this camera.The lens sharpness is quite good for a camera in this price range. I've blown up handheld images and found that the sharpness holds up quite well and is not the limiting factor in this camera. Another reason I bought this camera was the speed of the lens, f2.8. Thats pretty quick for a compact camera and helps in low light shooting conditions. I have to admit that the lens does not have great telephoto range, but its very usable in 90% of my shooting situations.In terms of picture quality this camera is great for what it is. I shoot in the 400 ISO speed range or lower and get good results. ISO 800 and higher start to get grainy, but don't rule that out in some situations where grain gives a desired \"feel\" to a particular scene. Don't expect this camera to perform like a Canon 5D/7D or other pro type cameras. This image sensor is a fraction in size in comparison to that of a full frame or a 1.6 size sensor. The noise/grain to sensitivity factors will be more apparent in a sensor of this size, and will be the picture quality limiting factor.The hot shoe is another feature that I wanted that doesn't exist on any compact camera. Once in a while I'll pull out my Vivitar 285HV flash with a Stofen diffuser and shoot a single or group shot with good results. Since I'm not using the external Panasonic flash designed for this camera, I have to set the f-stop manually as per the dial reading on the flash. If you have an old school auto thyristor flash you will know what this if for. Also the flash makes a good hand grip as the camera is so small, holding it steady could be a challenge.One note; this camera has a built in pop up flash. The camera should be set to red eye removal mode, otherwise peoples eyes will glow red due to the closeness of the flash to the lens location. I only use the built in flash when I have no other options, and I'm willing to live with its forensic harsh looking pictures.To conclude, this is a great camera and is well made with a lot of metal casing for the body exterior. The build quality is excellent. The camera can be manually configured and used by an advanced user or you could run everything in auto program mode still get decent results. After taking numerous pictures, I don't regret buyng this camera and would still choose this one if I had to do it all over again.

Made in Japan - many of its competitors are manufactured in China.Beautiful design - you are basically getting a Leica D-LUX4 in terms of looks and almost in terms of quality too. I just love the retro styling and it feels great in the hand too.Lovely lens - enables great indoor photos due to its fast f2.0 lens at 24mm. Sometimes it would be nice to have a little bit more of a zoom but it often means you should just walk closer to the subject. My previous camera was a Canon S5 with a very long zoom so it will take a bit to get used to not having that option. I do love the wide angle lens for landscape photography and it seems to be really useful for capturing big family groups clustered around a table etc.Very fast burst mode - About 2.5fps which is really good for a point-and-shoot.This camera just totally inspires me to want to get out and take pictures.Cons:Movie mode - not too impressed so far. Movies aren't as good quality as my old camera even though there is the 720p 'High-Def' option. One thing about the movie mode that is of poor quality is the audio due to a single microphone on the LX3 compared to dual mics on my old camera that allowed for stereo sound of much higher quality.The lack of a dedicated movie capture button. Instead you have to cycle through to the movie option and then press the capture button.The separate lens cap is a little annoying although, in my opinion, is not nearly as bad as some reviewers' thoughts. It is definitely not a deal breaker.I would love it if I could use AA batteries with the LX3 although that just doesn't seem to be an option on most digicams anymore.All in all, very few cons - a wonderful camera, you really can't go wrong with the Panasonic Lumix LX3.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'm very happy with my purchase", "Author": "M.

I have had a Lumix FZ20, a Sony 717 and a Minolta 530.For the money the LX3 is simply amazing, but don't expect to be in the same league as the reflex camera, especially at high ISO. If there are lots of shadows I don't like using my LX3 above ISO 400 (that's a subjective assessment). I get about a 2 EV advantage with my D300.The zoom is not especially powerful, but it's so bright and compact I imagine it would have been difficult to design one that would have been at F/2.8 all the way.The depth of field is of course much greater than my larger cameras because the focal length is so small, so it can be an advantage in many situations, and a disadvantage for taking portraits.It doesn't feel that slow, probably because I expect compact cameras to be slow.The quality of the image stabilizer amazes me: I'm able to take many pictures inside museums and have had better results than with my reflexes when I wasn't using stabilized lens. Pictures at a 15th of a second are tack sharp.There is very little chromatic aberration in the lens.The flash is occasionally over-powerful.The video quality is so much better than what I had before.I take this camera everywhere, which is more than what I can say about my reflex cameras.It looks good.On the negative side the manual is not especially well written, but finally you can figure out a lot by just exploring the menus.All in all I would give it four and a half stars, but given the price and the use I get out of this camera I'll give it 5.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Superb!", "Author": "I'M DONE WITH DARKNESS!!!", "ReviewID": "RLWX9XP41DXJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I come from a very different camera - the Panny FZ-20 from long ago.

Noise is often visible in shadowed areas on many images, even with the lower ISO's.  It can't compete with DSLR's for fine color contrast (for example, hair).  Auto white balance and auto focus sometimes miss the mark. Get this camera out of its comfort zone and it will remind you it is a compact.

My prior compact, a Canon G7, gave up too much resolution and picked up too much noise at ISO 200 and above for confidence with reliably capturing that one great impromptu shot.

I want a camera that can go anywhere with me so size is an important factor.  The above are all good cameras, and then I came across the LX3.  Comparing with the price and the features, I decided that it gives me the best value among the other products.  Having an interchangeable system is great, but with the limited choice of lens at this stage, I decided to wait a few more years until the \u00be market is more mature.  So the deciding factor for my purchase on the LX3 is its size, the features, the F2.0 lens, and the price.  Although LX3 is at it end of life but looks like Panasonic has just release a new firmware for it.The 10 mb pixel is good enough for me, size does not matter.  It's the quality.  The picture quality of the LX3 beats all the pictures I took in my film camera years (bye... Minolta XE7, X700).The Good:The micro mode is excellent.  I took a lot of pictures with my model diorama, so this feature ranges #2 in my wish list.I like the multi-file mode where I can take a color and B+W pictures at the same time;I like the custom mode where I can preset the features and be able to switch to it at an instant.Overall, good quality on the built and on the picture.The Bad:This is a major design fault.  The Leica F2.0 cannot take a filter unless you buy a lens adaptor.  Having the lens adaptor on adds two inches in the front of the camera and makes it no pocket-able.  If you want to take the adaptor off, you have to put the lens ring back on, otherwise you cannot put on the lens cap.  So in effect, you either leave the lens adaptor on all the time, or have to constantly mount and dismount the lens ring and the adaptor.  This is more trouble than it's worth.  And then I found out, with the lens adaptor on, it left a dark shadow at the lower right hand corner of the picture when you use flash.  You have to zoom out to 2x in order for the lens to reach out of the blind spot.  To the Panasonic engineer: why can't you design a small thread on the front lens element so that it can take on a filter?  This is why I gave the product four stars instead of five.By the way, I brought the silver LX3 and brought the lensmate silver lens adaptor.

I hate flash photography, and with the LX-3's fast lens and image stabilization, i almost never need the flash and still get great photos.  Start-up speed and refresh rate are very good, the wide angle is fantastic for getting a group in the shot, and it fits in my pocket so I don't feel like a geek lugging around a big camera, but when a photo op arrives, it starts up and is ready quite quickly, and takes great photos in such conditions.  With the wide angle, I have perfected the art of taking self portraits with a group of people.  Stand next your group in a line, then hold out the camera pointing down the line and click, a picture of the whole group.  This really streamlines the group photo thing, and allows me to get in the photos I take!It is also very good for portraits, but at the widest angle, noticeable distortion occurs, so zoom out quite a bit for the best portraits.The same features that make it so good for social photos make it great for photographing the interiors of buildings.  Wide angle, fast lens, image stabilization equals truly excellent interior photos: realtors, architects and designers take note!The LX-3 is also stellar for casual outing and travel photos.  I am the sort of photographer that loves to take quick photos of whatever interesting scenes come up while traveling, and the LX-3 allows me to get images on the fly with a minimal amount of effort at programming.  All I have to worry about is composition and light angle etc., and it makes some surprisingly good travel photos.  It is also very good for landscapes.I can fit it in my jeans back pocket with a little bit of care, it is tight, but it works!  The small size is amazing for a camera that takes such great photos.Problems:The lens cap is a pain, often getting in the way when I am trying to compose a shot on the fly, and when it isn't on, it is easy to get finger prints on the lens.  I've gotten used to it tho, mostly.The mode dial and/or on off switch often moves when slipping in and out of the case, or my pocket.  This slows things down and can lead to some missed photos.Not much zoom out ability.

Many have found this camera to be almost as good as the Leica M8 at thousands less.Look for pros on the internet who use the Dlux4 and check out the pics .This is what this camera is capable of.The manual is much easier to read also.  Plus the firmware has been updated giving you a better EV adjustment then Leica especially when taking bracketed shots. So also great for HDR photos.The micro 4/3rds cameras may beat this one out but at 2 to three times the price and thats with one lens.The JPG output is many times better then what you can do with the RAW.Add one point of saturation and one of contrast and you have the Leica equivalent of what they claim makes the Dlux4 better.See the dpreview tag elsewhere it says it all.

Silly neck strap, looks goofy... feels wrong.  Either way, I purchased the camera for image quality and usefulness.  First, the DP1 is an artists camera and when approached with careful time and patience really delivers great pictures.The LX3 is a camera for the active photographer.  Quick autofocus, sharp pictures, raw + jpeg shooting, various film/ color simulations and decent battery life.  While reviewing shots in Lightroom the pictures exhibit some level of noise and artifacts in ISO 100 and above.  I will not use 800 or higher as the color shifts and noise turn me off.  Regarding the noise at the lower ISO levels, I have not used noise reduction or tried to eliminate it as the noise does not show up in photographs printed on 5x7 paper.  I have not tried 8x10 but I probably would attempt using noise reduction software if i were to try.Flash works well for it's size and the lens cap is really not an issue (compared to my Leica film rangefinders!).  The close-up autofocus switch is also very helpful and I have used it many times during photo shoots.  The LCD does make shots look better than the files (color/ contrast) but it is useful for judging exposure and focus.  Overall it is an excellent alternative to the Sigma camera lines from a user-interface perspective and overall joy of ownership.

Not so for this camera, because if the lens shade is not blocking anything at wide, it certainly is not going to block anything at the telephoto (retracted position).Those who use off-camera flash/strobes should consider a hotshoe-to-PC synch cord adapter such as the Nikon AS-15.

Additionally, I have arthritis in my hands, and sometimes I simply cannot handle my 40D.I had read many reviews of the Leica D-Lux 4, but I could not justify the price-even if I got the Leica name and leather case!. But seriously, I then did some research on the Lumix /country cousin of the Leica. I read ever review I could locate...pro and con. I realized that what I wanted, and what would suit my purpose was a compact w/ a wide angle..and the Leica lense in the Lumix would suit me. I went to the camera store and I held both cameras. Honestly, the Lumix is a little work of art. I liked it better than the Leica. It felt like the first Minolta my parents gave me in 1968; sturdy.  At any rate, I was impressed with the packaging, with the in box equipment, and the sheer beauty of this little gem. I have been shooting for years w/ SLRs and for the past four years with DSLRs, and to be completly honest, the picture quality (4x6) even at a higher ISO is void of noise. The shots are crisp and clear with detail I could not have expected from a point and shoot (but of course, there is the Leica lense). I know some reviewers are not happy with shooting results in RAW, but I did not purcahase the camera to get creative in this manner/I have the aforementioned cameras for this purpose. I have not tried RAW yet, but again, for my purposes, the camera is so far working well.  Now, for the technical issue I have with Lumix: In my opinion, the instruction book was written by someone whose first language is not English. If this camera is purchased by someone who has never owned a digital of any kind, I imagine there will be some frustration with plodding through the book. I have purchased many camera instruction books over the years to complement those that have come with my other camreas, and someone could write one for this camera. I figured out most of the menue selections because of being familiar with the Canon system, but I had to go on-line to locate some answers to a few of my questions.

Image quality is even better if you shoot RAW from ISO 80 to 800 and process in Lightroom 3/4 or the included Panasonic SilkyPix app.What I like:* Street-shooter heaven, day or night - the 24-60mm eq zoom range, fast lens + larger sensor, fast autofocus (in Quick AF mode), stronger-than-average and low-red-eye pop-up flash make this a great camera for HCSF (\"hard-core street photography) style shooters.* Strobist's delight -  REAL hot shoe with manual flash sync at 1/180 sec! Lets me shoot with my old Sunpak flashes or Canon 580EXII on or off camera. With the cheap $25 Cactus remote flash trigger (or equivalent accessory), you can put the flash behind a potted plant and get great, unobtrusive strobe illumination. I've even used it with a Norman studio flash setup and it works great.* 2nd curtain flash sync - For nightime ambient-flash action shots, keeps the \"light trails\" dragging in the \"wake\" (behind) the subject* 1:1 \"square\" mode - I didn't think I'd use this mode much because you're throwing away pixels...but when set in \"B&W; Dynamic\" mode at ISO 1600, it creates an awesome vintage 120-film quality that is very close to my 1960s era Bronica C with Tri-X pushed two stops! Somehow, composing square leads me to framing choices and final images that are creatively very different than standard 3:2* Three other aspect-ratios to choose from ON THE LENS DIAL - 16:9, 3:2, and 4:3 (latter is native sensor format with the most pixels)* RAW files - with Lightroom 3 and 4, the image quality is superb. In \"apparent perceptual resolution\" (not actual MTF 10-lp/mm results), it makes prints that look as sharp as my Canon 7D 18mp or Bronica ETRS 645 with Portra 800 print film pushed to 1600* Tack-sharp lens at all focal lengths* Surprisingly good HDR jpg mode (even better than RAW files optimized in Lightroom)* Very good Auto White Balance (AWB). Amazingly, much better than the Canon 5D Mark II and 7D pro DSLRs I use* Super-quick-change  \"C1\" & \"C2\" custom settings ON THE CAMERA DIAL, and another in the LCD menu - this is a very under-rated and awesome feature that lets you tweak and keep EVERY camera setting (just like on the Canon 7D and 5D MK II). So you can switch instantly between your own custom configurations, like:  - C1 for \"Uber High Quality\" (RAW files, Aperture Priority, 4:3 aspect ratio, ISO 400 max  - C2 for \"Quick Snapshots\" (JPGs, Program/Dummy Mode, 3:2 aspect ratio, ISO auto)  - C3 for \"Old Skool B&W; 120 (JPGs, 1:1 square aspect ratio, B&W; Dynamic, Manual Exposure, ISO 1600* Fast (though not blazing fast) start-up time, minimal shutter lag, and fast autofcus in \"Quick AF\" mode for catching those fleeting moments* Focal-length resume (\"zoom memory\") - When you turn on the camera it remembers your zoom focal-length, so you're ready to rock at, say, 40mm (added with firmware update 2.x).* Larger-than-average sensor - makes the 10 megapixels feel more like 16, especially in low light (\"1/1.63\" size is = 8.07 x 5.56mm or about 45 sq. mm's, which is about 20% larger than a basic digital point-and-shot.* Rock-solid build, metal structural frame and skin. Feels like a classic all-metal-and-glass 35mm rangefinder camera and withstands bumps and travel shock very well* Excellent optical image stabilization modes for both stills and video. I regularly shoot at 1/3-1/4 sec with very sharp images* Good battery and shot life, including video modeWhat I don't like so much:* Taking the lens cap off every time I shoot (gotta get me one of these cool automatic lens caps: http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Lumix-Ultra-Microfiber-Cleaning/dp/B00378YPB2/* Just a BIT too big for jeans pockets (fairly low-profile in a hoodie or messenger bag)* Wish the physical lens barrel dial could also be used for aperture selection in AV or Manual mode (it's just for choosing aspect-ratio)* At ISO 1600+, JPGs can have an \"over-processed\" look and less detail resolution, which is why I always shoot RAW. With LR3 & 4, grain and resolution of this camera's images match that of the newer LX series. If your computer is too slow for LIghtroom or Panasonic's own RAW converter (SilkyPix), then this should be a consideration* Not for bokeh freaks - even with the f/2.0-2.8 aperture, you won't cream out backgrounds at normal portrait distances (4-6 ft), even at full zoom* Image quality of this sensor still cannot match an APS-C or 4/3 10-megapixel+ sensor at high ISOs (over 800) due to higher noise* For video, just okay - good but not stellar image quality at 720p/24fps, no external mic port for video filming, and no focusing or zooming while shooting.* Many useful features are buried in the LCD menus (though you can set your camera-body buttons to pop up your favorite ones instantly).* Menu buttons and \"toggle\" switch are not for people with big hands (or gloves).Summary: If you're looking for a fast high-image quality camera for street, travel, strobist, and creative studio photography, this is a little gem. If you're a bokeh/shallow-depth-of-field junkie then go for an APS-C, 4/3, or full-frame compact.Hope that helps and happy shooting whatever gear you're using! - Andrew", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "LX3 repair", "Author": "Rowland Scherman", "ReviewID": "R2OSDLE4QFBUDQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read P.

I haven't used ISO and F-stop since a photography class in college so this is a great camera for getting familiar with using those settings again when necessary.

At the time I bought it, other brands of cameras were avalailable with technically much higher megapixels yet they couldn't compete with the quality of photos that this camara took.  The number of megapixels is only one thing to take into account - after a point, the number of megapixes becomes less and less important.

It's just great, and every time I see it, I still am surprised at just how great it looks and in retrospect, just how amazingly it performed. This camera really starts to blur the line between point-and-shoot and SLR. Will you get the same low-light performance from this camera as you would out of a GF1 outfitted with a Nokton F/1.4 or greater lens? Certainly not. However, for how compact the camera is, how silently the shutter runs, how outstanding the macro functions and how great its photos come out, it's an excellent camera. This is because it chooses to focus on quality over quantity- particularly in its sensor. Where other camera manufacturers try to impress with high megapixel counts- which for point-and-shoot cameras is wholly useless, panasonic chooses instead to use fewer pixels ( don't worry- the megapixel count is more than enough to make a full-sized canvas print if that's what you want to do with it) but make it so that each pixel is more efficiently utilized.Is it expensive for a point-and shoot? By all means, it is. It's a luxury camera to be certain. One which begins to blur the line between point-and-shoot and an SLR. For those just easing in to photography, I'd look elsewhere- perhaps a Canon PowerShot SD870IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) . The camera has a dedicated following on flickr, and for good reason. The pictures it takes speak for themselves- particularly on the high-contrast B&W; settings.When I was showing off this camera to an SLR enthusiast wielding a thousand-dollar telephoto lens, she had a similar reaction to the camera. She absolutely loved the way it looked and the pictures it was able to take.While the camera may not perform quite as well as a DSLR- particularly in low-light, portrait and high-contrast situations, I find that because its so portable you'll have it with you more often, and you'll subsequently take more pictures with it. Its durable, it's beautiful, and it takes great pictures. A note of caution, however.

There are a lot of other stellar reviews about this product so I won't rehash what everyone else says. In a nutshell - this is a camera I would highly recommend to anyone.About Me: I'm just an average user, I'm learning as I go and I'm certainly not an expert. I shoot mostly scenery/landscapes and candid people shots. I use Lightroom on my Mac to do any post-processing - which has not given me any problems at all thus far.That being said - the LX- 3 performs excellently, no matter what the scenario.Build - The camera itself is quite portable, and feels solid to the hand. The only major point of concern I have is the separate lens cap, which I've gotten used to by now. This thing CAN fit in a large pocket but i prefer to have my girlfriend carry it in her purse - where it fits quite nicely.Performance - Excellent low-light performance, REALLY excellent daytime performance. The camera has a slew of useful preset Scene modes, but also allows you to tinker with almost anything else - aperture,shutter speed, exposure are the ones I use most but there are others - including white balance, ISO etc. The latest firmware update also gives some predefined \"HDR\" settings for that HDR look, although it also gives you autobracketing from -3 to +3 EV so you can actually use it for a proper HDR scene.Images are clear, sharp and the best I've seen from any digital camera. Noise increases in low-light conditions, but when used with a tripod and proper shutter speed selections the results are quite nice. Even so, this beats other digital point and shoots by a long run when it comes to low-light photography.I don't use video all that much, but it seems to work well, especially audio reception.By the way, the full AUTO setting on this (iA) is quite capable of adjusting for almost any scenario. I feel absolutely no shame in using this when on a regular point ad shoot day.

I bought it for the f2.0 fast lens, the wide angle, the build quality, the Panasonic processing software in the camera itself, the accessories like even more wide angle with an accessory lens or the 24mm optical finder. I have done some photojournalism in my life and this is what I wish I had back then.I have gone through at least four digital cameras since I decided to leave my Nikon film SLR on the shelf a few years ago. I have never looked back. But this beauty allows me to do the photography I like best, to be inconspicuous, to be quick, to feel like taking it along because of its relatively light weight and size, to not spook people who are shy when an SLR is around. It looks like any P&S;, but I'm thankful it isn't.I've seen minimal barrel distortion, maximum sharpness and contrast, easy menus, abundant automatic as well as full manual features.You can go with the much less costly extra batteries (under $15.00) and other items. A tip about non-Panasonic brand batteries: remove the stick-on label because it is just thick enough to make it difficult to remove these after market batteries. When I did this, they fit just as well as the Panasonic batteries. Get the S005 battery. These aftermarket are just as good as maker branded batteries. Get a few of them. They charge up in just 45 minutes or so.I have used the 720P HD video (use the wide 16:9 format at the right side of the lens barrel selector switch) and am impressed at the quality. Certainly a dedicated 1080P HD videocam would do better, but being able to use a 24mm wide angle lens is a real plus. On my digital TV and on my computer monitor the results were satisfying. My computer played it with a little stutter the first time but playing it again it was smooth on succeeding times. Go figure. I have a low end graphics card so that may be the cause. My HD videos have been less than one minute so far - I understand there may be a limit of five minutes or so (per file). Don't buy another still camera without HD video!A tip about what some pros and advanced amateurs do with a quality new camera to preserve its resale value is to cover as much surface on the camera as possible with adhesive plastic (such as the PDA screen protector materiel) to minimise wear (and actually, it gives you a better grip than the stock exterior). This is for a user camera.Oh, one thing. Do not trust the neck strap. It almost came loose at the camera end while on its first use. Use a sailor's knot there - don't trust the tiny plastic sleive to hold.

Taglieri", "ReviewID": "R2Z2SR3F2RTAFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good:*24mm wide angle in a compact. This is invaluable to me as I love to get closer to my subject. Also, the JPEG processing eliminates distortion.*60 second exposures! This is my favorite part of the camera. I do a lot of night time shooting, and when I don't have one of my serious cameras handy the LX3 can create some gorgeous long exposures. I don't think many other compacts go beyond 15 seconds.*F2.0 lens. I'll use this cameras at low ISO and 2.0 all day indoors.  I hate using a flash (bounced flash is lovely, but I'm lazy unless it's for work) so I'll use an slr if I really need great ISO indoors for people. Let's all be honest and say it's NOT a real summicron; and even if it were it would not matter as a tiny sensor isn't going to max out even a so-so lens. I would never pay over 500 dollars for a normal focal length lens (if you do you need your head examined!), so this is probably the only thing I'll ever own that says \"Leica\".*Moderate control of noise reduction. I can set my lx3 to -2 noise reduction and capture more detail.*Aspect ratio control on the lens (3:2, 4:3, 16:9). I almost always shoot in 3:2 and 4:3, but it's nice to have such a convenience.*Image stabilizer definitely does work.*Battery life is acceptable.*The lens cap. Most people see this as a bad thing, but I enjoy it as it provide infinitely more protection than the weak built in caps on other compacts. Yes it protrudes, and I'm willing to make that sacrifice in order to keep my expensive camera safe.*Screen is very nice. I also like how you can eliminate all the junk on the screen by pressing the display button.*I blew a picture up to 20x30 at iso 80 / f4.5 / -2 noise reduction / 3:2 ratio / JPEG. It looks plenty sharp from a few feet away and perfectly reasonable up close. It currently hangs in someone's home and definitely displays just how capable these tiny cameras are.The Bad:*The auto white balance has trouble at night time. During the day it is ok.  It produces some cooler colors during the day and I find adding some amber to the auto white balance makes it more to my taste. Night time auto white balance is very frustrating though; it loves to go green like reciprocity issue on film. I can still get it to look good, but it's nothing like the pleasant gamut of colors I get from a professional slr. Haha but how mad can I really get? It's a compact camera.*Has RAW support. All this does is cause people to angst over RAW vs. JPEG in a compact camera. Compacts are all about convenience, so I really have zero desire to shoot RAW on this (or quite frankly any other camera). My clients have never noticed or cared that I shoot JPEG. For snapshot duty on the lx3, shooting RAW is like walking up an escalator that is traveling down. For real cameras, RAW is a choice for the photographer as they have to decide if the marginal benefit is worth so much of their time. Too much work for arguably the same results.*This is not as compact as most compacts. It's bulges a little in your pocket, but then again that's the price you pay for having such a versatile tool in a barely pocketable package.I may switch over to an aps-c compact camera when they have improved some more.

I've shot over 10,000 images with it, dropped it hard on pavement a few times, seen it ricochet around the inside of a car during an emergency stop... and it's still going strong.The combination of killer optics (leica f2.0 24mm w/ a touch of zoom), effective image stabilization, rugged construction, rock solid ergonomics, battery life, overall ease of use, and lightness is simply unbeatable - still to this day.How many digital products can you think of that are still being made and sold new for the same price as when introduced 4 YEARS after launch? Zero! Except for this little cam.I've never used a case or lens cap because at time of purchase, I bought and retro-fitted the Ricoh LC-1 lens cover, added the little double stick pads inside to keep the louvers out of wide shots, and have been going utterly trouble and damage free ever since.I've been trying hard to replace this cam as my \"have it everywhere\" cam, because I want a bigger sensor in the same little killer package, but to date there is no such beast. I shoot a 5dMKII with all the top end Canon glass when I feel like hauling the tank around, which is rare. I bought the NEX 5 and a few NEX lenses, but although it produces very nice images, I've never been satisfied with it as a replacement for the LX3 (the Sony lenses are no match for the LX3's Leica, and non-system lenses I've tried - a bunch of top line Nikons, and the amazing Voigtlander 35mm 1.4 - have no auto focus, which is a serious drag in a cam with no viewfinder). I recently bought the EOS M with the very nice 22mm lens but returned it after a few days - way too many loose ends that the LX3 covers in spades (better optics, no need for lens cap, better ergonomics, more rugged construction).There are several close contenders for replacing the LX3:1) The Lumix GX1 with the 20mm 1.7. It has a micro 4/3rds sensor and the image quality with that lens is killer, but...it is heavier, costs around $700 with that lens, needs a lens cap, has no zoom range. Very tempting after using a friend's for a few days, but...it feels like 75% of the jump to LX3 escape velocity.2) The Ricoh GR 16.2 MP. Amazingly compact APC sensor-equiped, needs no lens cap, and based on many amazing images I've seen taken with it on Flickr, the lens/sensor/software system is truly outstanding. Also in the $800 range.3) The incredible Fujifilm X100 12.3 MP APS-C. Rugged, lovely manual controls, shoots incredible images with its 23mm F2 fixed lens. Needs a lens cap, slightly bigger than the LX3, no image stabilization. Recent price drops put it under $900. Ultra tempting! (note: the newer x100s is $1300).A full jump up from the LX3 would be a Lumix full frame LX3 (LX3-F?) with all the same features and a similarly amazing f2 or faster Leica ~24mm lens with a bit of zoom capability (24mm-50mm = perfection) for ~$1,000.Until something like that is available, I'm stuck and happy with the LX3, which at this point is the highest return on camera investment I've ever enjoyed.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best for quality point and shoot", "Author": "Welly", "ReviewID": "RY5WD9U868CA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro :1.

However i've quickly become accustomed to the LX3's joystick approach to changing settings. Its not that big of a deal. I found the dealbreaker of the g10 was the size. In contrast the LX3 is a tad smaller and thus more manageable. It is still not a pocketable camera, but with the neck strap, I wear the camera like a messenger bag and it tucks nicely away under my arm.I did have a complaint a few weeks ago about the poor auto white balance performance, but since Panasonic just recently upgraded the firmware, this issue has been resolved.

When I hand it off to people they sometimes get a little nervous once it's in their hands b/c it obviously is more than just your average p&s.;  I get a lot of \"whoa!\"s.

In all cases, the white balance was good, the focus was very good, and most of the photos were taken Ai which works very well.  No indication of camera shake, pictures very sharp, skin tones very good.  I haven't really tested it in all conditions, but it is a perfect bridge camera unless you want a long zoom.  If that is what you want, this is not your camera.I have an FZ35 for a long zoom, and a Canon 5D for those days when you feel like packing some weight and getting pictures that can stand large size without any noise.

I primarily take photos of my pets (dog and cats), friends, and family. The camera really excels indoors in low light conditions where the F/2 lens really shines. You can take sharp photos in places where there was previously not enough light. The wide angle end of the lens is great for group shots in tight spaces or for getting an interesting perspective. The telephoto side (60mm equivalent) is nice for portraits.I primarily use the raw files, and finally Apple software supports the LX3's raw file in iPhoto.If I am going to be somewhere inside or dark, this is the camera I want with me.It's a little bulkier than your standard point and shoot. It definitely doesn't go into my jeans pocket, but I can put it in my cargo pocket or in a jacket pocket. The size does make me take it less places than I like. The interface is a bit complicated, but the features and customizability is one of the reasons I love the LX3.

A camera for taking interior pictures without flash because that usualy changes the aspect of the characters.In addition, it takes very impressive pictures outside for landscapes, and the HD video is of quite good quality also (although unfortunately in MOV.format like most cameras these days...)but without the ability to use the zoom when shootingI must tell that this camera comes in addition to my Canon Powershop S5IS which I use outside for its x12 zoom and for taking AVI videos of reasonably good quality.I also have a Pana LX2 and a Canon G9.The improvement with the LX2 is impressive in all respect.Compared to the G9, the main area where the LX3 is clearly winning is the shooting in low light. I mainly use my LX3 in P mode with the ISO limited to 400 and I hardly never use the flash. Occasionaly I have to adjust to ISO 800 which still gives very good pictures. I believe that the quality of the optic, the aperture (1:2.0) and the limited zoom explain this result.For me it is compact enough to be carried in a pocket or in a hand bag, but of course not as compact as some other cameras, but which may not take as good pictures. To give an example, I bought an Olympus 840Mu a year ago but I have not used it beyond the first month as I could accept to get only one or two good pictures out of 10.It is expensive...But personaly I consider it is a worthwile investment.

In a world obsessed with the wrong stats (megapixels, which this does have a-plenty) it was great to see a company focus on a great lens. There are more features than I know how to use but these are my favorites:\"Star light\" mode (aka time lapse exposure) - leaves the exposure open for 15 - 60 seconds. Makes for AMAZING night time photos. One of my fav's was a car coming up a road at night. The headlights created 2 long beams like a \"snake of light\" going around a turn, and blended into the tail lights as it went around. Looked incredible. So many possibilities.Burst mode - take 3 pictures in one click, or better yet, snap continuous photos for as long as you hold down the button. Great for fast moving things, like your kids. I have so many good pictures of my nephews thanks to this. Most are junk you delete, but the ones you keep are real gems.Grainy black and white. Sounds odd for a modern 400 dollar camera, but these come out amazing in the right conditions. My fav's are a sailboat coming through an old drawbridge in the Carribbean, and a sunset settling over some drift wood on the beach. Yea, a black and white sunset - go figure.But the greatest feature is it simply takes great pictures. It makes you look like a much better photographer than you (or at least) I am.About my only complaint is the tripod mount, a must for the aforementioned time lapse exposure. Its offset to one side, so my little travel tripod always wants to fall over from the weight. Really frustrating sometimes, but not a big deal. I just need a gorilla tripod so I can offset the legs.In short, if you want better, get a DSLR.

Spot metering, AF area selection, RAW, apterture and shutter speed control (and dedicated apterture and shutter priority modes) are all there. It even has a hotshoe mount for a flash (although any useful flashes are twice the size of the camera). The lens is a respectable 24-60mm equivalent for anyone with a full frame camera with a removable ring that allows for mounting of a variety of add-on lenses for telephoto and wide angle applications as well as filters. The ver 2.2 firmware autofocuses very fast, too. Image stabilization is a huge plus, which when paired with the small size of the camera allows for excellent low light, low shutter speed shots.Downsides are few and not real disadvantages if you realize limitations of such technology. The small photosensor creates a substantial amount of noise over a DSLR crop body, which is expected and the only workaround would be a larger sensor. ISO 800 is rather noisy and 1600 is VERY noisy. Thankfully, ISO 400-800 are quite adequate in average lighting. ISO 3200 is essentially unusable, though, even with the best noise-reduction software. On the other end of the spectrum you get ISO 80, which is incredible and ISO 80-100 photos have a DSLR quality to them.I have no real opinions on the scene modes or jpeg performance since I shoot RAW and use the camera in A or M modes and often set my autofocus points (a very useful feature). What is truly remarkable is the inclusion of spot metering, which really gives you another professional tool. To fully take advantage of this little camera, shooting in RAW with a PP software like Lightroom 3 is a must.Moving up to the front, the lens is 24-60 mm. While that seems inferior to other cameras in the segment, which offer over \"15x optical zoom\" and digital zoom far beyond that, those are the equivalent of superzoom DSLR lenses with obvious optics limitations like soft corners, soft focusing, chromatic aberration and the like. On this camera the optics are sharp throughout the focal range and aperture settings. f/2.0 is respectably sharp. Expect distortion at 24mm, not a bad thing for landscapes, but save your portraits for the 50-60mm range, remember that at that range your useful aperture goes to f/2.8. On the subject, DOF is incredible, making this an amazing landscape camera. Manual focus is there, but controlled electronically instead of through a focusing ring. The lens also has a great macro feature available at the flick of a switch. At another flick of a switch are aspect ratios that I assume would be useful for video, but seem useless for still photography. Interestingly the \"10 MP\" coverage isn't available in the 3:2 (35mm) mode, instead 9.5 MP is what you get.Outdoor photography is addled by the LCD display which is no match for bright sunlight and makes it useful only for menu settings and basic composition. There's a rangefinder-like viewfinder, but that doesn't help much if you are adjusting the aperture and shutter speed/ISO, and is rudimentary at best. An LCD viewfinder makes its way from the micro 4/3rds segment to the LX5, but isn't compatible with the LX3.Controls are tiny, but aren't that difficult to use even with very large hands. The biggest downside is a tiny little joystick for aperture and shutter controls (instead of a DSLR rotary dial present on the LX5 and GF1) that doubles as a quick menu switch, but has been set to activate only when held down to prevent accidental input during shutter and aperture adjustments. Construction is solid and elegant. The lens cap is the only real irritation on the build. It's large and bulky, making the camera a tough fit in cases and pockets. In terms of portability, this is probably the largest camera that can fit in a big pocket while inside a case, but most owners would probably opt for a belt clip as it is much thicker than most compacts.The flash is reasonable for its tiny size, but works extra hard at ISO 200, and has very limited range. Its best use is as a fill flash for bright backlit daylight photography as indoors it casts garish shadows and gives photos a point and shoot look--more reason to take advantage of the 2.0/2.8 aperture and low light performance of the Leica lens over the flash. Any indoor flash photos will require the purchase of a flashgun that will inevitably exceed the size and weight of the camera.Battery life is adequate, but anyone used to the life in a DSLR should probably throw in a spare battery.In conclusion, this is NOT a compact DSLR replacement as some have said because of its DSLR features and controls. You need a micro 4/3rds sized sensor and a few hundred dollars more for that, but lose portability unless you can live with a pancake 20mm lens. What this is is a respectable compact camera with an incredible lens that foregoes the superzoom trend of the competition and offers great optics. DOF is incredible, and it's just portable enough that this is the camera that I always have with me everywhere I go (and that's the best selling point I can think of).And, honestly, it's in a tiny crowd of excellent compacts that really are above and beyond their point and shoot competition.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazingly Versatile Camera with Amazing Image Quality!", "Author": "D. Yu \"Idealist\"", "ReviewID": "R36HBSMSLLFYQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the Panasonic LX-3 for over a year now and have put it to good use in that year. It's eventually lived up to my expectations, but not without putting some work into it. This camera is geared towards photographers that want full control, so this review is for those folks.Hardware:From a build quality perspective, this camera is top notch. Very little plastic was used in the construction of this camera. The only cheap point is the plastic battery door, which seems rather fragile, but it's managed to handle the abuse I've put it through. The lens cover is annoying, but I've gotten used to taking it on and off. I've opted not to attach it to my camera via the provided wire, and usually just slip it into my pocket so that it's completely out of the way. This camera WILL fit in your jean pocket, but it'll look unsightly due to the protruding lens. I've opted to attach a small wrist strap and stick it into my pants while walking around, but the provided neck-strap does a fine job of making your camera easily accessible.Performance:I'll keep this short. This camera is as fast as the fastest point and shoot, but it doesn't come near the speed of a DSLR. If you're looking to take pictures of fast moving kids in low light, get yourself a DSLR.Menu System & Firmware:It's hard to judge weather the LX-3 menu system is good or bad, since everyone has their own preference, but I can definitely say that it's on the better side. What really surprised me is the amount of control that Panasonic has given the user via the firmware. You can move your focus points around to exactly where you where you want it, great for macro photography. You can fine-tune your auto-white-balance to corret any AWB tendencies you discover. There's exposure bracketing of max +/- 3 stops, which works well for HDR. My personal favorite is that while manual focusing, it'll actually show the range of what is in focus based on the aperture and zoom you're at. This takes the guess work out of hyperfocusing. Panasonics dedication to providing features via software that really makes the LX-3 a complete camera.Picture Quality:From a pure camera sensor standpoint, the LX-3 takes excellent photos. Given enough light, the sensor produces great dynamic range and detail, taking full advantage of the Leica summicron. Once light starts being reduced, the sensor's low \"actual\" ISO (confirmed by DXOMark) and the sensors overall weak performance at higher ISO's tends to degrade the photo quality quite a bit. ISO 400 can work for B&W;, while ISO 800 is really only good for web posts.Adobe Camera Raw + LX3 = WIN!I've never liked the JPEG engine and AWB's tendency to add a green-cast to most of my photos. I've started playing around with the AWB fine tuning and other settings to get acceptable JPEGS, but shooting RAW in conjunction with using ACR for post processing is my recommendation. ACR automatically fixes optical distortions, which the LX3's Summicron generates a fair amount. With ACR, I've finally managed to get the colors I want, while giving me full control over noise reduction and sharpening that can create undesirable artifacts. Yes, it takes time to process these photos, which is why I shoot JPEG + RAW. I use the JPEG's for quick posts, but will use the RAW files for any prints I want to create. The Silkypix that comes with the LX3 is horrible to use and generates very soft pictures from the LX3's RAW. Maybe I just didn't know what I was doing, but I'm avoiding it and would recommend you do the same.I hope this review provides some additional insight compared to the tons of other reviews out there.

I wanted something smaller with a very wide angle lens to replace my Canon 20-35mm L. This camera is incredible. I found the perfect little bag for it which carries a microfiber cloth, spare battery and charger, the wide angle lens and adapter. I don't have to think about taking it out with me as it is so light and portable. With the optional wide angle lens mounted it really isn't something that you can fit in a coat pocket so the bag is a necessity.I shoot in aperture priority and in high resolution jpeg format which gives excellent results. The only slight issue is that the mode selector dial is easy to turn getting it in and out of the bag so you do have to double check what mode you're in before you shoot as I have missed some shots with it. I've shot movies with it that are half decent quality.

I haven't played with the picture mode settings at all, but in 'regular' mode I'm so impressed with the LX3. I really hadn't been expecting such good results and if I do buy into a high end system down the road I will definitely consider Panasonic's micro four thirds options over and above a DSLR. For the type of photos that I like to take - mainly street photography, this is small enough to go unnoticed and I can definitely tell in the results. My old Canon had a very loud shutter which always used to attract attention. The automatic cameras I had were also large and conspicuous so this is a welcome change as is the drop in weight that I have to lug around when I'm shooting.I've shot a lot of low light situations whether it is musicians playing a gig or photos in a restaurant or at a party and the LX3 really shines where many other respectable compacts fall short. When you have the wide angle lens attached you can't take photos using the camera's built-in flash as you get a shadow of the lens' barrel on your subject so if you are planning on using a flash then pick up an external flash that sits on the hotshoe. All in all I'm very happy with it and it will be my little go to camera for years to come.The build quality is excellent. I'd say the only weakness is the door to the battery compartment which needs to be opened and shut gently as I could see that breaking easily. I put on a Domke strap that is rugged as hell and it works beautifully so I'm happy to have the ability to make that choice as the factory strap is adequate, but I wanted something strong and thin attached to the LX3.There are a few limitations that I can live with, but overall the camera is brilliant. The LX5 looks as though Panasonic has addressed some of the things on my wish list of things to improve with the 24-90mm lens as opposed to the 24-60mm on the LX3. I won't be upgrading to the LX5 anytime soon in spite of the changes as I am saving for a micro four thirds system with a live viewfinder and interchangeable lenses.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for decent price", "Author": "V.

This camera is an example.Some photographers prefer wide angle and others prefer telephoto ways of seeing. I'm a wide angle guy and so the 24 mm equiv lens on this LX3 is wonderfully appealing in a pocket cam. Also the f2. Also the very close focus down to 1 cm. Together, these enable some photos you just could not capture with any other pocket camera. The lens is the result of a fruitful collaboration between Leica design and Panasonic whiz-bang manufacturing.Unfortunately, Panasonic did not go far enough in learning from Leica, who are famous for their simple, clean control layouts. The user interface is not well designed, busy and fussy. Far too many little levers and buttons - some actually redundant - the joystick does almost the same thing as the multi-controller, so why have both? Also, a pet peeve of mine; perhaps the worst owner's manual ever. 150 pages and almost incomprehensible in parts. Be prepared to spend hours puzzling over it if you want to take advantage of all features.And the Scene Modes. Hasn't the Scene Mode thing gotten a bit out of hand? We used to adjust the shutter and aperture and focus and that was thought too difficult for the public to master - so now we have \"Fifty Scene Modes\" instead? This camera, believe it or not, offers a \"Food Scene Mode\" to take photos of your sushi plate in a restaurant! Absurd and useless - but some of the high price you paid for this camera went to develop the Scene Modes you don't use and the manual you can't read.There are other small but annoying examples of thoughtless design choices. Instead of the universal USB cable that almost all cameras use, the LX3 has a different cable with a teeny tiny plug. Why do they need this? The space saved is insignificant, but it means you must search for this oddball cable which none of your other gadgets use.There are two aspects to a good product, the technical performance and the user interface. Both are necessary to get good results quickly. The LX3 is much better on the former than the latter. Panasonic is clueless about this sort of thing throughout their product line.

I have been a photo for 35 years. I bought the LX3 after about a year of salivating for this camera and not being able to find it in stock. At first I was so in love with the camera that I practically took it to bed with me. BUT, then I headed out for a month of trekking (not wanting the weight of a DSLR) in Thailand and Laos and the camera began to fail:1.  Within a few days of being in Thailand, the sensor developed a sizable black spot in the lower right hand corner...mostly visible in the 16:9 mode shooting zoomed in at a bright subject. VERY, VERY annoying for a professional photog. I have returned to the US and sent it in to Panasonic ($11 in shipping paid by me) and am waiting for its return. It was returned in a month's time and now within 2 weeks, it developed ANOTHER spot on the sensor and a blurry area in the lower right hand area in low light wide angle shooting. NOTE: the lens is not dirty on the outside. It is spotless. I have asked Panasonic for a loaner while they fix it and they refuse.You can see photos and documentation of the spot and blurry area on my blog:[...]2.  I returned to my home computer to find that about 50% of the photos I shot in RAW format were out of focus. WHAT??? My last Lumix never produced a single out-of-focus shot. I examined them all carefully and can see that in some cases the auto focus didn't grab my intended focal point...it grabbed something like a shirt color instead of a nose. Enough when using the camera in not-so-bright settings to ruin the shot. One has to be very careful about what exactly the camera is focusing on. Chalk that up to user error, but still, it was disappointing. The remaining unfocused shots were camera shake at 1/40. What?? What about that image stabilizer that worked so well in the TZ3 and ZS3? I think the stabilizer is not adequate.3. The LX3 is not supported in RAW format on iPhoto. That is a BIG DRAG!! If you use Lightbox or Bridge, OK.4. The zoom really does suck. We all know that at the outset, but I found myself using my travel companion's Lumix ZS3 b/c of its extraordinary zoom capability.5. The VIDEO mode really is pretty miserable. It won't zoom. I knew that. BUT, what I didn't know is that the camera adjusts its aperture on the fly as you're panning from a bright to dark subject. But it doesn't do it gradually or elegantly. It does it abruptly so you have these SUDDEN shifts in exposure which are jarring.What good I will say about the camera is that the f2.0 lens is great. The wide capapbilities are great. The sharpness and sensitivity of the sensor when shooting in RAW are better than any compact I've ever seen or used. That alone makes this cranky camera worth the investment. So if you can haul around a mono or tripod to ensure sharpness and you take the time to make SURE you're focusing correctly, and if you're not really into shooting video, go ahead and get this camera. But if you're NOT going to shoot in RAW, don't waste your money. Get the ZS3, an overall better camera for the good amateur.It is also a very attractive package when coupled with the Leica leather case.

Finally, there's a Manual mode for those who like to spend time on each shot.The camera feels and handles like a well-constructed dream.One feature I love: because the flash has to be manually revealed, the common behavior of flash being on by default is gone! And to be honest, with a good sensor and 2.0 aperture, you don't even need it in most situations!Biggest downside is the size of the camera, especially when considering the protruding lens and lens cover.If you're an amateur or pro photographer looking for a compact that offers you control and a connection to your images, this is the one to pick.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Amazon Fan", "ReviewID": "REA91U9SAUS6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a year and I still love it.

It also has simple control of the auto focus point, simple access to exposure compensation and force flash.You must remove the battery to charge it so a backup battery might be worth considering. The battery takes a few hours to fully charge.The included RAW processing software (Silkypix) is easy to use but I've started to use the Photoshop capability simply because it's convenient to launch straight into Photoshop after processing.Careful with lens cleaning solution.

The field of view and the speed (light gathering ability) of the lens can only be rivaled by high end camera and lens combinations costing six to ten times as much (admittedly those are superior in many other ways as well).  Still, the point is that no other compact point and shoot camera can rival the field of view and speed of this one.  Nevertheless, some things come up short of fair on the LX3.The shutter lag is terrible.  I am a very instinctive shooter that is quite capable in photojournalist style candids but I am almost always defeated by this camera.I am not a photophile or electronic gadget spec sheet bench racer.  I've done wonderful 8x10 prints with a 6MP camera and 10MP is enough to get prints after substantial cropping.  I have huge film scans when I need them but I cannot realistically show dozens of megapixels on screen or in print for more than a handful of images.  I also shoot in .jpg and it's great.  I can't imagine the agony of terabytes of raw data jamming my PC.I love the LX3 video quality for movies.  It's ideal for Youtube and even Youtube HD.  I do not like the Quicktime .MOV format or the weak compression algorithm.  I wish it had H.264 and wrote an .MPG type format.  It still beats the data format from a DVD camcorder though.The audio quality for movies is terrible.  Again, I'm not talking audiophile critique here.  For comparison, my Sony DSC T9 (ultra compact point and shoot) has far better sound.I hate the manual aspect ratio slider.  If I shoot movies I want 16:9 but for stills I want 3:2 (of course).  The LX3 requires that I remember to both turn the dial and slide the switch or I will end up shooting 16:9 stills.Overall, it's a great camera.

I wanted a high quality camera, with both still photo and video capabilities. The still shots have been fine, but the video has bad looking vertical bars in it whenever any small or large light source is in the shot (like candles at a candlelight dinner, street lights, car headlights, christmas lights...). This video was recorded with the Panasonic LX3S. Note the vertical lines in the video near the candles. 20 Seconds. After emailing my description of the problem to Panasonic customer service, they requested a video showing the problem, and I posted this on the web, hoping they would help diagnose the problem with video recordings on the LX3S, but they emailed my back saying they refuse to look at it. It was recorded on my DMC-LX3S using a SanDisk Extreme III memory card and the camera's firmware was upgraded to v1.2. Comments encouraged - please help me diagnose the problem & say if you also have a problem like this in these lighting conditions or not.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3FLZAZW2J27EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for about a month, it's one great digital camera for a size this tiny.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "review on lx3", "Author": "Simeng Yan \"simeng\"", "ReviewID": "RYHT5UWPMNKSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good camera but 2.5 optical zoom is not enough. perfect for the view but for the object faraway, it's kind of hard to shoot.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very positive transaction", "Author": "TEB \"TedB\"", "ReviewID": "RHKAHQAPI74MG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product as advertised.

Recently, I started my search for a better P&S; and have not found anything that excited me. I want to be able to use external flash. Everyone of them (except Leica, which is essentially the same as my LX2 and costs much more) failed miserably when tested against the LX2.Based on my experience with the LX2, I am so excited when I ran across the LX3. Here is the camera that could rightfully replace my LX2. The only issue is, it is too expensive. I could not justify dishing out $450 to gain may be another 10% functionality. With $450, you can buy an entry level lightweight, DSLR kit from Canon or Nikon that could easily blow this camera away in both images and usability. Yes, it is bulkier and heavier, but if pocketability is your goal, there are plenty of other DMCs that cost a lot less.BTW, I bought my LX2 over 2 years ago for $250. When Panasonic lowers the price of this camera to about $250-$300, I'll get one. Until then, I continue to shoot my LX2, 15,000+ images and still going. And I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewers here, this is the best of P&S.; I've tried the Canon G10 and I'd rather keep my LX2.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "LX3 US model has no menu support for Chinese/Korean (Most Asian Languages)", "Author": "Diego", "ReviewID": "R1YID1DGHQ9G60", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Almost every camera maker in the known world now includes world language toggle for their consumer camera lineup.

If you want to buy this for your parents or buy it as a gift for friends who are only fluent in an Asian language other than Japanese, forget about it.If you do a google search, LX3 has like 8 or more different models each with it's own set of \"language\" subset.This is normal right? Wrong.Go to any camera store and pick up the competitors, almost all of them, many half the price, have all the major globe language set encoded into their camera menu system.Cameras are the number 1 gift item all over the world and one of the rare consumer items used all over the world regardless of purchase location.
