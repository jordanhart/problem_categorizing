First off, out of the box I figured the entire camera out in about 5 minutes because it's very self explanitory.  The salesman said the batteries in digitals usually last for about 20 pictures...well I've taken almost 50 and I'm not even getting a low battery message yet.  The picture quality is so professional it's scary.  I definatly reccomend this camera to anybody!", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Really nice camera at a nice price", "Author": "A.Mick- \"Amy\"", "ReviewID": "R3TLS4SHKWL136", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went all over town looking for a good digital camera that wasn't too expensive.  I had previously owned a fuji film camera and it just wasn't getting the job done.  I went to store after store asking different salespeople what was the best brand, best value, etc.  Almost all of them pointed out an Olympus Camera, and I finally settled on the fe115.  I like products that I can just use right away and not read the instructions for a half hour before I use them.  This little guy fits the bill and then some.  Absolutely great picture quality, and the image stabilization is really nice.  Easy to use camera with great features and affordable (although I paid more at another store...always check amazon first!) I give it an A+!", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "I'm very pleased with the FE-115", "Author": "owb", "ReviewID": "R2GC11AY09O387", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally prefer cameras using SD or CF memory cards because their prices are lower for equivalent cards, but this one suited my daughter's needs and I am pleasantly surprised with the performance at this price. Two CD's are included, but I haven't looked at them and she probably won't have any need for them as she already has an excellent photo editing system on her computer. Transfering files requires no special software, you just plug the cord into the camera and into the USB jack on the computer. Windows recognizes it as a remote drive and you copy the files over.A feature I especially like is \"image stabilization\" that helps you take sharp pictures in shaky circumstances. Very nice when using zoom.It also has a supermacro range that lets you focus much closer than other digital cameras that I have used.Basic use is easy right out of the box and reading the instruction booklet and experimenting offers a lot more possibilities. I haven't tried the video modes yet.", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "LOVE this digital camera!!!", "Author": "D. B. Cohen", "ReviewID": "R2MQEOMUMZHW57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera.  My first was a different brand and I was not happy with it at all.  But, this Olympus FE-115 is terrific!  I am SO pleased with it!  My sister has an Olympus digital that I have borrowed and it is great, so I went with an Olympus digital camera myself.  And, I am 100% sure I made the right decision.The price is very, very reasonable.  The quality of the photos are excellent.  I went to the zoo and took pictures of butterflies and animals and the pictures look professional.  The zoom is also excellent.  I took pictures of Buffalo that were far away and you wouldn't know it by looking at the photos I took.  It has a stabilization feature that you can set it on (on an easy to use \"wheel\" that you turn) that stops blurriness.  It also has 2 Macro settings for close up photos and super close up photos.  It is easy to use, lightweight, takes only 2 AA batteries (alkaline OR rechargeable), and takes high quality photos.I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.", "Date": "July 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Ups and Downs", "Author": "K.

My pictures came out beautiful and the camera is easy to use.The problems I have with it are:Without a viewfinder it is difficult to shoot in dark situations, the LCD screen can't show what you are viewing.

I just got back from a semester of studying abroad in Glasgow, Scotland. This was the reason I purchased the camera. It traveled with me to Italy, Norway, Belgium, France and England. And I took over 1500 pictures in those 3 months.The camera is a little short on features and it does some things better than others. It took some time to get used to it and figure out how to deal with the deficiencies and work with it. But once I learned these tricks, the camera took some OUTSTANDING pictures. I have been especially impressed with the sky in many pictures. The camera has been able to expose the foreground well and still pick up specific colors and good detail in the sky (which it seems many cameras have a problem with).I bought this camera, a 512mb memory card and a pack of rechargeable batteries and it was the best $200 i've ever spent. I am going to be applying for some photography internships and my portfolio will consist mostly of pictures taken with this camera.If you need a good camera and can't afford a high-end digital SLR or just want more features than this offers, you cannot choose a better camera than this.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "NonTechy Very Satisfied", "Author": "S.

It takes pretty good pictures and is pretty easy to use.However, the battery cover's latches are really small plastic pieces that are a part of the outer cover of the camera.  Because it eats up batteries pretty quickly with the LCD screen (covers almost 1/3 of the back of the camera), you have to change the AA batteries fairly often (rechargables recommended).  Over time, the little plastic latches seem to either wear out or just break off from friction with the cover.  When this happens, the camera becomes unusable. Because the batteries push against the cover, without one of the small plastic latches, the camera acts as though it's not getting enough power to take pictures.  You can still connect it to the computer to get the pictures off, but the lens won't stay open for you to take pictures.Apparently, this happens often with the Olympus FE models from a few years ago.  I read that a guy tried to get his FE-130 repaired for the same problem.  It was not covered under the warantee and would cost about $100 to fix.  (See the Olympus FE-130 for other accounts of the battery cover flaw.)Overall, this is a good, cheap camera that tool pictures well.
