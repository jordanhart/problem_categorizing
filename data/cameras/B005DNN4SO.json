{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon T3i with kit", "Author": "Soni", "ReviewID": "RX8GDZ01RFL6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recieved the shippment earlier then expected. Everything inside was as described and of good quality. Only drawback was the camera bag. Guys if you are buying this product with kit, be prepared to buy a seprate camera bag as the bag included in the kit is very small and will barely hold the camera with one lens attached to it. The spare battery included is of canon brand. Tripod looks sturdy though I have not tried it yet. Overall its a great bundle and worth the price.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dr. Company", "Author": "Gilbert Minionis \"Normal User\"", "ReviewID": "R7FCSJ0B7JFHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most consumers already know this camera is a real winner. It's ability to adjust for all sort of lighting conditions and pick the proper balance is really an amazing accomplishment of Canon.  But since this is well known, I will comment on the quality of the Willoughby bundle and service.  The package came a couple of days sooner than promised (yesss!) and all the goodies inside were of top notch quality.  The comfort of having two lenses for better specificity is very helpfull.  This bundle is \"all Canon\".  So no generic carrying case.  The extra battery is original Canon etc.Highly recommend.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Package", "Author": "Veneet Katyal \"VR\"", "ReviewID": "R183E1M7UCVJDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just love this package. Had everything one can think of for buying their 1st DSLR camera. All the items described are original/branded and I didn't had to spend a penny extra for buying anything else. received the camera package in 2 days from the date of order. I will surely look forward to buy other accessories from this dealer again.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005DNN4SO"}}
