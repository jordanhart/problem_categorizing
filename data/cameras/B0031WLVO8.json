This one also takes great pics; great color, great detail. Much improved. Downside: must remove battery for recharging; my old one had a much more convenient dock for recharging - liked that feature much better. Otherwise I'm happy with with my purchase.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera when the lens opens", "Author": "Joyce Downs", "ReviewID": "RMHLJ4SJIYE3E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I used this camera for one day, while on vacation, was terrific. The second day the lens would not open. I exchanged it a few days later. I used the replacement for one day and it was great. The next time I used it, the lens opened only after the butterfly flew away. It currently will not open. Lens error try again. I love the zoom. But, with the unreliable lens I must find an alternate camera. Hopefully, I can return this one.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Luv It!", "Author": "Andrea", "ReviewID": "R2E9NR0FWDL3SV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1 Rechargeable batteries = ***** 52 Small and attractive = ***** 53 Inexpensive = ***** 54 Over and above support for Eye-Fi = ***** 55 Decent features = **** 46 Picture quality = ***** 57 Ease of use = ***** 5I take an estimated 230 pictures a day about 340 days a year. This camera was purchased as a back up to a backup camera. Due to the features, ease of use, picture quality, and Extra Eye-fi support built in, it is now my main field work camera. It does take 2 batteries to get through the full day. With so many pictures taken daily, I will not even consider a camera without a rechargeable Lithium battery. The camera exceeded my expectations. This is number 2 bought for me. 5 Star", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "LooHoo99338", "ReviewID": "R228AR99S91MUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is everything I could hope for in a camera.

My previous Casio camera was a 7-megapixel unit that failed after several years of heavy use. This new camera is easy for me to use when making video clips.

It takes great pictures!  It does a lot of stuff!  I love how it uses battery backs instead of AA batteries!  The zoom works very nice!  The video quality is pretty decent!The only thing I can say is that if you're looking for a camera to take good HD video this isn't the best choice.  SD quality is EXCELLENT but the HD quality really looks no better than the SD quality.  It has a kind of grainy look to it and is widescreen format.All in all it's a great camera.  Personally, I paid extra for this model over other models because of its HD video modes.  Keep in mind the video quality isn't BAD but it isn't as good as some better models.However, for a sub $100 camera its quality is pretty decent.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "casio", "Author": "Kimberly A.

Then it started glitching where it would focus but not take the photo. this camera did that exact same thing after a few months.

Three months after purchase, I have multiple problems including (1) multiple lens errors (2) auto shutoff within seconds of power on (3) inability to zoom (4)sudden and severe overexposure no matter what the settings are.This is my 4th Casio Exilim and I have been very happy with all previous models.  They have proved sturdy and lasted until severe trauma was inflicted upon them (a dog ate two of them; I dropped the last one into water).  I have babied this camera, always carrying it in a case, never dropping it, and keeping it dry.Now I have to send it across country at my expense and also have to pay to have it returned.

The pictures taken were of decent quality - good focus and lighting. However, after 2 hours of using it for the first time, the photo capture button simply stopped working. When pressed it simply would do nothing. After talking to Casio technical support, I learned that there was nothing neither they nor I could do to fix it. I had no choice but to return it, (which was extremely inconvenient since I bought it for that specific weekend). So I would recommend the camera for a decent quality point and shoot for its price, but don't get it if you need it immediately, as it seems to have some technical difficulties.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14.1-megapixel resolution\n4x wide-angle optical zoom; 2.7-inch LCD screen\nNewly-developed EXILIM Engine 5.0\nMake composite images of different moving images with Dynamic Photo; Art Shot Function\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)\nBundled Accessories:   Rechargeable lithium ion battery, lithium ion battery charger, AC power cord, USB cable, AV cable, strap, CD-ROM", "Name": "Casio EX-Z550 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Zoom with CCD Shift Image Stabilization and 2.7 inch LCD (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xbzdGLVpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0031WLVO8"}}
