and faster fps performance. Just what I needed for my summer vacation!!! I followed all of the Olympus cleaning/locking instructions to ensure that it was watertight. However, the first day in the water (a family tubing trip) the camera leaked and died! Needless to say, I was rather unhappy and missed out on many great vacation photos. I exchanged the camera for a new one and unbelievably, the second one leaked too! I've uploaded a video of my second TG-610 if you're interested in seeing my experience with this camera.Interestingly, I submitted this review and my video to the Olympus website and received a response stating that my \"review did not meet our guidelines for posting\" on the site.  Needless to say, I'm done with Olympus after this experience.  (BTW: My Fuji survived 2 summers of atv'ing, swimming, and tubing without any issue...)", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great waterproof camera", "Author": "swimmer girl", "ReviewID": "R95ZE7QYS69PJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for vacation to Kauai.

I bought the camera with a underwater shell style case to make it even more waterproof and actually have never put it in the water without this case since there is no reason to risk it. Besides the below (pretty serious) issue the camera has been great.If you leave the camera for long periods of time between uses, you may run into this issue. The battery will be completely dead and when you plug it in to charge, it will turn on and off and the shutter will open and close and it won't charge. It will seem like its broken for good.I found that if you use an external charger to charge the battery, this issue will be fixed. It has something to do with allowing the battery to sit for a long time and loose its charge. I imagine buying a new battery would solve it too but then you might run into the same issue again. I know that this isn't ideal since you are having to spend $40 on a charger but this is cheaper than sending to Olympus to \"fix\" and hopefully it works as well for everyone else as it did for me.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good bang for the buck", "Author": "Auromelie", "ReviewID": "R244M2RJIIVOH2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A really nice camera it starts a bit slow but once is on it just goes...

I'm used to good quality images, fast autofocus, good low light capability, and generally getting decent shots without having to fight the camera for them. I was prepared to be unimpressed by this little Olympus.I was indeed impressed by it.It's small and easy to haul around in a pocket; maybe not as thin and light as cameras without the shock/water/etc. proofing, but with this one you don't have to worry about dropping it, getting it wet, or minor abuse bricking the thing. I admit I didn't go diving with this camera, but I did take it through several water rides at a theme park, and it came through with flying colors. Photos are surprisingly good, and the 14MP CMOS makes up for the \"mere\" 5x optical zoom... you can crop the image and still have a size that's more than large enough for most uses.Video capability is also surprisingly good for a point & shoot camera. I took a quick video and the audio and video quality is quite good (720p is plenty competent... most any HDTV can upscale from 720p to 1080p without any problems).Low light capability is mediocre... this is still a P&S; camera. It does have a bit of image stabilization, but that doesn't help much when your shutter time is 1/4 second. There's only so much you can ask of a P&S; lens.If you're looking for a camera you can always have with you when you're out running around, has very good image quality, and can withstand a reasonable amount of abuse, this may indeed be what you're looking for. It isn't going to replace a DSLR, but then, it doesn't have to.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Olympus Tough TG-610 Waterproof/shockproof...whatever", "Author": "M.

I wanted a durable, waterproof camera to stand up to snorkeling, tubing etc.  I followed every instruction on care and maintenance for the camera and making sure everything was locked and took it underwater twice in about 3 feet of water and then it quit working completely.  I figured there was a little leak so after letting it dry out, and charging it, I can take about 2 pictures before the battery dies and still can't see what I'm taking because the screen remains blank.  Very disappointed and do not recommend this camera for underwater use.  I'd go with the Fuji or Pentax.

I work on the Delaware River and this camera is perfect for this kind of job.  I have taken underwater photos and video and both are achieved with this camera.  Suggestions for underwater photo taking are to keep on auto or program which is what I do.  Disable the flash because the photo with flash will not come out great at all.  I have my ISO set to 800 or 1600 to get the blurring reduced because when your taking pictures of moving objects the higher ISO will get the photo captured quicker.  When wanting to take multiple shots in a row to capture the image you want half pressing the capture button on the camera will allow it to focus faster and will tell camera to go back to taking pictures when you have the preview after each photo activated.  This camera will take great pictures but video can be iffy but that is the case with cameras designed for photos, the video is secondary.  If you want good video get a camcorder.  The Olympus tends to refocus during videos which can be distracting but still allows you to enjoy the views captured.  We are not making movies that will be for sale so some faults are not a deal breaker.  I suggest using a 32gb class 10 sd card with this camera because you will get faster file transfers and a ton of photos fit on this size card (9,000+).  I find that the battery lasts comparable to other cameras I have used.  The fact that you have to charge the battery in the camera (unless you purchase battery charger separate) is not a deal breaker and also is helpful because now you won't forget the battery in the exterior charger on the wall when you grab your camera and go.  Wen taking long trips with my job I charge my camera between sites using my cigarette cell phone charger that has a USB port that allows me to charge the camera in the car to make sure I have plenty of battery life for awesome photos.  I would recommend buying the newest versions of this camera which currently is the TG-820 iHs.  My supervisor has this camera and it takes great photos and is much quicker than my camera and takes 1080p video as opposed to 720p on my version but that is to be expected with the newest technology.  Coming March 31st the Olympus TG-830 iHs is going on sale and will be my next purchase.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get underwater shots or photos/video in extreme environments.  Olympus recommends replacing the seals on these cameras every year to keep waterproof capabilities but I have yet to do so and it is still working in, out and under water.  I am not sure of the cost of this service but if it is too much money I would be more inclined to just buy a new camera since the cost is relatively low.

Roth", "ReviewID": "R3B39MVOZ330RM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had mixed feelings for this review.  Let me start with the general perceptions and fill in the dirty details later.I like the camera and it works very well for both general purpose point and shoot as well as its waterproof mode.  I have an older weatherproof camera, Pentax Optio W80, which has been used for several years.  We wanted a second one so the kids can run off with one and I hold on to the other.  It has good optical zoom, does not have fish-eye effect, simple menu system, and takes better low-light pics than the Pentax and other cheap cameras.  The only complaint I would have is that low-light is not great, but better than average cameras.  It does good with average indoor lighting and fantastic everywhere else.  I especially like being able to configure my photo mode settings, click on the movie button to take a video, and then switch back to photo mode with settings retained -- great with kids!  I was using a 32GB SD card with this too, no issues.  I did not have any issues with battery life either, was good for a trip to the beach, to a few museums, and general stuff in the middle.We bought it for a two week vacation. It worked great for us on and off the beach, in the pool, and everywhere between.  On day 10 of the trip the wide zoom button stopped working, next day the tele stopped, and finally later that day the entire rear panel quit working -- all buttons.  That said, it still took pictures, just no settings or movie mode was available.  I did buy a refurbished one, so it could be a side-effect of that.  For this issue, I docked it a star.Aside from this issue, there are few complaints.  From what is in the box, the only way to charge it is to open the access panel and hook up the USB cable to charge.  This puts the camera out of use unless you buy a kit like I did, extra battery and charging unit.I am shipping this back for a full refund and definitely plan to replace it with another of the same model.  I like the photo quality, features, and would still recommend.
