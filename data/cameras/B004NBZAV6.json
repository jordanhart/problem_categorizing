Not only is the quality of pictures is awesome, but it has dozens of different modes of pictures and movies. It is very quick. Unlike my other cameras which were more expensive then this, this camera adjusts focus instantly when moving and zooming. Stabilizer is great even for shaky hands. Not to mention this Projector. I mean a projector in camera??? what will they think of next. It is a great quality projector for this price. This is a great party trick and the projection can get really big - like a big screen tv.I love this camera more then any of the cameras Ive had before!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "abrandt", "ReviewID": "RJE9YP8GV53DH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been needing a Pico projector and a Camera and WOW I found this.. For the $99 price it is soooo worth it and  even would have considered it at it's $300 price. Takes great pics and movies.. I have not tried to put my own movies on it yet and hope it plays them well too. The only drawback is it only supports 16g SD cards :( wish it would upto 64g.. It doesnt weigh anymore than any other camera I have ever had it is actually lighter IMO.. Great size easy to navigate all in all very surprised at this unique camera..", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Cool, but not Very Clear", "Author": "\"unknown\"", "ReviewID": "R212L2W1ZN1HT3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a total beginner and thought this would be a good entry level camera to take more interesting photos than a phone can. I find that the zoom is much better than what I have on my camera but close up pictures are comparable or worse (I have a pretty cheap 8mp camera phone and don't use it that much). Unfortunately, many of the pictures of even slow-moving subjects (like my pet cat) were blurry, even on the modes that were designed to take pictures of moving subjects. This is incredibly frustrating. I don't know if someone more experienced would be able to better control the camera.The projection feature was indeed very cool and quite a bit of fun (the cats were perplexed by the images of themselves lol!) but too blurry to really show off any pictures. It's still a really cool feature and the main reason I chose this camera over others and while I wasn't expecting it to be as sharp as the advertising images, it didn't come even close. Disappointing but still an interesting feature.The reason I ultimately returned it is because it didn't charge in the wall. First I tried the wall charger from the box which is actually designed to charge the fan to cool the projector when in use and so it comes with an extender cord that can plug into the camera (the fan has a circular input, the camera has a USB-like input). This did not work at all, I would see it flash quickly from blue battery icon, which I assume means charge, to the red low battery icon because the extender cord was obviously not well connected. Then I tried plugging the USB cord into a USB charger and it would display a loading bar and then said \"Connection Failed.\" The only place it would charge was my computer. This is inconvenient since I don't leave the computer running all night and it's quite bulky to keep attached to a laptop during the day. For the short time I did charge it, it seemed to have decent battery life. If you keep your computer on all night, I guess this wouldn't be an issue for you.Overall, the camera seems okay and the projection is fun but there were too many issues for me to continue with it.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great product especially the projector function", "Author": "Thanapat Jindavanich \"Poppuhaha\"", "ReviewID": "R2U2S8I5DSPOLU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is great for my work because I didn't have to carry with me a big projector to give a presentation at customer's site anymore.

The quality of the pictures was great.  Some pictures came out as shaky, but that was my fault.  I bought additional batteries, as this requires special batteries, so I can't just carry a pack of AA batteries with me.  Overall I am pleased.
