I like the auto setting and the other scene setting work great. I havn't taken a bad shot either. I like the rapid fire button on top of the camera because I take lots of pictures of my dogs and they don't sit still for a minute.The other day I was watching QVC and there was a guy talking about digi cams. He explained what the closeup/macro feature does. Its great for taking real closeup pictures of butterflies, lady bugs, or flowers with out disstoring the picture. Now that I know what it does I am going to try it out.The only compliant I have is the batteries don't last long. A friend suggested purchasing digital electronics batteries. They do last far better than standard batteries.

I purchased this one for her for Christmas.  The basic function buttons on this camera are clearly marked (far better than the Disney cameras I bought for her younger brothers) and she quickly mastered them, before moving on to experiment with the additional functions.  The menus were easy for her, though we had to explain what some of the words were as they were above her reading level.  In spite of her care, it got dropped on the tile floor with sufficient force that the battery compartment opened and the batteries fell out.  We returned the batteries, and all was well.  Although the pictures may not be perfect quality for enlarging, the 4x6 snapshots are certainly family photograph album and share with friends quality.  Before giving it to her, I put in a 1 GB SD card and installed rechargeable batteries (and charged up an extra set).  We had to change the two AA batteries once over the course of Christmas day.  Based on the use on Christmas, a charger and four batteries (which allows for one change during the course of a day) should be sufficient for all but the unusually prolific picture taker.  We did put the non-rechargable batteries in her camera case (purchased separately) in case of emergencies.  The ability to use AA batteries in a great advantage, as it does allow you to purchase more batteries at the nearest store if necessary.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good basic camera, pretty much idiot proof", "Author": "E.

It's simpl eto figure out how to use, the multiple settings cover any occasion of picture takeing. I love that it runs on AA batteries. I bought a cheap compact battery charger coming with four rechargable batteries so all i have to do is keep both sets charged in my camera case (i don't keep the batteries in the camera to keep both safe and leaving batteries in there takes some of their charge) so wheni want 2 use my camera i put one set in and if that set runs out (but the set lasts a good long while) i have the other set at my disposal and start chargeing the dead batteries at the 1st outlet. this solved any problems that might have happened with short battery life for me. the only other problem is the delay from when you push the button to the actual picture takeing. However in this delay it focuses the picture for you so ur shots almost always turn out well and in focused, as opposed to a friends camera who does not have the delay but it takes many more tries to get a focused one.I LOVE THIS CAMERA AND RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE, especially first time digital camera users.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "satisfied customer", "Author": "E.

Taylor", "ReviewID": "R26ANUOOHV8349", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, others have had their say, so let me just add this. How can anyone in the 21st century make a camera that can't be used as though it were a usb disk drive. My first kodak digital camera was this dumb, but now, 10 years later I see these fools still don't understand how the rest of the world works. I don't want to have to install their stupid software, what if I'm not at home and want to load my pics on another machine. I guess I have to carry around an sd card reader.Also, 1.45 volt alkaline batteries wouldn't even turn this puppy on. I had to use brand new 1.55 volt batteries. I'm thinking of returning this if I can since, naturally none of my 1.25-1.35 volt nimh rechargeables would work either.Just to be sure, I put the 1.45 batteries into a standard 2 D cell flashlight (by using AA to D adapter shells) and it's as bright as anything brand new. And if you know flashlights you know the brightness is a very good measure of how much voltage the batteries can put out when in a circuit - even better than using a meter, unless you put a load on or use a special battery circuit with a load. So, if batteries this good won't even budge this camera, then forgetaboutit!After trying many batteries, it is possible that this is just my camera, but other's seem to have had the same problems. So, I can't say if this is an un-feature of this camera, or if mine is just overly sensitive to the input voltage.Oh, one more issue. They keep mentioning an a/v out, but there really isn't one. They imply you can hook directly to a tv, but you can't. All there is is a usb port, so you'd still have to install their software, and use that to transfer the files (instead of simply drag/drop) and then if you have a tv that can hook up to a computer, then you could show the pictures or videos on the tv. They act like you can just hook up a pair of a/v cables to the camera and the tv. I'd have to say someone screwed da pooch here. I don't think they are referring to the docking station connector either, as that is not where they point and say a/v out in the manual. The manual also says that it outputs either ntsc or pal. Either way, I can't find out how and they don't show any pictures of any a/v outputs.I bought this here for a low price of under $60 and even then I wouldn't buy it had I known better.", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good starter camera", "Author": "Colorado Hermit \"ColoradoHermit\"", "ReviewID": "R1CVV1561OP4F8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for almost a year now and it has been a pretty sweet little camera. It's easy to use with simple selection controls. It takes nice detailed pictures in just about any situation with just using the auto setting.  The main thing that I don't like about it is the lack of image stabilization. It takes a very steady hand to get good clear pictures without any blurring. Especially when using the optical zoom. I found the best way to consistently get nice clear pictures is to use the 2 second delay and mount the camera on a mini tripod to use as a handle to hold the camera with. The draw back with this is that you have to remember to set the delay before each shot and it only works well for still shots. It doesn't do well for action shots. It has a time lag so when things are moving, from the time you press the button till it takes the picture what you wanted the picture of has moved out of the shot. I found that I have to use \"Kentucky Windage\" and lead the subject (like hunting with a shotgun) to get the picture I want. And the little view finder on mine is way off from what the lens is. So I have to use the screen to line up my picture.  For taking just about any kind of pictures with it I always mount it on my mini tripod first. I'm a big man, 6'4\" and 215 pounds, so I have some BIG hands. This camera is a little small for me to handle and keep my big fingers out of the way so the little tripod works great for me to hold it with.  Another drawback on this camera is the delicate door or cover that you have to open to access the memory card and to plug the patch cord into it. I don't have a lot of money and the camera dock seemed an unneeded expense just to load the pictures into my computer. So I'm always extra careful with my big fingers when I'm trying to open or close the little door/cover on the side of the camera. The access cover for the batteries isn't much better. I just know one of these days I'm going to brake one or the other.  For taking close-ups of things I'm amazed at the details that it will get. I've had a lot of fun taking extreme closeups of different things with it. Some I have used as backgrounds when working with my pictures on my computer. The details and colors that it gets when taking close ups of flowers is fantastic.  I have always liked taking pictures but the high cost of film and developing was more than I could pay. I love the idea of taking all the pictures I want without any extra expense. I have over 3500 pictures from this little camera stored on my computer now. And making my own prints with my computer/printer is way better too.  The Kodak picture software that came with the camera is OK, but it's pretty limited with what it will let you do with your pictures. I'm still looking for the program that does everything I want it to do. So far the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10 is the one that I use the most.  So as a starter camera to try getting into digital photography I don't think you could do much better than this one. It has it's drawbacks but for the price and for what it can do it has been a sweet little camera.", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Easy to use and inexpensive, poor screen", "Author": "Gladys Rueda \"Josgla\"", "ReviewID": "RIU08TVO6CD4L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is very solid and easy to use, It has almost the funcionality of the others products and the price is low.

A great camera for a teen or anyone who needs to get used to taking digital pictures.  The only problem with this camera is that it eats batteries.  I would suggest purchasing rechargeable batteries.  Also my daughter's camera only lasted a little over a year, and then it broke.  When I took it to a camera shop to see if it could be repaired, they told me the computer chip was damaged due to age, and would cost more to replace it than to buy a new one.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buy This Great Camera !!!

I love it. I hardly ever used it until I went to FL over the 2007 Christmas Holday. I went to Disneyworld and this camera fulfilled my expectations and more. I took still pictures and video with it. Mind you I bought a Memory card as without one you cant hold many picutures or videos. I never ran out of memory and the pics and videos were great !!! The only negative thing I have to say is the batteries sure go fast. I am thankful now that I had invested in an Energizer battery charger with rechargable batteries. I used the rechargeable batteries taking pictures in NYC and they lasted much longer than the regular batteries!!

We had it for about 13 months, and so it was not under warranty, and it would have cost more to fix it than it was worth, so we just tossed it.We went ahead and bought another one though, because it had great features for the $$ I think it's good quality and it's easy to use. I like the menu and the ease of use, and the picture quality is good. I looked at a lot of other cameras in the same price range, and this one seemed to offer more and have a better zoom. We've had it for several months, and So far so good, no lens problems. If the same thing fails on this one, then I doubt I buy it again.., but since my kids dropped the last one a few times I didn't think it was fair to blame Kodak.From my reasearch, as well as some of the cameras that my friends/family own..,I think when compared to other cameras in the same price range, this one is superior in quality of photos, features, zoom, and ease of use. If your willing to go up a little in price, check the Minolta. Overall I've been happy with this camera.., it's done all we need it to.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!! Recomend to anyone", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R14RDAFYUZ4OZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera (along with a 1 GB SD card) for my birthday and took  it with me to the Czech Republic. I took over 200 beautiful pictures and I can still fit 500 more. The software that comes with this camera is pretty easy to use and you can make albums that can be transferred onto the camera to organise your photos.I think the photo quality is pretty good. And the display is pretty good, it's bright and clear. The only bad thing about it was that if you took a blury picture you couldn't tell it was that blurry from the display because it's not that big(only if you magnify the photo a lot) But it's not that bad because you could just take more then one picture of an object and you can delete it later. You can also tell when the photo is extremely blurry.This camera has many great features such as special modes like party, children, snow, and firework modes that work pretty well, I haven't tried them all but the ones that I have tried , worked pretty well. Another great thing on this camera is the video mode that suprisingly works really well and makes pretty good quality video. Another cool feature is the burst mode where you take 3 simultanious pictures each second. For a cheap camera this camera is great bang for the buck. It's also pretty small and works on 2 AA batteries.The only other complaint I have for this camera is that the start up time is really long and the batterys don't last that long so it's a good idea to buy recharchable batteries and have a lot of extra batteries handy. That is why I give it 4 stars. I also haven't really tried any other 5 meg cameras at this price so I don't have much comparaison.

The photo make look in focus in the viewfinder, put upon printing, the focus was soft  (using a Kodak EasyShare printer dock series 3). You probably will never use \"5 megapixels\".  If you print normal 4 x 6 inch snapshots you will most liekly use a \"cropped\" 3:2 setting that is 4.4 megapixels (interpolated).  There is a huge time lag while the camera records the picture to the SD Card.  Very annoying.  Don't be in a hurry to take another picture.  The litte viewfinder is useless.

Worse yet, is if you don't want to use they're stupid software you're outa luck as it doesn't show as a drive that you can access. All and all go for a Canon (like I have at home).

Everything else worked, menu, flash,  photo review, lens, etc, but no image on screen, and no image if photo was taken.
