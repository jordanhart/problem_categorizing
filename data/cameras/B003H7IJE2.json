It took great pictures, only drawback that I see is the flash range, it is very hard to get real close to the fish, but 5-6 feet they turned out good. The included software does a great job on enhancing the underwater pictures. We had no problems with water intursion, and the battery lasted longer than we did each trip into the water. I would definately recommend playing with the focus settings, specifically the maual focus, finally figured it out after several tries at getting pictures of spiders. I was happy with the package from Bigvalue, had plenty of room on the memory card and the extra battery is a definate must.Under water or on land 95% of out pictures turned out great, about the same as the Kodak easy share we also use. Lacks a little quality in low light conditions, and more optical zoom would be nice, and getting used to where the power button and shoot buttons are. ( I sometimes would turn it off when  taking a picture)but over all for what this camera was designed for I really like it. I would recommend it.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "THIS IS MY 3RD", "Author": "PETER", "ReviewID": "R28Y2JS1FIYDT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IT'S AN EXCELENT CAMARA, THIS WOULD BE MY THIRD, THE FIRST ONE A W10, WAS WITH ME FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS, IT WAS DAMAGED BECAUSE SOMEONE PUT IT IN THE WATER WITHOUT CLOSING IT PROPERLY, THIS WAS FIXED ON THE W80, WHICH I BOUGHT WITH A 25% DISCOUNT BECAUSE OF THE FIRST.

The camera is small and compact, which is great, but the screen is so small, it is very difficult to see what you are shooting at under water.  The picture quality is good but not excellent, and all in all I wish I would have purchased a different camera ... particularly for the price.  Two of my friends had CoolPix underwater cameras, and both of them have much better photos than what I ended up with ... shooting the same subject(s).", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "what a deal!", "Author": "crowbody", "ReviewID": "ROTHHTWIL9VIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first of all this is an awesome camera. its been with me around the world several times. it needs no special case or pampering, i just clip it to my belt and let it bang around, its fine. takes nice pictures above water and beneath. the film quality is not that of say a gopro but this is a far more versatile camera. i highly recommend the camera and if you can get it with this package, even better. loved all the freebies in here, the extra battery is nice even though the batteries hold thier charge very very well. get it. you wont regret it.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera", "Author": "Bethany", "ReviewID": "R2B4VJB78TSK48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my husband that is in the water all of the time.
