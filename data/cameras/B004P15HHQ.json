Otherwise it's Sony at it's best; crisp, clear sound with no distortion, hum or static.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extra Bass Headphones", "Author": "Rick Weber", "ReviewID": "RH4FHXK9W1YRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have Bose noise canceling headphones. They are far superior to Sony's, so I was reluctant to buy these Sony Extra Bass Headphones, but they are fantastic.  None of that high pitched hiss that the noise canceling Sonys have.  Great even without the extra amplifier that hasn't arrived yet.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004P15HHQ"}}
