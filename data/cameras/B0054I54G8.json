{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Alpha SLT-A35", "Author": "Dave R", "ReviewID": "R1Z9WJB3ERE4QN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony Alpha SLT-A35 16 MP Digital SLR Kit with Translucent Mirror Technology and 18-55mm LensI've had the Sony SLT-A35 for a couple of weeks now and after some testing and two in the field photo shoots, I think I'm ready to review it.  I'll outline Pros, Cons and Matters of Preference.Pros:The photo quality is very good, what you would expect from a 16MP camera.The colors seem accurate and true to me.While the menu system is fairly deep, it seems well organized.  Key features (Shutter Speed, F-Stop, WB, ISO, Bracketing/Self Timer, Screen Display Toggle, Focus Zoom) all have buttons within easy reach.  A programable button can be set for easy access to one of many additional feature sets like HDR, Filter Effects, etc.If you use Auto Focus, it is extremely fast.  Manual focusing is a snap and the 7.5X and 15X focusing zoom helps a great deal for distance details.While the battery life isn't great, compared to reviews of the A33 and A55, it is improved.  I was able to shoot for about 4 hours and still had about 30% of the battery charge remaining.  Still, a second battery just in case seems like a must.The 18-55mm kit lens (SAL1855) seems solid as an all purpose lens.Cons:Biggest flaw so far is lack of Camera RAW support from Adobe/Lightroom.  The Image Data Converter SR software that comes with the camera is lacking at best.  I'm shooting everything in RAW + JPG so that I have something to play with until the RAW files are useable.There is a strange chromatic effect through the EVF when the camera moves or even when you blink.  It's somewhat mild and I've gotten used to seeing it pretty quickly, but it was startling at first.I haven't captured a quality image with the Panoramic sweep after about 20 attempts.  The file size is around 3MB, so it's capturing significantly less data than even a fine JPG at full resolution.Matters of Preference:The camera body is very light.  People taking the camera on long treks will probably find this to be beneficial as every ounce of weight you can shed matters.  Those who like a more substancial feeling in their hands as they shoot may see that differently.So far this camera is near useless for Infrared Photography.  It lets through very little IR light.  With a 720nm filter on a bright sunny day, a 4-5 second exposure shows almost no IR light.  Adding a ND 8 filter allowed for longer exposure time but very little additional IR light.  What you get is a very orange cast image with proper IR sky but foliage retains it's greens.  With a 950nm filter, finally IR light came through but on the same bright, sunny day, an exposure of 1 minute or more was necessary.  It's very difficult to get quality IR shots over that long a shutter.  If you don't shoot in IR, this is a non issue, obviously.Conclusion:I'm very satisified with the camera.  Although it's IR capabilities are non existent so I have to carry my old setup out on shoots I may want to do IR work on, the image quality and basic functionality of this camera are spot on.  The annoyances will either be sorted out soon (Adobe RAW support) or are in the extra features that are non-essential.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best entry-level camera, missed a few features", "Author": "Szu-ping Lee \"Ping\"", "ReviewID": "R86MM474CT6G6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The primary advantage of A35 over A55 except price(price difference is $100 at this point) is the overheating issue with A55. A35 being a second-generation model using Sony's 16.2mp sensor, Sony claim the improved version is more efficient, hence has longer battery life and less heat. Other than this, A55 is a more feature packed camera. Except the obvious feature differences (articulating screen, GPS, continuous shooting speed...) you can find on major camera review website, here are the minor ones:1. No support for the wireless remote (infrared), Noted both the description on Amazon and Sonystyle.com state the RM-DSLR1 infrared remote works with A35. IT DOESN'T!! it is one feature missing from A55 you don't see anywhere. Not that it is critical, but this should be noted and corrected.2. No digital levelIn the end, I don't think I will return the A35 for an A55, even though the price difference is only $100 and much more were packed into A55. In my opinion, an A56 with the heat issue fixed but retains all the A55 feature and price point will be killer. But since that is not available at this point, I would settle for A35 without the overheating problem over A55.[Update]After owning this camera for about 2 months and several hiking trips, I can attest that A35 is a solid performer, lightweight with output quality rivaling cameras costing $1500. When you think about the same/similar Sony 16.2mp sensor is used in Nikon D7000 and Pentax K5 (both are about $1500 at this point), the $700 A35 is truly a great bargain. Things I like most are its: LCD resolution (921k is just so clear), responsiveness, lightweight. What can be improved upon are: battery life, somewhat grainy EVF. I really shouldn't complain given its price point.By the way, you can get excellent Minolta AF mount lenses for your Sony Alpha camera. I recommend, as a new user, Minolta 50mm 1.7 (or Sony DT 50mm 1.8) for A35. Both are inexpensive (Minolta used can be had for well under 100), but very useful for low light photography. The image quality is amazing. Plus, they are compact and fit well to the A35 body. People often recommend Minolta 70-210 F4 (beercan) and 28-105 (secret handshake). All of these are solid, inexpensive lenses with low price.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "almost perfect entry-level DSLR (SLT)", "Author": "Tengo", "ReviewID": "R1TVWYZC2PA08Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony alpha slt-a35 is certainly one of the best camera under 800$. it has bunch of cool features and neither of them will disappoint you.I want to start with \"multiframe noise reduction\".(this is iso setting and you can choose any iso up to 25600) this is the feature that gives you 1-2 stops advantage when shooting at night without tripod. It works amazingly (takes 6 pictures sequentially and then micro-aligns them). even when subject is moving you can get very decent results.. sweep panorama is very funny and really useful feature. Despite that a35 has the best dynamic range among its rivals and DRO(dynamic range optimizer) is very effective, sometimes its necessary to use hdr and sony-s auto-hdr will give you excellent result.  many people complain that the body of camera is too small or lightweight and they don't lie, but i havn't seen anything more comfortable before. If you have extra large hands maybe it will be distracting but for normal sized hands (or smaller) holding the camera is a big pleasure. You can control everything rapidly, all the buttons are there where they should be. controlling your camera gets even faster with using elecrtonic viewfidner. The EVF is really great and in terms of visibility almost matches the ovf-s we have seen in other entry level dslr-s and outperforms them in any other aspect, at first its larger (1.1x vs 0.78x magnification) and has 100% coverage vs 95% of competitors. You can do everything without taking eye from viewfinder and this really matters. I found manual focus magnification very helpful. To be honest before I got my a35 I used to say that I'd like to have an ovf rather than evf, but now i must say i can't imagine living without EVF.  Of course the most important thing is image quality of camera. I must say the 16mp exmor-R sensor is really excellent, 2000$ nikon-d7000 has the same sensor and with this everything is said.image quality of raw files are perfect and jpegs are also very good (sometimes strong NR of sony is very annoying). Metering is almost unmistakable, colors are true and dynamic range is excellent as I've already  mentioned.  Hight iso performance is best-in-class and it gets far better with multiframe iso. Video is great, although there are limited control but its enough for most I think. Phase detection AF during video (and stills) works amazingly you cant see same thing in any camera of other manufacturer.  image stabilisation (steadyshot inside) does job very well. you'll get sharp images even in 1/2 second at 18mm and good thing is that lenses without stabilisation costs less.  Battery life isn't as bad as predecessor's, I usually take up to 500 image per charge, its pretty good result since there isn't OVF and sensor always has to work.  Overall a35 is excellent all-round performer, it has great IQ, great features and bunch of advantages that gives translucent mirror technology.cons:  Nose Reduction cant be turned off in jpegs.  automatic white balance could be better (but it isn't worse than competitors)  kit lens feels very \"plastically\" (but optically its very good)  no digital level gauge (we have seen in previous models a33/a55)  no switching button between raw/jpeg. (many cool features works only with jpeg so you often have to switch between raw and jpg)  sensor gets only 70% of incoming light (because translucent mirror doesn't move)  EVF visibility isn't great in lowlight (there's significant noise but not so much to worry about)overall a35 is certainly one of the best camera for the price, it delivers everything that promises and I hardly recomend it for everyone who is looking for entry-level dslr with excellent image quality and many cool features.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this camera except for one problem.", "Author": "Serious Sam", "ReviewID": "RO8KRZWH4GCOV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is not extensive but does cover what I consider the most important pros/cons I discovered during my time with the Sony a35.  I did not test the video performance, so all comments below are about photos.I really like SteadyShot, Sony's in camera image stabilization (IS).  This means you can use lenses without built in IS, such as primes, and still benefit from stabilization.  SteadyShot is actually one of the main reasons I bought this camera.This camera is small.  My pinky barely fits on the body (with effort) and I would consider my hands medium size.  If you have large hands and want a full grip, this is not the camera for you.  But small hands would likely find this camera perfect.  The small body also means it is light weight which is nice for carrying around.The menu system is intuitive.  I had no problems finding the settings I needed.  Available buttons and placement also seemed fine to me.I read several expert reviews which were all good.  A couple of reviews praised it for great ISO performance while some others considered the ISO noise to be high.  It turns out ISO performance was a problem I discovered in my own testing.  I was replacing a Canon EOS XSi with this camera and so was able to do some comparison shots of the same subject under the same lighting conditions.  I was shocked that the Canon produced less noise at all ISO's.  Even at ISO 200 noise was evident.  It was more than a small difference.  The comparisons were of RAW files without noise reduction.  In JPEG's the a35 apparently does some heavy noise reduction which could explain why some reviews actually said it had great ISO performance.  Unfortunately, an increase in noise reduction means a decrease in detail.The a35 produces very pleasing colors and does of good job with auto white balance.  These are improvements over my old XSi.  In the end, I returned the camera because I really need good ISO performance.  I now have a Nikon d5100 which has low ISO noise and also produces pleasing colors and white balance.If you shoot RAW and need to use moderately high ISO's (400 to 1600), I do not recommend the a35.  However, if you shoot JPEG in good lighting conditions, you're likely to be very happy with it.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "A camera you can use to grow your photography knowledge, but at the same time you will never outgrow the camera.", "Author": "paul kramer", "ReviewID": "R8KGJTHK6QGC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera! I added a few photos I took to the gallery. A little about me: I got into photography after two close friends both bought Nikon D90 dslr's.  I'm in no way a professional, and still learning the ups and downs to confidently used full manual mode, but even with built in scenes and modes you can take pictures that people would think a professional took.  I wanted to change it up a little bit, and researched the SLT-a35. I liked the new translucent mirror technology, where instead of a flipping aparatus there is a translucent mirror that reflects light to the image sensor AND the Autofocus Sensor, allowing you to take shots at not only at a faster speed, but clearly focused.I found out the a33 and a55 had some sensor overheating issues when recording video for extended periods and warm temperatures, partially to do with why they introduced the a35 and a65 in the first place.  If you compare specs from the original a33 to a35, you'll find it also has better battery life.  Other reviewers have also complained about senor overheating, but lets be realistic here - IT'S A PHOTO CAMERA FIRST, VIDEO CAMERA SECOND.  If you are going to record 30 + minutes of video, then get a video camera.  Short clips up to 10 minutes have worked just fine for me. I use the camera with an external Tascam condenser mic (a35 has external mic plugin) to record youtube music videos for me and my acoustic guitar.  If you use the onboard mic, you WILL hear some noise from the camera focusing unless you are at a place where the noise is at a substantial level.A GOOD MID RANGE CAMERA! I'm one of those people that when buying something expensive opt to buy something in the mid range. Having owned Sony a bridge camera, or superzoom camera, I found it silly to buy a entry level dslr (such as a100,200,330,390) because entry level had the same features, NO live view, NO video mode, but better photos.  So jump to mid range.  The good thing about this camera is it has many photo scenes and settings, allowing you to play with the different settings.  When you select a mode or a scene it gives a brief description of the purpose of those settings - allowing you to learn about your camera and what modes produce the type of photo you want to create.Sweep Panorama - AMAZING. I've used it for outdoor scenery and indoor settings.  The 18-55mm lens works best for tighter panoramics, the 55-200mm lens works well for landscape panoramic with distant features. Just keep it level, and go slow.  I'll also point out that if you press menu while in panoramic mode and scroll down, you can adjust the panoramic to be the normal wide, or a wider width.  The wider width creates some great effects when used inside.Overall, get this camera.  It is straight forward enough to use just like you would with a point and shoot in auto modes, but has enough built in modes, scenes, and effects to allow you to grow your knowledge as a photographer.  If you set yourself up with some accessories like lenses, tripods and filters, then you have all the tools necessary to simply take great photos, or to allow to you to explore your photo creativity.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!

I needed a new camera to take on vacations so I did not need to bring my big, bulky pro equipment with me internationally. Just for kicks I tried some of the auto night settings in a estuary (not to be rude, but in case you don't know it's a body of water full of organisms) that was behind our dinner restaurant on a pier. You could SEE THE JELLYFISH!! This camera takes multiple shots and puts them together in 1 shot to give you the best of everything. To get the right color and balance of this estuary at night and especially considering the shot was in shadow, I would have taken way more time and effort adjusting my manual settings then I wanted to spend as we walked to dinner. In 3 seconds I got the shot and nobody is the wiser I didn't take the time or effort to do it manually. The only complaint is that the night auto setting has a little bit of movement visible unless you use a tripod (it is taking at least 3 shots in a row to create just one anyways). For a travel camera I'd give it a B+, I even acquired a new (random) client while on this international vacation because they found out what I do for a living. They asked if I would shoot wedding pics for their destination wedding (instead of the less-experienced resort photographer), and I felt confident enough to say yes. I can't imagine I ever would have said that with my old travel camera. They walked away happy and I walked away with extra vacation money!

Now it's up to me developing my knowledge of basic photography and getting some time behind the viewfinder to even attempt to extract the potential this camera has.  I'd say the biggest cons are the autofocusing noise during video recording and the lack of a articulated screen.  Even then, I think for the money this is a great buy.

I bought it after buying the Sony HX100V superzoom and discovering how well it works.  I sold my Olympus DSLR and all its lenses and figured I'd be as happy with the A35 as I am with the HX100V.Don't want to write a long essay duplicating all the \"pro\" comments to date, but I'm most intrigued with the HDR and image \"stacking\" capabilities for low noise.  Very enthusiastic about the fast auto focus, great image stabilization, and low light performance.  Although the translucent mirror loses some incoming light, that loss does not show in the low light performance.  In the Amazon images I posted a shot I casually took in my driveway of Orion's Belt using a Sony 75-300 kit lens and no tripod.  You can see the 3 Belt stars and as well a few background objects that I couldn't see with my eye.  The background is inky black - no confetti color noise at all.  Looking forward to using the A35 with my telescopes.In the \"con\" department, I wish the A35 had an articulated LCD viewfinder.  I fairly frequently use that on my other cameras such as the HX100V.  Also, the EVF is noisy in low light.  It fools you since the actual stored image will not have any of that noise.  The EVF is handy for aiming the camera but not so much for making detailed judgements.  That's fine.  Also, you should buy an extra battery or two.  The battery life is acceptable, but particularly when shooting video, the juice goes pretty fast.  I have the original and two spares.  The OEM charger is pretty slow.I can strongly recommend the A35.

It takes extremely fine photographs and does HD or normal video and has built in HDR and panoramic modes. The 16.2 MP chip has fabulous resoultion. The Dynamic Range Optomizer does a great job of getting shadow and highlight details in the cathredrals. I honestly have nothing bad I can say about this camera's technical ability. However the ergonomics are another matter.This camera is smaller than the A100 and does not fit in the hand properly. There is only room for about two fingers in the grip and honestly, whoever decided to move the control wheel so it faces forward instead of on a 45 degree angle should be shot. It makes turning the control wheel extremely uncomfortable. You are always having to search for the wheel with your finger. The on-off switch, which is rarely used, is where the control wheel should be so they have placed the least used control in the most important position. Truly a bad mistake which I sincerely hope they correct in later models. This is far too good a camera to have this kind of ergonomic short comings.I thought I would have trouble using the LCD viewfinder but I'm getting used to it. It does not have the resolution of the LCD screen on the back of the camera so it does take a little getting used to but after using the camera for a couple of weeks, I don't find it as distracting as I thought I would.This is a great camera overall.

Found a good deal on a Used-Like New model on Amazon. I haven't tested extensively, but I like the single color settings and the menu arrangement. The smile triggered shutter setting seems a little hit and miss, but I was just playing around with it and haven't read the instructions to see if I was using it incorrectly (I wasn't holding the camera in a normal shooting position). This camera body is smaller than the a230, and I seem to be one of the few people who is not a fan of cameras getting smaller resulting in less room to hold the camera without accidentally hitting some of the controls, but it wasn't even immediately noticed, so not a deal breaker by any means. I'm just a hobbyist shooting for fun. Anybody in that class or maybe a little higher would be very pleased with this camera.UPDATE: I returned this camera after about a month due to consistent underexposure and soft focus issues. My a230 model was taking obviously sharper pictures with same settings and shooting with same lens. I'm assuming it was just this particular camera, but have not made any replacement to compare yet. Really did like the features and Amazon was superb with the return.

It is compact, light in weight, and loaded with functions that will likely delay their understanding of photographic principles. It captures RAW, RAW+JPEG, JPEG. If you have any intent of digital darkroom work, RAW format is essential. It also captures HD video at 60 fps.( I suggest you use Serif software for the HD editing.) The advantage of this (Sony) system is the availability of purchasing used Minolta Maxxum autofocus lenses for a song.  Minolta optics can be superb  (go to[...] for lens reviews). As the Minolta system was sold to Sony some years ago and is the basis of Sony's current photographic system, the lenses are interchangeable.The deficit of the camera is its digital viewfinder.

I have had it for 6 months now, since I still have not learned to use it well I get high noise in my indoor photos, even at 400. But I'm working on it, the DAvid Busch book for it is very good so far and I can see its not necessarily a camera issue. I have problems with indoor photos, sometimes they are sharp but they have this orange \"glow\" or \"tint\" that I cannot get rid off, my friend's Canon Rebel t3 did not show this issue, I will appreciate any advice about it.I have small hands, for me this is a perfect fit, I held several Nikon and Canon cameras about the same price range, and I cannot hold them comfortably, especially if I'm trying to switch between settings. Since I'm a baby level photographer I also like it has short explanations when you switch between options. I definitely love the built-in stabilization and the 7fps (at max. speed), I like to take family photos, and for me its a must. I usually frown upon cameras with very high Megapixels, since for most people no more than 10 are needed, but I have noticed sometimes I do need to crop a lot of the image, and then those 16MP come really handy!Since I'm considering to get a couple of lenses, I'm glad I can order old Minolta ones for a lot less than Canon/Nikon lenses. If you are a beginners, do invest in a good manual like David Busch's, since Sony its fairly new to this segment, its a little hard to find help for specific set up questions.Update:The orange \"glow\" in indoors conditions can be \"removed\" if you play around with your exposure settings and/or white balance, the camera can do its own white balance calculations using the function menu. Images are sharp and it works well with Minolta lenses from the 80's (I even found one for $14!).", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value, awesome features, incredible performance", "Author": "J.

I'm very impressed by it's low-light performance. I miss the optical view finder, but the speed of focus and shooting more than make up for it. I can see it being a bit difficult when trying to manually focus in low-light, as the electronic view finder gets grainy in low light, but it's easy enough to take the shot, adjust focus, and reshoot as needed.

It's design is nothing short of a good DSLR, and is very simple to manage around, as I had no trouble betting to any switches or buttons when holding it in my hands. It's light weight, but still has a bit of weight to it for it's size, so it feels sturdy, but not  a hassle to hold or carry around. I find that this camera fits better in my hand than any other DSLR's that I've held, like the Nikon D3100 or the Canon Rebel T3i for those models felt a bit more bubbly in my hands, and I felt that they were to light for the size they were, so even though its just a personal preference, I find that this camera fits in my hand just perfectly. it's important to have comfort when taking a picture or shooting video, so keep that in mind.As far as image quality goes, it takes excellent pictures, with very accurate and vibrant coloreds. It is fun to mess around with the different filters and camera styles, but if you're like me, you won't use any of them much because most of those can be done when you upload the picture to Photoshop. I think the main advantage to the affects of this camera is the sweep panoramic mood. its a very smooth and natural process, so I thought it was a nice little feature they had in there.Shooting video is really a blast with this camera, the only problem I have with it though is having a lot more manual control with it. I know this camera isn't the best be shooting video's with, but as a film maker, I use it a lot in my projects and productions, so it would of been nicer to have a bit more manual control over the picture of the film. Either way, this thing shoots great 1080p video, and will satisfy anyone who wants to start making films.All in all, its a great camera, and is a reasonable price for this sort of quality. if you're looking to spend any kind of Money on a DSLR I would highly recommend you check out this model because it is just a great camera packed with a lot of features, and can produce high quality photos and videos.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Buy", "Author": "Wes", "ReviewID": "R3UER1OCP73X38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was delivered fast and efficient.

Also, the image doesn't take up the entire viewable area of the electronic viewfinder; there is a black border all around it. It has the pixels there (because there is backlight bleed all over it, and a few icons appear in that space).Too much shutter noise.  You would think that since the mirror doesn't move, it would make less noise.Functionality severely limited in RAW mode.  Many features are not useable when camera set to save RAW or RAW/JPEG.HDR mode should have an option to make an artistic HDR opposed to just the simple dynamic range adjustment. What they call HDR just makes the image look more grey.Screen blacks out between shots, especially noticeable when doing HDR.Sweep panorama feels like you are using a machinegun. It's not smooth at all andImage stabilization should turn on when using manual focus assist. It's great that manual focus assist is there to begin with, but it would be 100x more useful if the built in image stabilization would also be there to assist.No GPS like A55.No built-in wifi.  Cheap phones have it, why not latest cameras?This is true for any manufacturer:(1) For those that use a hand strap instead of neck strap, put a place to attach the strap UNDER the camera body.

Words cannot describe how disappointed I am in Sony.  I've owned Sony cameras all my life and never had any problems with them.  In August 2011 I paid around $500 for a Sony A35 body through Amazon.  I was extremely happy with the features, especially the handheld feature.  In November 2012 my camera stopped working (it won't turn on).  I tried every fix I could find on the internet.  Even called Sony Service, they could only suggest troubleshooting tips I already tried from the internet.  Then, after two minutes of trying, Sony Service said sorry, your camera is our of warranty and you'll need to send it to Texas (from Hawaii!!) to have them look at it.  $250 for Sony to look at the camera...that doesn't include the repair.I'm still in shock.  I've never dropped the camera or got it wet.  I take very good care of it.  I bought two lenses for it, a full range lens and a prime lens as well as other accessories.The camera broke on day one of my vacation in November.  Extremely disappointed.

An Apple iPhone 4S will produce better images in many cases.If you are taking pictures in high contrast situations, the colors will be washed out and muted.  In other conditions the colors will be steely and dark if there is a broad dynamic range.  Turning DOR off seems to help quite a bit but I hate to start tinkering with settings so early in the game.  I have seen pictures from the NEX-5 and they appear to have the same problem.  Of course, you can touch up afterwards and the editing software that comes with the camera is sufficient to get better results, but having to increase the saturation on most photos is not for me.In general, the image quality is inferior and it is because the colors are muted and faded.  The biggest deficiency is in the pink/red/purple spectrum.  However, as many have noted, the autofocus is incredibly fast.  To prove that point, I put on the 55-200 zoom and took pictures of motorcyclists passing by on the highway.  The focus is very good.  The Canon T3i can not approach the SLT A-35 in either autofocus speed or for burst speed, so this seems like a good choice for the action photo types.Back to color.  If you are taking a picture of a dog for instance, it might be acceptable.  But my sample pictures, taken in good lighting conditions, are not what I expect.  Out of some 250 snaps I took in Carcassonne, France last year maybe a dozen were acceptable.Finally, now that the A37 is coming out, it is noteworthy that the initial offering price for the A-37 will be a hundred dollars under this camera and yes many bought the camera when it was $699.  At $499 it is acceptable but $699, no way.  Note that the A37 has a downgraded LCD viewer, this one is better in that respect.I guess the lesson is to be wary of Sony cameras in general.  Also be wary of the professional paid reviewers who constantly promote Sony products on this site.
