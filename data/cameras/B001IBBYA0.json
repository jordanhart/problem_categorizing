{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for extreme close-ups", "Author": "Portland Ghosts", "ReviewID": "R12VYJXHAV5OQ2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have three CCTV day/night cameras all hooked up to my DVR. This unit plugged in and worked immediately. I set it side by side with one of my other cameras so they were shooting the exact same thing and this one is at least 2x closer maybe even more. I had them pointed towards the side of the TV in my room about 8 feet away from the cameras. The first camera had a wide field of view and showed a good portion of the room. This camera showed mostly just the TV. It filled almost the entire screen up. It has a very narrow field of view and the video looks very zoomed in.This camera may work better shooting objects at a distance. It does not have anything even close to a 1:1 ratio as far as perspective. It looks more like if you were using a camcorder and zoomed in on the subject.Depending on what you plan on taping this may or may not be the camera for you. I plan on using it for paranormal investigations and this camera will have to be used to film areas quite some distance from the camera (like a long hallway) or it will look like the camera was right on top of the area you are trying to record.Also of note, of the 3 of these I have this is the only one that is plastic. It looks metallic until you touch it but it's plastic. Base does not lock very tight and it feels like if you force it you're going to regret it.Giving it 3 stars for the extreme zoom issue and the fact that it's made of plastic. Haven't tested the audio aspect of the camera and don't really need it.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "KAYLINDA", "ReviewID": "R25D3XPVYASMZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are using this camera as a door watcher in our restaurant.

I tried all of them and they seemed to work okay.  This one was the worse though.  It generally matched the colors well, but often had a totally washed out image in bright light.  I am not referring to intense sunlight but even simply natural light outdoors (it worked better in doors).  I ended up installing this camera.  Ironically the image looks extremely dim now (whereas it was washed out before).  The quality was not very good and the night vision didn't work so well either.  It worked, but not very far.  I ended up replacing it with another camera and was much happier.  The quality was better, the brightness was better, and the night vision was better.In swapping out the camera, I also noticed that this camera zooms in more on the image.  It creates a smaller viewable area.  Not bad if you want to zoom in on something far away, but problematic if you use it in doors or want to see a broad area.  Despite the narrower viewing area (e.g. \"zoom\") the quality wasn't any better.  In fact, I think it was worse than the other camera.  I ended up taking it down.  It's now in a box in my closet in case I need an extra camera.  If I had to do it over again, I would not have bought it.Here's the camera I used instead.  I would recommend buying it.  The only upside of this camera is that it has a microphone, but you can buy a microphone accessory for $5 or so if you really need to add that.VideoSecu Bullet Outdoor CCD Security Camera Day Night 26 IR Infrared LEDs With Free Power Supply 1Z8http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IBFSJ8/ref=oss_product", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "more info", "Author": "Sabre Lindsay", "ReviewID": "R15N8HGCJBBUOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "can you post more pictures of the power box and the wireing and brackes on the camera most thank you sabre", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.99", "Features": "Affordable day night color audio video security camera.
