We got it for my grade school son, who loves to take photos. I have a much fancier and nicer camera, and I still enjoy the photos that this one takes.It is easy to use.  It has lots of useful settings.  It is small and compact.  And, in my opinion, the photos look really nice.My son is young.  He is not particularly steady holding the camera.  Yet, he is taking a great many nice looking photos, which are not blurry, look good to the adult eye, and print nicely.I'm really finicky about grain, sharpness, etc. (which is why I have a very nice Olympus C-8080 for myself), and I'm just not unhappy at all with the photos that this smaller, cheaper Olympus takes.For the price, I consider it to be a nice little camera.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "So Promising, So Very Disappointing.", "Author": "NewsView", "ReviewID": "R2U3V9ZA59EEF9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "With the Olympus name, 6 megapixels, a local price of less than $200, 22 shooting modes, and a user interface that is so simple you don't need to read the manual, I expected to love the FE-140. Unfortunately, I chose the wrong initial test subject. On the Olympus Website, I read that in macro mode you can shoot objects as close as 5cm, so I decided to take some photos of a ring. Virtually nothing turned out. Rather, the pics looked as if I set the camera to \"self timer\", tossed it straight up and waited for the shutter to snap mid air - and all this despite \"image stabilization\" as one of the FE-140's advertised features. Needless to say, I was shocked. The last time I was in the market for a digital camera - in 2000 - I walked away with a 1.3MP point-and-shoot that has absolutely no image stabilization, no manual controls and no macro, but to this day, dying battery and disk drive notwithstanding, can still manage to focus on small objects, such as jewelry, with surprisingly good results.At first I thought my FE-140 was defective, but then, buried in a PDF on the included CD-ROM, I discovered a disclaimer to the effect that it may not focus well on reflective surfaces. So much for my budding idea of using the FE-140 to sell jewelry over the Internet. This camera is going back.As for \"regular shots\", I didn't take many. Additionally, the photos I took were limited to indoors. What I can report is that while the color was a vast improvement over my old camera, the images produced by the FE-140 appeared a tad bit soft. Using my bulky but trusty 1.3MP Panasonic PV-SD4090, I have been able to shoot pics of my parakeets - with details in the feathers - that I can't seem to capture with the FE-140. I know the FE-140's mild softening serves to reduce the appearance of noise, but personally I prefer crisper images, even at the risk that they appear somewhat pixelated. It's simply easier to compensate in Photoshop for a camera that oversharpens than to find that I have no choice but to live with a camera that is incapable of making each spec of dust stand out (close up, that is).After doing additional research, I'm heading out to purchase a Fujifilm F10, which is on clearance here at Amazon to make way for its newest incarnation, the Fujifilm F30.", "Date": "April 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Easy to use but limited in skills", "Author": "Antonio \"Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3MEZGOE2HLC0S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera thinking of Olympus as a good product at a reasonable price.Eventually after having used for a very short time I noticed that it did not meet my needs and requirements.On one hand this camera is straightforward to use, handy and easy to carry in your pocket.Functions and programs are ready to use. On the other hand grainy and blench colours were quite present on all my shots, even if I used proper program and lots of care while taking pictures.

I tried it the old way when I received a camera for my high school graduation 20 years ago.  I missed a lot of good pictures through assembling my previous camera. Naturally, just turn this camera on, point, and shoot!  Love that!  My only dismay is battery life.  It's short and maybe Olympus should include rechargable batteries with the camera.  I read some of the other reviews, and I'm sorry people aren't as thrilled.  The first thing people say about my camera is how jealous they are of the LCD resolution [lol].

I figured Olympus was a good brand and for the price the camera seemed to be a great value- even having 6 MP.

Do not try to take any picture fast, whatever you are trying to get a picture of MUST be still; if it moves just take as many pictures as you can and hope for the best. I recently tried to take some pictures of my cats and the instant I had the prefect shot the camera took the picture 2 seconds after. Needless to say It was not the perfect picture I wanted. For still images, the picture quality was decent. However, THIS CAMERA DOES NOT AGE WELL, and by age I mean within just under a year.The on/off button does not work, you have to press the red button (which makes it possible to take a new picture after having checked previous pictures)to get the camera to come on. Sometimes I would get lucky and the power button would turn off the camera, the other times I would have to remove the batteries and quickly put them back. Recently this is the only way I can turn off this camera but with the additional annoyance of having to also hold the lens closed as I put the batteries back in so that the camera stays off. There have been many times that I have come close to smashing this camera with my hammer out of sheer frustration, and once I secure a new camera, I probably will just for the trouble it has caused. The best way to find a good camera is not by looking for a brand name but rather determine what features are important to you and then use Amazon's 'Find Your Perfect Camera' search to find all relevant search results. Then instead of sorting by 'bestselling' change it to 'avg. customer review'. All that have 5 stars are your best best to narrow choices down with; and of course your budget.Best of luck to you, I think my next bet will be either a Pentax Optio S12 or a GE-E 1235.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "So Disappointing - Broke on vacation in Hawaii", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "RE1PADA2GO65J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this camera for 14 months.

The camera performed very slowly, which was fine for a novice, but was aggravating for quick action events. Night shots were terribly captured. There are so few adjustments that you can make that you are forced to use the modes Olympus gives you. Finally, after just 4 1/2 months, my daughter opened the case to find the LCD display had internally cracked. It had just been used the day before, and had not been dropped. So I am curious how it would shatter inside without breaking the glass outside, without the obvious causes like dropping it. I contacted Olympus support, only to be told that it would cost $105 plus tax to repair it. Since the product is all over the web for just a few dollars more, it sounds like they don't intend to stand behind their product, but would rather push you to buy another one.
