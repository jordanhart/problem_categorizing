{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good enough", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R31UHY3HYTMBCB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a KX-TG2000 2-line base with two handsets and a KX-TGA420 extension for use in my turn-of-the-century three story Victorian.  The phones work well everywhere I have placed them except near cell phones.  They even work in the yard and carriage house.  I never have to worry about placing phone lines.  Programming the phones is not intuitive but the manual is clear and once you have the instructions programming is easy enough.  The phone will call your pager if you get a message and you can use the extensions as an intercom.  It beats running up two flights of stairs.  You can have voice mail for everyone in the family if you want, and access voice mail from the KX-TGA420.  The phones allow you to store the numbers of people who call, you if you have caller ID.  The only complaint my family has is that you can't pick up an extension and listen in without the originator consciously conferencing the phone call or transferring it to an extension.  Personally, I enjoy the privacy.  The only drawback is that the extensions only work through the base unit, which means whole system goes down if your base fails. I tried and returned several expandable phone systems including ATT and GE before settling on Panasonic.", "Date": "May 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "thinking about buying another!!!", "Author": "nightwatch", "ReviewID": "R3UNSVP2CKL11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the complete system for over a year using it as a primary phone system in a small office environment. This unit, the cordless 420B, is my favorite of all.  We use the speaker phone constantly and place it in the center of the conference table when the situation calls for group discussion.  The novelty of walking throughout the complex talking on a corded.. cordless phone is unique.  The quality of the units and the service is more than acceptable.  Personally, I really like the phone and plan on purchasing another like the 420B.  Note:  Keep the units away from computer monitors (as in beside) due to the antennas causing the screens to produce a wavy effect.  Move the phone... wavy screen stops.  Buy it, you'll like it.", "Date": "August 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Panasonic 4000 4 line cordless:  thumbs down", "Author": "Hugh Rice Kelly", "ReviewID": "R2RZLERNCSBB9H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the KX-TG4000 as well as the extension telephone listed above as the 420B as This telephone system does not have acceptable voice quality, even with both base and extension in the same room.In addition, this base station is not powerful enough to cover a large, pre-World War II house with hard plaster steel lath walls and ceilings in some of the rooms intervening between the base and the extensions.  It was a disaster, frankly.I have been using a Uniden 900 mhz digital cell phone in this house for 5 years, without the slightest interference, and with first class voice quality.To rule out defectiveness of this unit, I borrowed another 2.4 ghz base and extension and placed them in the same relation as the 4000/420 combination.  The results were just as bad.I had to return the whole kit and caboodle, including 4 420's, the base unit and three cordless handsets, incurring [expensive]restocking fees from the internet supplier who sold me the system.The one star is scarcely enough to convey my disappointment and anger about this system.P.S., the system does not allow paging, a significant drawback.  Nor does it have a one step automatic transfer of calls into voicemail.", "Date": "July 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Corded/Cordless Unit Rocks!", "Author": "Bobby L.", "ReviewID": "R2ITM2H82QU66S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this unit for about 3 years, using it in an busy home office enviroment for upwards of 16 hours a day.  Its performs spectacularly, especially for all the abuse it takes.  The cordless handset broke in about a year and a half, and replacing it costs more than buying another phone.  But then again, we abused the heck out of it by using it 16 hours a day, and dropping it almost on a constant basis.  On the other hand, the corded base is wonderful, and its still working fine, albeit with some wear marks and paint scratches.Comparing this Panasonic to a GE Corded/Cordless unit before that, this Panasonic lasted 2 years longer, and is still going.  The GE unit only lasted for about 9 months.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Cordless Multi Line Multi Phone - System", "Author": "LG", "ReviewID": "R3TAP1CXP39CFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone system back in 2003 new. The base unit KXTG4000B came with one KXTGA400B extension. I purchased one additional KXTGA400B and three KXTGA420Bs. This system has been used to provide phone service throughout our home and for our two home offices. It has performed flawlessly now for about nine years. My only regret is that Panasonic discontinued the system. We have four lines on the phone, one POTS (plain old telephone service) line and three VoIP lines. This cordless multiple line phone system with extensions is tailor made for VoIP. Just place the base unit near your broadband gateway and VoIP adapters for easy connection. The system DOES have an intercom system, auto attendant, voice mail for the base and each extension, conference calling and you can define which extension phones ring and receive Caller ID info for each line. I cannot say enough good things about this phone system. By the way, our KXTGA420B extensions are placed next to our digital monitors with digital graphics card without any effect on them.
