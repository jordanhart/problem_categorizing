{"Reviews": [{"Title": "720SW gets 3.5 stars", "Author": "Thomas E. Tweedel", "ReviewID": "R3QVN8BT3M92V7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd give this camera 3.5 stars for the money.I arrived at the decision to buy this camera after a bit of circuitous route. Long ago I loved my old Nikon CP-990. Then I had a kid and for the first year or so it was ok. But after he started moving around on his own I found the camera to lacking in focus speed, frames per second and a few other tech specs. Not wanting to spend a fortune shooting him with my F3 Film camera so I got a D-70 and life was good, still is.However as he gets older and more adventurous we find ourselves in places I dare not take the \"nice\" camera. The pool, the beach, the sandbox, muddy days, the creek etc. At the same time my wife wanted a pursable camera so that we could have something with us at all times without lugging around a rig.So a pocket Point and shoot (PNS) seemed to be in the cards. I was all set to get the Pentax Optio WPi when Olympus announced the 720SW. It was good to 10 feet instead of 5 and was shockproof and had a form factor liked better than my wife (bigger LCD). So we held out and bought it. I've had a chance to play with it a couple of weeks and this is my impression.Pros-Small - Fits in the pocket/purse without issue.Faster than yesterdays PNS for turn on, focus and lock timeEasy to use - Has the standard full auto mode and some \"scene\" modes that are easy enough to figure out. They tell you what they are for and give sample pictures.Build Quality - I've never seen a point and shoot built like this. You could put this thing on the end of a chain and use it as a weapon and then take pictures of your vanquished foe afterward. Its tough. It has an all metal frame that surround it, the front plate is plastic, the back glass, metal and plastic. It feeds very solid. I haven't tested its robustness yet but its good.Internally focusing lens - You know those cameras that stick a snoot out when you turn them on? I find that somewhat annoying but more importantly I've seen those die when you get dirt or sand in the snoot. I've lost a couple of film PNS that way and seen a few digitals go down as well. Everything here is internally focusing. Its sealed, nothing to stick out or break off. I let my 2 year old play with the camera, he didn't break it but seems to instinctivally grip it with a sticky finger on top of the lens.Lenscap - The Pentax WPi does not have a lenscap! This one does. I once heard the salesman say \"oh but it has a protective plastic cover in front of the lens so it doesn't need one\" Ookkkay, so the lens doesn't get scratch, the cheap non replacable plastic in front of it does. Its still a scratch in front of your picture! The olympus has a more robust wiper type lenscap that can sweep stuff away instead of getting gummed up.Waterproof - This trick more than anything else is why I got the camera. Take it to the pool, take it IN the pool and get cool pictures. Pay the beach no head, splashing at bathtime, no worries. My son gooped it up pretty good, just ran it under the faucet and dried it off with a soft towel. Don't try that with your normal camera.High ISO - This camera can go to ISO 1600 which for its class is amazing. Higher ISOs make your sensor more sensitive but increase noise. ISO 800 and above starts looking very noisy and that's not uncommon in many digitals. Most small ones fall apart by ISO 400.Big Screen, Fast Zoom - It has a very generous 2.5\" LCD screen. When you take a picture and review it you can zoom in very quickly. Really great for taking a picture of a tourist map and taking it with you.Cons-Too small - Yes, too small. I'm not a big guy, my fingers fit ok but big guys might have some issues. Also the camera is so small and light its kind of hard to hold very steady. It doesn't have the weight to dampen your tremors and you really can get a good two handed grip on it, its always a finger hold.The \"Image stabilization\" - It promises no more blurry pictures because of \"image stabilization\". Well its not really image stabilization. When you kick that feature in it does an ISO boost (makes the sensor more sensitive to light) which lets you reduce the shutter speed so you don't have camera shake as much. The drawback is that you get more noise and less quality in your picture than if it had real image stabilization.Camera downloads kill the battery - If you plug your camera into the computer to download the pictures plan on charging the battery right after. It sucks it down big time. Get a card reader for $15 at any discount shop.Stupid XD Card memory format - It uses the \"XD\" memory format which is neither as cheap or fast as Secure digital or Compact flash. It's the same size as an SD card but different shape. Had to go get a new card reader to deal with it. Dowloaded about 5x faster. Most people don't have those cards laying around so plan on forking out some extra $$$.Can't zoom on video mode - When you start taking a movie you can't use the optical zoom, it can use the digital zoom be those are not too good.Review screen isn't all that pretty- Big screen but not great resolution. You can zoom in real close but it lacks sharpness. This might let you think the image is not sharp but it is.That sums up the pros and cons, but what about image quality? Does it take good pictures? Well I would say it takes ok pictures. I've seen better, I've seen worse. I've gotten somewhat used to Digital SLRs with good lenses so perhaps I'm not the best to judge. My wife thinks they are fine.For family stapshots of the kids by the pool or at the beach it is fine. Don't expect your photos of opportunity on vacation to far away lands to make the cover of a magazine though. This camera is at its best when getting the shot becomes more of an issue than getting it perfect.The best camera to use for any shot is the one you have with you. This little thing is a go anywhere do anything kind of camera. You can take it with you to the beach, the pool, on a 3 day hike through the mud and rain, across the desert and into the rainforest and not worry about it when you fall of your mountain bike doing it all..If it gets dirty or goopy find a bucket of water or a hose and wash it off. If that's important then this is the way to go. If that doesn't really matter there are smaller and cheaper cameras that will serve you just as well.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "This thing rocks (Updated June 2006 - with bad/good news)", "Author": "Olozbal", "ReviewID": "R3HAETW18Z5AY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got back from whitewater rafting the Grand Canyon and this thing rocks.  I just got done uploading about 200 pictures and video off this thing and the photo quality is amazing.Obviously the cool part is the waterproof part.  I had this thing on a carabiner off my life jacket for 7 days in and out of water and sand pretty much constantly.  It got hit repeatedly by various things and no electronic gear should have survived what I put it through.  I did give it a few \"beauty marks\" including a scratch on the screen and a few dings but it still works fine.The video it takes is awesome, I have video of us running the rapids in the Grand Canyon and obviously this thing doesn't care about a water hit which made me a star out there.Couple of things,quirks, etc.:1.  Wish it had a regular optical viewfinder in addition to the big screen.  However, when I was outside in the sun taking photos I never got it washed out unlike others' cameras I used.2.  I had to go on Ebay and buy a 1 gig memory chip for the trip.  That gave me almost 300 pictures on the super highest setting.  It comes with none of them.  Plan on buying a chip.3.  I had two batteries for the trip (bought an extra one).  For some reason the first one died in about a day which worried me a lot, but for some reason the second one lasted for the entire rest of the trip.4. Keep in mind, I lost a few photos because while this camera is a good underwater camera, a few times there were water drops on the lense which blurred the shot. Not sure if there is a fix for that but FYI.Overall - this camera kicks[..].  If you are going to be outside and active, get this thing.UPDATED JUNE 2006:- My camera is now DOA. This thing survives being in the desert, underwater, around sand etc, now I come back and go to the pool for about an hour and the thing is now dead.  Looks like water got inside the unit through the battery door. Seals look fine and intact so I don't have a clue.  Water behind the lense, this thing acts like, well - a piece of electronics with water inside.  It's totally fried.  I basically had it at the pool and took one photo with it and it's gone.Only warning to learn is this thing isn't some super ingenious design - basically it has the same vulnerable ports as all other electronics do but with rubber seals on the insides of the doors.The good news is I sent it back to Olympus and they sent me a brand new camera about a week later without any explanation.  I was expecting them to tell me I'm an idiot and forgot to do something but no questions asked.

I usually shoot with a Canon Digital Rebel SLR and was looking for something pocket-sized for when I didnt want to lug a big camera around.  The weather-proof and shock-proof features sealed the deal.I have to say that I am impressed with the color fidelity on the 720.  White-balance is good and colors are sharp and vivid without looking unnatural.Start-up time is good as is the time between shots.  Its slower than my SLR but that is to be expected.I can get around 300 photos on a 1meg card (not included, you'll want to buy one at the same time).  I also like the video feature.  Sure its only 15fps, but it's an addition to the features on the camera already.The best part is the digital image stabilization which helps to steady your shots.  I've had other small point and shoot cameras in the past and have gotten rid of them because of all of the great shots that were ruined by blur caused by camera-shake.  Think twice before going for a small camera without stabilization.  You can't possibly hold a camera this small without some shake, so without stabilization you're wasting your time and money.The digital zoom, as with all digital cameras, adds too much noise to the photos to be useful.My only complaint is that the small size makes holding the camera without getting a finger or two in the shot difficult.I would highly recommend this camera.  I can's say the same for many of the small Sonys that I have used in the past.  I am truly impressed with the quality of the photos this camera takes.

If any of these cameras are on your list of choices then read on...Image quality:Of the three cameras the Canon SD600 wins hands down, followed shortly by the Sony T9. If excellent quality photos are a must for you then the Olympus might not be the best choice. Just because the Olympus has the 7.1 megapixels does not translate to better image quality, just bigger prints. But who really prints photos bigger than poster size?Functionality:This is one area where the Olympus 720sw really out shines its competitors. The \"s\" and \"w\" in \"720sw\" stand for shockproof and waterproof. For many, the purchase of this camera will be heavily weighed on this characteristic alone as no other ultracompact on the market comes even close to being submersible. Its really remarkable and somewhat disarming when you first bring the camera into the water because of its steel construction, but there are definately many goodtimes to be had with taking photos in rain, in the pool, or even in the shower. Aside from just its construction however, the 720sw also has many added features like calendar options, titleing, slideshow, sound memo, and more. The menu is also easy to navigate and allows for ease of use.Construction:In terms of construction quality the Canon SD600 is excellent. While the Olympus has the waterproof and shockproof value to it, Ive found the overall design and weight to be slightly off balance. As the next reviewer noted, taking photos felt somewhat awkward at times with the lens placement, weight, and design of the 720. In some cases I had to make a conscious effort to make sure my fingers werent in the way when I photographed. The LCD screen on the Olympus is also the worst of the three cameras (which is unsatisfactory since there is no viewfinder). Sony had the nicest followed closely by the Canon.Portability:Of the three reviewed, the Olympus was also the largest and heaviest. For a man, the Olympus is just small enough to slip into the back pocket. For a woman however, its on the verge of being too bulky and heavy to slip into your jeans or purse. Keep in mind too that this camera falls into the \"ultracompact\" category. So if you are basing a large part of your purchase on portability and compactness, the Sony T9 might be best for you.Conclusion:If you are in need of a rugged and durable ultracompact camera that \"gets the job done\" so to speak then look no further. For adventurers and those who WILL knowingly take the camera into very wet or humid areas then this camera is for you. However if you are looking for something with excellent picture quality, high quality construction, and/or ultra portability then you might want to consider the Canon SD600 or the Sony T9. Both have very good picture quality and are true ultracompacts.

I'm glad I did.", "Author": "Family Guy", "ReviewID": "RIU3D0TAF69RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid photographer with high end SLR's and Digital SLR's.  Just Before going on a trip to Maine, I lost my Sony T7 and needed a replacement.  The T7 was a great camera but it's underwater housing was a pain to work with.  So, I decided to by an underwater camera.  With all the poor reviews out there I almost decided to go back to the T7.  I'm glad I took the leap.This camera takes GREAT shots.  I purchased a 1GB memory card for it and it holds tons of photos.  The picture quality is also excellent.  I'm not sure how people are getting poor images but believe they may not be holding the camera still while shooting or may not be filling the shadows with light.  I default the flash to always being on and it works great.  I did this also for my T7.For the complaints you've read about it not saving the \"shooting mode\". When the camera is turned back on, it defaults to the standard shooting mode.  If you'd like to use a preset mode, it goes back to the last one you selected at the push of a button.  This is a great since you may turn it off underwater and then turn it on later while above surface (and forget that you were on a preset mode). If you are still underwater you're only a button away to getting to the last preset mode you used again.  There are a lot of presets, so having it go back to the last one used is really helpful.I'm going to try to upload some of the shots I've taken. They're as good as the Sony T7 (if not better) with the added versatility of underwater photography.  If you want a camera that can truly go anywhere, this is the one!  Don't forget to put a little RainX on the lens and clean the lens regularly as this is another common reason people get poor shots with these cameras", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Strong, Fast, Stylish...

The manual and website FAQs aren't much help on this, and without some careful practice you will probably be disappointed with this camera's underwater shots at first.  My results were uneven despite experience with other underwater cameras.The biggest challenge for all us ocean snorkelers is MOTION.  You're floating, the fish are swimming, and you're probably near the surfline and some wave surge.  With all this movement, framing and capturing a dead-on sharp image is very difficult.  Above all else, you need to maximize shutter speed.To shoot underwater with the 720 SW, use one of the camera's four underwater scene modes.  Contrary to the manual and even the camera's own LCD display info, all four of these modes can be used underwater without a separate housing.  I confirmed this with Olympus technical assistance.  The modes are:#21 Underwater landscape No. 1.  Probably the best, but increase shutter speed as described below.#22--Underwater landscape No. 2.  Fixed focus, so should offer reduced shutter lag, but I didn't get especially good results.  WIsh I had experimented with it more.#23--Macro.  Ok, if you and the fish can stand totally still for a close-up.  Otherwise use it for coral or forget it.#24--General purpose underwater setting that curiously uses the \"cloudy\" white balance.  Not too useful.The scene modes need to be adjusted further for true underwater conditions.  Scene mode #21 is set for ISO 64, which results in low shutter speeds.  Press the round OK button and change the ISO setting to 200.  This is the single most important adjustment you can make.  ISO 400 would be better, but you need to decide if the loss in resulution is acceptable.Devote your first day in the water just to experimenting with different modes and ISO settings.  If you think it's hard to see the LCD on land--try looking at it through your mask underwater!  You can increase the LCD brightness a little, but too many of my shots were mostly guesswork.If you can pick a calm, bright day, and find a place where you can stand on the bottom, it will help immensely with this or any camera used in a shoreline environment.  Morning or afternoon light is better for pictures on land, but midday sun is great for underwater shots.You can zoom in and out in the scene modes, but don't use much telephoto because it multiplies normal underwater camera movement.  Take a sharper shot using wide or normal, then crop to your close-up on the computer.  Use the highest resolution setting.You can use the 720 SW's flash underwater--but the water must be totally clear.  If it is even a little murky the flash illuminates thousands of tiny particles in the water and spoils your shot.  Some of my flash pictures were OK, none were great.  Flash distance seems to be maybe 6 feet underwater, but that's enough.For enlargements, the sharpest picture I got underwater was barely OK for an 8x10, most I wouldn't push beyond 5x7.  The dry land photos from the 720 SW will definitely go bigger.The bottom line:  the 720 SW takes some real work to deliver adequate but not great underwater pictures.  Olympus provides almost no useful information to the purchaser about the unique underwater features of this camera.  Honestly, I think some people would be happier with one of the Kodak or Fuji ISO 800 disposables.  Why waste your vacation trying to figure out a new camera when you should be enjoying those angelfish?Olympus, if you're listening: to sell a lot more of these cameras, hire a good technical writer, put him or her in the ocean with this camera for a few days, and have them write up the best way to take the typical underwater shots.

I did so against the advice of several reviews I read here saying the quality of the underwater photos was poor. However, I strongly disagree. I've posted two sample photos here that demonstrate the quality that's possible with this camera underwater. I was completely satisfied. Here's why I ordered this...First, it's about the only camera in its class -- a simple, compact camera for use on land OR underwater. So my choices were rather limited.Second, I've taken lots of photos with disposable underwater cameras and I've learned that it's VERY hard to get good results. This has less to do with the camera though and everything to do with the conditions. So I took a chance that this camera would be at least as good. Turns out it was much better. I used the setting for Underwater Snapshots and had great results. I also took several short movies that turned-out surprisingly well. When shooting underwater, just remember the pro's number one rule of getting good pictures -- take A LOT of pictures!! Some will turn out poorly, most will be very average, a few will be great!This camera performed very well underwater and took nice images on land as well. It's also very compact. One MAJOR warning though. IT DOESN'T float! That means, if you're swimming in water deeper than you can swim to the bottom you'd better put the camera on a lanyard just in case you drop it! I bought one for $2.99 at a dive shop and just kept it locked around my wrist whenever in the water.If you DON'T need to shoot in wet conditions or need a camera that's this rugged, you can get better image quality with other cameras.

My other camera is a Canon 350, and that is not something you can bring anywhere, you can't slip it into your pocket like this camera, you can't bring it to the beach or to muddy places. You have to carry around the expensive, bulky camera and a bag of lenses with you.I bought this olympus because you can bring it ANYWHERE, not just because it fits into your pocket, but also because you can put it around your wrist and go swimming with it, and not have to worry about someone stealing it from your bag on the beach. You can bring it to the mud baths and if it gets totally messed up by letting your little cousin play with it, you can just bring it to the shower and rinse it.So, despite there being better point and shoot cameras out there, and despite it being a tad expensive, I still give it five stars.

I also added an Olympus 1GB xD card.  Less than a week after I purchased it, I used it on the \"Maid of the Mist\" boat ride at Niagara Falls, Canada.  This was my first intended use for its waterproofness.  It passed with flying colors! (literally).  The pictures came out great!  Even when water drops were on the lens they looked decent, although a bit blurry as expected.  I had used a Fujifilm disposable waterproof camera the last time that I was there, and the pictures were dark, even though it was sunny out.  It was sunny out again with the Olympus, and the pictures were not dark like the Fujifilm.  I got some great shots this time of people's reactions as the boat was facing into the horseshoe falls.  Please note that I was at the front of the boat, facing the falls!  The camera got very wet, as it was like being in a heavy rain fall.  After we returned out of the falls, I simply wiped off the lens, and the pictures came out good, as before it was wet.  I wish that I could post some of the photos here to show the results.I also used the camera for some regular photos (no water), and they came out very well.  I used it in both light and dark situations, making changes with the controls both manually and presets.  The photos were pretty much what I expected.  Today, I took it on a helicopter ride and the photos came out good, as well.I have used the camera while swimming, but have not had the courage to use it completely underwater yet.  So I cannot comment on using it like that.  I do intend to use the camera snorkelling next year in Hawaii.  We'll see how it works out then.  I can tell you that each compartment on the camera (i.e, battery/memory card, cable connector) has rubber seals around the inside of the little doors.Now my primary problem with this camera is the movie mode.  It uses Quicktime (.mov) format.  I had this on my first digital camera, an Olympus 490, and it was not good on that one either.  The movie mode takes up too much memory and battery juice.  On this 720SW model, the sound of the movie has a lot of static noise in it, which even makes the movie mode worse.  Also, the battery life is low, even when only taking photos.  I can only take about 100-150 photos on a full charge, depending on flash use.  Mind you that my 1GB card can hold hundreds, even over thousands of pictures, depending on the resolution mode selected.  So I recommend getting a 2nd battery, which I have not done yet, as I mostly only use this camera where water is involved, and use my other cameras the rest of the time.One of my other cameras is a small Sony T5 digital camera that is comparable in size to the Olympus 720SW.  It uses mpg movie format.  The movie mode (including sound), memory, and battery life on the Sony T5 are much better than the Olympus 720SW.  If the Sony T5 camera were only waterproof, I would have never bought the Olympus 720SW camera.  I also have a Canon S1 digital camera, which is a larger camera with 10x (32x digital) zoom.  It also fairs better in most respects to the Olympus 720SW, but again is not waterproof.So my final take at this point with this Olympus 720SW waterproof/shockproof camera is that if you intend to take a decent amount of pictures involving water, be it swimming, rain, or even Niagara Falls, and want good results, this is a good camera to have.  If water is not in your plans, it still makes a decent digital camera, and would be handy to have the waterproofness just in case you get it wet.  (I remember as a child when my dad's $1,000 35mm SLR camera was ruined at Niagara Falls with just the mist.  This incident had a lot of influence on my purchase of this Olympus camera.)  But if you also want to take good digital movies with this camera, I do not recommend it.  Either get a Sony T series, or even better - a camcorder!  Just don't use those in water, unless you have a waterproof housing.With the movie problem and the lower battery longevity (compared to my other cameras), I give the Olympus 720SW 4-stars instead of 5.  It is still a good digital snapshot camera though, especially with the waterproofing.*******UPDATE - 2/26/2008I took this camera to Hawaii last year.  It worked great.  I got some really good photos of fish and sea turtles while snorkeling off the shore of different islands.  BUT...  I had a wave hit me in the arm, where I was holding the camera, while getting out of the water at a beach on Maui.  This was my last snorkeling of the trip - Thank God!!!  I found out after that the wave caused the lens cover to stop working correctly.  Therefore the camera would no longer focus because it thought the lens cover was still closed - I think.Unfortunately the warranty was up by the time I returned home.  After it sat on the shelf for a while, I finally decided to take the camera front apart.  It had sand around the front parts, but the internal electronic components were still sealed within.  I cleaned out the sand and made some adjustments to the flimsy lens cover.  After a few adjustments, the lens cover started working properly again, and the camera can now focus and take photos again.  I put the front back on the camera, and it is working again.  I have not yet tried it in the water, since fixing it, but plan to on our next vacation.I highly recommend that on future water proof cameras, Olympus replace the flimsy lens cover with a more sturdy one, or remove it all together.*******UPDATE - 2009Still going. Still waterproof.

I have owned many digital cameras before, from cheap point-and-shoot to pro DSLR. The Olympus has some very unique features that you have to love - waterproof is #1. Take it in the pool, in the ocean - makes nice snorkeling pictures, too! And it is really tough built, that's great. It takes 7MP pictures, so you can crop them later and still get a good resolution print. It has nice big screen that is even pretty bright (a must since there is no optical viewfinder). I like the pictures it takes, usually. There are a few things that continue to disapoint me, though:- forget about \"image stabilization.\" That's a marketing term; this thing doesn't have one. Shame on Olympus for misleading everybody!- it has absolutely the minimum of manual controls that I have ever seen - no white balance, no flash compensation, no histogram- instead it relies on a long range of picture programs that are actually very nice; but tough to select and every time you turn it off and back on it has forgotten its settings!So if you want a true P&S; without any manual intervention on your side, you can;t get one much tougher than this one and it is a decent buy.

If something can withstand my abuse it is not only well made, it's almost indestructible.After much deliberation I decided to get the 720SW to replace my Olympus D-560. I was very happy with Olympus in terms of image quality. Cost definitely came into the equation- I already had the XD cards and wanted to spend more money on the camera itself than settle for something less and buy a 1gig card for whatever other camera I was interested in.I hadn't ever had a camera with a rechargeable battery so I bought an extra knowing that I'd be on the go almost every day and I didn't want to be caught somewhere and see the low battery message of doom. If you are getting this camera, do yourself a favor and get the extra. The charger doesn't take long to charge the batteries but the batteries barely weigh anything so they're easy to carry with you. I found that I often accidentally turn it on when I have it in my purse just because something will press against it. It does have an automatic shut off although I'm not sure what the timer is.Let me tell you about the durability. I took this camera with me to Thailand and Hawaii where I used it every day for about a month and a half. I dropped it once in the middle of the street in Bangkok from maybe 4 feet and it was fine. I don't think it even turned off. I took it on a jungle trek for 2 days and had it in my hand almost the whole time. It got dragged in the dirt a little as I climbed up and fell down a hill, it dropped into water and mud in a rice paddy, and I also leaked half a bottle of sunblock  on it. I took it out in the rain (I went during monsoon season) and snorkeled with it several times and it worked perfectly. It is absolutely waterproof without an addition housing.Underwater pictures with this camera are decent! It took some excellent pictures of sea turtles and schools of fish. The underwater features definitely work better the more light you have. Don't expect much from your underwater pictures unless you're taking them in the day time and in some very clear water. Also, don't be afraid of using the 720SW in salt water. I had mine submerged for hours at a time. At the end of the day you follow the cleaning instructions which basically amount to you filling a bowl or a bucket up with fresh, clean water and swishing it around for a bit. After it was dry I cleaned the lens and it was as good as new.Something else I am absolutely loving about this camera is the size. The LCD is very large and it does have the brightness option so you can see your pictures clearly in the day time if you adjust the settings. The camera can easily fit into my front pocket which makes it very portable. The resolution on the camera is very good at 7.1mp provided you aren't using the rapid-succession mode or the image stabilization mode. Both have their uses but they do not yield the highest quality pictures.The menu on the Olympus is very straightforward and easy to use. My complaint is that it has to be reset every time you turn on the camera. The image quality is adjustable depending on what you are doing. It has a 640x480 if you're taking little snapshots or messing around. It has 2 different resolution settings for the highest 3072x2304.If anyone is thinking about getting this camera, do it. It's a camera that is built to last. You don't need to worry if you drop it. You don't need to fret about the screen getting damaged if you take it in the rain. No, it's not big and bulky so it won't take up much space when you're on the go. The picture quality is high. The waterproof feature may be more than you need but the fact that it's basically built like a tank certainly isn't. Save yourself the hassle of buying the Pentax Optio WP. It isn't built nearly as well as the 720. The added bonus is that you don't need to worry about getting a service guarantee with the Olympus- it's built well enough where you definitely don't need it. Chances are pretty good that your extended warranty won't cover you setting it on fire or pushing it down the garbage disposal.", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice camera for a great price!", "Author": "Thrifty ShutterBug", "ReviewID": "R3GL9Y52JJ5X9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I saw the what it could do compared to my camera.

Took it on vacation to Maui where we snorkeled daily.  Some thoughts:All the underwater shots needed fixing - white balance especially but also brightness and contrast.  Same with movies.  Above water shots were fine - very nice usually.Love the movie mode.  15fps is definitely irritating (like watching 8mm movies) but Adobe's Premiere Elements (not included) does a fair job of smoothing it out.  The advantage is you can get almost 15 minutes of video on a 1 gig card.  For snorkeling I used the movie mode far more than any of the other modes.  A movie of a turtle surfacing under you sure beats a still.It needs a 20 cent large plastic viewfinder that you could snap on when doing underwater photos as it's very hard, impossible sometimes, to view the screen image while snorkeling on sunny days.  I found myself aiming too high when guessing.As others have mentioned, if you turn off the camera while using one of the specialty modes, the camera doesn't return to it when you next power it up.  But it's only 3 extra key presses, 2 of which are the same key.  It's not tough.  I actually agree with the design logic, but it would be nice if this was a configurable item - so you could have it default to the mode you were in when it was turned off.  On the other hand the main mode that the camera defaults to is configurable and those customizations do persist during power off.Digital Image stabilization is nothing more than boosting the ISO which results in grainy pictures - almost comically so.  As with any camera with a lens this small you have to keep the ISO low to avoid grain.  The camera could use optical (read expensive) stabilization.Battery life is okay but you'll want extras - they're inexpensive.Even tho we babied this thing, it leaked after about 5 days of snorkeling (all at less than 10 feet) and fried itself.  Olympus replaced it under warranty.  I'm hoping it was a bad camera and there isn't a design defect.I have a Canon Digital Rebel that I love, but I find myself taking FAR more shots with the Olympus because I can  slip it into a shirt or coat pocket.

I used the fireworks one and they came out great. the 7.1 megapixels allows me to make big prints if i choose. stabilization isn't all that great but i don't see myself having to use that too much. the underwater shots are awesome great to take to the beach or the pool or even when you go to an amusement park and go on a wet ride never having to worry that it will get ruined. the program it comes with is alright. the red eye reduction isn't that great i had to use the manual mode mostly. but the other editing capabilities are great and easy to use. i got a 1 gig xd card and when use set the size of images to 1200 by 900 you can take about 2400 pics. the battery doesn't last all day but like 3/4 of the day so i would recommend a spare for long trips. but definitely worth the money and very versatile i wouldn't want another camera.", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera, worth the money.", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3CT5564N96C8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera does everything it says; yes, it's waterproof and I was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  it is as slow as every other digital camera I've owned as far as focusing, multiple flashes, and then actually shooting.  You get your subject's attention and they smile, frozen, as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) I was especially intrigued by its \"Bright Capture\" technology, but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old Sony U20 2MP tiny little snapshot camera.  Still that same flash-in-the-dark look.  There is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others), but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob, even if you hold your breath and try to remain still.  My ideal snapshot camera is portable, durable, quick, easy, and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes.  This camera has 3.5 out of those 5.  It is way portable, very durable, easy, produces OK results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight, and it's not very quick.Overall I am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "two words: man magnet", "Author": "K.

I wasn't going to get it because, as a college student, it was out of my price range.Looking back though, it's definitely worth the extra dough. I took it with me on a trip to Colorado, and I've been taking it with me EVERYWHERE. It's small/light enough to actually FIT in my back pockets (girl jeans), and it's light enough that I tend to forget that it's there. Also, since I tend to be rather clumsy/forgetful (I killed my past two cell phones by drowning them), the shock/water proof is an excellent advantage. I've made many of my friends nervous by dropping/getting it wet.The most entertainment that this camera has provided me though was  when I took this to the hotsprings today. We took several pictures underwater, just to test it out. In the hour that we were there, FOUR different random guys came over to us and asked what kind of camera it was and was it really waterproof.

Some tips on my review...", "Author": "CCSR", "ReviewID": "R3UEBDKIIMP8NF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since January, after I dropped (and broke) my Casio on NYE.  I never thought I needed a shockproof camera, but after losing one, this was a godsend.  Plus I'm a big water person, and always had a regular film camera for the water, now I can just take one camera with me!I haven't dropped it yet, so haven't tested the shockproof capabilities, but I took the camera to the beach daily on my vacation in Brazil.  I would dive in the waves, take pictures from the ocean, it was great.When I bought it, I was afraid that the quality of regular pictures wouldn't measure up to my Casio.  I was wrong, my regular pictures come out great!!It really is waterproof, works perfectly wet.  Got a great pic of my nephew surfing towards me (literally, I took the shot then dove under so he wouldn't hit me with the surfboard!) Everyone at the beach gave me weird looks, and a couple of kids reminded me that I was taking my camera in the water :)The only problem with the waterproof feature is that you have to clean up the water drops from the lenses when taking pics out of the water.  When you're in the water, but not taking underwater pics, it's a bit hard as your hands, bathing suit, etc, are all wet, but doable!For the people who complained about the shutter-speed.  It is slow if you have the preview of the picture you just took.  Turn that off on the settings so you don't get the preview and then there is barely any lag between pictures.  I turn it on and off, depending on my needs.The one thing to be careful about is that the camera is not sand proof -- some sand got in between the lens cap and the camera while I was in the water, and when it dried up, the lens cap wasn't closing all the way -- it took some very throughout careful cleaning to get it all out, but once I did, it went back to normal.Ah, and remember to wash off the salt water from the camera -- steel & salt water usually means rust, so I always wash it over the sink with some soap after the beach.I'll post some of my pics up when I get some free time.

Waterproof as advertised (though the underwater scene modes are not sufficient to obviate the need for custom white balance--which it doesnt have) but cleaning the camera after saltwater use is complicated by the sliding lens cover.  I have to remove the battery while the camera is on (so the lens cover stays open), then soak it in distilled water to minimize salt build up.  Optics are very good but the camera can benefit a lot from optical image stabilization. The alternative of boosting ISO setting just leads to noisy, grainy images. My best images are at ISO 64 but I need to use a tripod a lot because it is very difficult to keep such a small camera steady.  The flash is weak, even for use in snapshots. 15 fps video is a let down.

My problem I have always had with most cameras is that you need to use a flash when taking pictures at night or in dark places, eventhough I didn't want to during a concert. So over the past few days I have been trying this camera in dark places.  So far it has a few different options for pictures at night.  One is available light, I have found this to be my favorite option, since it does not use a flash.My only issues and reading these reviews before I bought it I already knew them.  It is hard to keep the same option on the camera after you turn it off you have to go and reset the photo option or else it just goes back to the default.  Power button is very small.  I also don't like the software it came with.Also the other night I was at a campfire with friends.  Needless to say I ended up dropping the camera and didn't know it.

The shutter speed is a bit slow, takes usually about 2-3 after pressing the button to take the pics.  It can't capture very fast motion too well.  Tested this by trying to take pics during a basketball game.  It's durablity it's very impressive.

It is the camera I carry everywhere because of it's indestructibility. If you're looking for something you can carry everywhere, you need to look at these all-weather Olympus cameras.I bought this camera specifically because my Olympus 5060 was destroyed after my girl's soccer team dumped water on me after a game. After that, I wanted a camera that wouldn't be damaged as I'm fairly active with kids and the outdoors.It's also fun in the pool - which you absolutely can't say about other digital cameras. My kids have taken a bunch of goofy pictures of themselves in the pool, and I wasn't that worried about damage.The biggest problem with the camera is battery life, probably drained because there is no viewfinder, but only the LCD.

Reason for purchase: I'm very active and hyper and absolutely require extremely rugged equipment. I loved this camera - almost to an obsession.  I've never had a piece of electronic wizardry last so long in my possession.  That is, until I bent the front case when I landed on it falling down a cliff.  It was a small dent, but enough (I think) to lift the housing off the tiny tiny o-ring seal.  After that it suffered water intrusion a few times.  Incredibly, after taking it apart, cleaning the internals and allowing it to dry for about 12 hours, it would start working perfectly again.  This went on until a fateful Hawaiian snorkeling adventure - the saltwater corroded the contacts killing my little friend.  I've asked my wife for the 790sw as a Christmas gift.  It seems the software, controls, and video have been improved.  Plus, it looks like the gaskets are larger and wrap around portions of the case.  Maybe the 790sw will truly be \"Me-Proof.\"  We'll see...Pros:Takes good pictures for a point-and-shootWaterproof - tested it many times to beyond 10 feetShockproof - tested it many times to beyond 5 feetAmazes your friends and bystanders when you pull it out and take pictures with it in the waterGo-anywhere-fit-in-your-pocket size and designCons:Video not so goodBattery life sucksBattery meter frustrating - full green until about ten pictures left then goes to red - very little warningDoesn't save last picture mode at power-down - goes back to AutoChanging picture modes requires several steps - hard to get quick picturesShutter lag time - however I found if you hold the shutter button down (like focusing it) until right before you need the picture, then depress it completely the lag time is almost non-existent.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "S.

The two big draws of this camera are that it's waterproof and shockproof. I have a 3 year old and taking pictures is an everyday thing. The 7.0 MP is great. the pictures have great detail. It is very small, great to stick in a pocket, although I have taken a picture of my finger on more than one occassion. I bought the 1GB memory card to go with it and an extra battery. the battery does run out quickly so 2 is a must. The 1 GB card is great, I can put a ton of pictures on there or 40 minutes of videoThe only thing I dont like about it is the software to download the pictures. To get them saved on my hard drive or a CD I have to download them to the program, then transfer to the hard drive, then burn to cd. It takes a little while to get it completed. However I also bought the USB card reader Olympus 202049 USB 200 Media Reader/writer, so I can just pull out the card stick it in the USB and download to any computer, software or not. because the images are large files downloading isn't exactly a quick process, but again the quality makes it worth it.I would definetly recomend it to others, especially for the price!", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great camera with some annoying drawbacks", "Author": "John AKA Cali \"Certified Engineerd\"", "ReviewID": "RSMKT7HY4PGCV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for 6 months now, and I thought I would take some time to share my thoughts. After owning two fantastic Canon digital point-n-shoots, and a Canon 20D (SLR), I was swayed by the camera store rep to buy this water and shock resistant unit. I think it is a great camera, but I do say that with some reservations and additional comments.1. Olympus uses not only an annoying proprietary memory card but also a unique mini-USB jack. Why they would skip the industry standard MINI-USB jack used on every other camera and on my BlackBerry is beyond me. These Olympus-only image storage and transfer devices are extremely frustrating when trying to share photos with friends. I just got back from a week long trip with friends and having forgotten my cable, I had no way to share my photos while on the trip, while the Canon users could swap photos with ease.2. Image quality - I did some back to back testing with my old Canon SD300 versus the Olympus 720SW, and have continued to compare images by to my Canon image library and in my non-professional opinion, I think the Canon takes better pictures.3. Cycle time - slower than I would like.4. Battery life - buy at least 2 batteries. Battery life is shorter than my old Canon SD cameras. Oh, and the charger has a huge cable on it, rather than the compact Canon units with integrated plug - an annoyance when trying to pack light!Now, in light of these reservations and annoyances, I have had enjoyed this camera. I don't have to worry about getting it wet or dropping it (I also purchased the silicone skin) which is a huge relief for someone like me who takes their camera on ski trips (and frequently crashes) and other vacations. Images print 8x10 no problem. Now if Olympus would use standard memory cards and USB cables, this would be a fantastic unit...until then, don't forget your cable!", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing pics for a small tote-with-you camera.", "Author": "J Bean", "ReviewID": "R1T20EXC69FF4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a recent trip to Kauai.  It absolutely surpassed my expectations.  It was extremely portable, in fact, it was in either my shirt or shorts pocket the entire time.  I took it on rainy hikes, swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, and of course, to the beach.  I wasn't worried about it getting wet or smooshed at all, because of the water- and shock-proof qualities.I was worried about the lack of a viewfinder before purchasing, but it honestly didn't hinder my photo taking at all.  It was a bit tough in high light situations, but the gigantic screen made up for that fact.The only drawback is something that definitely has a work around.  If it gets taken in the water or it gets wet, you have to be careful to wipe off the lens cover the next time you open it.  Otherwise, water streaks show up on your images.  It takes a while to dry out for some reason.  Another tip, be sure to rinse it off in fresh water after being in saltwater.

Since I was scared it wouldn't work once it hit the water I took my other digital camera with me just in case. I didn't want to be left with no camera on my vacation, to my great suprise I never even took my back up out of my luggage. I got in the water looked at my friends and said here it goes ladies. After coming back up from under the water and seeing that my camera was still working I was really excited and the picture came out really clear. You can see the flash underwater too so you know when the picture snaps. I also took great pictures of the Island when we were on a speed boat and again to my surprise there wasn't the slightest bit of blurriness. And it was going pretty fast, lol. I have great memories of my trip. Underwater, out to sea, counting the New Year down, and just pictures of my girls hanging out. Of course I had tons of people asking me how it works underwater. Some people were even concerned. They would run up to me and tell me be careful you'll wet your camera and as they watched us take pictures underwater their mouths just dropped. They were amazed to see the outcome. And you have to believe I dropped it. So shockproof? Yeah I would say it is because it fell pretty hard, Oops! I read a lot of reviews before buying this camera and I remember people complaining about how it doesn't save your settings when you turn your camera off but surprise once again, my settings would stay as is. Pretty neat! I've been back for almost a month and I use my camera for everything. I have yet to have a negative moment with it. It takes great pictures and it's real easy to use. People were also complaining because it takes an XD-picture card but that was actually a blessing for me because I already had 3 of those from my Fuji FinPix Digital camera and a lot of the features where the same so I haven't even had to take out the manual yet.

It's awesome to be able to bring the camera to a rained-out concert or to the pool and not have to worry. Now if they can just combine that capability with my cellphone & iPod, I'd be REALLY pleased (imagine that -- a waterproof iPhone4!) :)Anyway, back to the Olympus here. The trouble is - and it seems that others notice this too -- that the camera just doesn't take good pictures. No matter what settings I would put it on, or even with the presets -- most my pictures all have turned out blurry. I think I have a decent handle of how I might take good photos, and I've passed the camera to several more adept photographer friends of mine. Even in daylight situations, quick motion is hard to capture. The camera requires very steady hands and a slow response to take a decent photo. Often, shadowed areas of the photos also seem more dull in color!Another problem is that I also take many of my pictures at night: at concerts, in the club, etc. This camera cannot 'tahan'.We should be at a technological point where a candle-lit dinner doesn't require flash for sharp, beautiful photos. But this Olympus always requires the flash.And, at a distance, the flash often illuminates the particles within a 3 foot range, blowing out whatever is in the foreground and creating all sorts of odd orbs and such, whilst leaving the desired target (let's say a stage) in darkness. In close-up photos, my friend's faces are needlessly 'over-exposed' -- and we all know how unflattering flash can be (red-eye, oily faces, etc.) If at all possible, I don't want to take any photos with flash. This camera just can't handle available light! :(I feel that this is a good start on a product that really needs to be refined more. Once they put the photo-quality of some of the Canons or HP digital cameras I've seen into a rugged, slim and stylish exterior of this Olympus, then I can recommend it as a purchase for anyone that cares about their memories and quality of their photographs!

A few weeks ago I had this camera on the beach and one of the people I was hanging out with spilled their drink on it.  She panicked and started apologizing immediately.  I took the camera down to the water and washed the soda off of it and started taking pictures again.  I did get a kick out of her reaction.  I'm not a camera expert and I don't know anything about ISO's or anything else mentioned in the some of the previous reviews, but this camera takes nice pictures and not even I can break it.  At my previous rate of buying new cameras, I have saved thousands of dollars with this purchase.Need a con?  Here is is...  After nearly five years of using this camera the battery life isn't what it used to be.That's it folks.  Maybe in a couple years I'll be able to say my MAC has lasted me that long.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for.....", "Author": "PJD \"smart shopper 30144\"", "ReviewID": "RQF0GEJAT7DKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera on keh.com web site as a used but in excellent + condition (which it is) for under sixty bucks.

I didn't even need to install any software to do it.After years of sea and pool water shots and a couple of falls the camera has finally started to act up, (refusing to start up sometimes) but we got 3 years of trouble-free service out of it even with the torture we put it through and to expect it to last forever would just be ridiculous.I'm very pleased with my purchase and if I can't get it fixed I'm gonna just buy the newer model.

I wanted a camera that was light weight and waterproof. When I found this I knew it was the one I wanted. I researched it, reading all the reviews, watching videos and looking at pictures it has taken. And I fell in love with it. I got a few memory cards for it and I was off to Hawaii. It took amazing pictures. Unfortunately when I went I wasn't able to go snorkeling due to rough surf but it held up well in the monsoon on the north end of the island! Wow, shock proof too?! I must have sat on this camera a dozen times and flipped out thinking I must have broken it and every time I was relieved to find out that it was still alive and in perfect working condition. I still use this camera every day and love it.It does however had somewhat of a delay. I've missed some photos because of it. You need to hold down the shutter button for a few seconds. And I wish it had a feature that when you shut the camera off and then turned it back on, lets say you were taking a video it would still be on video mode. Or at least there could be an option for it. I don't want to keep turning on and off the camera and then having to scroll to find the right setting every time. Maybe if there were a button on the side of the camera?Hopefully in the newer models that will be an upgrade?Overall, I still love this camera, and its great in the pool in the summer time, and even on the beach!

I own a Nikon SLR, but I don't want to use my camera in the boat or kayak due to the possibility of water damage, so I use this camera often as well.  I have really been pleased with the quality of the pictures.  They are really sharp -- easily the sharpest and highest quality photos I have seen out of the 4 different digital point and shoot cameras we have owned (the others being a Nikon Coolpix 3200, Canon Powershot A540, and a Polaroid A310 that we got for my son that was the absolute worst.)Also, the rechargeable battery is a wonderful feature.  I primarily used the Canon Powershot before getting my SLR, and it ran on AA batteries.  I thought that would be handier than a rechargeable battery, but I was wrong -- the 2 AA batteries wouldn't even last through one t-ball game, much less an entire day of shooting.  I missed so many memorable moments because my batteries had run out -- even though I tried to always keep replacement batteries with me, it would take a little time to change them out, and bam! the moment would be gone.  I have never owned a worse product as far as battery life.  However, this Olympus camera has lasted my husband a month on a single charge.  Granted, he doesn't take as many pictures as I take, but for it to last that long was remarkable.  And the rechargeable battery is much more economical -- I used to feel like I spent as much money on batteries as I would have on film when I kept pouring batteries into the canon.We bought this camera mainly for the waterproof feature, but the shockproof feature has, unintentionally, come in handy several times.  (Those of you with children can probably figure out why!)  For the price, I don't think that you can beat those two features.  Plus, we recently had an issue with a replacement part, and received absolutely wonderful customer service from Olympus.  \"Customer service\" seems to be a term that is nonexistent these days, so it was a pleasant surprise dealing with them.  I was so impressed, and would definitely buy an Olympus product again.All in all, this was a great purchase, and out of all the point and shoots we have owned, this is the only one that is still around and is still used regularly.

Pretty good pics in common situations.CONS, as with ANY pocket camera: the LCD is hard to see outdoors when you are in bright sunlight (unfortunately, most small cameras, except a few Canons, lack a viewfinder these days), the lens is tiny and doesn't extend, so sharpness and low-light performance is limited (but you don't have to wait for the lens to extend -- the camera, turns on or comes out of sleep pretty fast), limited zoom, you'll probably want to buy a higher-capacity xD memory card & they're are more expensive than other types.ADVICE: It's a good choice for a go-anywhere pocket camera.

My brother had a nice little Canon camera, but the fog and the rain we encountered on a trip to Newfoundland ruined his camera, even though he carried it inside his breast coat pocket and it never got wet.  I find that if I pick the right mode, I get very nice pictures. Is this camera on par with my Canon AE-1?  Absolutely not, but then I'm not going to take that camera on a bike trip or in the mountains or out in wet weather either.  The 720 SW fits nicely in any pocket I want to put it in.  I did buy some screen protectors for the LCD and those have worked nicely.  I find the camera easy enough to use to suit my purposes.  It will do more than I ask, but then so will my cellphone.  I got a 500mb chip and it will hold about 290 pictures and the battery will support that many.  True, in bright light it may be challenging sometimes to \"frame\" your shot on the LCD, but my television set has the same problem if I don't draw the shades.

Keep the camera!  My pictures!I bought this camera in May 2006, since I wanted to take pictures of my kids on the beach.  My biggest problem is that the LCD screen is useless when you are in bright sunlight.  It dims out so much that there is absolutely no way to see exactly what you are taking pictures of.  The easiest thing to see is your own reflection in the LCD screen.  (By the way, as far as I can tell there is no way to brighten the screen).Another problem is that the lens is in the upper corner of the camera near your left hand, and since you can't see what you are taking pictures of, most of my pictures have at least part of my finger in it.My other issue is that is has a proprietary battery charger.  Although the camera connects to your computer via USB, this DOES NOT in any way charge the camera.  In fact, it drains your battery very quickly.  So when you travel, don't forget that charger, because they are not easy to find.  (Apparently Office Max is the only store that carries a compatible charger).Another issue is that if you are in the ocean taking pictures of waves and kids splashing, drops of salt water obviously get on the lens, and your pictures will suffer.My advice if you want to take these kinds of pictures is to buy a disposable waterproof camera.

I think it was a good buy, it photographs underwater and is shock-proof for 5 feet (it got field tested it when told my dad it was shock proof and he reached out to take a look at it, only to \"accidently\" drop it). Needless to say, it's survived several drops from a lot higher than 5 feet. I like the stabilization feature it provides, so if a picture comes out a bit blurry you can always retake it with a \"sharper\" clarity.Negatives, it's not the best camera for low light, but then again, few compact digital cameras are good for low light. It's also pretty sketchy if you're trying to take a picture of something further away than 15 feet or really close up, like less than 6 inches away. The focus just isn't designed for that. It doesn't take too long to record the pictures to memory either, although I have seen some cameras that are faster. I'm not complaining about it though, it's great for going to sporting events and family gatherings because it's compact and the screen is big to show everyone the picture you've just taken.

I shot some photos for a few weeks and tried to convince myself that the quality was satisfactory (200x sharpening in Photoshop Elements II among other fixes were needed). Then took it on my once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and floating on the surface I pointed the camera down (perhaps a few inches below the surface) and the screen went blank. I guess it is not water tight after all, and now will go back to the seller as a bad purchase. I know, I know -- I should have tested it under water before I left home rather than believe the specs but was too rushed to do it.

'06 issue of Popular Photography. He let me take it. This camera's picture made me fall in love with it and forgot about my scary trip to the camera shop fiddling with the Fuji Fine Pix F30 that is very difficult to handle when you've never had a digital camera. I've ordered the Olympus 720SW from my camera store and will get it Tuesday. The features are incredible! I loved the screen. Not huge so not disorienting.The controls? Not confusing. I have small fingers, so handling the buttons was no problem for me. I loved the camera settings so it takes the guess work on taking a particular type of picture. I like the stabilization that was so good I could focus in on a very small piece of artwork of mine. The saleswoman recommended that I get a spare battery as she always has one for hers. She even sells carrying cases which I'll get. I even got to experiment with the movie making mode. So neat when you've never done it before. I can't wait until Tuesday when I can buy this camera and it's accessories which will include charger, spare battery, probably the original battery too, and of course the 1MB memory.

However, the good things end there. The camera (7.1MP) takes poor images for your average (out of water) shot. The shots are blurry and it is hard to find the proper settings in each condition. The Xd card is super slow, takes several seconds before the camera is ready to shoot again. My suggestion buy the canon elf and just take the extra time to put it in a waterproof housing. My 4MP canon elf takes a much better quality image. I will not buy another Olympus product, my next camera will be the 7.1MP canon elf.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "dissapointed..soon returned", "Author": "sammy", "ReviewID": "R1A4NTC9U1EAIJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "At first the camera seemed like a great buy with lots of unique features.

If you use this mode, it cancels out any other mode you try to select.*Recharger is very bulky and not travel friendly, combined with...*Short battery life.Positives are that this thing is bullet proof and can take underwater shots... that is about it!
