Kinney \"DJ\"", "ReviewID": "RBX528EP3WOMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE TRUTH: Most of these cameras are assembled from the same parts made at the same factories in China, creating clones and copies, and ripping off each other's ideas. This camera is identical to many other cameras you'll find on the hobby sites, complete with focusing lens (replaceable) and exposed circuitry on the back. The difference is that this is Prime, and you don't have to wait for a month for the slow boat from Hong Kong.THE GOOD: I think the unit feels very solid. It definitely uses the same optics as any of the other Chinese-made cameras of this kind, all the way up to the $200 FPV cams (I believe it's a 2.5mm lens). The body is solid. There are mounting holes as well and can easily be sealed up with some resin.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: This is not a replacement for a high-end FPV cam and it is never going to look as good as a GoPro. I do believe that it has 520 lines, but there is a lot of softness in the image. It has absolutely no ability to show very bright and very dark areas simultaneously. The light absolutely will blow out. With that said, if it's outside for FPV or inside trying to catch an employee stealing, it'll work. Just don't put it in a position to need to capture daylight and interior. This is not a high-definition camera. It just isn't. But I am going to be using it as a downward facing landing camera or possibly an emergency secondary camera if my GoPro fails during a flight. It's perfect for that.MORE TRUTH: It does not get hot on 5 volts. It does not shut off intermittently. The negative reviews here seem to have additional problems going on with hardware and/or basic electrical knowledge.I'll probably buy another one.I am going to be using this camera for an FPV ship.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great low-cost product for size, light sensitivity, and responsive vendor!", "Author": "Geoff", "ReviewID": "R3V1YE3ELFFK07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the model MC495 camera.  I have 12 operating, and found them very reliable over the past 2 years.Every one I ordered from Securitying arrived promptly, in excellent condition.  This product accomodates a wide range of lighting conditions, and the advertised 0.008 lux/F1.2 sensitivity featured allows operation in very low light conditions at night, without IR LED illumination.  The camera has an exposed PC circuit board and wires glued on the backside that require strain relief and anadded layer of physical protection from the elements, if used outdoors.  This camera comes with a wide angle 90 deg 3.6mm lens.  I found two other vendors on Amazon that offer 6mm, 12mm, and 18mm lenses at nominal cost that are interchangeable for this camera.  I have not used the auxiliary microphone to be able to rate audio.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, sound is acceptable", "Author": "B. E.

They shoot excellent video quality in moderate lighting and even in very low lighting they still deliver a clear picture but with a loss of color.  The audio quality from the built in microphone is not great and the only reason I did not give 5 stars.  If you want to be able to make out anything below normal conversation levels you might want to consider adding an external mic.
