{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great point and shoot camera for casual pictures", "Author": "Cinpii", "ReviewID": "RASN06P61S3FL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want a handy point and shoot camera that takes decent pictures, this one is great.Size:I have no complaints about the size.  Most cameras can't fit into my small pockets (face it, girl pockets are TINY!), but this one slips in great.  I esp. like carrying it in my back pocket so I can whip it out easily when I need to, and since it's so slim, it doesn't look bulgy back there.  Another plus, and this is purely vain, the slim size creates a lot of product envy in other people.  So if you like people fawning over how cool your camera looks, this is good for that. =)Picture quality:For casual picture takers, this should be sufficient.  If you are particularly picky about picture quality though, I'd recommend something else.  I've seen several Canon Powershots with lower MP that took better pictures than this one.Functionality:I'd say it's very simple and intuitive to use.  The interface is very clean and the Best Shot features make it a lot easier to take better pictures.Overall:I like this camera a lot.  I've used two older Exilim models in the past, this one makes three, and I've liked all of them.  The size really can't be beat, it takes unlimited movies (well, unless you run out of memory), and it's very fast.  Again, if you want super nice picture quality though, go with something else.  It really depends on what your priorities are.Caveat:This camera is great for taking pictures of other people, but not for taking pictures of yourself.  When you use the Best Shot function for self portraits, it has this really odd time delay, so you don't know when the shot will be taken.  If you can get over that (or just don't use that function at all), then you should be fine.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect picture quality", "Author": "gooseberry", "ReviewID": "R1QON8MY5ASRFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As for the picture quality it's just perfect and very easy to use. The camera turns on very fast. I'll update my review if i find any flaws.I just returned Olympus FE-340 - well designed a camera too, a bit larger though, AND yields picture indeed of poor quality (very pale, morbidly pale) compared to this Casio camera.

I have a big, fancy SLR camera that takes great pictures, but is so bulky and difficult to cart around to certain events.  Also, I have a high definition cam corder that also creates great high quality video, but the files are so huge and difficult to upload to the web to share with family.This little camera is perfect for anyone wanting to take casual pictures and videos on the go.  I use it everyday to capture random moments in my family's life.  I upload pictures directly to my blog almost everyday, and I am also able to easily upload videos to YouTube.  This is the perfect camera for me, especially with two little kids growing up so fast.  I captured my daughter's first steps recently and immediately uploaded the video to my blog and YouTube so that family in different parts of the country could share in the moment.", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Too slow if you are trying to capture pictures of your children", "Author": "L. McCoy, Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1XNRIMD95UJ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Even though the reveiws I read gave this camera high marks for speed, I didn't find that to be true. Even with a high speed memory card, and all the bells and whistles turned off, the response time was too slow to capture my grandson in action.....or even quickly enough when I had his short lived attention. I wouldn't buy it again, nor recommend it.Also, even though the Amazon Marketplace providors are supposed to allow you 30 days for return, 17th Street Photo wouldn't make a refund or even an exchange. Their cut off is 7 days. I have purchased things from them previously with no problem. I just didn't agree with their return policy, since it isn't in line with the information on the Amazon page about Marketplace returns.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Proprietary USB Cable", "Author": "drbobo", "ReviewID": "R3QQV6DLPATA58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera with ONE exception!The USB cable is proprietary.

I needed a camera for personal use to take pictures when I go and trips, etc. I could not have chosen a better camera. I went to NYC for the first time (I'm from GA) a few weeks ago. The pictures turned out amazing! Great for the person who doesn't want to worry with whether the light is right or if a moving car will mess up the shot! Just point and shoot and a perfect picture every time! No complaints!

I had a previous model which was just as good. I am really happy with the Casio Exilim.

Photo quality, just alright.", "Author": "dubbledubs", "ReviewID": "RYBUJUNA0OGKF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First the good stuff - this camera is the slimmest one I've ever owned.  It's thinner than my phone when I throw it in my pocket, which makes it easy to take with you wherever you go.Now the minuses - picture quality is good, not great.  Compared to my Canon camera, which was only 3 megapixels, picture quality and lens on this thing is not as sharp.  The photos look fine, but they are noticeably not as crisp.  Also for some reason, I can't figure out how to take a timed photo with this.  It has some neat auto-photo capabilities (like, it takes a photo only when subjects smile), but where's the regular old timer, Casio?", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect Point & Shoot Camera", "Author": "RLH", "ReviewID": "R2EZLZS8RHVL11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 3 kids, so a good battery life and a small camera I can keep in my back pocket are MUST HAVES. Well this camera does not disappoint. I can go DAYS with this camera in my purse, use it several times a day, without having to charge it, it's amazing. It's SO slim I forget it's in my pocket. It comes in gorgeous colors, I have the blue and people are constantly saying how nice it is. The menu system is pretty straight forward and the pictures have all come out wonderful. The one touch button video recording is so simple and videos are great quality for a digital camera. I HIGHLY recommend this camera, you will love it.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "great pictures but very fragile", "Author": "emji14", "ReviewID": "RDT8YH0H83KBQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I actually had two of these cameras. Both produced absolutely amazing images, I give them a lot of credit there-- very sharp, the colors were perfect, and in general, i didn't have to edit anything.  The battery life was also amazing (especially compared to my old camera which lasted a few hours at most). My main issue with these is the fragility..NOTE: I am slightly OCD and very cautious.. my previous camera (and now current one- an old Pentax Optio) has lasted over 5 years with minor scratches and no real issues. I kept these in their cases, always with the band tight around my wrist.1. the first camera dropped about 3-5 inches into a grassy, slighty damp ground, and the LCD completely cracked, rendering it useless.  The LCD screen is slightly elevated off the back of the camera, so it is easy to damage.2. the second camera got a grain of sand in the zoom/lens motor while I was at the beach, and was too costly to repair (almost the same as buying a new one). Apparently, the lens motor on this is very delicate according to a few camera repair people.Lastly, my sister has an older Exilim model, which was also great (not as good as this one, but still had great image quality)-- her camera's lens failed just after the warranty period (1 yr), one minute it was working, the next minute everything was blurry.  SO! I have become pretty suspicious of Casio Exilims, I think with good reason.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Casio People - Please Read", "Author": "Brian Boles", "ReviewID": "REO891OAF2XNS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this camera, it's super small and well featured.I have one beef I hope the Casio people can address.There is no charging cradle available !!
