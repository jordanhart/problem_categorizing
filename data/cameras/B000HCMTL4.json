We have several wireless GN Netcom wireless headsets in our office and one was just not holding a charge any longer.  Since replacing the battery using this kit, the headset is now working as good as new.  The kit was relatively easy to use and the instructions were clear.  I would buy this again when we need to replace another one of our headset batteries.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked Perfectly", "Author": "David A.

The one thing that keeps this from being a full five stars is the fact that the screw drivers were not magnetized. I would have liked it better if the screw drivers were magnetized due to the extremely small size of the screw holding the battery in place. That being said, the kit does come with an extra screw or two in case one gets lost.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Jon E.

Same package I ordered last time I replaced my battery, and that one lasted two years or so.Came packaged as pictured, with jeweler's screwdrivers.  These were not necessary for my headset (maybe for the 9125?), but they're surprisingly decent quality so I've hung on to them.  No need for the tiny torx yet, though.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "BretW", "ReviewID": "R3YKECKMIAEUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife's headset was not holding a charge, used this battery and it was easy to replace and works well!", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice easy fix for a dead battery.", "Author": "G.

My GNNetcom 9120 was starting to only give about an hour of talk time before needing juice. It was also flashing charge a lot while sitting on the base. It was the battery. Swapped it out with this kit and all is perfect again. I can talk all day and then some. Headset good as new.Including the screw and torx drivers was a nice touch. My steak knives are thankful for not having to do such an un-steak-knife-like job turning that itty bitty screw.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't fix my headset.", "Author": "Walker", "ReviewID": "R3CR1WOXZ1LCD9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Maybe I didn't buy the exact right replacement battery, but it didn't fix my Netcom headset and I ended up buying a different one.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000HCMTL4"}}
