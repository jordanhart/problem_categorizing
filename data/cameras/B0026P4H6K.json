The mic location could be better because there is an electronic sounds that dominates the audio at high speeds.Review:I bought this camera to help make videos of my dad's Camero and Ducati for his father's day present, mostly just to get another angle. The price was great on Amazon! With all the discounts I got it for $230 which is seventy dollars cheaper than anywhere else. The shipping was great, I ordered it on a Thursday and I arrived on a Monday day.I just took the camera for a spin mounted on the rear foot peg on my Triumph street bike. I used the included goggle mount, a strap from an old headlamp and some zip ties to secure the camera. The goggle mount can be used to mount it pretty must anywhere that is vertical and has something you can run a zip tie around. The video looked pretty good but like I said earlier I wouldn't call it HD. On my 24 inch iMac it looks pretty blurry and graining even when I am not moving to be considered HD but for a small camera it looks great. It is also nice not to have to have an external recording device and all the wires required for connecting. In both settings, HD and SD the video looks great! Both are in widescreen with the HD at a little higher resolution.The sound is also great. I was probably going 60 or 70 a few times and the wind was noticeable but not annoying. The sound quality when used in a still setting is amazing for such a small camera. I tested it around the house a few times and the sound was great.Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to record Point of View sports action. The quality of the product and video are well worth the price. I would see what you can do with the included mounting options for you order the other mounts.

I must preface this by saying I use these cameras in a unique application, that being on a military helicopter. Both have their pro's and con's but since we are talking about the ContourHD, I will offer this:Pro's:Resolution, it is HD of course. It does fish eye a bit more than I would like.All-in-one: No separate components..everything is literally right in your hand. (can be a draw back) No wires....Laser for making sure the camera is mounted properly.USB Chargeable battery with decent life.30 minutes of HD per gig..comes with a 2 gig card. A larger card really is needed.PRICE!! Excellent.Cons:Not anything close to Mil-Spec like the POV.1 (That thing was built for the military)On/Off switch can slide back and you would never know it. Fixed in later serial numbers.Mounting options are minimal.No lens cover..really? Fix that.Packaging looks pretty on a shelf but mine arrived bouncing around in the pretty plastic box.No included case.The all-in-one design offers limitations for remote operations. You have to be within arms reach to use this thing. Also, you have no ideal what you are shooting or what you shot until you get back to your computer. (The POV.1 has the handheld unit so you can see, and edit, what you are shooting...but comes at the expense of bulk and wires)Depending on your application, this could be and is a great camera. For what I need it for, it is too limited...until I modify the mounts!

Yes, the mic could be better.  But when you're haulin', wind noise will almost always be a factor.  Battery life?  Eh, sure it's not fabulous... but once you pick this thing up, see and feel the size of it, realize that there are NO external parts, and then see the video it produces?  You'll forgive the battery life.  Buy another battery, which is easy to do when your entire helmet cam costs less than half of anything even remotely in the same league (although nothing actually IS in the same league).Positives?  Where do I begin?  This thing is all-inclusive (did I mention NO external wires at ALL?), very lightweight (I hardly notice its presence on my bike helmet), super easy to use, and records unbelievably smooth (I found it almost too smooth, in fact... looks like a cable cam is flying through the trees as opposed to me rolling rocks on my mountain bike) HD video.  Yes, the HD isn't as clear as it could be, but if you've read any of the other benefits of this cam, believe me you won't care.  The video is still leagues (and I mean LEAGUES) ahead of anything that is out there for this amount of money (and most of the stuff that costs at least twice as much... I'm looking at you, VIO).  I've been disappointed in the quality of video of every helmet cam I've used until now.This device is worth every penny.  Make sure your computer can edit HD video though, otherwise everything will look choppy.Buy this camera as soon as you can.  It's a blast.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best option, for now.", "Author": "Hammer Down", "ReviewID": "R3BZ8DG56ABWCV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the price, and I give it four stars. I'm only going to focus on the cons for this review.1) This is probably the most annoying thing about the camera, but it probably won't bother everyone. There are random vertical purple lines that appear periodically on the video. They seem to show up more in the daylight outdoors than inside. I've noticed them on dozens of other people's shared videos on [...] community site. I'm not sure what causes them. The video quality itself is okay, but I think the term \"HD\" is an over-exaggeration. The wide angle is outstanding, but the edges of the video are blurry.2) Lack of mounting options. I'd like to see a picatinny rail mount designed for it, so that it could be mounted on military weapons. However, I'm not sure how well the video would record with the shock of recoil.3) The battery latch seems cheap, and I'm sure I'm going to end up breaking it off soon.4) Take the term \"weather resistant,\" very loosely. If it's raining, put it away.Overall, I think the ContourHD is probably the best helmet camera available for the price. Sony makes a true HD helmet camera, but it costs over a thousand dollars and has a thick cable running from the camera to the display screen. Go Pro is making a 1080p helmet camera that is as waterproof as their Go Pro Hero, and will be available either sometime later this year or the beginning of next year for around the same price as the ContourHD.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "BRACKET BROKE and Camera Flew off my Race Bike and ended up in the middle of the RaceTrack... STILL WORKS!!!", "Author": "Stefano Braca \"CrazySte\"", "ReviewID": "R333QRQTYDTIZ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HI EVERYBODYi received as a gift a Contour HD Camera for Christmas 2009 to record Videos while i go on the RaceTrack with my SuperBike.In March i had the first RaceTrack Day of the Season, i entered on the RaceTrack for a Practice Session, the VideoCamera was Flat mounted on the Tank of my Motorcycle, well covered from the wind.The Bracket was attacched with his own 3M Adhesive on the top of a Semi-Soft padding thing i made to dampening the vibrations, the padding is then glued to the tank.After 10 minutes of Riding, i saw my Camera laying in the middle of the Asphalt in the front Straight where we normally pass at about 130-140mph.I got back into the pits, called for a Yellow Flag before somebody got hurt and got back the Camera.The Camera was open, it lost the Main Battery and the SD Card, fortunately i found the Battery laying about 30 feet away from where the Camera was, the Memory Card instead was lost..The Bracketing Rails Broke... basically one of the 2 rails of the mount attached to the Bike broke, possibly due to the Vibrations, so the Camera was holding with only one rail instead of 2, but the effort was too much and the Central Rail of the Camera failed and let the Camera fell off.The impact with the Asphalt must have been extremely hard considering that in that part of the RaceTrack we speed around 130-140mph, plus it is possible that the Camera got also ran over considering that i found it in a different spot from when i saw it the first time.In the Impact, the ring around the lenses got ovalized, but the glass was intact, the LED Glasses of the indicators were all gone and also the little pin that holds the Battery.AMAZINGLY the Camera still worked, once i got home i putted in a different SD Card and tried to Record a Video while holding with my finger the Battery in place, the Camera Recorded a Video just fine and even the Lasers still Worked.CUSTOMER SERVICEi Called the Customer Service and told them that the Bracket Broke in pieces and let the Camera fly off and that i wanted to at least have it fixed under warranty.The answer was that they do now Warranty these devices for accidents but only for Factory problems.I Replied that the Camera was NEW and so was the Bracket that failed after about 10 minutes of use, which i don't think that that matches with the Factory specs, especially when they commercialize that that bracket is supposed to hold the Camera even mounted standing up on the side of the Helmet... well in here it was flat mounted and it failed without having been solicited that much.The Customer Service guy shipped me all the parts needed at his cost, he also e-mailed to me the instructions to mount the various parts which where: 2 Railings for the Camera, New Lens Ring and New Lenses even if they were intact, new back door with new LED Glasses and the Battery PIN, a new Bracket Mount to substitute the broken one.Then i got a phone call from the Customer Support Guy which he said that he spoke with his Manager and he authorized to Refurbish the Camera under Warranty, so i mailed to Camera to Twenty20.Meanwhile i received the Package with all the parts, and they told me that i could have kept them.After few days they Sent me and Email stating that my Camera was one of the worse that they have ever seen after one that fell off the helmet of a Skydiving guy and one that was involved in an Airplane Crash, they were amazed by the fact that the Camera Recorded Videos perfectly and how well the casing resisted (it was all scratched, but not deformed) anyway they have Replaced all the parts that were Replaceable.Today i got my Camera Back, it looks like New.I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE especially considering that this device was supposedly out of warranty.The Camera is Super Strong, amazingly Tough, i feel confident to say that it is indestructible, unfortunately i can't say the same for the Bracket that holds it.I suggest everybody to use some kind of safety wiring system to prevent losing the camera, other than that, this is a great device, it records great quality videos, the Audio it is not the best, but for me this is a great device that i would raccomand to everybody.BEST REGARDS", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply great", "Author": "Condo Guy", "ReviewID": "RIVOGJ2SOUBIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For an outdoor or extreme sports participant, this camera can not be currently matched.  720p video, great color, light weight, and mountable anywhere are its hallmarks.

Segal", "ReviewID": "RB744NXTV40B6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having owned and used the ContourHD for over a month now, I want to share my thoughts on the unit for those considering purchasing it.First, on the utility of the unit.  My initial reason for purchasing the unit was to mount inside my car and to record as I drove, sort of like a cop style dash cam.  Since the only way to make the unit record is to physically press the power button (there isn't a remote or wire to run to the car battery)you can't have it auto start recording when you turn the car on.  So, for car recording, you'll have an additional step when turning on and off your car (powering up the unit to record).  Mounting wasn't well done either.  This package should have included a suction cup for the window/smooth helmet (since the unit claims its great for mounting on helmets).  Instead, it comes with a sticky base so you can only attach it to one item, at one spot.  This limits where and how often you can reposition the item (unless you buy an after market suction cup.)Now onto the performance of the actual unit.  The unit has 2 record settings.  HD and standard (SD).  HD is the wide 135 degree view which gives it a sort of fish-eye bubble look when I play it back on my computer however it is true that it is highly detailed.  I suggest using it in SD mode though.  SD takes half the space but the record and playback looks normal (flat and not fish-eye) and even though its 'only' 90 degrees, it is also recording in 60fps which is perfect for fast action (as in driving fast).  I've used this camera outside of my car as well.  I mounted it on my desk and have recorded my day at the office.  The video quality is great - rivaling any camcorder.  Now for the bad stuff.  First, the audio.  The mic is built into the unit.  It captures what the user is saying just fine but even 10 feet away, the sound is low.  My coworker sitting at his desk, though recorded crystal clear, can only be heard as a low murmur while I came out loud and clear while I was recording our chat.  This makes this less than ideal as a substitute for a camcorder and to make things worse, there is no audio in jack to run an external mic.  You're stuck with the tiny mic on the top of the unit.Another drawback to this unit is there is no zoom.  The lens is also fixed, you cannot swap it out for anything but what it came with from the factory.Onto the accessories:  The package comes bundled with its own unique rechargeable battery meaning once it looses its ability to hold charge, you'll have to order it from the manufacturer.  I ordered a 2nd battery at the same time just in case.  It also comes with a 2GB microSD card which is the only type of memory card it can record onto.  This camera GOBBLES up memory so go out and buy a 16GB card (its the largest this unit can support).  Make sure you get the class 2 or better microSD card (the higher the class, the faster the read/write speed which you'll appreciate once you try and unload the file to your computer).The included battery charger is extremely cheap and plastic crap.  The usb charger barely fits into the adapter and the connection is weak, I had to use tape to hold them together.The software included is terrible.  It comes with 1 program which simply lets you crop the length of the clip.  You can't even rotate the clip with it.  If you recorded the movie upside down, the ONLY way to flip it is buy getting third party software.  And that is another problem, the unit only records into .mov format so windows movie maker can't even handle it.  You're forced between buying the apple quicktime PRO or getting a file converter to make the .mov into .avi/wma to edit on windows but then you start loosing file quality and that defeats the purpose of recording in HD.  Like the accessories, the included software is dismal.Lastly, for anyone who has used a camcorder before, you'll notice this unit lacks an LCD.  You can't check what you're recording until AFTER its done and you're plugged into a computer.  There isn't even a video out to plug your own LCD into it to check.So to sum up, I don't like the lack of versatility in selecting the recording format, the crappy audio capture, and the weak software suite included.  For this price ($299-325) you can get yourself a full camcorder with 20X or better zoom and multiple recording format options AND with built in LCD for playback.  This product is something strictly for helmet/bicycle action capture.I have since replaced this unit with a JVC camcorder with zoom, hard drive recording with an external mic line and of course, its LCD which I can flip open to see how the recording is going.  The price for the JVC was also $299 for the 20GB HD model. (40GB is now out)  I gave my contourHD to my little brother as a present for the coming holidays.  He also has a camcorder and only uses the contour to record point of view (POV) action shots for his movie making hobby.I hope that lengthy review helps in your decision to get the unit.  I know I wish there was such a review that I could have read before buying the unit.

Quality is good, although it could be improved if they figure out a way to add image stabilization to it.  The nature of a helmet camera would suggest you're going over terrain that requires use of both of your hands - although the picture quality is very acceptable, if you're skiing/biking over bumpy terrain, your picture will be bumpy.  But what can you really expect for $250?I'm a little disappointed with the build quality.  The velcro they used for the helmet mount is stronger than the adhesive and plastic that it is attached to.  When I attached the velcro to the mount and took it off, the back side of the velcro came of with a couple plastic pieces from the mounting plate.  Hence I can't use the velcro mount any more.  I'm in the process of epoxying the mount back into place.  The goggle strap is sufficient to use for skiing.The other problem was that as we were turning on and off the camera we kept popping open the back of the camera.  it wasn't a huge problem, it was easy enough to pop back into place, but it was a little annoying.  It's a design flaw that i'm sure they'll correct.I still like the camera a lot and can't wait to take it back up to the mountain.The microphone was sub par.  But then again if you're skiing @ 30 miles per hour you are going to make a lot of wind noise.  We had to remix the video with background music since the audio on the video was pretty useless.A note to new users of this camera - when mounting the camera either on the goggle strap or the helmet mount, make sure you angle the camera to film 10-15 degrees above your site line.  You don't realize how often you look down as you're skiing until you have a camera.  Our fist group of footage was a bunch of snow and the tips of my skiis.  Caught so little of the terrain.Another note to people buying this camera is that the battery life is only 2 hours each and recharges via USB.  If you were to record the entire 2 hours on the microSD card you would only use 4GB of memory.  If you have two batteries the most you would record is 8GB of video.  It's no use getting a 16GB memory card because most likely you'll dl the video when you recharge.  Even 4 hours of video is a lot.  On a 7 hour day of skiing we recorded 90 minutes of actual skiing.  The rest of the time we were riding up lifts, waiting in lift lines, eating lunch, waiting for the slow skiers to catchup.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "It works", "Author": "xfooey", "ReviewID": "RBA5HCC8OU4WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "only rated battery life and durability as a 3 star (neutral) cause I haven't had it long enough to know.  sound is kind of crappy when it's windy out.  when i got the camera there was a problem with the image capture, it had an oval shaped blur on the video. called Twenty20, the mfg, left a vmail.  response was next day.  told them my problem, sent them a video clip, they sent me a new camera. no hassle at all. the customer service experience was excellent. it wasn't india, the rep was knowledgeable and empowered to make my day. i've gone and purchased the windshield attachment and a 16gb mircosd. a very nice rugged piece of hardware.  transfer to the computer is easy via firewire. i use the camera for my daily bike commute in NYC and when i drive. i now have a video document in case i need to prove what happened.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Helmet Cam", "Author": "R.

I was very surprised to find that the video quality was much better.  The camera is mounted to the goggles strap on my ski helmet.  My goggles are not that tight, and I expected to see a lot of movement in the video, this was not the case.  I have shot about 24 hours of video now, ranging from riding a snowmobile down a bumpy road at night, to hiking in the backcountry, telemark skiing on the groomers and in the backcountry, driving down the road in a fire engine, and even going into a smoke filled house.  We also recently used 3 cameras for my wedding in the mountains, both on the ski slopes, on a hike, and in the chapel!  All videos have great picture quality, sound, and not very much vibration.The camera does have some limitiations, but these should be apparent when you get the camera.  There is no light on the camera, so whereever your flashlight/headlight is pointing, that is the only thing you will see at night.  And of course there is no way to playback the video on the hill, however I found the lasers to do a great job setting up the view (as well as making sure the camera turnded on while it is mounted on your head!).Overall, Great camera!", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for outdoors sports", "Author": "Dmitry Fedorov", "ReviewID": "R3DGZPQG7608M8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is perfect for what it is designed for: outdoor sports. I've used it skiing and biking, worked great.Cons: There are a few caveats though. The sensor is not very sensitive so no night filming for you. During the day it is great. While skiing I've had the microphone stop working once in a while, it's either the cold or snow from my gloves blocked the hole.Pros: Battery lasts long and is chargeable with any USB complaint charger, I've used my iphone's and also GPS's. Head mounting is the way to go to reduce shake, it's way better than mounting any camera onto a bike's handle bar.Future: It would be great to have wireless access to the camera, to get the live video feed and also to control, say, start and stop.

The size and weight was exceptional but after viewing and editing the video, it was disappointing. On HD mode, there is very little focus on the center and completely out of focus around the edges. So HD mode is useless. SD mode was much better but still not able to focus.I read on the contour website that there was a batch of badly focused cameras that were shipped. I contacted their CSR and uploaded a video sample per their request. Their CSR is really good, but I was told that the poor focus was acceptable to their standards. I might have to shipped it to them at my expense and pay them to readjust the focus to my standards. Blurry faces and images isn't up to my standards for this price camera.My last option is to open it up myself and re-adjust the focus. but that will have to wait until the warranty expires. In the mean time, I'll use my son's flip ultraHD camera since it has a much better focused image than my ContourHD.Note: I've seen other people's videos on their ContourHD 720 and the quality was much better than mine.

I used it at first for motorcycle rides and got some great shots. The video actually has a wider angle than your eyesight so you pick up more scenery.I then tried to use it for snowboarding, it didnt turn out so good. The first few dry snow days it worked fine, but as soon as it became humid/icy, the camera started malfunctioning, either shutting off or freezing up, aka wouldn't record despite it being on. And no, I didnt get any snow on it, it was just a really wet day.I suspect the battery is really susceptible to cold weather so it has issues compensating under a low voltage.

I would tell you that this camera has a lot of great features. Rotating lens, alignment lasers, shoots to Micro SD cards, metal body and a host of mounts. The HD is isn't really HD. Sure its the aspect ratio of HD but when your riding down the street with this thing on shooting a simple bike ride you'll soon see what I mean about the footage. Its soft, murky and just not what HD is intended to be. I had a hard time screening the footage. Hoping the video quality was higher it lack of detail is flawed. The camera had a hard time with the simplest details. Shooting a tree with it I could barely see a leaf clean. Grass was just a smudge of green. They did over saturate the sensor so you get rich colors but for detail its gone. I'll probable try using it a few more times but I think it will eventually end up selling.
