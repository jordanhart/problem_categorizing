Fits well in shirt pocket. Very light; particullarly compared to my Pentax Optio 550. Good, nice size LCD. Easy to use yet with nice availability of choices for customization. Well written manual (you can find online thru google) and onboard help menu. Photos come out fairly nice. Tried indoors in low light with several scene settings, outdoors, macro, and supermacro. Colors look true, fairly sharp without noticable artifact. Used in South Florida morning daylight outside without any trouble with LCD viewing (camera has no classic viewfinder). Have read reviews of washout in bright sun: have not tried that yet. Overall, I'm happy with the camera thus far.*Next Day follow-up:  LCD does wash out in bright sunlight. Also it's reflective, making it quite difficut to use. Cupping or baseball hat helps enough to be able to use. I'll definetly order shade screen when Delkin comes out with custom shade for camera. Would lower overall rating to 3 stars if using out in bright sun much.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but ...", "Author": "Thomas M. Carter", "ReviewID": "R2QYOSD6N06L31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace an olympus 400. All in all, it takes great pictures. The image stabilization works very well. I took some test shots at dawn from a freeway bridge (low light conditions & bouncing from traffic)and the camera performed excellently. The shots turned out great. Good color saturation, and fairly sharp image. It also is weather resistant as was the 400, which was one of the MAJOR reasons I picked Olympus. I have had a camera \"fry\" because of a little rain during a picture shoot.It does seem to go through battery power quicker than I would like, especially if it is being used outdoors in the cold. But I planned ahead for that by buying two extra batteries just for that issue. The lack of an optical viewfinder, screen is in use all of the time, I suspect is a major culprit. I usually turned off the screen on my older camera to conserve battery life.As with many postings for this and most newer point & shoot cameras, the lack of an optical viewer is a critical flaw if shooting in bright environments. Between the reflected glare, and dim screen images, you just can't see a thing while composing your shot. Just point, shoot, and hope!I was looking at Digital SLR's for a next camera when I bought this camera.

This camera survived lots of blowing sand and dust, some light rain, being banged around in a daypack, and in the process acquired some dents and scratches, yet it still performs like a champ. The photos are fantastic. Yes, the LED screen is VERY difficult to see in bright sunlight--under those conditions you have to feel fairly confident about your ability to compose the shot, and for this reason alone I didn't give it five stars--but thanks to the autofocus and stabilization feature, the photos aren't blurry at all. Please note that although this camera is water-resistant, it is most assuredly NOT WATERPROOF. It will not withstand submersion.Purchase an extra battery because the battery can't be charged while it's in the camera.Overall, this is an excellent little compact camera.

After using it for a month, I don't feel this is the \"one and only\" camera someone would want to own. The reasons: 1) The pictures just aren't coming out all that great, and are often blurry 2) Impossible to take pictures outside in the daylight, no matter how hard you try you can't see the screen in the daylightHeres why it got 3 out of 5 stars though... this camera has a perfect \"niche\" if you will. We recently had a very cold, wet snowy weekend in Texas. Since that doesn't happen in my area very often, I wanted to take a bunch of pictures. Well guess who was the only person who could take their camera out in the wet snowy environment? Me! Everyone else was afraid their camera would be ruined. Since the sun was not shining, I could see the view finder just fine, and even though it was getting wet from the snowflakes landing on it, I knew the unit was sealed and weatherproof.  It took good pictures in these conditions, and the camera wasn't harmed at all. This camera is also great for party settings, it can sit on the table and you can spill beer after beer and not worry about it.So IMO this is a good \"secondary\" camera to have around.

I tried the camera in full California sun and did observe the washout of the LCD, but just today I found the solution. The solution to the LCD screen problem is very simple and I am very surprised no one had discovered it yet. Just go to setup and increase the LCD brightness to maximum (see page 32 of the Manual). I just took the camera outside in full California sun, and I was able to see my subjects fine in the LCD and it was not any worst that my old Canon digital camera.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera, a leap forward for olympus!!", "Author": "Concerned One \"Thrashfan\"", "ReviewID": "R5BKCO4FF22AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compact so it fits in you pocket, high tech enough to dance with it's bigger counterparts.

Optical zoom 5x more than standard 3x. Nice built-in functionality of editting pictures. The scene choosing and guide for making photos are really helpful when you don't want to think how to adjust the settings to make the best picture in the certain conditions. A cool surprising feature is that camera can be in mode when it records 4 secs of audio just after the picture was taken. So later you can view the photo and listen what was going around. Seems a bit weird, but I like it. :) All-weather design is also good. Super-macro mode as close as 3cm/1.1inch was also making me happy.Other than that some major cons I've experienced - impossible to change the zoom level after the camera starts to record a movie, no viewfinder, you can't set the flash to the slow mode manually (it automatically sets to this mode when you choose night portrait scene as I've understood), dual-image stabilization sound really impressive, but I'm not using it very often.But obviously there are more pros than cons.

If a detergent say it can get out blood and grape juice stains out of a shirt, guess what, that will be the first that it will try to wash out. As for the weather proof camera, well there was a big, big rain and since I never been able to take pictures while it was raining before, I guess I got a little too happy with my weather proof camera.

On the whole, this has proved to be a pretty good pocket camera.  The 5x magnification is a big plus, and there is no size or weight penalty for the added magnification.  The camera fits both the hand and the pocket very well.  The Olympus also offers two levels of macro mode for closeups, and I got some rather good pictures using these (e.g. a full-screen picture of a dragonfly perched on a bush).  And in all fairness, I got a lot of satisfactory pictures using the Olympus.However, I did not end my trip loving the camera.  The biggest problem is that the LCD screen is essentially unreadable outdoors in daylight, so framing pictures under these conditions is mostly guess work.  Since more than half of my pictures on the recent trip were made under outdoor, daylight conditions, I found the LCD problem intensely frustrating.This is my third camera with image stabilization, the other two are Panasonic Lumix models.  By comparison, I got a larger number of blurry pictures using the the Olympus than I usually do using the Lumix cameras.  It may be, however, that reading the advanced manual (which comes on CD, only a basic manual comes in print with the camera) will show me how to use the Olympus image stabilization to better effect.The number and size of the buttons is also inconvenient, as many reviewers (including those on non-Amazon sites) have pointed out.  And it is essential to carry a second, charged battery with you, since the battery life is at best average, and the system for warning of low charge is not very effective.Overall, I rate the Oympus 750 as a good, serviceable pocket camera with some significant plusses but also with significant minuses.  I believe that one can probably do better at the price.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Stylus 750 Experience", "Author": "G.

The weatherproof-ness of this model has already proved immensely valuable as we live in TX and have been caught out in the rain (note all the recent flooding) several times during recent travels.  I took it to Galveston and we decided to go to the beach anyway even though it was raining.

Just remember, you don't need a warranty until the product breaks.  If you don't need the warranty, then this camera is not too bad.

The nice big viewing area on the back just goes completly black even in low light outdoors so you cannot see what you are shooting.

All the picture features are awesome the dual image stabilization really works...but at night the video funtion really deserve 2 star... i changed from a sony cybershot 6.0MP, i don't have any complain of the video quality. I did the change just for the Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery, image stabilization and all weather features of the stylus, i didn't see in any review about the video of the stylus...for the truth in places with bright light is fair, but at night is very poor the quality, i have changed the image quality the ISO 1600 and in low light the case is loss. Over all the all weather i really liked, haven't tested but i'll do it. Besides, i'll remain with the camera...Now i have almos one month with it, biside the video quality i have learned lot of thing and i would increase the scale to 4 stars, i tested the all weather feature in a place all my friend had to put the cameras away, my camera got very wet, every thing is fine...", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "a huge disappointment", "Author": "Carla B.

This is my first digital camera and I was new at it so one day I accidentally deleted all my pictures that were on the memory card.  That was my silly mistake, not the camera's.  I was hoping there was an automatic backup to the memory card but there wasn't.  There's a backup but you'd have to run it yourself and I hadn't been doing that.  Which now that I know is good to have because it can back up over 300 pictures or more.It's not so good to use indoors unless I just don't know how to set it because I tried different settings and still couldn't take good pictures, which led to me pressing all kinds of buttons and deleting my pictures.Other than that I like it.

Unlike the Kodak, the Olympus has no \"delete all phots\" feature, so the only way to delete all the photos from the camera after transfering to the computer is to look at each photo separately on the camera's LCD display, push the delete button on the back of the camera, confirm that I really want to delete it, then it's gone. One photo gone and 235 to go. It takes about 10 minutes to delete every hundred photos (each deletion requires 3 button pushes, one picture at a time). I've now bought a replacement camera (a Canon) that has a \"delete all photos\" option. I never would have guessed that a camera would be sold that made it so hard to delete the photos.
