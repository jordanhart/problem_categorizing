After days of research, I chose the DSC-S600 because:1.  It was under 200 bucks.2.  It is incredibly easy to use.3.  It has a very bright flash.4.  It has AF illuminator so it focuses well.5.  It sings a little song when it turns on.6.  It takes pictures without me having to do anything.7.  3X optical is standard, and good enough for me.8.  6MP is really all a regular guy/girl needs...9.  Carl Zeiss Lens.  I don't know what that means, but cool.10. You can quickly and easily access your files without installing their software if you want...unlike many Kodak cameras.I am disappointed that:1.  The camera runs on AA batteries, but this is kind of an advantage if you were to run out on vacation...plus you can get 4 NiMH batteries and a charger for 25 bucks.2.  The software is good...it organizes pictures but has absolutely no editing features.  This is okay, because I have access to PhotoShop CS2 at school, but for you it might be important to know.3.  The camera doesn't have many scene modes--just the standard 6 or 7 rather than the 16 that the Olympus cameras have.So, I'd say buy it.  Other cameras I considered:1. Nikon Coolpix L1 (overpriced)2. Panasonic DMC-LZ2 (no AF illuminator lamp)Remember to buy:1.  At least a 512 MB Memory Stick Pro Duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go (50 bucks or so).2.  Rechargeable AA batteries and a charger (25 bucks or so).3.  Case (10-15 bucks or so).", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price..", "Author": "B.

I've been using Sony cameras for some time and this was an upgrade from my older 4M. Similar features, but I recall I bought my old one at $400.00! Expect to get nice large prints (>16X20) from this 6M if you're into printing posters or large photographs. (If you don't care about larger prints, a 4M is plenty!)I didn't give it 5 stars for 3 reasons:1. The camera is a bit heavier than others in the 6M range (non-SLR of course). Nonetheless, comfortably fits in your pocket.2. It may prove challenging for some with larger hands as the size is smaller than others.3. No rechareable batteries included.. Plan on buying some. Keep regular ones for emergencies only!Highly recommend a 512M memory stick (or two 256Ms).

I am still very happy with it. A few things to add:- The wide-angle lens is even more of a benefit than I originally thought. It makes a difference at, say, a restaurant table, where you can get everyone in the picture without having to go to the other side of the room. And the corresponding lack of long-range zoom hasn't bothered me at all.- I hadn't expected to make much use of the video capability, but the quality is so good that I'm using it instead of my camcorder for brief action shots of my toddler. Make sure you get the faster Pro version of Memory Stick Duo in order to be able to use the highest video resolution.- Some users report the camera shutting down with the lens sticking out after only a few shots. I had this issue too, but it was due to nothing more than dead batteries. Alkaline batteries get used up very quickly in digital cameras, and tend to die suddenly, leaving too little power even to withdraw the lens. Sony should reconsider their decision to ship alkalines with the camera as this has led many people to have a poor first experience with thic product.Original review posted in April 2006:Here are the features of this camera that are most important to me as a casual snapper, based on my frustrations with a 4-year-old Nikon E775:- It takes AA batteries, which are available everywhere so you're never stuck with a dead rechargeable.- Small size, pocketable, despite taking AA batteries (Canon A series cameras are huge compared to this).- Robust: see the reviews of Canon SD series cameras complaining about easily breakable LCD. Lens retracts completely.- Sensitivity: ISO 1000. There's some noise at that setting, but I'll take noise rather than underexposure or blur.- Wide setting of lens is wider angle than most (31mm equivalent). Good for group shots or landscapes.- Powerful flash - some cameras have less than 10 feet range. This has over 20 feet.- Quick start up and no shutter lag. Search Google for sites that compare shutter lag and next-shot delay on current model cameras.- Camera connects directly to computer via cable, doesn't require a special \"dock\" that I would probably forget to pack on a trip, or I might lose it or break it.- Standard mini-USB connector on camera, not a proprietary one, so if I lose the cable it is easy and cheap to replace.Things that are less important to me:- Display size. 2 inch is plenty for me.- Megapixels: I am happy with my current 2MP camera. Nothing less than 4MP is available from any vendor, so this wasn't a factor. 6MP on this camera is more than enough. I'm considering setting it to capture 3MP images for smaller file size.Downside:- It's slightly fatter than I would like, but still pocketable. For a camera that's similar but thinner, consider the Sony DSC-P200, but that has a proprietary rechargeable battery and a weak flash.- It uses Memory Stick Duo, so figure in an extra twenty bucks or so compared to the cost of SD memory for competitors' cameras, depending on how much capacity you buy.- No macro mode, but who uses this anyway on a point and shoot?- Wide angle lens with 3x zoom means that the telephoto end of the range is only 93mm. Would benefit from 4x optical zoom.Rechargeable batteries are essential for everyday use, as they both outperform and outlast alkalines. I purchased the Sony BCG-34HE4 battery charger which includes 4 AA NiMH 2500mAh batteries. I chose this charger for price and small packing size as well as its smart charging features.-", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Thought it wouldn't happen to me...", "Author": "saintsfan", "ReviewID": "R25DO020L25V9F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research on digital cameras, I decided to ignore the reviews from people whose cameras were defective, and bought the Sony DSC-S600 for myself.With the first camera I was sent, I noticed a problem almost immediately. The POWER button did not work consistently. I would have to press it any random number of times (5 to 50) to turn the camera on or off. When the camera was on, it took beautiful photos and video clips. I have no complaints at all about picture quality. That's why I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1. Had the camera worked properly, I would have given it 5 stars.Since I spent $200 on the camera and another $60 on a 1GB memory stick, I decided to exchange it for one that worked properly. After reporting the problem, Amazon sent a new camera to me overnight. I was happy to find that the POWER button worked well on the new camera, and I thought that would be the end of my problems. Unfortunately, a few hours later, the camera spontaneously shut off, leaving the shutter open. Now, every time I try to turn the camera on, the word ACCESS will appear on the screen for a split second, then it turns off again. It sounds like the same problem a few other reviewers had.Needless to say, I am regretting my decision to purchase this camera. I know I shouldn't expect much for $200, but I definitely expected to receive a camera that works for more than 2 hours. Since I already invested $60+ on the Pro Duo memory stick, I'm going to give it another shot with a new camera. Here's to hoping that the third time's the charm.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Thought It HAD Happened to Me But It HADN'T", "Author": "Alex James", "ReviewID": "R2LFRM64SVE32O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these a couple of weeks ago. I took a few shots with it and then the shutter wouldn't close, the power button worked intermittently etc. as reported by others. Then I changed the (supplied) alkaline batteries for NiMH's and this camera has been fine. It drained those alkalines in a dozen or so shots, but the same NiMH's (2300mAh) have been in there since then for several movies and many more stills.

The reason for my \"upgrade\" was that I dropped the camera in the mississippi while canoeing. The previous camera stopped working, so I bought this one, only to find out after a week when the camera dried out, that it was functioning as good as new! That re-enforced my decision of having bought a Sony product again!The good points: Very easy to use, just aim and shoot on \"auto\". Those who are overwhelmed by technology and just want to get good pictures, well, you just need to put in the battery and then the camera asks you for the time (first time use) and  you are ready to go without even adding any memory, thanks to the 32 MB built in memory.The picture quality is really good. I did not find much difference in the 2MB and 6MB setting. The flash range is good and the screen size is good. Camera is nice to fit in a pant pocket, but not a shirt pocket. This uses 2 AA batteries and so not having a charged battery is not an issue.Areas Sony Corporation could improve on:1. Sony left out the date imprint option on this model. I hope in the shorterm, if they could let their included software do the job (the files saved shows the date of shot along with the fle information).2. My previous model had the LCD screen offset from the outer surface. This one is almost flush and hence chance for scratches etc.3. Sony removed the capabilty to connect the camera to the TV! Any way one could download to the laptop and then use a cable to see the pictures on  the TV screen.4. The thickness can be reduced further. The other dimensions are fine.Just to balance, off, I am very happy with the camera and after reading the latest issue of the consumer reports magazine, I was happy to note that Sony had the lowest percentage of problems compared to any other camera including Canon. My experience with the previous camera has shown that the design is very robust and can take a lot of rough handling. I would not hesitate to buy another Sony again (albeit, I would wait a week if I did drop this in the water again!)", "Date": "July 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for beginners", "Author": "T.

We came down to the Sony S600 because of the price, the megapixels, the reasonably compact size, and the ease of use. We are very pleased with this camera. Soon after we received it we took it on vacation and got some beautiful pictures. The 6MP allow for enlarging and cropping sections of pictures, which is a plus for novice photographers who may not always be the best at framing a shot. We bought Sony rechargeable batteries (BCG-34HE4) to use with the camera and they work quite well and have long life. Recently, my husband took the camera with him on a trip to Mexico and once again got great pictures. For this trip he used the Energizer E2 lithium batteries so he wouldn't have to keep track of the battery charger, and got long life out of those as well.

It was very easy to operate and even easier to upload the pictures to my computer. There was no software to install, just plug in the usb cord and it uploads the pictures. My problem that i had with the camera started about 3 months ago, after i had only had the camera about 5 months. It stopped turning on everytime i'd push the power button, and then sometimes it would randomly turn itself off. the lens started getting stuck and wouldn't zoom, and wouldn't close the lens cover. at first it only did this every so often but it just got worse. now my camera will not turn on except to review pics. it's not the batteries becuase i put brand new ones in. the camera will turn on if i have it on review mode but as soon as i switch it to picture mode, the lens tries to come out but gets stuck and turns off the power. I was very careful with this camera, dropped it a few times but nothing that should have caused this. i can't find my reciept to show it still under warrenty so its useless. i'm stuck buying a new camera. when i got this camera i purchased the 1gb pro duo memory stick to use with the camera and now i have found out that only Sony camera's use that device so if i want to use it again i have to buy a sony, otherwise i have to buy a new card as well. My suggestion would be to opt for a camera that uses the SD card becuase it is much more versitile, can be used with Casio, kodak and a few others. I'd also opt for a camera with a bigger screen on the back becuase the one on this camera is very small. I'd opt against purchasing a sony all together since thier memory card is exclusive to thier brand. I'll be purchasing a Casio, most likely the Casio EX-Z60.

Now that the camera has completely broken down, with the lens fully extended and stuck in place, I think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. Another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review, flash, etc., quickly wore off, and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. Not a big deal in itself, but annoying given the other problem.The lens is prone to strange flaring, especially indoors, where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. Several photos were ruined, or have required tedious photoshopping. Otherwise, the lens is fine and reasonably sharp, although nothing to write home about.The camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models, e.g., Canon A610. Many frames are motion-blurred, as well. There are ways to avoid this, but I didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure, thank you.There are a few things to recommend it: Not only is it relatively inexpensive, it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. Those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. It is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus, see above.) The jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. Skintones are good.Still, with the durability issue, this one's not worth it. Lucky for me, unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown, I did keep the receipt. Anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo?UPDATE:A Sony repair shop quickly fixed the broken lens mechanism and it has given no further trouble. Overall performance still not so hot. How do you get motion blur in a beach picture? Well, this camera managed it.SECOND UPDATE:Zoom mechanism conked out a second time 8-10 months later. I probably won't buy another Sony camera.

But there are probably a lot of people like me who don't mind buying gently used older cameras for a good price.The fact is that I've had this camera for several years now, and for the kind of basic photography that I and most other people are into, this camera is probably sufficient.  The original price was a good one when this first came out, so I'm assuming that you can pick up a used one for even cheaper.When I use the camera outdoors, I have no complaints.  My pictures look better than they did with the 2 cameras I had used before this one.  It has all of the standard features you'd expect in a standard digital camera, and it's extremely easy to use.  It's true that the software that comes with it is limited, if you're interested in processing your photographs, but that's to be expected in a camera in this price range.My main complaint is about indoor pictures.  Sometimes they don't come out as well.  Sometimes there is too much of a delay from the time I press the button to the time the shutter snaps.  Also, when I try to take pictures of close up items for Ebay, there seems to be no good way to make the pictures look as good as I'd like them to.All in all, it's a great camera for its price range and should still be acceptable to the average picture taker.  If you're seriously into photography at all, however, then you'll want something newer and with more pixels, etc.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ashamed it's a Sony!", "Author": "Michael A Trujillo \"Mike T.\"", "ReviewID": "RD0SC71QIY5TJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because of Sony's history of making excellent products. Boy was I disappointed! After a few weeks the camera would turn off by itself, flash internal diagnostic malfunctions, and basically just refuse to work. Not only is it useless but it burns through batteries (rechargeable and alkalines) faster than the speed of light. I usually got less than 15 pictures or four minutes of video. I could not find my receipt to return it but with shipping and drama I have decided to turn it into a boat anchor instead and live-and-learn. Reading other negative reviews about this product I can only surmise somebody was asleep at the switch when Sony designed this camera.

Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time when you turn the camera on it will either briefly power up and then immediately shut off or stay on for a few seconds and then shut off. I have changed batteries repeatedly, so it isn't dead batteries, although it does seem to suck the life out of batteries very quickly.I've had this camera since late 2006 and it worked fine for a little over a year. I can see two possible causes.1.) Defective on/off switch.2.) Poorly designed battery compartment. The connectors are so tiny here and recessed into the cover, I don't see how they can make good contact with the batteries. There also seems to be some room for the batteries to wiggle within the compartment which may cause intermittent contact.I like the camera when it works, but now I am debating whether to spend the money to send it to Sony for repair. If the problem is #1 (above), what's to stop the switch from going bad again. If it's #2, this is a flaw in the camera design and probably can't be fixed.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Typical Problems", "Author": "B.

She bought it at 14 years old with her own $ to take on a school field trip to Washington.  She took about 50 shots and then the power button would only work randomly or the lense would freeze coming out or closing.  Being an electrical engineer I would guess that the motor for the cover/lens draws so much current that the battery voltage drops so low that the camera shuts off.  I have tried brand new Eveready Copper tops with no luck.  If I try it 4 or 5 times and can't coax it to life I can sometimes set it to view the pictures and then slide it over to the take picture mode and it will stay on.  I feel bad as I talked her into a $300 Sony telling her to buy a good brand name and it would last for years.
