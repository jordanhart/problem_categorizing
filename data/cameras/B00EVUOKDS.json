It is too small and there is no way the camera will fit into this case.  I have called Focus camera twice and emailed their customer service department, but no one has gotten back to me.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots of features for the price, some gotchas", "Author": "Joanna Daneman", "ReviewID": "R257CKYDQ1HVCK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lot of features in this camera especially for someone who wants a camera to do almost everything. The Canon SX510 has a lens that goes from wide angle to telephoto, a stabilization system to let you take sharp photos, and it processes lightning-fast. It is actually a very good camera and for the price. I gave it a try (needed a backup, lightweight camera) but it turns out it is missing a few features I've come to rely on. If you don't need these extras, you'll love it, because it's an excellent camera with a lot of function and quality. You'd have to pay quite a bit more to get the extra features I happen to like, so if you don't need them, this is quite the deal for a highly-functional digital camera.Good points:1. 12 megapixel resolution2. ISO up to 3200 (possible to shoot at ISO 6400 under special low-light setting)3. 24-720 mm Optial Zoom (one lens from wide angle to telephoto with no changing required.)4. Min shutter speed 15 sec to a maximum of 1/1600 sec5. Does video (MP4) w 240 frames per sec at low res, and has hi res available6. WiFi built in (can do GPS sharing to your mobile phone, etc)7. Lightweight, small size. Controls are knob plus the direction dial (familar to Canon users)8. Manual setting available (with some limitations)9. The IS (Intelligent Stabilization) can let you shoot with a steadier hand at low shutter speeds (great if you tend to shake--I'm not steady anymore below 1/125 sec--when I was a kid, I could handhold 1/60th reliably but not anymore.)Bad Points1. No viewfinder and NO flip screen (flat on back) No touchscreen. This was the killer for me--angled flipscreens are dead useful in bright light and when doing video. Once you get used to having one, it's difficult to go without.2. Hard to see the screen due to glare in bright light.3. No flip up flash: this is another issue. You have to be reminded to flip UP the flash if you need flash. It doesn't automatically flip up when the exposure is calling for flash.4. There is a low-light mode (ISO 6400) but you can't set it manually and it works by reducing resolution.5. No raw shooting modeSummary:The steady-Eddie IS system AND the wide range of focal length in the lens make this a one-camera-does-all for most people and if you can live with the screen limitation, this camera gives the user a great deal of function for a moderate price. You can hardly get this much camera if you were to upgrade to a DSLR like a T4i or SL1 without spending at least twice as much, so the flash and the fixed screen and some limitation of low-light shooting may well make this a great do-everything camera for a very reasonable price. The Canon SL1 would be a good alternative to get around the limitations: more resolution, touch screen, optical viewfinder but again, it costs quite a bit more.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Satisfied with camera", "Author": "Doris Browning", "ReviewID": "R1MBXKMDXT3RZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the camera, however, the case that came with it is too small.

I do like the 510, and have been able to take some very good pictures with it.  However, there are two cons that I have discovered so far.  The first is that it does not have an small view finder---only the large screen, which make the camera almost unusable in bright sunlight.  The other con:  Canon has saw fit NOT to provide a user's manual with the camera.  So, you must go on line to get one---over half of it pertains to connecting the camera to WIFI.  Cameras are bought to take pictures; therefore, with a camera so small and complicated as the 510, explicit instructions are needed to explain and tell the user about the camera's many features.  I'm finding every time I use the camera that something is hidden deep within the software that astounds me.  We need to be told, in written form, how to get to these features and how to use them.In order to use the full optical zoom, a good tripod is required.  The image stabilizer is simply not good enough to handle the shake which occurs when trying to use the zoom.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot", "Author": "Donna L.

We took it to our vacation to Puerto Rico. I checked it in stores and in the canon website as well, and I found that the bundle offered in Amazon was the least expensive. It reached in 2 days as I am prime account holder.Let me begin with the camera case. It is nice and easy to carry. Unlike mentioned in previous reviews, the camera and other stuffs fitted well into the case.Camera is awesome.  Very good pics, high quality. However the pictures in darker places did not come as good as I expected. But I am just starting to use camera and still am learning the settings according to places and light condition. I used manual mode and setting the aperture most of the time . In dark places, the shutter time would be too long(5-6 secs), so by the time it took a picture the subject would already have moved. But again as I said I don't know if I was supposed to use other settings than manual.Video quality too is very good. Camera is very light, so is easy to be carried.The bundle came with canon battery and an extra battery which is not canon.The tripod is small, around 20 cm in length. It was useful to take picture of me with my wife, as we did not feel comfortable to ask passerby to take pics of us together.Overall I am very satisfied with the camera.

I'm pleased with the battery life and have yet to have run out of power during the day though I've purchased a spare battery so swap it out and fresh charge after each day of use so I don't know how much more than a day's use I could get without draining the battery.
