This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. The problems are that it needs a view finder. While taking pictures in the desert I could not see what I was \"shooting\". Also, the instructions came in DVD format. That is kind of hard to use when you are traveling and don't have computer access.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fuji is really the best, give it a try if you havent!", "Author": "drumzbabe", "ReviewID": "R1NWS58W0818CF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched cameras quite extensively and had purchased several makes and models prior to this purchase. I have used Fuji in the past and this camera has all the features and compatibility with my devices that I desire. It works well with most Windows programs including Vista. The beauty is that the batteries are AA and easily changable and accessable as opposed to most other camera batteries. SandDisk didnt list any of their media cards as compatible so I went with Kingston as it did not come with one. It has decent video quality with audio. The LCD screen is conveniently larger. The audio is a little sketchy if there is too much noise in the room (like for musicians) but for a standard amount of sound it works fine. Included accessories were limited but affordable separately. Zoom didnt work during video mode so be sure to set it before filming. The price was affordable overall for a point and shoot and the camera is real easy to use. Manuals come in disc form which poses an issue for reading if you arent near a pc but Id suggest asking the company if one is available in paper format. There is no viewfinder but that really isnt necessary since the images are easily viewed on the LCD screen. Shipping was fairly affordable and items arrived according to the estimated arrival dates provided. Hope this helps....Thanks again Amazon!", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Total Piece of Garbage", "Author": "Carson", "ReviewID": "RVVCPMAGBFVNP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Died within a month.  Died while taking pics.  No drops.  No damage.  Just died.  FujiFilm \"customer service\" reps were total jerks, and the process was going to be expensive and cumbersome.  Saw it on Amazon last month for $119, along with the less expensive A100 model, which I can't find on Amazon anymore.  That's a good thing, because this camera isn't worth a dime, and it should've been taken off the market more quickly than vegetables with E. Coli.  Luckily, I'd bought it at brick-and-mortar store because I needed a camera quickly, and it died on day 29.  So, I took it back within the 30-day limit for a refund after hassling with a company that obviously has no idea about creating and maintaining relationships with their customers.  Too bad, 'cause it took decent pics and movies during the short time it lasted.  If only Fuji could've made it last just one more day, they'd have profited well.  I have never written a review on Amazon, as far as I remember, but my experience with this camera prompted me to do so.  I will never buy another Fuji product again...
