Well, I am writing this review because the light worked great for about two weeks and then the unit started to flicker! My hubby and I tried to put in new batteries, but to no avail, because no matter what we did to try and fix it - nothing worked. Not only did the light begin to flicker, we noticed that there was a crack in the lighting system!  We are truly sorry because this motion sensor worked so well, but I do not think that we are going to invest anymore to buy this specific unit. Too bad!!", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "One bulb not working already", "Author": "rodney mazzaro", "ReviewID": "R245F0OI6717KN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One led bulb was not working at time of arrival .i am  Sure there are more to follow.time will tell", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002HZHFEU"}}
