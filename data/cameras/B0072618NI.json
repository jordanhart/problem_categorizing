{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera with LOVELY RESULTS", "Author": "L. K. Richardson", "ReviewID": "R268W5QZ5V18OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I purchased this camera because I am infatuated with Samsung products.  I am not very technical re camera related specifications but here's what interested me:I did a product comparison on Samsung's website, and this model has great specifications relative to ST66/68, WB150F, and ST76/77. (Now you can have your own criteria so go check):a. Lightweight and relatively smallb. Wi-fi capability - to upload pics to PC or social websites or e-mail....yes you e-mail your pictures from the camerac. Expansion up to 32GB with microSDHC card. YES MICROSDHC. (Got a good deal on a 16GB Kingston Class 4. )d. 16.1MP ....although I would hardly use that amount when doing settings.e. 10x optical zoom ...I am not into spying so this is sufficient for now.f. Amazon reviews played a part too. Especially in not choosing the WB150...that has a different lens and could be responsible for some of negative ratings. But I am not technical.g. Price is great. Good bang for buck in my opinion. I really didn't look at any other brands. I had 2 Coolpix before -1st one was great and after about 5+ years it needed a replacement I upgraded to a higher Coolpix that made me cry. (There's a review on Amazon for that). I have used Canons and was not impressed. So my phones are gonna be Samsung so why not my camera. And there were options in my price range. (Didn't feel like spending the $300 I did for crappy Coplpix)h.There are Basic modes, Scene modes, Magic modes...includes picture in picture, funny distortions, frames, ....download the manual to review. My review long already.i. You can edit photos and videos.The reason why I tried to be comprehensive is because the camera PERFORMS. I got it about 5 hours before my daughter's school concert. I didn't have time to read up workings and settings. I put it to charge and continued sewing my octopus costume. Later that evening, when she was dressed and outside just before sunset, I pointed at her and pressed the shutter button ...LOVELY PICTURE #1. Inside the hall, in costume with muted lights backstage, I pressed shutter...LOVELY PICTURE #2. I hurry to the auditorium and using my Samsung Y for light, I easily found the button and option to go from SMARTpic to SMARTvideo mode. She comes on stage with her class, I am in the 10th row or so, shutter button ....LOVELY VIDEO #1. Playback is great with great audio.I have tried out the e-mail function...great.I have to download MobileLink to cellphone for that function.  There is a remote view finder function I am excited to try too.I have to download Intelli-Studio to pc for that wi-fi I think. I transferred pics and videos using USB cord provided.Cannot wait to explore other functions with the help of the manual. The screen is not a touchscreen, which would have made e-mail entry easier. Will update when needed.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love This Camera", "Author": "James S. Lasinski \"Get My Money's Worth\"", "ReviewID": "R3X19LOI0TBHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried out this camera as soon as it was delivered.  The manufacturer enclosed a \"Quick Start Guide,\" but it was not much help; as it was written in another language, than English.  I went \"Online\" to the SAMSUNG Website, and down loaded the entire manual for the camera.  After that, I had no problem getting to know all the wonderful functions that can be utilized.  Photos can be taken \"Automatically\" by the camera, or you can set your own functions \"Manually.\"  A \"Memory Card\" does not come with the camera, but you can try it out with it's inner memory; up to 3 or 4 pictures.  I love the \"Panorama\" mode and many other features, too many to mention.  Check Amazon's \"Description\" to find out.  It takes very clear photos, even when there is not much light.  I highly recommend this camera to someone who does not want to go through the trouble of \"Manually Adjusting\" the features; and also to those who want a lower priced, but a quality product.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Cicely Stewart", "ReviewID": "R3U32GJ87G50U2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received for my birthday. Very easy setup.  Can now email photos directly to the grandmas or post on facebook without having to hunt for cords. Nice zoom, nice flash. Easy to turn flash off. Only problem is mine-haven't figured out how to rotate photos before I post. Exactly what I wanted!", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beyond Obsessed!!", "Author": "Yael", "ReviewID": "R15DBXHVLV6PZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I literally spent days and hours on line looking for the best point and shoot camera I could find,and I didn't think my budget should stop me from getting it.  AND I FOUND IT!  I am so so so happy with this camera.  The pictures come out amazing, the zoom is amazing, the time between pictures is fast which was important since the subjects of the pictures (aka the off-springs) do not like to sit and wait.  I LOVE the wifi emailing/uploading to fb thing since it is so easy and cool to do.  The camera has tons of fun features we find every so often that make picture making taking even more fun.  I would 100% recommend this camera to anyone looking for a fantastic new toy.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Pics!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R34DZXZYUQ9BJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very easy to operate!

The ST200F fits neatly into my shirt or jeans pockets allowing it to be taken along anywhere easily.  My wife loves it too because she hates complex cameras and this baby is a really great point and shoot if you don't want to get fancy. Purchased it because my other (non-Samsung) point and shoot broke and the ST200F has 10X Optical Zoom and 16MP.  In Africa some of my wife's photos with the other point and shoot were great but it was only 8MP and after cropping making enlargements suitable for framing lacked the clarity we wanted - 16 MP gives us more wiggle room.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "WiFi", "Author": "Tim Etherton", "ReviewID": "RJM4NLYUND2ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Small Compact size works great over wifi glad i bought this camera you can take it with you and send pic back to your computet over wifi..", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "June C.
