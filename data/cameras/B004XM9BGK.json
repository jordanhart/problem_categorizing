After extended research, decided to go with the Nikon D5100 with 18-55mm lens since this camera seemed to have all the features that I wanted in a SLR system. Shortly after receiving the camera, had some problems with pictures being out of focus and subsequently found that was mainly due to operator error. A technical representative at Cameta Camera was very helpful in the diagnostic of this issue.One thing I should mention that was not covered in any of the reviews I read, i.e. you need to use a HDMI cable (does not come with camera) when viewing pictures on a HD TV. The video cable that comes with it is a simple analog cable and you use loose a lot of picture clarity. Overall I think this is a great camera for a good price. Now looking to complement the dynamic range of this camera with a telephoto lens. You may also want to know that manual that comes with the camera is abreviated - the complete manual is on a disk in PDF file and is over 200 pages.Loaded the software that came with the camera on the computer but have not had time to gain a lot of experience with it. While I am not a profession with cameras, I have owned cameras all my adult life starting with an Argus C-4 in 1956. The Nikon D5100 has an extra-ordinary number of features available for the user. As of this writing, all my pictures have been taken in the \"auto\" mode. However, it is easy to see that with some experience this camera is capable of creating some fantistic pictures even under the most adverse circumstances. Got a long way to go!! Have not used the movie part of the camera as of this writing.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!

Everything was packaged really well. Everything was brand new and the boxes were in perfect condition. Everything included in the bundle was much better quality then I had expected for the price. The camera bag included is a real Nikon bag, that I have seen sold elsewhere for around $60. The tripod is very sturdy and works great with this camera. The SD card is exactly as promised. The camera came in perfect condition and works perfectly. I would recommend this seller and this order to everyone.***UPDATE****I had an issue with one of the small items in the bundle. I think it was just defective and was a manufacturing problem, not Cameta Camera's fault. Cameta Camera on top of selling a great bundle of products, also has great customer service.

I had narrowed down my search to Canon T3i and Nikon D5100. After going through lot of reviews and videos on both, I decided to go for Nikon D5100. There isn't much of difference between the 2 products. But, the ones that made me go for Nikon D5100 is :1. AF Nikor lens. Nikor lens is the best in class as far as my knowledge goes. Again, I prefer a lens with AF motor and not a camera with AF motor.2. The camera size is appropriate for my hands. Its easy to hold and operate.3. It gives me the best natural shots (per my knowledge on light) even in low light situations. But, the LCD on canon is better compared to Nikon. So,in the begining you might not feel too good looking at your shots in LCD.4. Most of the functionalities on the camera are easy to access. You dont have to take your eyes off your object to actually make some of the small changes, like aperture.. iso..etc.. however, in canon its quite a task compared to nikon.5. The lens is very quite compared to canon when taking shots.6. I dont have much to write on this review as am no expert to talk more on the DSLR.. Am learning too. For anybody who's a beginner and looking to start off with a DSLR, NIKON D5100 would be the best choice. I love my Nikon D5100. It's been just 2months that I have had this camera and my experience with Nikon D5100 is getting better and better every time I use it. I have taken over 1000 shots. It just gets better and better with every shot.Will keep writing more.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy with my purchase!

I received it just a couple of days before I took a trip with a bus full of genealogists to Ellis Island, Ground Zero and passing the Statue of Liberty.  I didn't have much time to figure out how to use it but a woman in front of me had just received one for Christmas and the woman aside of me is a professional photographer.  Just on that one trip I took over 200 pictures that ALL came out excellent.Two days later I was on a plane to London for 8 days to visit my son & sister.  Everything was absolutely breathtaking as this was my first time.  My son was an excellent tour guide & on the first day he completely took over as the photographer for the whole trip.  He loved my new camera as well!  On this trip we took over 1,000 pictures. We were completely stunned that we had taken over 1,200 pictures total.Next will be a concert to see Alan Jackson & I can't wait to be able to zoom up soooo close as to get a picture of just his face.  Thank you Nikon for making this all possible.I purchased this camera thru Amazon at a lower price than I could find anywhere else.  They did not add all the extra's that came with my camers so this was a BONUS!  I'll anxiously wait for the day when this camera comes in a pocket-size version.  It was a little bulky carrying it around & I was so worried about banging it into something.A true fan of the Nikon D5100.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camerafan", "Author": "Doug Allen", "ReviewID": "R1EDRUMMUV7YDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pashionate about digital photography, I recently upgraded from the Nikon D3000 to the D5100 and found this to be signficant imporvement.  Image quality with the D5100 is outstanding and I like the low light capabilites of the CMOS sensor.  While upgrading I needed a new memory card and cary bag.  This package provided these plus an UV filter, and tripod for no more than the bag and memory card would cost seperatley. I have a tripod so I really didn't need a new one.  It's not the strongest or steadiest, however, I really like it's compact size.  I think I'll find I use it more than my previous one due to it's protablity.

Ill go ahead and say that its a very nice camera, as you can see I gave it 5 stars for my uses, so instead of saying everything that's great about it, ill just say the couple bad things that might matter to some people.The autofocus is not particularly quiet with the kit lens (which by the way is a really nice leans for the money and is probably worth getting unless you already have nikon lenses.) so if you're looking for using this with video (and want autofocus) then you will have to jump through one of a couple small hoops to have a workable setup.To shoot video you have to be in live view mode. Once you are in live view, you can't change the a number of the settings that you might want for finer video control. Again, it can be worked around with good cinematographic practices, but its something to note.So yea, if you're looking for a really video oriented camera at this price you might want to look into a canon. But for photography i would personally go with this camera, especially since nikon's lenses are very nice, and a bunch of the cheaper ones (pricewise)  just so happen to be really nice.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thank you", "Author": "no", "ReviewID": "R2MZMTECPMFY9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera arrived on time.
