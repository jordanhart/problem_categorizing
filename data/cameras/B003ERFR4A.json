This thing is an absolute steal at this price. I did all the research. This is the top of the line camera from Casion in Fall of 2009. Could have easily gonna Canon but I like this better than my old Canon. 3 inch extra bright high contrast screen, CCD image shake correction (it really works!), a battery that is good for 550 shots (most others are good for half that), fast start up, able to focus in complete darkness with the AF assist light, 4x zoom, and HD 1280x720 movies. Pictures are sharp, clear, and the camera takes them fast. So why only 4 stars? I took one off for the HD video. The camera automatically pushes the video into image anti shake mode and pushes the gain way up and the videos tend to be grainy. I would love to turn off this feature but there is no setting because, as per the manual, it is done automatically for video. Note the CCD image correction (maxes out at ISO400 and looks good) and image correction (gimicky, ISO maxes out at 1600 which is too grainy) are two different settings. This thing rocks, just be sure to turn off all the garbage like face reconition, make-up mode and image correction (manual calls it image AS), leave it on AUTO and this thing is very fast and produces great pictures. Highly recommended.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best exilim for price", "Author": "loopnh", "ReviewID": "R1J7TURZQR89Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched a replacement for my good old EX Z600 and my non negociable criteria were: the same super charged battery (NP40), stabilizer feature, 3x optical zoom or more, 8+ Mpixels, and same overall pocket size.Believe it or not the Z450 has all that and more for the price of the entry level S series. It really compares to the Z200 and Z300 for less than half the price.Most important: Look for the battery type in the specifications; if like me you want to shoot 500 photos (@ 3 Mpixels average) without bothering about the charge, pick a model featuring the NP40 battery, or even better the newer NP90 available on the H10 (more pricey though). Don't try to understand the battery model numbering: avoid the NP60 and NP80 which will cry for charge every day or so.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1 Megapixels deliver up to Still images - 4000 x 3000 pixel detail stills and up to 1280 x 720 (24 fps) movies\n35.7MB built-in flash memory for out-of-box uses / SDHC Memory Card, SD Memory Card slot for practical use\n4x Optical Zoom Focal Length 4.9 to 19.6mm (35mm Film Equivalent Approx. 28 to 112mm) / 4x Digital Zoom enhancement\nLarge, bright, 3 LCD screen for previewing and viewing stills and videos / Also displays friendly menu functions\nFocus Mode - Auto Focus, Macro Mode, Pan Focus, Infinity Mode, Manual Focus; AF Area - Intelligent, Spot, Multi or Tracking / AF Assist Lamp", "Name": "Casio EX-Z450 Exilim 12-Megapixel Digital Camera - Gold", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nX6LzwXLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ERFR4A"}}
