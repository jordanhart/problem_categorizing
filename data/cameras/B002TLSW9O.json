Support told me to send them back or remove the lense covers and wipe the glass. I wiped and they worked fine for a couple of days. I'm in Florida and if high (not that bad) humidity in November is a problem-imagine what will happen in July and August when the rains start. I plan to return them and see if the new ones leak.I am still working with Defender to see what they are willing to do. The support (telephone) department seems to be handled by one very busy, polite young lady. We'll le tyou know how it turns out.

Barrett", "ReviewID": "RFQLDYTUK6X2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced my 15 year old VCR based Black and White security system with the Defender SN-300 color Security system with 4 Nightvision cameras for my small retail business.  In the past, it was difficult to see a small 9\" quad screen in B/W.  Now I have a 19\" color monitor hooked to the Defender DVR and the difference is huge.  I really like the ability to switch from quad view to one camera for monitoring and playback then back to quad again.  The picture is not HD quality, but is VERY, VERY good and clear.  The DVR in highest quality will record 7-10 days of monitoring only.  I haven't tried the low quality setting, but I am sure the DVR would record much, much more with the 500GB drive in the low quality setting!  The nightvision cameras are a must and light my office well for recording.  That was a huge bonus.  The setup is easy and the menus also are easy to use.  The networking is a little more of a challenge, but am working through this for watching the store from home.  All in all, you can't beat the system for the money.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good first impression, with just a few quibbles", "Author": "William W. Davis \"famousdavis\"", "ReviewID": "RTBAARBHWWYWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "QUICK SUMMARY:  I setup this surveillance system (not really a security system) with minimal trouble.  It's doing what it's supposed to do WITHOUT having to call Tech Support, without reading the owner's manual, and without scouring the Internet for solutions to problems -- I didn't encounter any serious issues, and the few minor installation bumps I encountered were easily remedied.  Don't expect much from the \"color\" cameras - the default colors from them are abysmal (but for an inexpensive surveillance system, I'm willing to put up with lousy color).  I'll wait a month before deciding whether or not recommend this system, but overall, I'm pleased with what I've seen so far.What I LIKE:- Well packaged and complete.  It comes with a Quick Start guide and an owner's manual which is only slightly more informative.  You can do the installation just from the Quick Start guide, and refer to the owner's manual only if you need to.- It worked!  It does what it says it will do -- without having to call Tech Support for assistance.  Yea!!- The color \"high-res\" cameras (which are NOT \"high definition\") are really quite small and unobstrusive.- The cameras can be installed indoors or outdoors (but if outdoors, they must not be directly exposed to the elements, so says the owner's manual).- Lots of configuration settings let you decide which cameras to turn on/off, how many frames-per-second they'll record (from 1 fps to 30 fps), resolution quality, when to record, and more.  I haven't tried many of the features yet, like connecting to my home network, or recording only when the camera's sensor indicates something is moving within its narrow field-of-vision.- If I really want to have this system professionally installed in my home, there's an option the manufacture provides to do just that.  But I don't know what the cost of that would be.- The \"night vision\" feature (for darkly lit rooms or outside at night within ~15 feet of the camera) works pretty good!  I've never used \"night vision\" electronics before, and it's startling how clear someone's face can be seen using this feature.- At night using available streetlight, you won't be able to read a license plate from the video that's recorded, but you will be able to see the model of a vehicle driving by.What I Did **NOT** Like:- The default colors from these \"color\" cameras are awful.  The color green -- leaves on trees and the color of grass -- show up grayish-brownish-purpleish, NOT green, on both the live video feed and the corresponding recorded video.  Strangely, the only time grass and leaves show up green is during a torrential downpour of rain.  White and black show up well, orange shows up okay, but most other colors seem way, way off.  You can improve the colors by manually adjusting the hue setting for each camera.- Using the remote, sometimes pressing the \"Menu\" button (which should exit a screen and return to the main menu) instead caused the toggling of the configuration setting which was highlighted on the screen.- The 1st camera I connected to the DVR did not work until I connected the 2nd camera, and then both cameras worked.  I swapped the camera inputs on the DVR and still had an issue with one of the cameras.  I suspect a suprisingly loose connection between the video cable and the DVR to be at fault.  I stopped debugging the problem, though, once both cameras began working.- There is no chart that explains what types of settings will lead to what kind of disk usage within the DVR.  The retail box says it can record up to 2 years of video, but the fine print explains that is at the lowest frames-per-second (that is, 1 fps) and at the lowest video resolution possible.  In other words, you're not going to get 2 years of recorded video from this unit!  After a few days living with this system, I found that I could record a total of 20fps (among all 3 cameras combined, where all cameras are set to the highest quality resolution), and that uses about 7%/day of the hard disk space.  So, in my installation, I'll get about two weeks' worth of recorded images before I begin overlaying the oldest images with newer images.What Could Be BETTER:- The camera's field-of-vision is very narrow, and there's no adjusting that.  On the camera I installed outdoors, the field-of-vision 30 feet away is about the width of my double-wide driveway plus the mailbox.- The zinc-plated hardware (wood screws) used to install the cameras will rust quickly outside, even if they're not directly exposed to the elements.- There is no glitz when it comes to the menu user interface.  It's like something out of 1980.  Just white, block text...no icons, no graphics, no media bling at all.- The tightening screw on the installed cameras (that applies pressure to the ball-and-joint of the stand) tends to keep the cameras from moving vertically out of place, but it still seems too easy to move the camera horizontally with a very light touch.  I need to investigate this some more to ensure it's not \"user error\" though.  The cameras themselves aren't moving out of place, but with a strong wind outside, I'll bet they would.BACKGROUND:  I already have a home monitoring system -- that is a much better deterrant than a 4-camera surveillance system.  If all you're relying on is this system to protect your home or business, a burglar can easily haul off the Defender's DVR unit, leaving you empty-handed and without any video proof of the crime!  But a surveillance system has many other uses and benefits.  It's a great compliment to the measures you're already taking to secure your property.  For instance, what ARE my kids doing while I'm not at home and they're home alone?!INSTALLATION:  As I said already, it really was easy.  I mistakenly assumed I could connect the DVR to my computer and use my computer to do the setups.  Afterall, the DVR has an Ethernet jack and it comes with an Ethernet cable.  But you can't configure this DVR using your computer -- you *must* use either a TV or a monitor with an RCA-type video input.  So, I moved the DVR from my computer desk over to the home theater armoire in the family room, and quickly connected it to my Samsung LCD TV.  Right now, I've connected one camera atop my armoire, and another two outside my home overlooking my driveway, street, and walkway up to our front door.Note for Northerners:  The operating range for these cameras is 14\u00b0F ~ 140\u00b0F, so if you live in a part of the country that gets very cold in the wintertime (I don't!), this may be of concern to you if you plan on installing any of these cameras outdoors.CONFIGURATION: Simple to do.  Hit \"Menu\" on the remote control, and walk through each menu choice to make your selections.  Hit \"Menu\" again after you make a configuration setting change, and \"Menu\" once more to update the settings on the DVR.VIDEO QUALITY:  Okay, don't expect to see anything approaching HD videos here!  The live video feed is probably like TV's standard definition.  The cameras struggle with most colors, like green, navy or dark blue.  Other colors, like honey oak on our table, look good.  Indoor lighting can get screwy if you're using a combination of different lighting equipment within the same camera's field-of-vision (for instance, my kitchen with fluorescent lighting in the foreground looks okay, but the background incandescent lighting in the dining room causes the walls to look faintly purple). By default, outside colors are awful.  Tree leaves and the grass outside look gray-brown-purpleish using the camera's default settings.  If you change the \"hue\" setting for cameras placed outdoors from the factory default 64% setting down to 40-50%, tree leaves and grass obtain an acceptable green color.  Most everything tends to look washed out, but the objects you'll see in this video -- people or pets, for instance -- are easily recognizable.  In other words, it's \"good enough\" to be useful, as you won't be using these video cameras to record baby's first steps!  Recording at the \"Highest\" resolution setting won't be quite as good as the live video streaming.  Lower resolution settings just make the recorded video look that much worse.  My suggestion is to take some short video samples and see which resolution you can live with.  Note:  There is no audio feed coming from these cameras -- you only get video.CONCLUSION:  I've only had this system for less than a week, but I like it.  It can help identify the goings-on around and inside my home.  I'll continue to update this review until I decide whether I'll recommend it or not.*** APRIL 27, 2010 UPDATEHere's how this system helped solve a mystery for me.  Yesterday, I left for work in a downpour. While backing out of my driveway, I ran over our garbage can which had been emptied by the city workers just a few minutes before!  Why did I run over my garbage can?  Did I not look behind me, before backing up?  Did the city workers place the emptied trash can directly behind my vehicle?  Later in the day, I watched the video and saw that the city workers had placed the emptied can at the corner of my driveway, but yesterday's storm blew over the can and pushed it directly behind my vehicle!  There was no one to blame; it was a freak incident.  The video explained exactly what happened.

Overall I feel that their customer service was just awesome. They were very knowledgeable about all systems and help me find the one that fits my needs. When I did purchase this unit, I was missing a power cable and they sent me one in 36 hours. I understand these things happen but they made good on their service.Very easy system to install. No problems doing so. I am able to view my house from work and find that very comforting.

Installation was a breeze and it was easy to hide the wires as there is only one small wire for each camera going from the cameras connector to the connection on the DVR. I did put the cameras under the sill of my home protecting them from direct rain and snow and so far I have had no issues with them. I did have one camera mount that did not work properly when I received the system so I contacted Defenders customer support and I had a replacement mount in two days. I must say so far I am quite happy with my purchase and also with Defenders customer service.  Having been the victims of theft prior to installing this system, my wife and I feel better knowing that our home is being watched even while we are not there. This time if the theives return I will have video evidence for the police. Night vision works great, even better if you have a little extra ambiant light such as a low wattage porch light to help illuminate the area.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "I wish I could say nicer things...:(", "Author": "William Hardin", "ReviewID": "R2SQGU4CWHWEH6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I hate rating something low like this but sadly this Defender product earned this rating. I too ran into hard drive problems. I too had 2 cameras die due to them being used outside. I too struggled with trying to set up the remote networking part of the unit. Past that the software interface is ugly and awkward to use at best and the CMOS cameras (instead of more common CCD cameras) produced just decent quality video with off color (as others have reported).What others haven't reported as much is how much the product lacks compared to the other popular brands of cam/dvr combos. I have used 4 brands now with this being the worst package and with the most failures of any of them. (It is also the newest!)One thing to point out, is when shopping for these systems look at two very useful features. What is the quality of the cameras (including if the \"outdoor\" cameras really stand up to outdoor conditions) and how many feet the night vision works on as not all are equal. The second feature to make sure you look for is H.264 compression. This allows for maximum storage and less loss of quality which means you can record longer and the result will save better but you still need quality cameras. (The other two major points is overall failures and software/interface.)I hope this information helps you with your purchases and I look forward to trying out an updated Defender product should they release a better quality package.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Video Review on the SN300", "Author": "CKE", "ReviewID": "R1QPQPZ56P59PH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content":

After an internet search I realized that this is a very common problem. Easy to set-up and lots of nice features, but they need a more dependable hard drive.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Defender SN300 is a do-it-yourself home/office security system. It is very easy to install and really only requires a cordless drill. Overall installation can be done in 1-2 hours - in truth, it takes almost as much time learning the system and the menus as it does to do the installation.Features -- Nice crisp cameras- Lots of control over frame rates, recording times, and video quality- Ease of installation- Very easy to cycle through the camera- Everything you need is included - all of the cables are included!- Defender did a great job organizing the box. Everything is positioned in a logical organized method - this may sound crazy but it does aid in the ease of installation.Other notes-- Not Mac compatible - so if you are going to connect the SN300 to your network you will need to borrow or use a PC- The menu screen was a little slow - not much of a complaint- While the SN300 is not complicated it may take a while to learn how to operate through the system.Final Verdict- The SN300 is a excellent choice for homes and offices that need an easy to install security system. The cameras are crisp and the DVR has 2 years worth of memory so the SN300 is worthy of your consideration.---Please Note - I received the SN300 from the manufacturer for reviewing purpose-------", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "System very unreliable", "Author": "CEdison", "ReviewID": "R2BWZJFCL4OLVJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I unfortunately purchased 2 of these systems in April 2010 for use at a vacation home. Although the camera quality is average at best, the systems would be fine if they worked reliably over time.  But they do not. Both systems unexplainably stop recording from time to time, which is the last thing you need from a security system. And when the systems stop recording, remote Internet access is impossible. The final straw for me was the complete failure of the hard disk in one of the DVR units (apparently a common porblem), losing all content and making the system useless. I am sending it in for warranty replacement now, but the company says this will take 2 to 4 weeks. By the way, if you need to call support, for most calls you hang on for 10-15 minutes and then get a message that someone will contact you within 24 hours, which they generally do--but when they do you may not be anywhere close to the system they want you to reboot or adjust or whatever to diagnose the problem.  My conclusion: Do NOT buy this product.

It should be noted that there is no monitor included with the system - you'll need to supply your own (with RCA jack inputs for video).In good lighting (indoors or out), the pictures are clear and have a relatively wide field of vision. At night, the infrared lights do a decent job of lighting a small area (approx 15 feet from the lens) but don't expect the light to do much in a larger space or outdoors. In my own tests with outdoor use, there was a huge amount of \"noise\" in the pictures once the sun went down. Maybe that's an unavoidable problem with light amplification, but it looked bad. In fairness, the picture clears up when something gets back within the 15 foot range.The DVR-style recording unit is extremely compact and can be controlled with a handheld remote. Unfortunately, the remote and base unit frequently didn't want to communicate, requiring multiple button pushes. Additionally, the small (very small) rubber buttons on the controls sometimes stuck in the \"down\" position (getting caught in the body of the remote itself) causing some confusion.An important component of the Defender is its ability to interface with a computer...but sadly, I couldn't test this. When they say that it works with your \"PC,\" they don't mean just a \"personal computer,\" but only a Windows machine (though the only place I could find this information was a small line printed on the bottom of the box). There is no software or support for Mac computers, and my query to the service department asking if Mac compatability was planned went unanswered.Similarly, I was unable to test the \"online monitoring\" function, which seems like it could be a big plus.All in all, the Defender seems like a good package for the price - assuming you have an appropriate TV monitor, a Windows computer, and either small or well-lit areas that you wish to keep track of.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "good for home security - could be better", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3UN7YQ8PRZVSK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This all-in-one video surveillance kit is decent for home security.  Most other kits in this price range (as of this review date) offer higher-quality CCD cameras, smartphone support, FTP/e-mail alerts, and VGA/audio connections.  I learned this the hard way after making an impulse buy.  Oh well.  I am happy with it so far though.  I've used it for a day now continuously without any problems.  The included CMOS cameras display decent-quality video but the color is very washed out - it's like black and white with a smudge of color here and there.  With CCD cameras, that wouldn't be an issue.  I do not recommend using the cameras outdoors - I've owned weatherproof cameras in the past, and these ones aren't, despite what the manufacturer says.  The night vision is really neat and shows everything even in pitch dark.  However, in night vision mode, the cameras will be very sensitive and will display small particulates like dust in the air, which can trigger motion recording.  The motion recording works well, and the sensitivity seems nearly perfect.  Note there is 60 fps SHARED amongst all 4 cameras.  Using the max 60 fps at high quality will max out the storage quickly (in under a week).  At only 4 fps per camera (16 fps total), at highest quality, the video motion is still fluid and you should be able to get about a month or more of footage (using motion detection instead of continuous recording).  Using lower quality for recording is a waste of time since the resulting video will be very pixelated and blurry.  The DVR unit is small and compact - very easy to conceal if necessary.  It lacks a VGA display port and offers only BNC connections for input/output (with RCA plug adapters included).  No audio support.  The buttons on the DVR unit and on the remote are a bit flimsy but will work fine if you press them gently.  I had high expectations for the USB-to-PC feature but it's not much different than the network feature; in both cases, you must run a special client software program to use the DVR remotely.  Windows detects the DVR as a mass storage device, which is awesome.  However, since the DVR uses an oddball storage system instead of a standard FAT or Ext2/3 file system, you can't access the video files directly.  Therefore, you must use the special client program - you cannot use your own automated backup program.  Backing up video content using the client software is a bit tedious since you are forced to playback the footage you want to back up, and then wait for the AVI conversion (which is DivX, by the way).  The DVR runs in simplex mode, not duplex or triplex; this simply means that it can only do one thing at a time instead of offering simultaneous playback and recording.  The built-in configuration setup menu is simple to follow.  The networking setup is pretty straightforward.  You can have an administrator and a regular user account, both with seperate passwords.  You can also password-protect vital DVR functions.  Hard drive prep is a breeze - the DVR unit formats it very quickly.  You must format the entire drive if you want to delete any video from it, however - deletion of individual video events is not supported.  What's great is that you can unplug the DVR, plug it back in later, and it resumes operation seamlessly.  A power button would have been nice, though (geez!).  All in all, this is good for home security use.  If given another opportunity to buy something else, I would.  But I'm content with settling with this product since it works very well and has good support, despite some drawbacks.UPDATE (3 months later):Experiencing some major glitches with the DVR unit.  The case gets very warm and I suspect overheating.  I also had the dreaded hard drive glitch where the unit would not detect the drive.  After it cooled off for awhile, it began to work normally.  Also, at times the motion detection will simply revert to continuously recording from a single camera, usually when I need it the most.  A lot of footage was not recorded because of this.  Another issue is the unit simply malfunctions at times, showing incorrect dates like \"14/16/2133\" and locking up.  My overall experience has changed and I'm not very happy with this surveillance package anymore.  It sickens me to realize that I've spent close to $500 for something that is of mediocre quality.  The unit is still under warranty but based on other reviews I've read from people experiencing the same issues, it doesn't seem worth bothering with it.

Potter", "ReviewID": "R54HIAXYM60QZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Old, long surpassed technology is the number one weakness of Defender SN300-4CH-001.  First, the cameras.  The Defender uses cheap CMOS cameras that have been on the market for around 10 years or so.  Yes, they don't use much power.  However, their image resolution is not on a level with even a cheap CCD camera.  In low light, even with the \"night-vision\" there is a great deal of camera noise. I am not confident the camera would provide a clear enough image to help identify the face of an intruder photographed at night in low ambient light.  The daylight images are much better but still lag behind those produced by CCD cameras.  If you are trying to safeguard your home at night, the Defender is not a good choice.The DVR is ridiculously backwards in terms of technology.  To set it up, you must hook it up to a television--greatly annoying if you plan to hook it up in a room with no TV.  I placed my DVR in my home office next to my computer.  I had to heft down, from the attic, an old school tube tv to perform the initial setup.  There are scads of inexpensive DVRs capable of connecting directly with a computer monitor.  Unless you plan on using the DVR in the vicinity of a TV the Defender will disappoint you.  The quality of the camera connectors is poor, as well.  It is necessary to first connect the camera output plugs to a metal adapter before plugging them into the DVR.  Even then, the adapters are loose.  The slightest tap against one of the camera leads near the back of the DVR results in a dropped picture and annoying beeping until you jiggle the cables enough to somehow reconnect the cameras. I appreciate the loss of camera alarm but it should be much harder to break the connection between the cameras and the DVR.The quality of the hard drive in the DVR is poor.  The drive in my unit died after about two months.  I have no idea why.  I located the unit in a protected, stable, air conditioned space.  It was never dropped, jarred, or otherwise treated roughly.  I hoped to find information on the problem on the Defender-USA web site.  I was wrong.  There is no on-line support.  In fact, there is very little community support for this product at all.  I am sure the warranty would cover a new drive but I have not gone that route because I got my DVR through the Amazon Vine Program.  Besides, I would not want another of the same kind of drive.There there is the internet viewing option.  Be aware, unless you have a static-ip through your ISP, you will have to go through port-forwarding in order to see your cameras images from a remote computer.  The manual that ships with the unit does not provide instructions on how to do this.  Instead, Defender sends you to portforward,com.  I followed all the port forwarding instructions and actually did get multiple ports to forward.  Trouble is, every time I forwarded a port capable of handling http traffic, I found my ISP had blocked it or some other problem kept the Defender from connecting to the net.  In the meantime, though, I set up other remote controlled apps using the port forwarding knowledge I gained.I can't fully fault the Defender system for my inability to use the view anywhere internet functionality.  However, the Defender-USA promotional material touts this connectivity as a huge selling point.  It neglects to point out, however, that it is difficult to set up and one's ISP may not permit it.In summary, the Defender SN300-4CH-001 is a cheap, low quality system delivering less than high quality images using antiquated, archaic technology.  From the set-up menu to the cameras to the DVR, it is clear Defender-USA's goal in developing this product was assemble the cheapest components, dress them up with slick packaging, and market the finished product as an entry level surveillance system.  Trouble is, when one is talking about a system that should have 24/7 up time, be rock solid reliable, and be capable of delivering footage or images upon which police could base a prosecution, cheap-cheap-cheap doesn't cut it.

Based on my experience, neither the optics nor the design of this product is up to par.Optical quality is \"ok\" under artificial light, but colors fade to grey under decreased brightness levels.  Pointing the cameras out the window at night (at an area lit by a bright streetlight) shows only dull blurs on the screen.Color reproduction is far from faithful, even under bright lighting.  My orange tabby cat looks dull orange-grey in the camera view, going to B&W; w/ a hint of tan at close range.  One of the cameras was showing quaint analogue flickers, even though its cord ran across only the DVR itself (no proximity to interference that the other cameras didn't also experience).  The picture looks like a cross between how security cams are depicted on old TV shows and a first-generation camera-phone.The default UI is simple to understand, but a bit annoying.  You can't use the menu while recording.  The default setting has every keypress beeping loudly.  The remote control only works straight-on from the front of the unit.  The onboard interface is a bit slow if you're searching for something, and begs to have a mouse+keyboard instead.The PC interface requires ActiveX, and therefore Internet Explorer browser, which has become less common and less popular in the last few years.  I have used old UIs that require ancient versions of IE, which are no longer available or would be unwise to use.  ActiveX-only is a poor design choice for longevity.There's no audio.  The cabling has various adapters for power and RCA connections, making for a mess of adapters that would make you think you had a lot more than 4 cameras.  The only video output from the DVR is RCA over a BNC (coax) adapter-- really??  Not even VGA or S-video, much less common HDMI?.The drive writes continuously during operation, presumably not buffering to RAM first, and since the camera view is static, it must not be using modern image formats (that store the differences between each frame, rather than each frame individually) such as MJPEG or MPEG, either.  I suspect this unit would soon suffer a failed drive if actually used for 24-hour security purposes.Some nice touches: Everything you need is included, the cameras have integrated wall-mount bases and even an anchor/screw packet per camera.  Virtually no configuration is required.Defender has tried to make setup and use simple for what is normally a rather complex project.  On simplicity, they have succeeded, but not so much in usability or utility.  For this small number of cameras, the dedicated DVR device drives the cost higher than simply running an application on a PC (which the consumer of this product would almost certainly have).  Wireless cameras were cheap enough back then to be an alternative, and definitely are cheap enough now.  All the wiring management is just not necessary when dealing with 1-4 low-end cameras.Since this is not Defender's newest model, their more recent and higher-end gear may be more usable, but for a small personal deployment, this DVR + dumb-camera approach is terribly outmoded.This DVR system may have been acceptable (if not special) for indoor-only usage when it was released.

While I was able to get the system operational, I was unhappy with my amateurish installation (I want a much cleaner and professional look and don't want wires hanging around), so I am going to make the investment of having one of their professional installers come and re-install.

I tried to find a good security system, and checking amazon it had the most good reviews while in a budget range.MAIN POINT why I didn't like it: Took too much time troubleshooting every little thing, had to try different methods of seeing what it liked (sometimes it needed to rest so i had to yank the power cord to turn it off from overheating because it COULDN'T RECORD 24/7 ...memory-wise yes, but the parts felt like it couldn't take the heat).--------->The hard drive was the last straw!!!! Kept saying \"no hard disk detected\" had to try it on a different TV...weird.CONS:-cameras are all wired, not ideal for people who have upstairs or downstairs.-relies only on remote, a mix and match of remote and controls on the DVR doesn't cooperate-firmware is out of date, if you go to the website it looks like it's from some third-rate company,-their 24-hour support is actually some voice-machine that's set to return your call in a day.-oddly, it won't record on the times I really depended on itGOOD:NICE clear cameras, night vision is not good at all, it needs some light to get something decent.ADVICE:find some place local and get one, at least you can take it to the store and yell at them. Amazon's return policy is only 30 days ... I had it for only 20 days since the shipping rate took awhile (even if you pay express shipping), so I felt cheated out of the return.It doesn't matter how much you pay for Defender products, just save yourself time and money by getting a different brand, or just invest in a door alarm or wait a couple of more years until they develop something better.*******UPDATEI called amazon, told them my story about how cruddy the service was with the manufacture and how I would have to pay for shipping for a faulty part, and how SQUARE WARRANTY wouldn't even cover it until 2 months later, they gave me a \"refund\" on the product with free shipping.

After receiving the product and reading the manual I found out that you have to run four 60 feet cables to the cameras, and 60 feet won't even reach 2 sides of the house. Not only that, you cannot hide or lock the DVR because it has to be hooked to the TV monitor and a smart burglar will steal the DVR too! You cannot do the setup on the computer monitor or through the network, it has to be done on the TV. So the DVR & TV have to be in the same room with an ethernet port if you are going to monitor on the computer. I think the company needs to be explicit about the installation process and not mislead the buyers with descriptions like that. The only clue that the cameras are hooked to the DVR by cable is the small print \"4 x 60ft 4 PIN DIN to RCA (male) Power Cables\" under What's in the Box. It could be a useful system for a small business premise but I find it too cumbersome to install and useful in very few situations.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does what it says it will", "Author": "Kaleidocherry", "ReviewID": "R27EUW658DAPK5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took us a long time to achieve success with this item, but that is because the laptop we were trying to use as the command post had some problems.  So in order to review it, we had to set it up, let it run for a week, then disconnect the DVR unit and move it into our TV room, connect it to the TV, and watch it there.  A minor inconvenience for testing, but I wouldn't want to do it all the time.The product has an easy setup.  We posted one camera looking out the window towards a protected \"tree save\"; one camera looking from that windowsill back into the room (just for testing) and one camera upstairs, looking down and out onto the tree save.  We have frequently seen raccoons, deer and our own cats roaming around in there, so we assumed there would be some interesting wildlife footage, even if it were just our own cats poking around looking for mice.The cameras are motion-sensitive so we knew there would be some disconnect in the footage.  We used the TV menu to set it to continue recording for 30 seconds after the motion is detected.  They are also supposed to be night-vision cameras, so we were interested to see that.After a week we moved the DVR to the TV room and connected it.  The upstairs camera hadn't recorded a thing.  Turns out I'd connected the camera to the DVR, but forgotten to plug the camera into its power source.  OK, my bad.  The camera looking into the room had a lot of footage of me and my son going back and forth prepping for school, or cleaning, or whatever.  It worked, but of course the stuff it filmed was really boring.  We had high hopes for the downstairs tree save camera.Augh.  We hadn't considered that trees moving in the wind would generate motion.  We have a solid week of recorded trees waving in the wind.  No animals, and more importantly, no night-vision recording.  It simply stopped recording at night.  There is a time and date stamp on it, so we knew it was skipping that time frame - not that it was recording a black screen.  It's possible that the window/screen was causing too much visual blockage, so the camera couldn't see outside.  Maybe if you mounted the cameras outside it would work.The other issue I had was the cords.  If you were going to use this in any kind of *indoor* real-world security situation, you'd probably want to get professional installation.  We have all three of the cameras set up within about 20 feet of each other (not counting the vertical rise for the upstairs one) and there's still a mess of cords all over the place.  When we want to move the DVR to the TV to look at the footage, we have to disconnect all three cameras, unplug the DVR, bring it and its plug into the TV room, replug it, and connect it to the TV input.  It's a bit of a mess.  So I'd suggest (a) a dedicated computer, TV, or laptop for it, and (b)(1) installing it so the cords are run through your walls or (b)(2) mounting the cameras outside and running the cords through the window or wall right at the place where you keep the DVR.We'll probably leave it up for a few weeks to check for outdoor summer footage, and then pack it up.  It's not worth it to us as a security device.  But it works, mostly well (but for the lack of the night-vision thing).  For us that was not a dealbreaker since it is a fun device for us, but for you, if you want night vision, better look elsewhere.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value, But Setup is Hardly \"Fast & Hassle-Free\"", "Author": "shaxper", "ReviewID": "R3GUBB5OP2RNXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sentinel 300 series is a great value in that it provides all the necessary hardware to observe up to four locations inside or outside of your home with clarity, adjustable features/options, and a generous hard drive with which you can record all of this and even connect it to your computer so that you can watch over the internet in real-time while away from your home.The problem I've run into, however, is installation. The product advertises \"Fast & Hassle Free\" setup, which is true in the sense that you can connect and test the hardware quite quickly. However, actually installing this system is a different ordeal all together. I feel very stupid for not having considered this in advance, but each camera uses wires to connect to the control box. The fact that the wires are hidden in all of the images of the product along with the promise of a \"Fast & Hassle Free\" setup probably helped me to make this rather large oversight.Essentially, you're going to have to do quite a bit of drilling and behind-wall wire running in order to set this thing up, and that's not an easy job to pull off, even for a do-it-yourselfer. The box provides a toll free number if you need help with installation (which you will), and the number refers you to an outside company where a very nervous and overly eager young man informed me that installation of four cameras WITHOUT hiding the wires would run me over two hundred dollars. It's about a hundred and fifty more if you want wires hidden, and that's a rough quote that they gave without even seeing my home or intended setup. Granted, three hundred fifty plus the six hundred forty dollar purchase price isn't such a high price for a good security system, but it is a bit misleading and, worse yet, requires significant work on and inside your walls, which always makes me nervous.As great a system as the Sentinel 300 promises to be, I will not be installing it in my home. It was probably silly of me not to consider everything that would go into installing this system, but I also think Defender worked pretty hard to help me make that stupid decision, concealing the wires in all photos and promising that setup would be \"Fast & Hassle-Free.\" Until Defender pioneers some amazing wireless camera technology, I will simply have to do without. The Sentinel 300 system is a great option for a small business or a person who is comfortable doing their own wiring or has someone they trust to do it for them correctly, but playing inside of walls when it isn't necessary just seems like an invitation for problems and aggravation.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice little gadget", "Author": "Rama Rao \"Rama\"", "ReviewID": "R263RDD7FUPVNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a user friendly security system with DVRs built-in 500GB hard drive which can record over 2 years of continuous video.
