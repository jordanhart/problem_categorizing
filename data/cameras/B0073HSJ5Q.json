I'm not a professional photographer but this camera takes really crisp pictures! Zoom is pretty good and the face tracking is really accurate~ Pixels are not all mashed up when you zoom in it warns you when you zoom in too much and you notice the increasing blurriness of the photo. Pictures in low light look really good also as though there was a light source present. I have yet to experiment much with the videos but it from the little videos i've shot, the video is pretty clear.The fact that I don't have to go mad looking for AA or AAA batteries is a SUPER PLUS! Miss perfect picture moments because of batteries and nobody loves that~  You do have to buy a memory card because the camera doesn't come with one.Terrific camera!

Painfully slow....so slow, that I returned it and got my money back.It's slow (and difficult) to get all 9 focus boxes to appear for a crisp clear picture.It's slow to save the picture to the SD Card (class 10)It's slow to transfer the pictures out of the camera to your computer (at least this can be fixed by taking out the SD Card and connecting it directly to your computer)30% of my pictures were blurry. Most likely because it takes forever to focus. I shot about 1000 pictures on my vacation.  30% (300) blurry photos, that's a lot.PRO'sAs crappy as the camera is to take a STILL picture, it takes great pictures while you're moving (go figure).

Salisbury", "ReviewID": "R16NHMKHN4CJOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mother bought this camera on Amazon for my 10-year old daughter for Christmas.  It seemed perfect for her - very slim and easy to operate.  My daughter loved it immediately.  Unfortunately she left it outside on our swingset ... for almost a week ... and it rained/snowed every day.  They only reason we found it is that it had sleeted/snowed one night, and the kids were out playing the next morning.  I heard my daughter WAILING as she discovered the camera.  It was frozen to the swingset, encased in ice.We brought it inside and packed it in uncooked rice (an old tech trick to dry out electronics) for the 1% chance it might still work.  I assumed that was the end of the story, and that we would call this an expensive lesson in taking care of your possessions.After several days, I pulled the camera out of the rice, popped the battery back in it, and TURNED IT ON!!!  It came on just as if it had been sitting in a drawer for a week, instead of outside in winter precipitation!  I proceeded to take several pictures and played with some settings and it worked fine.  There wasn't even any moisture inside the lens.  My daughter was absolutely thrilled and has been snapping photos ever since.So I have to give it to Nikon - they made one heck of a camera here.

Nikon.", "Author": "Ray Woodcock", "ReviewID": "RF3KTWGE4D00E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a very positive reaction upon opening the box.  It is really refreshing to open a product and see the things you'd expect, like a user's manual and a CD.  And then to go to the manufacturer's website and see downloads, FAQs, and more manuals.  Right from the start, I felt like I had really gotten a deal -- like this used to be a $300 camera, and they put the love and attention into it that you'd put into selling a $300 camera.Now, some additional notes, as I got into the website and the camera.The manual didn't tell me where to find my serial number, and neither did the product registration page.  Neither the outside of the box nor the bottom of the camera indicated that the number shown there (which, inspection confirmed, was the same) was the \"serial number\" OR \"S/N.\"  Oddly, the Nikon product registration page indicated that no manuals or updates were available, when that was obviously not true.I wish electronics manufacturers didn't find it necessary to use proprietary jacks and cables.  That includes this Nikon.  It would be a lot easier to pack for a trip, and there would be less risk of leaving an essential cable at home, if they would all just use the standard mini-USB cable.  One cable would handle everything.I installed the carrying strap, battery, and SDHC memory card.  Mine came with a 4GB class 4 SDHC memory card, but I replaced that with an 8GB class 10.  I had one lying around.  Not sure if that helped.  It didn't hurt.The Nikon website is not well organized.  For instance, I found myself at a page offering the answer to my question.  But I had not asked any questions.  The question being answered was, \"Where can I download the latest Nikon software updates?\"  That was a good question.  This page did not quite answer it.  It showed 20 different updates, with no indication of which, if any, applied to my particular camera.  Apparently I was supposed to load the included CD first, see what was on it, and infer that the only software applicable to me was whatever would be on the CD.  But even then, no dates were supplied:  I didn't see how I could tell whether the website's offerings were more recent than those on the CD.Starting with the CD, I looked first at the proffered ViewNX2 software.  I wasn't sure I needed it.  I had prior experience with unnecessary camera software.  I already had image editors I liked.  I figured out that the included recharger was just a transformer, from 120V AC to the USB input needed by the camera, so I put that part back in the box and just ran the USB cable directly from the computer to the camera.  As soon as I connected that, the camera turned on and let me set date and time.  I also got a dialog on the computer, offering to let me browse or import pictures, etc.  So I held off on installing ViewNX2 for now.That meant I didn't download any other updates.  There was one possible exception.  Somehow I found a webpage indicating that there was a firmware update for my camera.  But it wasn't applicable to Windows 7 nor to 64-bit operating systems.  So it wasn't useful in my case.Meanwhile, now that I had connected the cable, a light on the camera was flashing green.  The manual said this meant it was charging, and it would require 2.5 hours to charge a fully exhausted battery, and then the light would turn off.Other than that, I didn't go through the manual in detail at this point.  There was too much to learn.  Some of it was familiar from my previous camera; some was not.  It seemed more efficient to check back as I came up against specific questions.After charging the camera, I took some photos.  Excellent quality.  My previous camera was slow -- I would take a picture and then have to wait a couple of seconds before it was done saving it.  That was not an issue here.  (The SDHC card was the same one as in the previous camera.)  It saved the photos within, I think, less than a second.That was as far as I got at this point.  So far, I really like this little camera.Update, Dec. 1, 2013.  This camera has been good for me for 11 months now.  I wish it were easier to hold and use one-handed; sometimes I use it to take pictures of items indoors without a flash, and am holding a light in the other hand.  Also, for some reason, it is not transferring via cable; I have to pop out the memory card and put it into the computer each time I want to transfer pictures.  Not sure if that's a camera issue or a computer issue.  There are also times when I think it could do a better job of identifying the object of attention, in medium to low-light conditions, so as to bump up its shutter speed and avoid blurring.

If someone gives you one as a gift, exchange it before you're even tempted to open the box.The camera is slow and takes lousy pictures. The screen is horrible. The video is incredibly grainy at any resolution. It is the worst handling camera that I've ever used. It's actually pretty surprising how poorly this thing fits in your hands. It's so awkward to hold that your hands almost always interfere with the camera's operation. Nikon uses a proprietary USB cable for this camera.All of that is almost forgivable at this price-point. It's a cheap camera and I was not expecting anything more. Had the camera actually worked, I would have given it two and a half or three stars. However my camera was also defective, and (repeatedly) trying to deal with Nikon's \"repair\" center has convinced me that Nikon is not a company that I want to do business with.My camera would not recharge its battery. The charging light comes on, but the battery does not charge. I tried a different charger, charging cable and even a different battery. None of this worked of course, because the camera is defective. So we sent the camera to Nikon for warranty repair. They had the camera for about four weeks, and sent it back to me without repairing it. The \"repair\" slip said that they had fully tested the camera, and found no trouble with it, so they sent it back as is. Obviously the camera still doesn't work.I called Nikon's repair center number which I found on their website, and explained my situation to their rep. I have experienced some bad customer service, but Nikon really takes the cake. At different points in the conversation, I was told each of the following things:1. The camera is working fine. The charging light means that it's charging.2. Charging the camera for more than three hours can damage the battery.3. The camera is not charging because I used an \"un-approved\" brand of SDHC card (Transcend) which corrupted the firmware.4. There are only four \"Nikon approved\" brands of SD card, and that they can be found in the owner's manual.5. Removing the SD card has fixed the firmware, and it really is charging now that the Transcend brand SD card is out.6. Nikon does not replace defective hardware under any circumstances, but I can send the camera back for further \"repair.\"7. Nikon does not refund defective product under any circumstances, but I can try my luck with the store that I bought the camera at.Let's take this line by line:1. I already told the rep that the light comes on, but that it isn't actually charging the battery. It's easy to tell, because the camera won't turn on even after several hours on the charger.2. This is a blatant lie. Li-Ion batteries require specific circuitry to prevent overcharging. If overcharging ever occurs, it's because the device is defective.3. This line is packed full of BS. A. SDHC cards are an industry standard. If a device accepts SDHC cards, than it accepts ALL SDHC cards. B. Transcend makes great SDHC cards. This particular card has worked, and continues to work flawlessly in every computer and device that it's ever been connected to (including this lousy camera). C. No SDHC card could affect a camera's firmware. Firmware is loaded at boot time, and is not writable from within the device's OS. Changing firmware requires special software, and should even require very strong encryption keys. If any consumer device's firmware was ever discovered to be writable via the SDHC card any respectable manufacturer would issue a recall. D. IF the firmware actually WAS corrupt, then the repair center would have found and should have fixed that.4. If there are only four brands of SDHC card that work with Nikon's cameras, then Nikon's cameras are not standards compliant. This alone (if true) would be reason enough not purchase a product, ESPECIALLY one which is meant to capture special moments. Also this should really be printed on the outside of the packaging, since most people buy media at the same time that they buy a new camera.5. If Nikon has invented a method by which a corrupted firmware can repair itself, then they have achieved a truly monumental feat of technological engineering. I have a VERY hard time believing that they have invented such a game changing technology, and that they chose to introduce it to the world by way of their entry level product.6. If Nikon were able to repair the camera in the first place, I would be writing a very different review. It took them over four weeks to not repair it when they did nothing at all. How long will they have it if they decide to do SOMETHING???7. That was the first and only honest thing that the rep said to me. I will never purchase another Nikon product, and I will take every opportunity to explain to my friends and family why I will not and why they should not.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "BAD", "Author": "katie", "ReviewID": "R3Q4W90WP3P2RM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Seriously takes awful pics.

I like to have a point and shoot in my pocket a lot of the time, they're small and easy to carry. Previous Nikon pocket cameras have done a great job, and often getting better results than my D70s DSLR. And, let me add I always bought the Nikon model at the low end $100-$150 price range, not the higher priced models.This camera is HORRIBLE. First and foremost, the focus is dreadful. I just used it for a weekend in Telluride and had to discard at least half of my photos, as they were not in focus. Same for an earlier event a month ago. I don't know what this camera is trying to focus on, but NOTHING in the images was in focus.  I had read this on earlier reviews, but ignored it thinking it was user error. It's NOT. I have always been able to pull a pocket camera out and get a nice image no matter where I was. Not with this thing.Next up is the exposure itself. Horrid. I took some outdoor photos, granted in snow, but they were unusable, could not even rescue acceptable images with editing software. Previous models did quite well outside.The flash is also not  very powerful, I've used pocket cameras from Nikon and got good indoor photos at night, not with this thing. The photos are grainy because there simply isn't enough light, and that's assuming they are well-focused, which I've already discussed. Also, the flash is on the same side as the shutter button, so invariably if you ask someone to take a photo, you have to tell them to move the fingers that automatically are place on the front of the camera, but in this case, block the flash.I only gave it one star because I had to. This camera is a total FAIL by Nikon. I know it's a cheapy, but previous cheapies from Nikon did a respectable job to just \"get the shot\" with a camera I could easily carry in my pocket. It's a bummer I didn't listen to the reviews and bought this.

Kodaks seem to be no more but I had liked whatever color rendition they offered better than Canons I have dealt with and for the price, thought this would be a good possibility.  I'm always doubtful about zoom on these cheap cameras as getting one that follows focus is always iffy, or the first thing to go after some use.  So, when downloaded off the chip this camera gives a large frame size 15.3 x 11.5 approx at 300 dpi.  The old 14 megapixel camera input at 480 dpi and a smaller frame size.  This means that if you want to save the 16 megapixel image to a higher dpi, you have to settle for whatever extrapolation the editing program is going to do and so far I am not seeing a perceptible sharpness improvement to this pictures or any better quality when I have zoomed and cropped, which is the other use for these high megapixel cameras.  But the zoom is there and I needed it because the camera is a much wider angle lens when you open it up, almost a fish-eye. Usually if the zoom doesn't follow focus, I fall back on not zooming and relying on editing the image.  With this camera, I have to edit almost every shot for the fish-eye effect to get rid of the keystoning. also some of the zoom pictures are too fuzzy when zoomed--just not sharp, which tells me that the follow-focus aspect of the zoom already doesn't really work that well.  Still, I do sometimes need a wide angle camera and for the price it wasn't bad.  The color rendering seems to be okay, better than the Canons and there are options when shooting whether to go wth a vibrant color setting; also the iso change option worked fairly well. In many ways the thinking that went into the design was more useful for someone who photographs quite a lot, working with landscapes and buildings primarily.  I may have to fiddle with the focus options to avoid the \"find face\" feature and see if it improves the quality of the images.  So, I'd say it's serviceable but you won't feel as though you've gotten much bang for that 16 MP but it's short money to try it.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great starter camera", "Author": "William Weeks", "ReviewID": "RVAS3JGVXKJ0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this for our young daughter.

I just use it for family gatherings and do not abuse it. Never left my house. However, the one big moment I wanted a camera was for when I volunteered at the Wounded Warriors galA inTexas with my 2 daughters and granddaughter and guess what it did not work would not focus. Now that was a once in a lifetime event for which I had no camera. Mind you I had already returned it once at my expense, they repaired it, no explanation of what was fixed, so now this is the second return, at my expense again, this time they gave an explanation that the focus needed to be repaired. so In four mos I have returned it twice at my expense. I emailed them my concerns,no response, so wrote them a physical letter over a month ago and no response to that either. So for mE and my family we all agre say this is a loser. If a company this large does not respond to their customers concerns I for one think they don't derserve my business ever again.My family will not buy their products either and I will continue to tell everyone that asks it is a pc of junk", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect little camera", "Author": "Nancy Eaton \"ne1054\"", "ReviewID": "RNDXAKH6QYRGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compact, Fits in my purse, easy to operate and focus is nice.

I do wish the camera had come with some kind of protection to prevent that from happening.  The broken camera continued to take beautiful pictures and actually was fun to use because of the \"blind\" point and shoot.  I bought a second camera almost immediately and enjoyed having double the batteries, cords, etc. to keep both charged and let the broken one be my \"back up\" for the good one.  The reason I had to buy a third was that my daughter accidentally tried to charge each of the cameras and unknowingly forced a KODAK camera charger cord into the ports on both, which made them both unable to charge and the one with the unbroken display would show nothing.  So now I have one working camera with three batteries, sets of cords, etc...  Hard lessons learned.  I now wrap my cameras in an old sock to protect the display and my daughter learned to NEVER FORCE any electronic connections.  I think it stinks that the electronic industry continues to require all different sizes of batteries and does not have universal ports to charge devices.

I own a Canon Powershot Elph 310 HS and am a Canon fanatic, but I wanted to see what Nikon had to offer for a point and shoot. Having worked with a Nikon D3100 DSLR in the past, I was expecting decent results from their more affordable point and shoot line. However, after using this camera for only a day and a half, I returned it to the store and decided to get the Canon Powershot A2300 for the extra ten dollars. The main reason I returned this product was the picture quality; LOTS of noise in pictures EVEN with the flash on! It is practically impossible to take a picture with out the flash, and with the flash everything in the image is washed out. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I took a picture indoors with adequate lighting AND flash and the picture came out almost completely black:( The camera is also very slow, the time it takes for the camera to focus, take the picture etc is very long, and you are likely to miss the shot you are looking for. The build quality of the camera is attractive, and it is very small and compact, great size for your pocket or purse (one of the main reasons I purchased it)but that fact is irrelevant if your pictures all fail to turn out.

I sent it in for the 1 year warranty repair and Nikon wanted to charge me $120 for fix it because the USB port was easy to damage, due to poor quality of design, and therefore it voided the warranty. Nikon will not repair any of it whether it is covered under warranty or not because the USB port does not work.

You have to use the telephoto/wide button to bring it into focus. then you press the shutter halfway so it'll focus it for you. What a joke 90 percent of my photos were blurry. Outdoors, indoors it didn't matter. I tried and tried, I read all the instructions I tried every setting and out of the 50 or so photos I shot I have 3 that were not blurry. I can focus faster with a single lens reflex and get perfect pictures all the time. My little 6mp camera has yet to take a blurry picture.
