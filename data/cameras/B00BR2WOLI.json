{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera and Good value in the bundle!", "Author": "Robert Tacsion", "ReviewID": "R114TFT73WJ673", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have separate reviews for the camera itself and then the bundle:Nikon D7100 Overall Rating: 4.5/5Positives:+ Image quality in pictures is excellent. Maintains good image quality even at high ISO settings.(better than many cameras in its class)+ Excellent video quality (best in its class according to \"Consumer Reports\")+ 51-point auto focus system (allows you to focus on images much faster on a moving subject)+ 2 SD card slots+ Solid build quality (firm, nice grips, and definitely feels like an expensive piece of equipment)+ Fast and the menus/settings become simple to use after a bit of tinkering around+ Cheaper than the Canon 7D (which was the camera I originally planned to purchase)+ Headphone output (great while shooting and watching videos with the camera)Negatives:- No aperture control while shooting video! :(- A bit heavy to carry around for long periods of time, especially with a lens attached to it- Questionable ergonomics (I wish the ISO button was on the right side, where I wouldn't have to take my hand off of the lens)Overall, the Nikon D7100 is a solid purchase and I'm very happy with it so far. I'm not a professional photographer, but I do visual effects on movies for a living; so I understand composition/cinematography etc. I also had to learn how to use an SLR camera in college (ISO/Aperture adjustments, long-shutter exposures, etc) so I can confidently say that this camera captures excellent images and video, and makes it simple to obtain desirable results.The Bundle: Overall Rating: 4.5/5Positives:+ $2100-$2300 value for less than $1900+ Already cheaper than purchasing the Nikon D7100 + 18-105mm lens bundle and Nikkor 55-300mm lens separately.+ You don't need much else after this bundleNegatives:- No tripod in this bundle (one of staples to have in photography)- Samyang 500mm telephoto lens is too large to fit in the backpack (with everything else inside) and is very cumbersome to use.Overall, this is an excellent bundle; most people won't need to purchase much else; although I would sell the Samyang telephoto lens for a decent tripod instead. I am very happy with the purchase; I felt like a kid on Christmas morning when I opened the package. It got me really excited when I got to open the boxes and bags of extra items. I'm glad I went with the D7100 instead of the Canon 7D.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Package,excellent camera and lenses", "Author": "Claus W.", "ReviewID": "R259WE2H21QF02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have received the camera and the accessories about a week ago. I own a Nikon D100 for about 14 years now. Great upgrade.So far I love the D7100 and its possibilities. I have not found a point to criticize yet.I have ordered a second memory card because like to shoot both RAW and JPEG at the same time. That way I can store the different formats on separate memory cards in the camera.I like the package content and use all items except the screen protector and the back pack. The back pack is not practical for a camera and lenses. I use a traditional camera bag over my shoulder. That way when I change lenses it is faster and can be done on the spot.The large 500mm  lens does not fit in my bag nor in the back pack. But it is a lens which is used for specific application only anyway. I do not need to carry that around all the time.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent camera", "Author": "John M.", "ReviewID": "R7ERIR3VYSTM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my wife who was wanting to upgrade her Cannon XTi.  We researched numerous DSLR cameras from Nikon and Cannon and decided that the D7100 was a camera that wasn't a full frame but had enough to produce spectacular photos.  We were particularly looking for a camera to handle low light action shots due to attending our children's dance recitals.  I am nowhere near an expert, but this camera combination provided everything I needed to build on.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Package and Price", "Author": "Johnathon Lee", "ReviewID": "R2PU7FP22JGXU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the price. I compared several places and was waiting on a sale to get the D7000 at a big discount, since the 7100 came out. Once I saw the package price on this (for a 7100) I could not pass it up. Everything came as promised. I haven't shot with the Tele-Photo lens yet, but looks to be a quality piece and easy to mount. Surprised by the adjustable Monopod, I don't know if I missed it in the description or if it wasn't labeled well. The photo back-pack is cool, but as someone pointed out, it doesn't hold everything (I was able to get everything into my Amazon Basics Back-Pack). Accessories included are just what you need, meaning you would have to buy if it wasn't included. Lastly, the Nikon 7100 is amazing.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!
