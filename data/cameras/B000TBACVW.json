{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Carol Duerr", "ReviewID": "R2QKRZLD0OCPEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to keep an eye on our vehicles especially at night. This camera is exactly what I needed. It has a great wide angle to it and you can adjust it for closer viewing if you need to. The IR feature is great providing enough light to see clearly at night. I was impressed by how bright it was since I have had other IR cameras and they are not as bright even though they had the same number or more LED's. I do not have the audio feature hooked up yet so I don't know how well that works. It also works very well during the daylight hours. I highly recommend this product if you have the need for one. It is a fantastic bargain for the price.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fair Quality Camera", "Author": "DaveM", "ReviewID": "ROAEEHS20Y6LO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am using this camera outdoors to observe a driveway.  The image quality is what you would expect from a 420 line camera - ok, but not particularly sharp.  The night vision is good out to 30 or 40 feet, automatically switching to black and white at dusk.  The mounting bracket is poorly designed and not totally stable.  The IR led's have an obvious red glow when seen at night - drawing perhaps unwanted attention to the camera.  I have not connected the audio.  I will probably spend a bit more and get a higher resoulution camera to replace it.UPDATE MAY 2009:  I have connected the audio on the camera and the mike sensitivity is good.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.95", "Features": "1/3\" CCD, color DSP image sensor.
