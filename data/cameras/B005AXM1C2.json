But I was wrong. It promptly fried my IR camera after I plugged them in. Regardless, when this cam was plugged in, the 50' runs are grossly under powered resulting in poor image quality and the IR on and off often, it can't work at night causing the cam to go offline unless there is a light source in the field of view of the cam. Last night, this camera went offline due to this 2A power supply is under powered.This $7 PS has just cost me a $1, 00 in fried my camera! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! This unit should be pulled from the market and banned from Amazon.
