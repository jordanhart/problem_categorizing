{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally It's HERE!", "Author": "Tay", "ReviewID": "R1FFIC1387GJ5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I have been waiting for this camera since early February. And waiting and waiting long after it was supposed to be released February 15th. Today I finally got mine! (obviously only having it for a few hours won't allow me to give the best review but I would like to point out some of the things I have noticed) I am an avid camera collector and Nikon fan, taking classes in high school and college (and the last thing I needed was yet another camera) but I was unhappy with my options. My DSLR took fantastic pictures but was too heavy to carry around for everyday use and my basic point and shoot was the perfect pocket size, but took less than decent pictures. I was hoping a bridge camera would solve all of my problems.Pros so far:- Camera powers on very quickly.- Its surprisingly light and compact without sacrificing amazing picture quality.- The camera body has a nice grip on it so it's easy to hold on to and stays in your hand.- The pop out screen makes it oh so easy to see pictures you're taking at weird angles.- Easy to use (especially for those people who aren't comfortable with adjusting ISO and shutter speed manually - but can be adjusted for those who are)- Has tons of settings (hard to say forsure but seems like it performs well in low light situations)- The zoom is INCREDIBLE (I can take a picture of a lego mini figure from 20 feet away with better clarity and image quality than I could right in front of the object with my point and shoot)The downsides I have noticed so far:-Video is alright, when I blow it up on my computer it doesn't look to be true HD quality but it's good. Also the zoom on the video can be heard no matter what which is a little annoying.-The zoom on the actual camera is very slow if you're extending it the full range and it takes a few seconds to focus.- Battery life is not that good - would definitely recommend getting a back up!Overall I LOVE this camera. Sure you may find a Canon or Olympus that has slightly better reviews in one feature or another, but let's be real, no camera has it all. However, in my opinion so far this comes pretty close!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best all-around camera today!", "Author": "Bob_Review", "ReviewID": "R4UQN930HIYEA", "Overall": "5.0",

It can be a telescope, as well as a macro camera as you can see in the video.  By far the most versatile camera I have ever owned.  It is an upgrade to my Nikon P90, and it is amazing.The pictures of the moon and Venus were done on a tripod, but can you think of another point and shoot camera that can see Venus in its crescent phase?  Incredible.  And no sacrifice in macro mode as well.  I have taken action shots in soccer from across the field with no vibration issues.  I can't say enough about this camera!  You can use it in action situations, for wildlife at a distance as well as amateur astronomy.Please note that windows moviemaker reduced resolution to 640x480 on the video - use it to gauge its versatility, not its resolution.  The pictures are very sharp!", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Pictures, Poor Video", "Author": "Sonya", "ReviewID": "R2LNKIP2POZK7P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the Nikon P510 for a week now and have been comparing it to a Panasonic FZ150 that I am also testing.The P510 is a very nice looking camera that has a quality look and feel.  It has a nice textured rubberized material on the hand grip and it has a solid feel.The camera powers on quickly.  I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and I was happy with the results.  The shot to shot speed is slower than the FZ150 and overall it does not feel as fast or snappy as the FZ150 in everyday use.The 42X zoom is incredible but it was slow to focus, or would not focus at all sometimes with the zoom at it's outer reaches.Overall I slightly preferred the picture quality on the FZ150 and had more keepers with the FZ150 due to its faster and more accurate auto focus.  But if I wasn't doing a side by side comparison I would be happy with the picture quality on the Nikon.The biggest problem I have with the P510 is it's video performance.  The actual video image quality is excellent.  In fact the low light video quality is impressive and considerably better than the FZ150.  There are, however, three big problems.1)Inability to focus at extended zoom range.  After you zoom about two thirds of the range it is unable to auto focus.  So while it has an incredible 42X zoom, it is not usable with video.  And it's not like you know when it will loose focus so you just end up with a video scene that suddenly turns blurry as you zoom.2)It refocuses every time you touch the zoom control.  Even if you just slightly zoom, the camera looses focus for about one second before locking in again.  You end up with a video clip that has multiple one second blurry segments intermixed within an otherwise clear video.3)The sound of the lens zooming is picked up while recording.  This is not just heard during very quiet scenes, it is heard all the time.  I was surprised how loud it was when playing back a video.If video performance is not important to you, the Nikon is a really nice camera.  I am looking for a camera does well at both photos and video and therefore will be returning this camera.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased so far -- exceptional camera", "Author": "N.

I took numerous pictures with both, but decided to keep the Nikon p510.  Although both cameras took very nice pictures, I liked the way that people shots came out with the Nikon p510, especially indoors.  The Nikon p510 seems to give a nice \"matte\" finish to skin shots and with a bit more color, whereas the Sony hx200v showed/emphasized more skin flaws.  Also, indoor pics with the Sony were inconsistent - sometimes too yellow, and other times too white (overexposed).  Although the Sony hx200v does have a \"soft skin\" setting, I felt it looked too unnatural (gave the skin too much of a porcelain doll finish).  Also, the Nikon p510 seems to handle indoor pics better where there is a lot of backlight.  Outdoor pics are nice with both cameras, but again I preferred the people pics with the Nikon p510 (the outdoor people pics taken with the Sony were more neutral toned).  The only reason I give this review 4 stars is because the zoom can be a bit flaky when trying to focus with maximum zoom, in particular on small objects such as birds; sometimes it would focus right away, but a lot of times I had to keep adjusting the zoom before it decided to focus.  Yet, I haven't had this problem with other types of pictures.4/22/12 update:  I think I found the solution to the problem I had with zooming on small objects.  Pg 72 of the disc manual (\"Using Focus Modes\") talks about how to change focus modes.  It seems that when I change the focus to \"infinity\", it focuses on the subject a lot quicker.  I'm still going to play with this setting a bit more, but so far it seems to have helped.  Also, after reading page 73 (\"Available Focus Modes\"), it looks like \"manual focus\" may also be helpful on zooming in on small objects.  I will play with these settings for a while.  If I find these settings consistently work, I will change my rating to 5 stars.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "It'll make you happy if you aren't a pixel peeper", "Author": "Edward", "ReviewID": "R25RQG3MFY1SNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I reallyl liked this camera. As with all superzooms out there, it has its pros and cons. Image quality on the Canon SX40 HS is better, the P510 may be in the same league as the Panasonic FZ150 though.Battery life is the weakest point here, the battery is half the size of SX40's and FZ150's.The strongest point is the LCD, with a 900k resolution, it's much better than Canon's 200k and Panasonics's 400k. Though the LCD can't be flipped to face you when you're taking pictures of yourself.Also the zoom is a very strong point, it's much more than what you get with the FZ150, but it's comparable really to what the SX40 has to offer.Overall, this camera is very fun to use, and it's weakest points are bareable and are most regarding to battery life.

I just took photos of my kid's concert and I never could get close enough to take pictures like these. The digital zoom is outstanding and had no problem zooming in to view my child from a far distance away. Video mode also worked well from a distance. This camera is well worth its price. I paid over $2000.00 for my D80 and sigma lens a few years ago. Nikon's got a real winner of a product on its hands. I hope the quality of this camera is like my D80 which is top notch. For me to get the same zoom, I would have to spend a few thousand on a new lens for my D80 and then switch the lens (pain in the rear when traveling or on the go which is usually the case for me) in order to get close to the P510's 42x optical and digital zoom.

I obtained my first D-SLR five years ago.  I am mostly a nature and scenic photographer. I've been looking for a reasonable substitute for a $10,000 2.8 on a $3,000 D800.  A professional nature photographer suggested I give this a look.  While it certainly id not as sharp as a 1000mm 2.8 on a D4, 300 or the new 800, for the price, it is remarkably close.  I was most amazed at it's low light capabilities.  Image and color qualities are better than I expected.I read the single star review, and I suppose you can get a bad apple even with the best of quality controls, but I have found none of his problems.  Battery life --- I am amazed how long it lasts. Of course, being an \"old timer\" I use the view finder.  I know of no professional or serious amateur that uses the preview screen for generall composiyin and framing, but I do like the ability to use it in flip up mode while on a tripod for ground level shooting versus getting down on my old knees.  My only disappointment battery wise, it that it has to be charged \"on board\".  The camera did not come with a stand alone charger, but there are plenty of after market chargers with batteries on line for under $20.  Macro:  There is a macro setting.  You can take close up, but it takes practice to get it to focus correctly.  I will still use my D-SLR for macro-work. I do a lot of close up photography. The P510 is not the best choice if you do to.The GPS. It works, but you have to be patient.  I takes several minutes to lock on.  Don't worry about any of the articles that scare you with privacy concerns .... It will not record in your home.  Even heavy canopy (trees) block it.  But, to record where you took remote location pictures from a days hike into the wilderness, it is a neat feature.Wide angle. For a point and shoot, it is reasonably wide.  I prefer my 10 to 20mm on my D-SLR.Telephoto:  This is where it shines.  The image stabilization is a plus and you will take many good hand-held at the maximum zoom, but if you want excellent sharpness, use a tripod.  Resolution does drop off if your subject is over 150 feet away. Up to that, you can still see individual hairs on a squirrel in sharp focus and the  individual tines of a bird feather.  As you get beyond that, this fine detail pushes the pixels, and is why folks who can afford to do so, buy $6,000 + lens. But, for a $430 camera,  you will great enlargements.What it does not have and needs:  I do wish it had an remote shutter release ... both wired and infrared.  It is hard even on a tripod to get perfectly stable camera while pressing the one and only shutter release.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great All Around Camera for the Price", "Author": "CR", "ReviewID": "R3HIMX3RYH20TE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I have to say that I bought the red camera, and I love the color!

We took each of them out into the field for one day and also did some head-to-head comparison shots under realistic conditions. The SX40 was the clear winner of the contest. Our review is based on the performance for our particular purpose, but will likely apply to anyone that will use the max zoom frequently. If looking for a general purpose camera, neither of the two is a good choice. A 30+ zoom involves technical compromises that will render these models inferior to others under more typical conditions.Here are the details:- Auto focus: Focusing with an 800mm + lens is a challenge for any camera. One should expect that depending on the exact circumstances focusing may take a few seconds and sometimes fails altogether. Given that, both models performed surprisingly well. However, the SX40 somewhat outperformed the P510 in speed and reliability. This is an important factor for us, as birds often do not wait for us zooming in on them.- Image quality: At the same zoom level, the SX40 has a noticeably sharper image. The P510 suffers from being \"over-pixeled\" with its 16MP sensor. Compared to the SX40 the pictures are visibly noisy. Contrast and color rendering of the SX40 are also superior.- Long zoom: The P510 has a longer zoom, up to 1000 35mm equivalent vs. 840 for the SX40. Here is the bad news: If you take a picture at 840mm with P510 and crop to what it would be at 1000mm, you get a higher quality picture compared to a picture taken at 1000mm. In short the optical zoom is inferior to a digital zoom, and it is shockingly obvious. As mentioned, the 840mm picture is still worse than the SX40 picture at the its max zoom level. This was really the deciding factor for us.- Weight and size: The P510 is a bit smaller and noticeably lighter than the SX40. Not enough to really matter for us, but it could be relevant for some people.- Somewhat minor, but a bit annoying: The design of SX40 lens cover is poor: Hard to put on, easy to fall off.Summary: Both cameras are good choices if you are looking for an easy to carry camera that lets you zoom up to near 1000mm and take reasonably sharp picture without a tripod. Given that this was beyond laughable just a few years ago, it is difficult to be to harsh with either model. However, the SX40 clearly outperforms the P510 in image quality. It seems a bit damning that the main reason for that is \"over-pixelation\" and \"over-zooming\" on the side of the P510, something that Nikon's engineers are certainly well aware of.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera--Even With Flaws", "Author": "Steven J. Streitfeld \"SJS\"", "ReviewID": "RCNM7ZORZ0R2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited almost 6 weeks to get this camera at a reduced price and it has been well worth the wait.  The reference manual alone is over 260 pages long, but if you plan to take shots using other than Intelligent Mode, it's worth the read to familiarize yourself with this camera and its many functions.  I've read the previous reviews on this forum...the criticisms centered around focusing problems, stability at the zoom's far ranges, short battery life, difficulty downloading shots using a memory card and motor sounds that can be heard during playback while panning during motion picture photography.  I'll go over each one.  I took shots of birds in our backyard utilizing the the zoom at full range.  I was able to get clear shots of the bird feeder but in order to get a clear shot of the sparrows, I had to focus elsewhere.  I was able to take these shots without using a tripod, something my old Olympus 800UZ from two years ago could not do because using the zoom at maximum would cause instablity.  In short, I had no stability problems using the Nikon, but to get the autofocus to hone in on a small bird, I had to focus on something else for it to work.  Although I've experienced similar problems with the Sonys, Panasonics, Olympus and Samsung digital cameras I've owned in the past, the Nikon autofocus problem was only resolveable if you focus on another object.  I tried motion picture shots of the same birds in the yard, panning in and out without hearing any discernible motor sounds during playback, which means the motor problem mentioned in earliler reviews has been corrected, or the sound mentioned was barely discernible to begin with.  As far as battery life goes, I have sadly come to the conclusion that this may be correct.  The original battery with the lower MaH rating(storage capacity) lasted for several days and conked out without much notice.  I used an aftermarket battery as replacement with a higher MaH rating and it didn't last more than a few hours on a full charge.  Using the EVF, editing features, autofocus without taking a lot of shots can drain your battery quickly even with the power saver set at 30 seconds to go in standy mode.  By the way, using a higher rated battery also means it will take longer to charge that battery, in much the same manner as having a larger gas tank on your car takes longer to fill than a smaller one.  A word about battery chargers:  It is not necessary to use the supplied camera cable to charge your batteries in-camera.  Ebay has higher rated batteries and wall chargers that also charge your batteries using a ciagarette lighter in your car, a handy accessory if you're down to your last spare battery while on a road trip.  It is not necessary to use the supplied camera cable to computer port to download photos.  I've found that an SCHC memory card reader can also read and download photos to your hard drive, although using the Nikon software supplied with the camera to download your photos is slow and cumbersome.  I used Webshots desktop and downloads take a fraction of the time but with drawbacks:  There are no editing features like the Nikon software on Webshots, and motion picture photos taken on the memory card will not download using this method, nor can you use the many editing features included in the Nikon software even if you download videos using Real Player.  There is no in-camera guide to explain various functions like my Oly had, and it would take another camera bag to lug around the 260 page instruction manual that can be downloaded from the Nikon web site.  The sweep panorama is a technological breakthrough compared to the assist panorama (also an available option here) which requires the user to take up to 3 separate photos while panning across 180 or 360 degrees and using a floating target to ensure the pictures are stitched together correctly by the camera's computer.  The net result often was that photoshopped or stitched together look instead of the smooth look you get from the sweep panorama function.  The in-camera GPS function is only good when you're outdoors and able to get GPS signals. To make a GPS log, the camera's reference manual tells you to download it from their web site using a card reader and a memory card every week or two.  Click on the My Computer link before you insert the card reader so you can determine which removable drive it can be found on your computer.  If you download it to your desktop, right click your mouse and transfer the file to the removable drive on your computer where the memory card is located.  If you click on one of those two drives while the card reader is insterted, you can see the NCFL folder where the info is being stored.  Right click your mouse on the file created by the download and drag it to the NCFL folder.  Insert the memory card into your camera and your camera will update the A-GPS file in about two minutes.  Two years ago, I thought we had seen the last of the EVF, but Nikon has brought it back.  For those that prefer a monitor for composing shots, it is adjustable for those hard to reach shots at concerts.  If you still prefer the convenience of AA batteries instead of Lithium-Ion, I see no evidence that any major camera manufacturer plans a return to that standard again now or in the near future.  I would have preferred a time-lapse photography function, but given the numerous features included here, I won't quibble.  While I have no intention of retiring my tripod, I won't have to use it as much for wildlife shots and sunrises and sunsets from Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park.  I've never owned a Nikon before, but after this camera, I will give serious consideration to owning another one in the near future.  I just hope next year's model can resolve the autofocus issue encountered in the P510.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Features, low price", "Author": "Nailesh", "ReviewID": "R3157U0TSEOMCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a bridge camera from quite sometime and this fits my choice because of lots of features and price.

Okay, so it's not a DSLR, which I definitely prefer, but it suits my needs for ordinary shots and when I don't want to drag the D90 around.  First impression is that the body seems a little cheaply made and I'm not crazy about the red color, but I'm comparing it to the D90 which was three times the price. I can live with the cheaper feeling plastic body as long as the photos are decent and I have some control over settings.  It's much lighter than my D90 and smaller, too. Works well on Auto, but there's lots of options and settings to be used, too.  GPS works great but I doubt that I'll use it much.I liked the choice of being able to look through a viewfinder instead of at the LCD screen as I prefer viewfinders, especially in bright sunlight.  Using viewfinder also saves on battery power.  The only problem is that the viewfinder is very small and not that clear, even with the diopter tuned to my vision.  I'm getting used to it, though.As for the telephoto/zoom lens, yes, the more you zoom in, the more shaky the view will be.  I find that happens even with my D90.  Tripods should be used for telephoto shots, anyway.  I'm having a bit of a problem with getting used to the zoom only because I'm used to manually zooming by turning the lens barrel, but after using the camera a little more I'm sure I'll get used to the differences.Comparing the photos to the D90:  okay, the D90 is sharper upon magnification, but the P510 does a really nice job for a camera 1/3 the price of the D90.  I may update this review after using the camera for a couple months, but at this point, I'm happy with it.  I'm not so happy that the price dropped $30 within a couple days after I bought it, though!I recommend this camera for those who want a bridge camera... more than a point 'n' shoot, but without the bulk, expense and confusion of a DSLR.

My Canon served me well but was kind of slow and not very high resolution so I thought the Nikon would be a huge improvement.  In some respects it was but overall it was a disappointment.  The Nikon has a beautiful LCD viewscreen.  Just gorgeous. It had good image sharpness, color saturation and overall clarity. The software touch up features were also nice.  Movie quality was average - okay but not great due to noise.  The big problem is with the autofocus.  It is slow.  Mindnumbingly slow, in fact.  I bought this camera to take pictures of my pets and family.  Family and pets tend to move around and need an autofocus that can keep up with small movements.  This really doesn't seem like a lot to ask of a camera.  Unfortunately, the autofocus on this camera is disastrously bad.  It was constantly playing catch up and I was constantly missing shots because of it.  I tried every possible configuration in the software and nothing would help.  Burst mode didn't do any better.  Further, while the zoom sounds impressive on paper, once again it cannot focus when zoomed.  If you have a tripod and are photographing a still image, it may work fine but that's not why I bough it.  For a $400 camera this is completely unacceptable and I exchanged it for a Panasonic FZ150.  I'm really disappointed that this didn't work as I had high hopes for this camera.  I'm not a professional photographer - just an average guy who likes to dabble in photography.

I would find I was too far away from my daughters school play to get a good shot, or too far from a stage show, or my son on the playing field, I needed to be closer to the action. I also found that I would like a camera that I could raise above obstructing heads and take a shot, and I would need a camera with a tilting screen to do that well. I felt I wanted a large and clear screen to view my shots and a GPS would be nice too.But my main requirement was a long optical zoom, that would take me close to the action, and with that I wanted a good image stabilization , preferably lens based.I also wanted a backlit CMOS sensor, so that my indoor and low light photos would be better than those taken with the CCD on my Old Canon IxusI knew that a super zoom would have a small sensor, it had to, because of the size of the lens. I knew that it would not come close to a DSLR, but I also knew that if I wanted an SLR and the optical zoom of this baby, I would have to lug around a huge bag with heavy lenses and pay 10-20 times the price.. so deciding was easyThe Nikon P510 ticked all of the boxes.After I got it, I found that it lived up to its specs.

That said, there are several things missing that SHOULD be on this camera.  Number one is a manual focus.  Shooting between leaves, through a fence, etc., the camera will focus on the closest object, even with the center weighted metering.  Also, it almost never will go all the way to 24mm -- stops about 28mm.  Closeup shooting is also a problem in that the camera will pass optimum focus and then refuse to focus at all until you move either in or out with the zoom.  Second, I miss having a PC outlet for external flash.  The built-in flash is good for about 10 feet indoors, and is worthless outdoors as a fill flash.

Unfortunately, they are very inconvenient when out and about, and their short zoom length means that you spend a lot of time trying to crop photos later.  In order to get really good photos at any distance, you need to carry thousands of dollars of equipment, which isn't particularly convenient at major theme parks with mouse themes.  All this means that many of my more important family photos ended up on my Canon Elph 110.  It's a good camera for the size, but isn't what you want for taking photos that you may want to enlarge or frame on your wall.  So, I've spent months trying to find the perfect camera for carrying when traveling, etc.  I've actually purchased two of the small, exchangeable lens cameras, but didn't feel like they were that much more convenient.  They also had the problem of a relatively short zoom length, and photo quality still wasn't close enough to SLR to make them a good value compromise.I finally purchased the Canon G1X, due to the large CMOS sensor.  I still didn't have any zoom, but I felt like the photo quality would be good enough for later cropping.  Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed with the actual quality of the images.  For a camera close to a grand, I was very disappointed.  I'm not sure the quality was any better that that of my Elph.  Finally, I broke down and tried a couple of mega-zooms.  I was quite skeptical due to the smaller sensors, and felt sure that even close up photos wouldn't really work.  As it turns out, this camera was a good compromise.  For me, this camera makes sense.  The photo quality is excellent, and shooting time is very fast.  The HD video is very good, and allows for captures of up to 30 minutes of video at a time.  If you take your time and shoot well, you can get excellent quality photos, even in relatively low light.  With a little bit of enhancement, (with Adobe lightroom, for example), you can get some stunning photos that can still look great when enlarged.  I would go so far as to say that a professional photographer could take photos with this camera that would appear to be SLR quality.On the other hand, when you're shooting quick photos in action situations, (birthdays, holidays, etc.), you get much better photos than I've ever seen with point and shoots.

I didn't want to tote along my digital SLR with long, heavy lenses, so I bought this all-in-one, very lightweight camera instead.  With the 42X zoom I was able to get amazing animal and bird photos, especially once I learned to use the spot focusing feature rather than the other auto-focus setting.  Even pictures in low-light with relatively long exposures came out well, even hand-held.  The only negative for the camera is the battery life--with taking hundreds of pictures daily, I had to change batteries at least daily, and sometimes more than once a day.  I took three batteries with me so that I always had two extras that were fully charged.  That was probably overkill but you definitely need at least one extra battery with this camera.  It doesn't come with an external charger so you have to buy that separately, because obviously if you're using the camera you can't charge the battery at the same time.  Despite this drawback, I was thrilled with the quality of my photos and the ability to get amazing close-ups of African animals and birds.  I do find it a pain that you don't get a printed manual anymore, but I don't think that's unique to this camera.  I wound up printing out the 250 page plus manual double-sided and taking it to a copy store to have it shrunk and bound so for an additional $20 I had something that would fit in my camera bag.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon P510", "Author": "Ken in Texas", "ReviewID": "RUPE8E364V3PI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A friend had recommended the P510 and since my wife and I were going to Italy I wanted a new camera so I took the advise.

I had high hopes for the P510, but it let me down in a big way. It takes really vivid landscape pics. The camera takes lowlight landscape pics that rival my D7000. No kidding. The big flaw is focus time. It takes this camera for ever (i.e. sometimes over a second) to focus. This may not sound like a big deal, but when I wanted to take a photo at just the right moment the P510 failed me badly. It also had a hard time focusing on anything moving. Also, if you want a camera that is ready shortly after turning the power on, this this is not the camera. The power button is small and hard to press. Plus, it took so long to turn on I often pressed the power button a second time just to see if I actually turned it on, of course by doing this I would turn the camera off again. If your really into the 42x zoom feature, then realize that it comes at a price. Because the camera is relatively inexpensive the lens is not of good enough quality to work well at 1000mm (42x). I know its a bad comparison, but my D7000 with a 300mm lens has about the same magnification. I can still crop the D7000 with a 105mm lens and get better quality at the same range.  The P510 at 42x is grainy even in the best light. But, I have to say again that I was impressed with its dawn/dusk landscape capability, which makes no sense because it's not really designed to be good in that range. Video was great, but focus was an issue on anything moving around. Video was better than my D7000 minus focusing issues. Battery life was about 200-250 pics with minimal flash use. Another issue is the build quality. I have an old Coolpix 8700 and it's well built and feels solid, but the P510 feels cheap and plastic. In the end, I returned the P510 after a little over a week and 1000+ pics.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tips on Battery [short] life", "Author": "northd_tech", "ReviewID": "R1E9092K39PV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I basically bought this 42x optical zoom LENS (with a free camera attached) because my choices ultimately boiled down to a $500-$2500 Canon or Nikon DSLR camera body plus about $1000-$3000 in lenses vs. this $400 Nikon P510.  Overall, the picture quality has been excellent and the camera very easy to use (I've still only read about 8 pages of the PDF manuals several weeks later).Unfortunately, I've been working long hours, the days are getting much shorter, and we have had several brush fires here in the Western US so many/most days I have had a very smoky/hazy view of the nearby Rocky Mtns. and haven't been able to test the camera extensively yet due to several factors.Back to this camera- for the money I doubt that you will find another camera with the flexibility, ease of use (including the very well-designed camera menu system), and powerful features of this Nikon P510 for under $500 US.  From my experience, you won't find ANYTHING else to compete with the P510's 42x (1000mm equivalent) optical zoom for less than about $4000 in camera + very large, heavy lenses (which come with at least as any \"cons\" as \"pros\" with weight, bulk/size, fragility, need for extensive cleaning, poor concealability and poor handling, etc. to name a few with high-dollar lenses).Now regarding battery life- it flat out SUCKED when I first tried the camera!  It died completely in less than a week with the camera switched off nearly the entire time.  Then I remembered reading briefly that the GPS location feature keeps looking for satellites even with the camera turned off.  I recommend that you leave the GPS turned off until those specific instances when lat/lon are needed, and then PROMPTLY turn the GPS locator off again.  It is a bit inconvenient to need to go into the menu to do this each time (although the GPS system has its own sub-menu that is quite easy to navigate).  I would prefer (and engineer: Hint Hint for Nikon engineers) an external button to toggle the GPS seeker radio on and off quickly and easily, but alas I don't engineer things for Nikon Corp.I also recommend doing an Amazon or other online search for \"nikon p510 en-el5 battery charger\" and seeing what charger/battery combos you find.  The 6 lithium-ion batteries (yes, that's six spare batteries) that I recently received actually had a capacity much higher (at 1800 mAh) than the \"factory\" 1100 mAh Nikon battery that came with the camera.  I'm still charging the 6th (well actually 7th including the Nikon OEM battery 'refresher'), so I haven't seen how they last compared to the factory battery but I expect longer life with the higher battery capacities.  I see a pair of batteries and a charger similar to mine for under $10 US right now on Amazon when I just checked.While I'm on the subject, I highly recommend getting an AC/DC charger for the batteries as I have found needing a computer and USB cable just to charge the battery \"in camera\" extremely inconvenient.  Of course, Nikon did provide a 120 volt AC to USB \"wall wart\" power supply, but I find my laptop just slightly more inconvenient to carry than the provided Nikon USB power supply (plus the laptop serves many more purposes, including storing my digital photos).The inexpensive (~$5 US) chargers that I bought don't look all that well made but they did charge the higher capacity 1800 mAh batteries in about 2-2.5 hours from either home or my truck.  I haven't had a problem with them yet (but I did find putting a cardboard 'shim' about 1/16\" thick in between the charger and the battery opposite the battery contact side tightened the somewhat sloppy connection and made the batteries charge better and more quickly).  The chargers that I ordered go from red to yellow to green when charging, and the shims seem to shorten the \"yellow\" charging phase to about 10 minutes rather than 30+ minutes.  I also much prefer charging the batteries themselves EXTERNALLY rather than charging the camera and needing to put that much wear on the Nikon USB cable and camera connector.I'd recommend getting this camera if you are looking for versatility in a camera system under $1000.  While it's not perfect in every respect, I think you will find several pleasant surprises in this relatively light and compact (compared to full DSLR cameras anyway) Nikon P510.  Just be sure to get multiple spare batteries (hopefully in the 1500-1800 mAh range) and another charger.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what expected for the price", "Author": "drluly", "ReviewID": "R23LEIRV3JEIVW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I buy a camera every year as the pixels and zoom improve.This is my second Nikon.Likes: Great zoom.

I wanted to be able to shoot the chldren, grandchildren, whales, and scenery quickly, quietly and with no fuss. I wanted something lightweight that took good pictures and also gave me a few extra options that most point & shoot cameras don't have. I spent several days reading camera specs and reviews of point/shoot cameras. I almost missed seeing the Nikon Coolpix P510 because it didn't fit one of the categories I had marked as wanting. When I cleared a few selective categories (like shoots in raw), this \"bridge\" camera appeared.  After reading the reviews (good and bad), I decided I would commit. And, boy am I a happy camper!  This is a great little camera.I took the advice of several reviewers by also purchasing the following: an external battery charger, an additional battery, a small camera bag (I bought Zeik's), and very importantly, the book Photographer's Guide to the Nikon Coolpix P510 by Alexander S White.After receiving the camera, I read the instruction booklet, but I found it really didn't explain much. So, I began reading Mr. White's book and was amazed at all this camera can do that I didn't know. There are so many important pointers found in this book. I have decided that the people who rated this camera poorly and sent it back had no idea what all it could do because they didn't read the book. I set the jpg setting on fine and I was impressed with the quality. (Probably I won't be able to make large poster-size images, but that wasn't my goal.)I took almost 2000 images while in Hawaii. The images are clear; most of the pictures look great. I was impressed and surprised at the quality.  I haven't learned everything about this camera. Still need to learn much more. I have set the exposure and white balance to my preferences. I shot primarily in aperture priority for nature and scenery. With fast-paced grandkids, I went to program mode and was really happy with the images.I haven't figured out night lights yet. Also, I have to do a bit more adjusting for macro shots. It may not compare to my wonderful 105 macro lens, but I was able to work out a few good macro shots with a little playing around. This camera was so lightweight and easy to handle. Personally, I use the viewfinder when shooting. One of our guests was so impressed with my little camera and the photos it took that she came home and purchased a P510 herself.It's not a complicated camera, but you do need the book to show you what it does and how it is done.

The issue I have with this camera is the problematic software and the poor battery life.Upon delivery I received a camera locked up and not usable.  Nikon support recommended loading the newer level firmware on a memory card and reload the camera..  This seemed to correct the problem ...What!, out of the Box it failed.  Amazon exchanged the camera.  The new replacement has had an occurrence of the same issue while using the camera..  I would suggest carrying the firmware with you to address this failure.  My P500 failed the same way.The second issue is the battery performance.  I would suggest buying a second battery and the external charger.  My recommendation is charge the camera fully everyday while you using the camera.  The battery meter is misleading.  This camera uses the battery up fast.  The second nagging issue that drives me crazy is the with a full charged battery it will go dead in about two weeks with the camera powered off and properly stored.  This is unacceptable, you would expect to use this camera for those you need to quick get the camera out and take quick shots around the house.  Heck my DSLR will hold a full charge for months.If you take the battery out the battery holds a charge for months.

Based on other reviews and features, this was the camera for me. I've been a Canon person my whole life. This was my first Nikon. It will also probably be my last simply due to the taste this camera has left in my mouth.The main draw for this camera is clearly the zoom. Which is is beyond phenomenal. Even at full zoom, you can still get a bit closer with digital zoom. If you do opt for the digital zoom, you will get noticeable wavy \"heat\" lines on the image (as other reviewers have noted as well). To avoid this, just disable digital zoom, and crop once it's on the computer as necessary. Additionally, the GPS feature rarely, if ever, works for me. Even if I have full view of a sky around me, I find that it will stamp the GPS mark roughly 1/10 pictures, if that.During the day time, this camera shoots beautiful point and shoot quality photos. At night or indoors, it is awful. Even with a high ISO and decent shutter speed, images still blur. I have a steady hand and had no issues with shooting at 1/60 on my old rebel, but this not so much. Using the night shot mode on the camera drastically improves night pictures, but I prefer to shoot manual or shutter priority manual if possible.Video only allows you to shoot continuously for a maximum of 30 minutes. Also, if you'd like to change focus or zoom while shooting video... don't get your hopes up. There are two focus modes; Full time and single AF. If you choose single, it will focus when it starts recording, then hold at that level. This is the only usable focus mode for video. If you enable full time AF, the smallest change will make the camera constantly re-evaluate, causing blurry to not blurry back and forth video. If you try to zoom while it is enabled, it will stay in focus while it is zooming, but stay out of focus as soon as you get to the point you want to be at. And you can't manually focus video either. There IS a manual focus feature for the camera, but it is a pain to use, even after you figure out how to change it to use the side rocker to control said focus.Overall, I do not recommend this camera, and am sad I am past the return window.

I was particularly intrigued with the 24 to 1000mm lens on a COOLPIX, and what the response time would be when one pressed the shutter release to when the photo would actually be taken, especially after my previous experience with a Nikon COOLPIX S4, though that is a different camera altogether.  When it arrived, I read the manual, charged the battery, and formatted the memory card.  After setting it up for her, I tested the zoom lens and was blown away by its clarity, even at 1000mm.  The resolution of some test photos was incredible!  Also, the response time (from the time I pressed the shutter release button to when it actually took the photo) was like an SLR.I have a Nikon D80 with AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm, 55-200mm, and 70-300mm lenses that takes excellent photos, but for everyday outdoor photography, it's very difficult to beat the little COOLPIX P510 because you don't have to change lenses to get that great telephoto shot.  The only downsides to the P510 package that I've encountered were the lack of a memory card (you have to supply your own), the Nikon battery doesn't last very long, it doesn't come with a case, and there's no hot shoe or cable input for a small-but-more-powerful external, bounceable flash.  Thankfully, I had the foresight to purchase extra batteries (non-Nikon) with a charger.  I also purchased a case and a cleaning kit with cut-to-fit stick on/peel off monitor screen protectors.  That said, overall this is an incredible compact, lightweight camera, and I highly recommend it.Some of the other features that I really like are the movable monitor screen that is positionable for one to take photos with the camera held at or below one's waist or high above one's head and still view what one wants to photograph, and there is also a 'monitor' button next to the electonic viewfinder that switches the view from the monitor screen to the viewfinder for through-the-lens viewing like an SLR camera for those sunny-day occasions when you can't see what's on the monitor.  It also comes with a reference manual CD, the Nikon ViewNX 2 software CD to download your photos, a lens cap and tether, and an adjustable strap.As a side note, I took photos of the \"blue\" moon zooming the lens to 1000mm, and the resolution was amazing!  I managed to hand hold it though it took me three shots to center the moon on the monitor, and it does take several tries to get the camera to focus correctly, but it was worth the small hassle.  Trying to take a photo with a 1000mm lens without a tripod is difficult at best, day or night.  I would recommend some sort of support, like a tripod, for those really long range photos, but I've had good enough luck to be able to rest my elbows on the roof or hood of my car and click away.  Thankfully, with digital photography, one can take all those shots until \"the one\" is achieved, and then go back and delete the others.This camera may appear to be a bit expensive for a COOLPIX model, but with the 24-1000mm zoom and the multitude of other features (including shutter and aperature priority settings and several different \"scene\" settings), I believe this camera is a decent value.  I liked her camera so much, that I bought a black one for myself so I could travel a lot lighter and not have to haul around my 13 lb camera bag with my D80, three lenses, charger, spare batteries and flash.I'll say it:  I love this COOLPIX P510, and so does my fiancee!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Newborn and active toddler <3", "Author": "fsj1204", "ReviewID": "RCI2FYH8RSUF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased many point and shoot cameras over the last couple of years (each lacking something) I figured I would never find something just right.

I guess it was half charged already as the manual states that it takes approximately 4.5hrs to charge a fully exhausted battery.The zoom was exactly as advertised. I was going to get myself a good set of binoculars, but figured I would kill two birds with one stone and get a new camera out of it.  No disappointment here.

Having owned other Nikon compacts I knew the P510 would take great photographs, but I felt it was no match for my outfit. We went out to a wildlife preserve to photograph birds. I set up by camera on its stable tripod, 300mm prime lens, tuned in the optimal exposure and composition, and took my best shots. Meanwhile she was shooting out the window, or walking around snapping at whatever presented itself. When we got home I loaded both sets of pictures and knew right away I was in trouble. She caught the detailed orange eyes of a sandhill crane, I did not. She caught the windblown feather detail of a yellow headed blackbird, I did not. We will be printing some of her photographs to hang on the wall, there will be none of mine. With a lighter and more agile camera she was able to take advantage of the moment while I was stuck on the tripod. Lesson learned. All I got to say is Wow!.

The superzoom is amazing; I took photos of weeds that had tiny flowers and the zoom captured every detail including the minuscule dew drops on the petals. I look at weeds differently now! Even more fun is the Pet Portrait feature. Just select this mode, point the camera at your pet and when it finds the face it focuses AND takes the picture! No more blurred shots with my kitty looking the other way. I started using this camera on a tripod because I have trouble holding still when I take a photo but it has motion detection and vibration reduction that assist in getting clear shots. The viewfinder displays all of the menu items and shows focus and zoom activity so there is no need to use the display screen to take photos. I love this feature because I can take a picture in bright sunlight and stabilize the camera better. The display screen is not always visible in bright light outside but it is movable and can be adjusted for difficult-angled shots. Great camera with awesome features, lightweight, great battery life and very easy to use. Maybe not a choice for a professional because you can't change lenses, add filters or add a flash but it is wonderful for someone like myself who wants to learn to take better pictures without having to take classes; the results are immediate.

The picture quality is good, the operation is relatively simple. The battery life is not so good. Where it really doesn't live up to its billing is in its GPS capabilities. I got it because I've started using geotagging on my website, and thought that it would be an advance from my current technology (Sony F828 with a separate GPS logger, and software to marry the two). It isn't. The GPS often takes a very long time to lock on to its position, even when it has already found that position and the camera just went to sleep. As a result, many fotos do not have GPS info inserted into them automatically when they're taken. The GPS logging system is, to put it kindly, pathetic. I recently went on 2-week trip, and set the logging system to log for 12 hours every day, and saved the log files. Of the fourteen files that were created, five were corrupt and wouldn't load into my geotagging app. Of the ones which loaded, many had corrupt locations, with 3-digit degrees of longitude followed by 5-digit minutes of longitude entries (that's 5 digits with an additional 2 digits following the decimal point). That certainly is non-standard. When displayed on a map, they are 50 and 60 miles away from the location where the foto was taken.

I gave the SX40 to my husband because I did not like the camera at all.  I currently own 3 Nikon DSLR camera bodies (D330S, D600, and D800) along with 5 lenses to go with those cameras. I also like to have a simple point and shoot camera for everyday stuff.  I bought the Canon to replace an older point and shoot camera.  The Canon had a 35x zoom but the quality of the photos were inferior.  For example, on sunsets, the camera didn't have a sunsett setting because the camera was supposed to sense the orange and pink colors in the sky and know what to do.  But it didn't.  In fact, it tried to compensate for the darkening sky and overlit the photo.  The sunset photos were too light and some were even washed out.  Within a short time of owning that Canon, I looked at the Nikon CoolPix and chose the P510, even the there was a newer model.  It has 42x zoom which is fantastic.  The photos are wonderful, too - not the quality of my DSLR's but considering the cost, the quality is wonderful.  I would highly recommend this for the amateur photographer.  The video is great too.  This is the perfect camera for a new parent because you can get snapshots and videos.  First steps, first swimming lessons, first attempts at talking, first haircut.

Bought this to supplement my stable of Canon DSLRs, and small pocket Fuji Point-Shoots, and Pentax waterproof  cameras.  Excellent pictures so far but I have always found the menu navigation on Nikons to be less than intuitive, and this is no exception.  There are easily changed basic settings for full auto, programmed (not sure what the difference is there), aperture and shutter priority, as well as several landscape modes, but no portrait or fast sports presets.  The latter on most cameras optimizes shutter speeds and usually gives you rapid fire multi-frames per second if you hold the exposure button down.  On this camera I have found full programmed auto to give highest shutter speeds in general, but have to negotiate the menus to get multi frame exposures added to it.  Long tele capability is what sold me on this camera, in lieu of carrying extra lenses with my DSLRs, but the controls are a bit clumsy and not so intuitive or versatile.  Also there is a nearly one second lag in exposure after pressing button, then at least another second or two between that image and the ability to take another, unless in rapidfire mode.  Digital video is clean and crisp, and only takes one button to turn on from back of camera, but again controls are not so intuitive and I found myself video-ing my lap several times while figured them out.  Lens cap pops off every time I turn off the camera.  Viewfinder is the default display, requiring a back side button to switch to screen display which is nicely mobile but not very hi res.  and you can only have one or the other on at a time.All in all a capable camera with great built in long zoom, but IMHO a clumsy and difficult control interface compared to others I have worked with.  Shutter lag, lack of a rapid fire sports quick setting,  and a few other settings have been a disappointment .  Clearly an oversized P&S; that wants to be a DSLR but falls short a bit on both accounts.

I can take a picture of a license plate over 100 yards away and it looks as though I'm standing directly behind the car. The video is magnificent. I posted videos on my web cloud & many of my friends asked what kind of camera I was using. The picture & audio was just that awesome. Still pictures look as though they were taken with an expensive SLR even in very low light. The camera is very easy to use. Unless you choose to do things manually, it's fully automatic & will not let you down. 16.1 MP is much more pixel power than I will ever need. I don't plan on blowing up a photo the size of a barn door. The only thing I find lacking on this camera is that its shutter speed isn't as fast as the Fuji. It's plenty fast enough for me. The display monitor folds out & can be set at any angle, which makes picture taking a lot easier.The problem with many of the reviews on Amazon is that some people are just plain anal. These people ought to go back to film and do their own developing in a darkroom. I had to choose from 3 other brands; Fuji, Panasonic, and Canon. Any of these cameras (in this price range) would have been fine. I chose the Nikon mainly for 4 reasons: 1. The 42x zoom works remarkably well. 2. The camera feels well in my hands & is easy to use. 3. The video is first rate. 4. Nikon is a name you can trust.

I had done a bit of hurried research online before an impending trip to Mexico, since I needed a good camera, under $500, and fast. I've always been a fan of Nikon, going back to the old FM I had back in the day. Since then, I've had a succession of 35mm SLR cameras: Minoltas, Oympus, and Canon. I was pretty stuck on Canon when I purchased my first digital SLR, the EOS Rebel T3. I was happy with this camera, it being reasonably priced and having some nice features. Then, I dropped it. So, long story short, went back to using the equivalent Canon 35mm until I could justify spending $300+ on a new camera. Fast forward to present day. I purchased the Nikon Coolpix P510 through Amazon, had it the very next day thanks to the stock held here in Phoenix. Testing went well, but the trip was nigh, so no more messing about. Features I've tried out so far, Scene Selection, HD Video, sport mode, close-up, and moveable display screen. Just scratched the surface. Used the video while on a whale watching tour, worked terrific. The boat was moving so much that I found it nearly impossible to take still photos, but will have to try that again. Some success with sport mode, but again, too much movement to really know what it's capable of. Close-up is simply amazing. I had the opportunity to visit the local botanical gardens in Puerto Vallarta, and the Orchids just scream for close ups. The clarity is amazing. I love the design of the display screen, how it has various positions that let you hold the camera where you need to. To be honest, I've only read a few pages of the instruction booklet, so I can only imagine what else this baby can do.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic except for one feature", "Author": "Paula E-F", "ReviewID": "R2PLXCX94HKXQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I am satisfied with the Nikon Coolpix P510. My last two cameras were Canons so this was a jump for me. The quality of the photos is stellar. One reason I bought the camera was the zoom lens because I enjoy photographing birds and animals that frequent our woods. Quite often I am shooting through a window.  Even so, the detail on these photographs is simply phenomenal.  On the birds you can see tiny individual feathers with clarity.  There are details I have never been able to capture on previous cameras.The feature that annoys me is that the self-timer only takes one shot and then reverts back to regular mode. I can't think of a single instance when using a self-timer that I have only taken one shot. When you have a group of people, as we did at Christmas, re-setting the self timer after every group shot was a major nuisance. I have investigated the menus on the Nikon and cannot find an option to change this. On my previous cameras it would stay in the self timing mode until it turned off or you changed it back.

There are a few things I really like about the camera, quite a few things I don't like (or could certainly be better), and a few things that should be included.I have been using digital photography for about the last 15 years, and digital exclusively for about the last 6 years. I have a DSLR and an assortment of lenses, I needed a really long zoom and was considering lenses in the several thousand dollar range, when it occurred to me that maybe a newer generation superzoom might be a cheaper (and lighter) way to go. Before purchasing this camera, I tried the FujiFilm HS30EXR, X-S1 and Lumix FZ150, each for about 2 weeks thanks to Amazon Prime. Although, I loved the Fuji cameras, their image quality  and image stabilization was not as good as the Nikon or Lumix. The lumix had as good or better image quality compared to the Nikon, but not the zoom reach (600 vs 1000 mm equivalent). So, after taking the same pictures with them all, comparing the pixel detail, noise, overall image quality, and ultimate \"usability\" I decided the Nikon P510 was the best long telephoto producer at that time.  The ability to shoot still subjects, hand holding the camera, when it was fully zoomed to the 1000 mm end, at exposures as long as 1/8 second and get consistently crisp images played a major role in this decision(Yes, I Am Serious).DP Review did a good review of this camera, I am only giving my opinion from six months of daily use.The GOOD:*  An excellent lens (especially considering the zoom range)*  Exceptional optical image stabilization (Nikon calls it vibration reduction)*  Very good color reproduction, and white balance*  Good flash exposure*  Very good articulated rear screen*  Good overall image qualityThe Not so Good:*  Menu is not very intuitive.  Things that should be easy to adjust are difficult to find.*  No focus lock, No exposure lock. Holding the shutter button does lock them until the shutter releases, after the  shot, exposure and focus reset even if you continue to hold the button half depressed.*  A significant time delay in the \"live view\" image you see in the EVF, or on rear screen compared to real time. This delay is probably less than 1/2 second, but is significant enough that you will loose many action shots.*  Zoom lens takes about 3 seconds to extend from full wide to full telephoto, then the auto focus may take another 2 - 3 seconds, depending on the illumination and contrast of the subject.  The auto focus is generally very accurate, once obtained, which can be difficult at long zoom (I frequently have to initiate a refocus to get the subject focused in, rather than the foreground or background).*  The video quality is not good at all.  The P510 may be able to shoot decent video if you use manual focus, but the few times I have taken video, the auto focus is way too active, even in good lighting/contrast situations.  If you want a camera for video, I highly recommend you look at a different one (both the Lumix and FujiFilms I tested before buying this one, had much better video performance).*  Very low light or night photography is generally best left to other cameras.  However, with sufficient illumination, such as a city that is well lighted, the results can be very good.*  Pretty bad chromatic aberration in high contrast areas (especially at wider angle zoom).*  Extremely prone to highlight clipping. I have to shoot about a stop faster than metered most of the time to avoid this clipping, and this increases noise in the shadows (and no doubt causes some loss of shadow detail).*  Function button is difficult to find without looking, as it sits just behind the shutter release and is even with the surface from which it should emerge (I put a droplet of clear epoxy on it).*  With a zoom this long, auto focus can be very difficult (focusing on a bird in a tree for example). Nikon and other superzoom makers should offer a way for the user to direct auto focus as it gets close to focusing on the intended subject, rather than having to refocus over and over until the camera eventually finds focus, AND they certainly should make it easy to maintain that focal point until the user decides to refocus.*  Battery life isn't too bad. I get between 100 and 150 shots on a charge. My shooting isn't typical, I would think the average user would get over 200 shots per charge. Others have criticized the lack of an external charger, however, I think that for the casual user, USB charging through the camera might be sufficient. If I were going on vacation, or serious about capturing images of an event, I would want at least one spare battery. I bought 4 spare batteries and a charger on eBay for about $15", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great In Between P&S; Camera", "Author": "William Bash \"Someone Who Still Cares\"", "ReviewID": "R2JKLEI2JMB4ER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon P510 is Nikon's 2012 follow on product to their well received \"P\" Series family of products.  You have, or can, read about all the features, details, and specifications published about this particular Model product elsewhere.  So rather than bore the reader herein with all the techno, spec jargon, here are a few examples of what I have experienced with this product.  The product \"does\" provide excellent color rendering for both Still Shots, and Movie/Video Recording.  It captures images in an impressive manner in both bright, and low light (example: In the woods, sun setting with fading light, but you do get nice golden colors, darker shadows at that time of the day, etc.) this camera duplicates that which our human eyes see in excellent detail.  This product is easy to use: Its Menu systems for (Still, Movie recording, and Playback menus) are essentially straight forward so that the beginner, or experienced photographer can utilize and set Modes, Dials, and control Buttons, in a logical manner.  Of course its high Zooming capability works very well out to, and past, its advertised 42x \"Optical\" Zooming spec.  There is another 42x power \"Digital\" internal camera zooming compounding the Optical Zooming, plus an \"internal\" camera feature to nearly double the Optical & Digital magnification to create something on the order of 160x Power. Of course, your photos become more grainy as magnification is increased, and Sharpness also declines with more magnification - but that is just a matter of fact for \"all\" cameras and lenses, and our own human eyes as well.  This model product is reasonably fast in focus, shutter, and capture timing.  Its start up from the off position is a little slower than some other products, but not an issue.  Color rendering even at full telephoto is impressive, and focusing is good at telephoto setting considering its Lens to Camera Sensor internal auto-focal length calibrating.  Focusing of course is faster at Wide, or less Focal lengths, say up to 20-25 power Zoom.  42x is still good, just a little slower.One negative that others have noted also - when Movie recording, and especially at longer zooming - the Lens system physically/mechanically moves around within the Camera's barrel that holds the Lens assembly.  This results in a small quick jumping of the recorded image(s) each time you zoom in, or out, while recording, and then prominently seen during Playback of a recorded Movie.  Nikon needs to tighten up the physical/mechanical dimensions fitting between the Lens and Camera Barrel.  Not a real big issue, but non-the-less needs improved - are you reading noting this NIKON?Another small item, Battery Charging can only be done in-Camera via the wall adapter and USB cable provided.  It would be nice if Nikon would/could provide a battery charging wall adapter that charges the battery outside of the camera so that you do not have to tie up the camera itself while charging a battery(s).  Optional external battery wall chargers can be purchased, along with extra batteries (as a foot-note only) Amazon seller \"Blue Nook\" has excellent products along these lines.Bottom Lines: This Nikon product offers nice capabilities for Auto, Semi-Auto, and Manual setting modes and usage, is an excellent value for its price point, produces excellent color rendering, is light weight, fits the hand very well, nice checkered urathane rubber front and side covering handgrip, comes with a CD Disc for loading your complete Users Manual and Software usage Manual (Nikon VX2) which certain other manufacturers have recently ceased providing, and has great battery run time.  It is in direct competition with Sony's DSC-HX200V higher end Point & Shoot camera product (which in my own opinion is just slightly better that this Nikon), but this Nikon is also top-shelf, and does what it is supposed to do for you.  I own both of these products.I'm not Mr. expert, only a Photography enthusiast who primarily photographs Landscapes and Wildlife utilizing DSLR's, SLT products, and higher end Point & Shoot camera products.  This Nikon \"does\" hit the mark.  You will not be disappointed should you decide to purchase this product.

I'm a point and shoot type of guy and like the simplicity of these cameras. I also like a camera I can put in my pocket since I hate carrying stuff, but I have beenfighting the macro feature on my small point and shoot cameras and just got tired of that. I shoot small items like pcb's for example and wanted something a little better. I decided to check out this camera a while back and just loved that I could get so close to items I wanted to photograph andthe lens just focused right then and there. This is my very first Nikon, and camera with all of these settings. I knew it was a little bigger but decided on this one for the micro setting and not the large zoom it comes with. Although that's a nice bonus. I think a dslr would probably give youeven better closeups but I just didn't want that extra stuff and weight myself. I'm still working on getting a bit more detail on my macros, but this could also be me and not the camera itself. It's definitely better than my two point and shoot cameras I've had and I only use them for web pictures somy need for high resolution hasn't been necessary. With that said, nothing is perfect but I'm only pointing out the little things that I have noticed and those that do bug me.Pros:-Macros and Long zoom without a doubt-Size because it is smaller than a dslr-New 64GB sdxc class 10 seems to work out of the box. These use the exFAT format. I just went ahead and formatted the card and it's still in exFAT. I want to see if it makes a difference on anything now that it's formatted in the camera.-The included editing program seems basic, but it has all the basic features I want in a program. It's not perfect but it's free. It did take me a bit to find the basic crop and where things were. I like the feature to upload and delete all the files from the sd card. This works great as I always have an empty camera ready to go. Since I'm always on the computer I also just leave it plugged in which also charges the battery, so I haven't yet ran into a problem with it not lasting. I took about 100 pictures and that's a lot for me, so we'll see once I start using the other settings and taking more shots. The included wall charger uses the same cable to charge the camera. I had to plug my old camera just the same way so I'm used to that but my old one didn't get charged by the usb, this one does.-I like the green light ring around the power button when you turn it on and it blinks when on standby mode. It's a nice touch.-The camera seems to start relatively fast.-I got a better deal elsewhere than amazon. I got free shipping, no tax and a coupon that took a few more bucks of the total. Just couldn't beat it. At the current prices I say look at a dslr since they are just a bit more. I'm a point and shoot person and I just didn't want to spend all this on a camera. If not, just go down and get a pocket camera as this will be less and fit in your pocket if your needs are similar. If you find a deal, then by all means, otherwise I would not have bought it even though it suits my purpose.Cons:-I like to use things as they are designed, so the first thing I noticed while carrying it around is that the neck strap is a bit short. I feel like I'm getting chocked by the camera when it's around my neck because there's not enough slack to move it around. I have adjusted the strap to give me the furthest length but it's still a bit short. It's just uncomfortable for me and I'm not a tall guy either. I know I can buy one, but why should I have to when you spend this much on the camera. The strap is thin at the camera holders so it doesn't feel too strong if you were too pull hard on it accidentally. It works, but just feels that way to me.-For the price you pay, Nikon doesn't even include a cleaning cloth! The first thing I did by accident was to put my finger on the lens while handling it. All I had at the time was my cotton shirt and guess what...it's what worked on my old point and shoots so the shirt had to do if I wanted to start shooting without my thumb smudge on the lens.-Cameras used to come with a simple leather cover that you just snapped out and let it hang. Now the camera doesn't even come with anything and if you can find them for some cameras they cost and arm and a leg. I know there are many bags and things to choose from, but it would be nice if I could get something just for the one I bought that actually fits and it's not bulky. I like keeping things to a minimum so carrying extra stuff is not what I'm going to do.-Moving from picture to picture can be a tad slow when viewing for some reason. At least at times is feels like it. Again, I'm using the latest type of sdxc and class 10 card.-Starting and stopping video also seems to take it's time. I just hope they can speed this up a bit. I can see that firmwares can be updated through the editing program and see other cameras there, so I hope a firmware will fix this.-The night shots without the flash take a while to save. You get the hour glass for a bit. I'm not sure why, but man that's annoying. Although the pictures at night have been good so far on auto, you just have to wait for it to save. I tried the video briefly and it was reasonably good too, surprisingly.-For some reason the delete image options seems backwards to me. I feel that if the \"yes\" was on the bottom and the \"no\" the top, it would be more intuitive to use as your thumb is already on the buttons and the bottom is selected and hitting down just makes sense or ok if they were flipped, but instead you have to push the thumb up which just doesn't feel natural. All other settings seems fine.-One feature I totally forgot about and wished this camera had would be the option to add an external microphone to allow me to walk back a bit from the camera and talk without a problem. The included mics are good so far, so I guess we are stuck with the built in mics.-Extended warranty. You have 10 days to submit your form. It took 7 days for me to get the camera and then UPS left it at the wrong door step on a friday. I had been waiting for it so I picked it up as soon as it got here but had to wait until saturday to get the card out and the nearest post office was closed. I had to find another one eventually. So basically they need to leave this open or really allow more time as there are things that we just can't control. If you don't send it within the time frame, then it's too bad from what I read elsewhere. I'm not sure but I sure hope they do fix this.-Proprietary usb connection. Why? It's almost 2013 and they can't use a standard usb cable?-No printed manual. It only comes in a cd. You only get a printed quick quide. I prefer a printed manual I can take with me as I can't remember all the different settings and that would have been very helpful. At least to me.I'll be updating this as time goes on.Update notes:I've been testing the night landscape mode. The pictures are clear but the colors are not as vivid as the auto mode. I know that I should use some other setting, but this is just using the setting by itself. They look great on the LCD, but the pictures came out almost washed out I guess you call it. The weather isn't that great either, but they are not like the auto where you can really see red as red and not sort of red. I took some other night shots with the auto and the colors really show much better. Just to give you the comparison between the two modes.Video and zoom, yeah don't zoom in and out because it's hard to focus if you do. Usually you shouldn't be zooming, but thought I add this for those that think you can. It's nice that you can take hd videos with it. Too bad it's slow at starting and stopping at the moment. I just formatted my card in the camera so we'll see if that helps. I was using it right out of the carton but both use the exFAT so I don't think that will make any difference.I forgot to mention that I was testing the video and for some reason the camera just shutdown on me. It took a little while for it to turn on again. The battery was full, or at least the icon still said it was full. I noticed the video I took is a bit choppy. I really don't know what happened, but again I'm hoping they fix these minor things in the firmware because if they can't that will really suck.Update January 9, 2012I finally went out and did some more testing with the new sd card. I found out that the choppy video was not due to my sd cards. Yesterday I tested the 16gb sd polaroid class 10 that I have and I noticed that choppy videos, again. I also found out that the camera only does this on the 1080p settings not the lower settings. So it is the camera and not either of my sd cards. As I mentioned before the new card is a 64gig sdxc card.Update January 10, 2013I just read that Fujifilm has announced two similar long lense cameras. Their models are Finepix Hs50exr and Finepix SL1000 in case anyone else is interested in something similar.Update January 12, 2013I finally had a chance to test the battery and sure enough, at around 200 pictures including a few videos, the battery was done. I had fully charged it before this event. Very disappointing, not to mention it was only 10:30pm at the party when things were just starting to pick up. There was also no place to plug in to charge anything, so I was done once this happened. A message saying battery depleted came on the screen. The camera did not turn off by itself like I read some say, but I could not do anything else other than turn it off and once this was done, it would not turn back on no matter what, which makes sense if the battery is depleted. Either way I had to update on this.

The Coolpix P510 is both compact and lightweight.  It's not too difficult to use or learn.The P510 has lots of automatic shooting presets.  The 16 megapixels is ample; the 42x optical zoom is a nice feature, and it takes pretty good pictures right out of the box.  It's got manual shooting modes, too.  You can use autofocus or you can manually focus the camera if you wish.  You can use the digital viewfinder or the LCD screen.  It takes pretty good movies, too, with stereo sound.I really like it for macro photography because I can get really close (less than an inch) to my subject with it; I've gotten some really good macros with it.  It's okay on zoomed shots, though there does tend to be a bit of noise at higher zoom levels.  I did not find it easy to focus (I used both manual or automatic modes for this)on moving objects such as a bird in flight with the digital viewfinder.  Maybe that's just me, but I'm more used to looking through my lens, without any electronic rendering on a viewfinder screen.

I got the red-love the color. The size is pretty good too-it's not as compact as a point and shoot-but not big and bulky like some SLR cameras I've looked at. It's easy to use right out of the box (once the battery gets charged)-just set it to auto and shoot away. But I'm glad there are a lot of settings to allow professional looking photos to be taken by an amateur like myself. I also like that it works with an Eye-fi card (which I purchased separately).The reasons I didn't give it 5 stars-are because it seems to use a lot of battery power (but I just keep a second one charged).

Took a shot of the full moon on a clear night and the individual craters could be easily viewed in great detail. Not great in dim light for long magnification. But for nature photography, you can't beat it. Lots of complaints about focusing in the reviews. Here is my solution - there are at least 4 focus modes you can set. The single AF mode, where you push the shutter down halfway to get it to focus, works best. It allows you to refocus, rezoom and refocus quickly until you get it right. Does not take that long to do, 10 seconds tops. The full-time FT auto focus overworks itself, takes too long, and is not as precise. The single AF mode gives you the most control. Also,for exposure, I generally just set it on auto and forget it. The camera is smarter than I am, and selects everything you need. And quickly enough for you to still get the shot before the critter moves. This camera is a point and shoot if you want it to be. All the way to fully manual if you prefer, even the focus can be manually set.Don't look to this camera to do it all, you will be disappointed. It is not a DSLR.

The selling point for me was the 42X zoom, 16MP and the HD recordings.This was an upgrade from my Nikon S550.The quality of the pictures and video are great. there is a bit of background noise on most of the videos that I have recorded though, but it doesn't drown out the audio - maybe a setting taht I have missed.On maximum settings the pictures are quite large and would require some storage space if the camera is used regularly.The camera itself feels sturdy and solid unlike some online reviews that said the construction was weak.While the supplied OEM Nikon battery lasts long after is has been depleted and fully charged a few times but buy an extended battery if you get clicker-happy.The flash is terribly bright and has a far reach.Use of the digital view finder is a must if you want to maximize battery lifeThe zoom is electronic and is a bit slow.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera!", "Author": "Kim E.

If you're looking for something to take on nature walks, birding, or to your children's games, this is perfect.

open unexpectedly. The L1 was a great point and shoot for work but I wanted something more but something I could easily carry around for work. A bridge camera seemed to fit the bill since I also wanted to play around with video as well. The zoom on this simply blew me away.  As for video, I never expected this to do what it does. After all, if you want to shoot video you get a video recorder right? No need. The video I have included is my very first serious try at shooting HD video, not including the \"walk around the yard stuff\" I shot when I first got it. This was shot over Thanksgiving on Hilton Head Island from about 50 yards away. As it turns out I had a very cooperative subject. The heron didn't show up until close to dark but immediatedly caught a mullet, which you can see flipping about even as being swallowed.  This camera produces professional grade material, but compose your own shots. I prefer to set the aperature and let the camera do the rest but the manual mode lets you do it all. There is a learning curve with this camera as it does so much, but I guess that's true of most new cameras.

Better than any other camera I have owned.* The Zoom (to include the digital) is just as great as described.* The stability feature is fantastic. Of the 1300 photos, only perhaps a dozen carried a blur from my shaky hands. The rest were stabilized, even at max zoom.* Panorama worked well in assist mode. Pleased.* Low light mode? AWESOME. I took a couple of photos of the moon with Jupiter alongside that were simply amazing. The same with landscapes at dusk with very little light left. Low light mode was amazing.Negatives:* Auto-shoot mode was weak and I could not count on it to provide a quality photo. More of these were blurred than should have been..especially accounting for the 'wait' for focus.* Temperature effected the camera (I am not an expert or a pro photographer, so I don't know exactly what to expect...maybe this is normal): Outside temperatures of 36f down to 32f effected the focus/zoom horribly. The camera would not focus auto or manual. Only after zooming in and out perhaps two dozen times did the camera 'warm up' and begin to act normally. This was a problem on an all day trek where, although clear skies, the temperature stayed within the above-mentioned ranges. (When the temperature was 40f or above...no issues whatsoever.)I would have loved to give 5-stars, but my experience with Auto-Mode and the very bad time with the lower temperature situation pulled me down to a 4.That said, I WOULD RECOMMEND this all day long to the outdoor casual or amateur photographer (indoors as well).

The quality and durability of Nikons are great, so when I decided to get a more powerful camera, Nikon was the way to go! I've had the camera for a few weeks now, and I love it! There are so many great aspects of this camera that I haven't had in the past with other brands!Pros:-The camera charges and turns on extremely quickly. I was amazed by how quickly it charged the first day! Since purchasing the camera, I've only had to charge it once! The battery life is great- I don't use my camera on a daily basis, so perhaps it would take more charges if you did, but for recreational use, it has a great battery life!-This camera is much lighter than I expected! It looks large, but it doesn't feel heavy when you've got it around your neck!-The GPS feature is really cool! It's nice to be able to remember where exactly I took a picture if it's of a landscape/flower, etc.-The grip on the camera is great! You don't feel your fingers slide, and you can really hold on to the camera well!-The pop out screen is awesome! You can move the screen to see the photo you're taking better, especially if you're holding the camera at odd angles!-Great quality pictures that are easy to take- I'm no camera genius, but even my mother who can barely use a camera can take great pictures with this camera! It's got so many settings- you can take a standard picture without adjusting ISO and it still looks just as great!-So many settings- There are so many great settings on this camera! The selective color feature is great, and I love the panorama shots! There are also great lighting features so no matter the light in the background, the photo looks great!-The zoom is incredible! From 50 feet away I can take a perfect photo of a flower that looks like I was standing next to it! On most cameras I've owned the farther zoom means poorer quality photos, but this camera is perfect for taking long range pictures and having them look flawless!-The video quality is great! I went to a Flamenco show and took video, and the picture quality and sound quality was amazing!Cons:The only major con I've noticed so far is that it can take a second to refocus after zooming out a large distance. It's not bad, but if you wanted to  take a picture of something that would be gone after a few seconds, you have to be really prepared to take your photo!This camera is definitely worth the price tag!

I have been able to take pictures of the moon close up.  On zoomed pics you have to either use a tripod if you don't want to fight the natural shake that your hand will have.

There really wasn't that many features on the P520 that weren't on the P510 to justify spending another $150 bucks, which is why I went with the P510.Pros:- Rechargeable battery. Replacements/Extras are inexpensive, even for a name brand. I have been using the camera for a month and haven't had to recharge the battery yet.- Large viewing screen that extends out.  This allows you to take photos at different angles while still being able to see the screen.- Has a few built in effect features. Easy to learn, simple to use.

I was teetering between this one and the DSLR.  I'm SO glad that I purchased this camera!  I just LOVE the 42x zoom that it has!  The picture quality is GREAT and I'm learning how to do the manual settings!  This does have some DSLR settings, but it's not a DSLR.  Also, I cannot override the aperture setting and leave the f-stop on 3.0.  It automatically moves, so I can't always guarantee a soft/blurry background.  I have not had any problems with this camera and I HIGHLY recommend it.  As a former photo lab technician for Walmart, I was exposed to various cameras (no pun intended).  Needless to say, Nikon wins hands down.Pros:1) 42x zoom--awesome!2) turns on fast3) manual settings for me to play with4) takes excellent photos5) not lugging around all the lenses :)Cons:1) cannot leave the aperture setting to 3.0 for the f-stop to keep the background soft/blurry2) cannot take extremely close pictures with the camera--it does not focus on the macro setting to very close unfortunately :(  i just LOVE my close up pictures3) manual settings can be hard to get used to--I'm still toying with them trying to figure out which ones to use and what ISO levels to put them on, etc.Overall, an excellent camera.

After weeks of looking at cameras, he picked this one out. I am an amateur with photography, so I was wanting a nice camera that took beautiful pictures, rather than just a standard digital camera such as the Cybershot (which was disappointing). He did well! Of course it does not hurt that the color is red either (my fav!).  The first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was that it came with a lens cover, a tether (handy!) and the neck strap. I never had anything that required all these items so I carefully combed through the book to make sure I had all the pieces and set it up correctly. Additionally, the initial charge took several hours. I read some people stated that it took only two hours, but mine took closer to 3.5 or 4 hours. I had a decent battery life that lasted two days of traveling and taking pictures of the family Christmas events. I love the zoom capabilities and were able to take shots a block away from the house of a neighbors dog, and it came out crystal clear! However the only downside is that it does not focus automatically upon zooming, so I have not recieved a clear picture until after I took it. There had been some good advice from other users on here on what settings to use to speed up the focus so I will try it.

I wanted something I could loop the strap over my neck for safety but basically hold the camera in one hand while I hike and sightsee.  Here are the POSITIVES: 1.  Does GREAT in low light situations which was the reason I was looking for a new camera. 2) THe zoom does a great job of hand held stabilization, even at it's highest setting, for general use.  3) It is very comfortable to hold and carry.  The rubberized grip is great for hot sweaty climates. And for all it does, it isn't too heavy. 4)  The tilt LCD screen is fantastic for many situations, particularly for shooting over a crowd, down low when I don't want to get dirty, upward angled shots, or surreptitious travel shots of locals. I held it way over my head and angled down for some cool Christmas pictures. I normally use the view finder, but now that I have the tilt screen would never go back to a camera that does not have this feature; I am amazed how many opportunities I find to use this.  5) The new battery  lasted for 400 shots over several hours of on/off, zooming in and out, and leaving on till it slept.  The zoom is so powerful that it takes a lot of battery to extend it that far so as I always carry backup batteries. I was happy with that.  The NEGATIVES: 1) I detest the on/off button.  there are 2 close together, it is slightly recessed, and I have trouble finding it without looking.  Several times I caught myself hitting the FUNCTION button instead and got frustrated as shots passed me by.  It is sluggish to turn on. 2)  The zoom is sluggish to respond.  3) Twice, the camera has frozen and become unable to focus till I powered off/on.  I missed a few second opportunity to catch a tiger in the wild due to this problem.  I got the shot with my iphone instead.  I'm still bitter. 4)  This is my BIGGEST complaint.  The colors are not saturated.  My photos look slightly washed out.  This was confirmed against several other cameras. My sister and I hiked together in the autumn woods, her little Kodak took better photos of side by side shots. (I'm talking color here).  I carried both my old SONY  DSC-H50 and the Nikon out in my back fields and compared colors.  The Nikon lost again.  And while in India my traveling companion had a small pocket Olympus with a Leica lens that she was shooting with.  I backed up all her photos with mine on my ipad and was frustrated that her colors were more intense.  THis was across the spectrum.  Since I've been home and have edited the pictures with iphoto to boost the color or saturate more I am happier with the pictures, but I shouldn't HAVE to do that.  5) The menu to work around your features isn't very intuitive.  It took me quite a while to remember how to get to the options that I most used.  Overall, I am happy.  There is so much that is great about this camera.  But the color misses the mark.  I tried many cameras in the store and this one felt the most comfortable in my hand.  It felt at home and not too heavy.  But I travel a lot and color is a huge part of my experience.

I continued to research the camera and after many hours of comparison I decided that the only thing that was holding me back was the cheap appearance of the body of the camera, hence I decided on the red one and I love it!!!It has an incredible 42X wide zoom, there are many special effects that are very easy to use. HD video requires one button touch. Video is good but one does lose clarity if tracking a fast moving object. I read several reviews that pointed out the battery life was very limited, however I always charge the battery before I leave for a photo event and have never had it run down on my during my shooting session which will be off and on for several hours.

I shoot w/ a Canon 40D and still rely on my Canon xti. I have a Leica point and shoot and a Lumix LX3  ( the best camera ever for outdoor landscape shooting). Because I have arthritis, it is difficult at times to lug mey larger lenses around. I researched the Canon, Lumix and Nikon point and shoot cameras w/ extended zoom capicity. I concluded that the Nikon P510 would be the best choice. The price was a factor b/c I did not want to spend $500+ when $300 would get essentially the same result: a fun point and shoot w/ extended zoom and workable movie capacity.I am so impressed with the Menu. By far, this is the most user friendly set-up of ANY camera I have ever owned. This is simply a fun camera to use and actually provides great photos...really! The zoom is great for outdoor use, and the photos I have taken inside are crisp and clean. I have kept the ISO no higher than 400, and have not shot much in shutter in low light,  but apture is just fine. True, the body is rather light/more plastic that metal/but this is OK, as I am not hard on my equipment. I'll leave it to the pros to tell others what to purchase and why, but I have found over the years that one camera does not fit all.

The Lumix LX 3 is unsurpassed as a point and shoot for the  outside. This Nikon is a great all-around camera with a zoom that is tops. The best advice I can offer is to decide what you like to shoot, and then do your homework. Read all that you can about your camera choices b/4 you purchase anything.

Wow, but not quite The One Ultrazoom. I loved the GIU of the Sony Cybershots. The AMB is one of the coolest things around!Enter the Nikon P510. The P510 is surprisingly small and light. It has HHT and the panorama but not the dedicated AMB, which by the way is a multi-shot mode that reduces motion blur during a sports event, etc, by using the other 5 shots to modify the first. Smart and although similar to the HHT (pumps up the ISO instead), has a different purpose. Problem is that the P510 is also soft at the high end. Perhaps a bit sharper than the HX100 but still soft. Slow for the burst modes. Blurry and crappy EVF. Battery life was short as well. The body is big enough to hold a bigger battery (hint, hint, Nikon...).Returned the Nikon and now happy with the Canon SX50. Sharper shots, pretty good speed and an effective HHT (although hidden in the SCENE mode). However, the SX50 does NOT have the panorama mode (!??!?!). It acquires the shots but does not do the in-camera stitching. SHAME on Canon, its like they didn't want to pay for the license. Although I like the Canon multi-shot options (best shot select, SNR averaging), its only available in the AUTO mode and cannot be selected - arrggh.What do the P510 and the SX50 really need?

I did a few days research and decided this was the best step-up for me from a pocket-sized point and shoot, to a more complex camera with options, but not ready for a DSLR.  I ordered it on Thursday, was supposed to be delivered on the following Monday, but I got it today, Friday.  Kudos to Amazon for the fast shipping!It took about 3 hours to fully charge the battery, and then I was out shooting on \"Auto\" and trying it out.  It feels like it's well made, definitely much lighter than the old SLR I owned in the 80's and 90's.  It has a very nice feel to it, as far as fitting in your hand, and so far, most of the controls seem to be fairly logical.  It is laid out similar to my old, tiny, Nikon Coolpix point and shoot, so I'm somewhat familiar with the basics.  I didn't really need the full capabilities of the 42x zoom today...but when I did try to zoom all the way out, I can see you might want a tripod.I could only take pictures here in my house and in the yard this evening...but so far, so good.  No, not everything was perfect, but then I\"m just playing around and I know it will take me quite a bit of practice to get farther than the Auto setting!  However, I can see that even if you never went beyond Auto, you would get good quality pictures. I always got compliments on my photos that I took on my point and shoot, but the difference in quality with this camera is amazing. Also, the software for downloading is good- very similar to what I was used to, with more options.  I've been very happy with my past Nikon cameras and their software, and it looks like this camera will offer the same quality I have become used to.I am looking forward to experimenting a lot with this camera in the future, and learning all I can about it.  I did order the book Photographers Guide to the Nikon Coolpix P510  (very highly rated on Amazon), because I want something I can carry with me while I am learning how to use this camera, and not have to refer to a computer-based reference manual.  The Quick Start Guide that comes with the camera gets you started...but just barely. My biggest complaint with ANY new appliance/item/camera I have bought in the last several years is having the instruction manual online...or even downloaded on my computer.  If I have to sit in the woods with my laptop to figure out how to work my camera...then forget it.  I need a book I can refer to.  Besides...I own a cabin in the woods where there is no internet, so if the manual is online via the internet, I'm out of luck!Ok, got off the subject a bit...just venting!Anyway, first impressions- very good.  I will update this after I have had the camera for awhile, but for now I'm very happy with my purchase and very impressed with the quality of the pictures I have taken.

I have not yet mastered my camera but generally I am very pleased with the results I've seen.  I won't get all technical on you except to say that this camera generally seems smarter than I am.  Most of the time I'm just leaving in it the mode where the camera decides the scene and optimizes that way.Some other reviews have mentioned a few defects: telephoto focus and battery life.  Let me comment on battery life-- Usually I leave flash disabled and I've not noticed a short battery life.  At a recent Christmas dinner I turned flash on and I did find the battery running down pretty quickly.  BTW I have noticed that the battery indicator shows \"full\" until maybe 15 minutes before you're out of juice.  I'd really prefer more warning than that!  Back to the battery life: I'd just leave the flash off-- In many cases because of the sophistication of this camera you won't need it as much as you expect!I initially thought I had a problem with focus in telephoto mode until I realized that it was only when my subject was closer than the minimum focus distance of the telephoto; I could focus on objects that were far away but not my up-close subject.  Having used telephotos this is to be expected.  And with the zoom range of this camera it's easy to be in an extreme mode without realizing it-- This lens zooms from 28mm to 1000mm equivalent /before/ switching to digital zoom!  With great power comes great responsibility!Speaking of the zoom-- this camera works pretty well handheld -- even in zoom mode -- when the room lighting is decent!  Of course it can't do the impossible but it does surprisingly well if you are even just a bit careful.I wish there was a good body case for this camera.  I also wish the strap were either just a bit longer or that there was a hand version of the strap.  Be careful to follow the directions when you attach the strap or it may come loose and the camera will fall.  (Fortunately in my case the fall was very short!)Recommended!", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "About as good as point and shoot gets", "Author": "monsieurms \"monsieurms\"", "ReviewID": "RTBB0N5GYT7F3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pace of technology is amazing. I imagine this camera would seem like magic to someone just 20 years or so ago. It is well built, intuitive, takes sharp photos and includes options galore. The picture modes are great. The panorama feature at 180 is exceptional, very good at 360, too. The burst mode in various scene settings helps pictures be better. Built-in effects like sepia, high/low key, monochrome and delete-all-color-but-one work great. It even tells you if someone seemed to blink as you took the shot. Magic indeed. Ultimately, though, it is about the basic act of taking pictures. They were sharp and clear from 24 - 1000.  The camera did a good job with automatic exposure selection, too. I also liked being able to save to a 16:9 format--that's my computer and my TV format. Why not? If you use the 2x digital zoom to go to 2000, even farther than the optical zoom allows, quality does degrade a bit (just like in the old days with extender lenses)--but if you need it, it's there. Controls are logically thought out with key items like close-up mode, exposure compensation, self-timer and flash menus available from a push of the rotator dial without having to dive through the internal menu system. Another similar and great touch is that when you focus and are in an automatic mode, you can adjust the F-stop/aperture program on the fly by just spinning a rotator dial to come up with a different combination, as light allows. Add GPS, support for full size SDXC cards, eye-fi, HD video and so on. There is not much missing here in a fixed lens camera. Some quibbles... The biggest con here is no filter thread. I'll live. It handles so many effects itself (not to mention software that does the rest), that all but the hard core can live without a set of effects filters. But seriously--what can possibly be the point to not having a filter thread on a camera that does so much and is intended to be one stop shopping for most? Just to have a chance to protect the lens if nothing else, a filter would be nice. It would've been nice as well if it took AA batteries for versatility instead of lith-ion, but that's a quibble, too. Also, it comes with a charger that lets you charge the battery IN the camera, but  no travel charger that lets you charge an extra battery all by itself. It would be nice to have both, but that, too, is a minor quibble and a rational choice to keep prices down as (a)there are, if desired, plenty of chargers (and extra batteries) on Amazon and elsewhere at modest prices and (b)on most routine trips and shooting moments, most people probably will not run the battery down unless they use the playback and picture editing features intensively; and (c) if they do run the battery down, they probably can live with in-camera charging that happens rarely at inconvenient times. More intense or more paranoid folks (that's me!) should invest the modest sum of $15-$20 in a travel charger and an extra battery.

However, what I've found to be a big difference is the batteries. The p510 takes a lithium ion battery whereas the p810 requires 4 AA batteries. I would much rather have the longer lasting lithium ion that is rechargeable. It comes with a USB charger, so you can charge it in your car, and for $15 here on Amazon, you can buy a backup battery and travel charging unit combo! I just don't like the idea of being out, snapping away and suddenly needing to find a convenience store to buy some extra AAs to keep shooting. This camera has AMAZING color quality, faster shutter speed, captured photos way faster speeds, a viewfinder, and captures 1080p movies (and yes, like other reviews have stated, you CAN hear the zoom on video playback, but I can overlook that for all its other features) this was a wonderful option for me and I highly recommend it!

So upon receipt of the camera I did a test between my very well used Sony and the new Nikon expecting some extraordinary differences between, especially regarding the zoom. I was sorely disappointed. The Nikon has a much louder lens sound, was noticeably lighter in weight making for more movement in my shots and the zoom was not comparable to my Sony which has a 30x zoom as opposed to the Nikons 42x. The shot recovery time of the Nikon was less than the Sony, but sacrificing photo quality for a second or two recovery time is absolutely not what I was looking for.

Best to come back a short way on the zoom for the focus. Much quicker that way. Does a great job in low light and virtually don't use the flash. Forget the case it comes with.

The box itself seemed undamaged, so that's good to know after I found out that the lenses-cover (the cap) was inside its own little bag. No scratches on the lenses whatsoever thanks to the little box inside the big box, and I am very picky with that. So 5 stars on handling. The tracking information was not updated that often, I didn't hear of it for 3 days on its way to LA from NY. I finally heard of it after its arrival near LA, and it arrived 1 day earlier than estimated.The camera performs so nice.

Nevertheless, once you know what the buttons and settings are for, the P510 its a much easier to use camera.Another remarkable feature from the P510 is that you can record a video with sound and able to use the zoom. In the SP800-UZ, you have to choose between sound or zoom, which was a great disappointment.One really bad setback for the P510 is that since it is relatively new, its replacement batteries are relatively expensive, and for cameras with great zoom like this one or the Olympus SP800UZ or the Canon SX50, you have to buy at least 2 more batteries. If you use the video with microphone, zooming in and out, and with HD, you are going to drain the battery before you can use 2GB of memory.Talking about video, you are gonna have to be patient with the auto-focus if you are video-recording and you zoom to its max. It really takes a long time to bring the images into focus, it happens to both the P510 and the SP800-UZ, although the P510 seems to be better within the same range as the SP800-UZ for video-recording.I'm going to update more once I can make more test and be able to compare them better", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon brand must do better", "Author": "Marigno", "ReviewID": "R1HOTPXL7LGZJP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really appreciate the brand since I have a Nikon D90 which completely satisfies me. I thought I'd give the P510 to my novia for Christmas. We took several pictures and enjoyed the great range of focal length that makes possible some shots otherwise impossible, the good color rendering, the good definition (not beyond 400 ISO). But we also saw a lack on GPS: it has no orentation sensor (the iPhone has), a noticeable distortion at the sides of the image and a critical focusing, impossible on moving subjects. The lens does not have the filter thread. I use a lot the polarizer so I didn't give up: I bought a circular polarizer, I worked it with a file for a couple of hours and created the evidences to frame it in the same spots where the lens cover fits. At the end I was able to mount the filter in a stable manner, aesthetically perfect. The first thing that was not immediately obvious is that having electronic viewfinders it is not so easy to polarize but you can do it; the second thing is that focusing is now more critical and impossible on long focal lengths despite the circular type of the polarizer. Conclusion: A firmware update may solve the focusing problem (with and without polarizer); it remains the lateral distortion that is a fairly common defect of cameras of this type; on D90 there is the update that solves this issue too, maybe it could be possible an update for p510 too.

I'm not a tall person and the fact the screen tips out is nice if you are in a crowd just tip out the screen stick up your arm focus and shoot.

I'm a avid hunter and like to pack a camera with me, I've found that most cameras are not practical to carry while hunting. Some are to big and heavy, the smaller ones do not have the quality of pictures I like. This fall I was able to take several hundred pictures of wildlife that are amazing. In the past I would have to pack so much equipment to get great pictures that it was not enjoyable. This camera has made taking pictures while hunting fun again. It is light and has a great zoom. I do not like the on/off button because I'm used to the location on my other cameras. It takes a moment to power up so you can miss a shot if you are not ready.  I thought that the sound of the cameras zoom would scare the animals, but in the 20-30 ft range I never had a animal know that I was there. I like to use the view finder over the LCD screen, and have found that its not as nice as my bigger Nikons. The price of this camera is nice, it costs less than buying a lens for my other cameras. I wish I could attach filters to this camera. The battery life could be greater, I just carry a couple extra batteries with me and haven't had a problem. I did buy a separate charger and wish Nikon would include one with the camera purchase. I have used this camera in adverse weather, down to -15 degrees F.

I owned a P-100 previously and I think there is a considerable optical improvement at the higher focal lenghts. However, the inability of the P-510 to focus on some subjects was maddening. It would go through the focus process passing right through perfect focus only to stop out of focus. It would do this sometimes on a completely isolated subject.  Also the camera mysteriously lost it's access to the main menu screen. I hoped that Nikon would be able to provide a firmware re-install but they could not and said that I would have to return if for service. You might have noted that I tend to speak of the camera in the past tense--it was aggressively stolen from me here in friendly Costa Rica where I have been using it for the past 2 months.

The only negatives so far (1) no RAW format, (2) Panoramic with the easy scanning does not allow zooming, have to do the panoramic with the wide angle (versus the Fujifilm HS30 EXR that allows zoom with the panoramic scanning),  and (3) the P510 doesn't seem to allow a still photo to be taken with video (that I can tell / this is another function the HS30 EXR has).

Padilla", "ReviewID": "R2KU02OOG3ZB6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an avid amateur (and inveterate gadget freak) I've owned a host of film and digital cameras over the years. I needed a camera with a wide range of focal lengths and features, including macro, wide-angle, and extreme telephoto (orangutans don't like lenses in their faces).  Great camera, and the high MP allows further cropping and enlargement.While I've got a Sony NEX5 with the monster lens, I needed something a bit more flexible, as an upgrade from my old Konica/Minolta A200.  This machine fits the bill.The only negative on the Coolpix P510 package is that it does not come with a \"real\" charger.  You can charge the battery in the camera, but that's really inconvenient.  You can get 200-250 shots per battery, and the batteries themselves are dirt cheap compared to others.  However, it would really be a better idea if they just charged another 10 bucks and included a charger.  3rd-party charger plus a slightly lower capacity (1000 mAH rather than 1250) battery is only about $12 and change, on Amazon & elsewhere.  I didn't order one initially because the one on the Amazon website looked like it was only for use in a car, and \"everyone knows\" that cameras come with chargers. What you get instead is a wall adapter and USB cable, which plugs into the camera for recharging. Doable, but a bummer if you're on a trip.  The batteries are very small, not much bigger than an SD card (!), so be sure you own several if you plan to take lots of photos.Overall, 4.9999 stars, so I rounded up to 5.AlNikon COOLPIX P510 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 42x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and GPS Record Location (Black)", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Graet Camera!", "Author": "WestTnDawg", "ReviewID": "R3KBKB5G6QF1DY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

Most camera enthusiasts know the importance of putting a filter on the lens to protect it from scratches.  Usually a simple UV or skylight filter is used for this.Some of the Coolpix cameras appear to have threads on the lens that appear to take a filter.  This very deceptive, because those threads in fact do not allow a filter.  This was confirmed to me via a phone call to Nikon.  The only exception is the Coolpix 7700.  Nikon tech support believes the inclusion of digital filters built into the firmware of the camera are sufficient.  But digital filters will not protect the lens from scratches.  When your lens gets a scratch, you have to send the camera off to Nikon to get it fixed or buy a new camera.In the Nikon camera series, you have to get an SLR $$$$$ to take a filter, the Coolpix 7700 excepted.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Early Review on Nikon Coolpix P510", "Author": "K.

Also, if you'd like to change focus or zoom while shooting video... don't get your hopes up. There are two focus modes; Full time and single AF. If you choose single, it will focus when it starts recording, then hold at that level. This is the only usable focus mode for video. If you enable full time AF, the smallest change will make the camera constantly re-evaluate, causing blurry to not blurry back and forth video. If you try to zoom while it is enabled, it will stay in focus while it is zooming, but stay out of focus as soon as you get to the point you want to be at. And you can't manually focus video either. There IS a manual focus feature for the camera, but it is a pain to use, even after you figure out how to change it to use the side rocker to control said focus.\" This is a quote from Robert Torttielo and my exact experience with this camera. Everytime I think of the blurry video of my granddaughters ballet recital I get pissed. I shouldn't have to search the net for a fix for this and then keep my fingers crossed that it works.

The sports setting works well except the time after the photos are taken, the recovery time I think is too slow can't move onto the next shot quickly. I am not a photographer and have no training which is I why I bought this camera instead of another one with different lenses where it would be a larger investment. I have been disappointed with many of my photos as a lot of them end up out of focus and I have to take multiple, which really annoys people. My bothers-in-laws phone took some better photos with better color and lighting correction, needless to say was not happy when we compared photos. When I get a photo in focus they usually turn out really well. Landscape pictures turn out well but camera doesn't take people moving very well unless you are on sports setting. Changing between the settings can be a little time consuming when you are trying to make multiple types of photos quickly. Before you use the camera spend a lot of time getting use to the settings, learning where they are and how to change them.

The camera does work great all around and is a fast shooter camera with amazing diversity of settings really programmed into it alreadyReason its given 3 stars is because of the fact that (my own fault) left it sitting on a tripod for a long exposure shot and a gust of wind knocked it over, with only having it for 3 weeks the lens inside was knocked out and since was irreparable, finding out that a very easy fall can really damage it beyond repair. You would think that the camera could take a bit more wear and tear but it really can not handle much. The warranty works! Get it from square trade and they work with you the whole time and are a VERY good company to work with.

I already had a digital Pentax SLR, but the old lenses I'd originally bought for a film camera body that died when a wave hit me in Antarctica didn't have any decent wide-angle settings.  I also already had an old, good, small Olympus point-and-shoot camera with a pretty good optical zoom.  I thought this would be a good compromise camera that wouldn't excel as much as either of them, but would do a better all-around job.  Boy, was I wrong -- it isn't even as good a camera as my phone is.  Zooming in tight invariably gets me blurry pictures, even using a tripod.  (There's no bulb feature, and MAYBE there is a delay feature -- if only the manual's instruction to \"see page 39\" were not a reference to a non-existent page in the paper manual.)  It quite often won't focus at all, and therefore won't take any picture AT ALL.  There's no macro setting, so very up-close pictures are also blurry and lousy.  The optics are terrible -- point this thing at a perfectly beautiful full moon, and the viewfinder will show it surrounded by a huge fuzzy halo that isn't visible with the naked eye, which was the biggest and most surprising disappointment of all, given the reputation of Nikon lenses.

I can't speak to all the technicalities as others have done. What I can speak to is results and disappointing they were. Overall, I found the colors washed out and most images out of focus even when the subject was 10 feet away and not moving. Images taken at the far end of the zoom were all out of focus, no matter what setting I used. I also found the battery life disappointing. After about 75 images, it was dead. I compare this camera to my little Panasonic Lumix - blew the Canon out of the water. I've returned the Canon and am going to try an upscale version of my Lumix.
