{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Marginally functional", "Author": "H. Ho", "ReviewID": "R2Q5I0B2Y1VGLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For being an aftermarket trunk release solenoid, Viper should have considered that not all trunk latches are as friendly with these solenoids.  The solenoid is not powerful enough to pull open the spring-ed latch on the trunk release of my 94 honda accord.  No matter how you position the pull-line of the solenoid you cannot remotely open your trunk with the kind of power this solenoid puts out.  I wound up breaking the spring on my latch.  Although the remote trunk release works now, the trunk only latches shut 10% of the time.  The only way you can get this to work on a latch like this is to reduce the spring tension to where it is just enough for the solenoid to pull open and enough that the latch will work properly when the trunk is closed.  Another possibility is to lengthen the arm you want your solenoid to pull thereby increasing the torque that the solenoid can work with.Updating my reviews...I just wish I can drop another star from this item.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Lacks power, push button very cheap", "Author": "StrikeEagleCC", "ReviewID": "R1MWW3X325UWFF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I installed this on my '00 Camry today. The solonoid simply has too little power and travel to be effective.  While the travel is sufficient for my application, it may not be for yours. The spring tension on my latch is not strong at all, but this thing can only pull it open one out of two times. Unacceptable. The push button is also terrible, but even on a relay, this solonoid just will not perform.

This company cant even stand by the products it sells. It didnt work no matter how I installed; with slack or not; this product just doesn't have the power that trunk latches need. ur better off going to the junk yard and picking one up for $10, they dont burn out like that because they dont get used like a window motor or door lock motor.

I have read reviews that this solenoid is not powerful enough to open the lock,. I initially thought that was the case when I hooked it up the first.The key to making it work is to leave slack in the cable when you connect it to you mechanism's latch (take time to remove the latch and drill a latch hole to keep the cable securely attached). This is because the slack allows the solenoid weight to accelerate a bit and tug on the latch with a more force.  I think the mistake most made who found it disappointing was to make the cable taught, which is wrong.  The kit has most everything you will need however if you don't have a source of constant on power in your trunk area, you will have to run a wire.Good value and it came in a reasonable amount of time.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Under Powered", "Author": "dmcnaughton", "ReviewID": "R1H4QIDNC8K2E6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The device itself is severely under powered for opening the latch on my trunk.

I have a 240sx hatch and with the hatch open the solenoid will function. With the hatch closed the solenoid barely tugs at the spring latch.  I've tried adjusting the tension on the wire cable with no luck. Just a little bit of slack and still won't pop open. Too tight and the door won't shut because the tension on the cable is keeping the latch open. Even when I found a happy medium, feels like the solenoid barely flicks the latch.This item may work with trunks that are very light, but not for heavy trunk doors/hatch.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "very week", "Author": "dchrist", "ReviewID": "R1E23AE6KQFDN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The solenoid doesn't have enough power to open up a trunk.

I ended up buying additional wire. The trunk release switch is crappy. It doesn't work most of the time. Fortunately, I hook it up with a relay from my bulldog ke1702 keyless entry. And that works all the time.Also, grounding is important. If the grounding on the trunk lid is not good, route another wire to a factory grounding point on the body.The most difficult part is not electrical but mechanical. There's no standard way to hook the steel wire. I took the locking mechanism out and studied a bit. I found a spot where only a little force and moving distance needed to open it. The spot is on the actual movement which locks the latch and it doesn't interface with the manual trunk release cable and the arm operated by the trunk key.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "bought this to give it a try...", "Author": "Matthew A.
