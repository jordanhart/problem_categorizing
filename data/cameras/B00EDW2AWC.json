The camera starts, but almost immediately pops up a screen saying something like 'Incompatible Battery Type, Please Insert Correct Battery'.  I suspect that the ID code chip in the battery is incorrect.  We tried contacting the seller (DavisMax) to see if they had batteries that would work, but they simply referred us back to Amazon.  Note that I borrowed a Wasabi battery, which looks very similar and has similar specs to this battery, and it worked fine.  So it is possible to find 3rd party batteries that work on an A77, but just not this one.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EDW2AWC"}}
