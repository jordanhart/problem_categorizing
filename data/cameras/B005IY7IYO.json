The 18-55mm lens is 58mm and the ones in the kit are for a 52mm lens, when I contacted them they sent me out the right ones and an item that was missing they sent it out right away.  The customer service was very good. I was pleased at how they handled the situation.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "evaluate the product", "Author": "sultan", "ReviewID": "R181WMZGHGVJU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this product is good but not the same items that discribed or shown in the picture. the tripod , video flas  wich is normal flash) and flash diffuser are totaly different than the picture.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005IY7IYO"}}
