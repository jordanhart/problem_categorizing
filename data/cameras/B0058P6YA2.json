On a couple camerasI  was able to use only the extra 100 feet and on other cameras I attached the extra 100 feet to the original cable. I did not not loose any clarity using the longer 100 ft cable. The extra cables made it all come together.

These worked well. They are slightly thinner than the ones that came with my system. That said, I was expecting a drop off in video quality since the others were 60' long.

Even though these cables physically resemble the Q-See cables they are not constructed in the same manner.  The cameras run on low voltage electricity. The cables are supposed to carry the camera signal feed-back over coax and simultaneously the low voltage electricty to the camera over copper wire.  Since these cables did not contain thick enough copper wire the low voltage current could not travel the 100+ foot run.  The installers had to put local power sources for the cameras, consequently they could not be hooked up to the central power control panels located with the video unit in the server closet.  The coax seemed to work on two cameras.  When we discovered the problem we threw away the other 2 cables.  I wish to point out I hired professional installers.STAY  AWAY  from this provider", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Must Get", "Author": "Lloyd Dawson", "ReviewID": "R1ZPL9JKMORYY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you ever do camera installs you've run into the situation when a cable is to short.This is the perfect answer. 100', heaver duty and a GRAT price.
