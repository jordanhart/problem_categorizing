{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the best compact digital cameras on the market...", "Author": "JoJo", "ReviewID": "R1TD9U9CBGO292", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this as a replacement from my Sony P-72 3.2 meg camera.  WOW!  This camera is so much more improved from only a couple years ago.  Aside from the 5.1 megapixel count, this camera excels in almost every conceivable area relevant to compacts.First off, this camera starts up in less than a second or so--truly fast compared to other similarly priced cameras.  This feature is essential when attempting to capture that oh so special kodak...er...sony moment in a blink.Secondly, the camera is beautiful.  Sony got it right this time when designing a sturdy, compact and lightweight technological masterpiece.  True, it's not as small as its even lighter cousin--the T-1, or the Pentax Optio S4i and Casio Ex-z4, but it passes the pants pocket test with flying colors. Additionally, when compared to the T-1, this camera uses the regular memory stick size and not the smaller duo like the T-1. Sooooo, if you already own a sony, this is a natural upgrade.Some other excellent features on the P-100 are the manual overides.  You can adjust the shutter speed and aperature which, for a camera in this class, is a true rarity.  Unlike the T-1, this cam does have a tripod mount, a no brainer for any serious photographer.  I also am enjoying the extremely high quality video mode; although not the most important selling point, having the ability to take camcorder like videos with sound for unlimited amounts of time (unlike 30 second segments from many other cams) is handy.Another amazing feature is the battery life.  I remember my first sony digital camera--the DSC-P50 2.1 mega pixel.  It's battery life was dismal.  My P-72 was slightly improved, but still suffered from chronic battery munchies.  The P-100 fully charged can take pictures for over 200 minutes!  If you're on the display modes, it can last almost double that--another breathtaking accomplishment.  The info lithium works well in calculating the remaining battery life--a major complaint from owners of other cameras like Canon that lack this feature.  Lastly, it is a proprietary battery, so purchasing an additional one is recommended.Needless to say, the 1.8\" lcd is gorgeous, just like the past sony cameras I've had.  It's extremely hi-res and I have no difficulty seeing it in sunlight.  The lcd's navigation is similar to earlier sony cams with a few new additions like a light metering box.Overall, I'm tremendously pleased with the picture quality from this puppy.  I envision this camera lasting well into early-mid 2005 when Sony will release yet another improvement.  Until then, I highly recommend this for most anybody who appreciates quality and functionality incorporated into a lightweight package.", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "The P100", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RHIJ8ZC9MUVHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here are some of my initial impressions after using the P100 for a week now. These are things that I had read about that I thought might be a concern before I bought the camera, and now that I've actually been able to use it here's what I have found so far:1) Sharpness of photos: very good. There is an option to adjust the default setting to +1 sharpness or -1 sharpness depending on what you like. I chose to increase the sharpness and find this captures all the details, facial features, environment, crisp and clean. 2) Size: this is very compact which I like and is very portable. It also feels sturdy, so no complaints. I feel like this is something I can take with me very easily without any hassle.3) Movie mode: this was a key factor in luring me to this model. After shooting some movies, I plugged in the supplied cable to my TV (AV cables) and voila! I was watching my footage on the 34\" screen and it looked great. I used the 640x480, 30 frames per second, fine mode (the highest quality setting on the camera) and was very impressed. User tip: the focus needs to be set at a fixed distance such as 0.5m for closeups, all the way to infinity if shooting landscapes. If left on multifocus or centerfocus the camera focus will constantly be adjusting to every movement in the frame causing a very disorienting effect. Caveat: this is not a camcorder and could never include all the functions of a dedicated camcorder. But, for someone like me who only wants to carry one device and keep things at a minimum this is a fantastic gadget. With the 1GB memory stick pro (which you will have to fork over some $$ for), you can shoot about 12 mins at the highest quality setting (so I bought two of them).4) Startup time and lag time: startup time is virtually nil. Press the on button and it's running. Amazing. Lag time will depend on your settings, most importanly, how you set the flash settings. So this will vary from user to user. On the basic 'auto' mode, the lag time from pressing the shutter to the shot being taken in only a couple of seconds. When using the 'red eye reduction' flash mode, it's probably around 4-5 seconds lag. 5) Battery duration: aboout 2-2.5 hours depending on what you're doing, viewing, etc. Full battery charge takes about 3 hours.The main things I was looking for in improvements over my last Sony 3megapixel digital camera were:1) would it be faster: overall, yes2) smaller size: yes (I don't think a smaller camera would be  user-friendly)3) improved video: yesI'm a nit-picker when it comes to electronic devices, but have found the P100 to meet or exceed my expectations. If there were one thing I would like to see improvement on (and this applies to all digital cameras) is achieving a zero-second lag time when it comes to pressing the shutter and having the picture being snapped. This might not be possible, but I would like to see instantaneous click-to-shot times.----- update to my initial review ------I went and bought the 'base station' for the camera. My main reason for getting this was for ease in hooking up the camera to my tv. You can hook the camera up to your tv without the base station, but because the cable connection in the camera is on the bottom of the camera, it means you have to lay the camera on its front or back which I didn't like doing. I can keep the station hooked up to the TV at all times, it doubles as a charger for the battery, and it has it's own remote so you can sit on the couch and scroll through the picturs and movies. You can also zoom in on pictures (and the pictures hold their sharpness--amazing zoom detail). Pricey but a handy accessory.P100 cybsershot case: this is the black case 'made for the P100' which has the square metal \"logo\" on the top flap. This is a POOR case for the camera. While I like the materials, the closure is velcro and the camera fit is too snug, so it feels like the flap will pop open. My suggestion would be to look for a different case.", "Date": "June 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Sony P100 review (plus Canon S500, Fuji F610 and others)", "Author": "Sushil Pant", "ReviewID": "R3CJVTPC24BRIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ultra-compact digicam comparison: which ultra-compact camera should I buy? Make sure you read the whole thing - it'll give you an idea of what to look for yourself.Considered: Fuji F610, Sony T1, Sony T11, Sony P100, Pentax Optio S4i, Canon S500, Nikon 3700/5200.Fuji 610 (72 x 93 x 31 mm)Pros: excellent camera with awesome image quality. Claim that vertical design will limit camera shake - maybe. Video quality excellent at 640 x 480 (30fps). xD picture cards cheap.Cons: Larger than canon s500 and sonyp100 - but not a huge problem considering the better features (especially the amount of manual controls with shutter/aperture). BUT - NO AF ASSIST LAMP: therefore poor low light performance. Not able to switch off digital zoom such that the optical switches over to digital automatically - which will reduce image quality stored. But the clincher here is the lack of AF assist lamp.Sony P100 (108 x 51.5 x 26.6 mm)Pros: It's a Sony: their attention to detail is always guaranteed. Nine scene selections which makes shooting for amateurs so much simpler and takes you up that extra notch - read excerpt below. Option of attaching a wide-angle telephoto lens down the track - should you start to take your photography (more) seriously. Excellent video quality at 640 x 480 (30fps or 17pfs), size unlimitied). AF assist lamp. Battery life indicator: provides estimated mins remaining. Battery has also been found to be of exceptional stamina - compared to other digicams of this size.I got this from Imaging-Resource: \"Scene mode offers a range of preset exposure modes, including Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Soft snap, Snow, Beach, High Speed Shutter, Fireworks, and Candle modes. Both Twilight modes optimize the camera for low-light shooting by allowing shutter times as long as two seconds, while Landscape mode sets the camera up for shooting distant subjects. Soft snap mode warms skin tones and sets focus to slightly soft. Snow mode enhances saturation and adjusts exposure, to prevent loss of colour in bright white snow scapes, while Beach mode ensures that blue tones are recorded accurately in lakeside or seaside photos. High-speed shutter mode is for shooting action or bright subjects. Fireworks mode preserves colour in shots of fireworks or other night light displays by fixing the lens aperture at f/5.6 and setting the exposure time to the 2-second maximum. Candle mode slows shutter speeds and biases exposure to keep candlelit scenes looking natural; a tripod is recommended in this model\"Cons: Memory stick: expensive, but prices have come down and will come down further. Definitely get yourself a MS Pro Duo (either a 256, or better still 512MB). Getting the Duo now (which is not much more $) will keep you ahead of the game. Size: slightly longer than Canon S500 but thinner - so not so bad. Overall the cons are not awfully bad.Sony T1/T11 (T!: 91mm x 60mm x 21mm)Pros: Awesome design. Very thin. All other pros similar to Sony P100. Nice option of black.Cons: NO tripod mount - sure it's an ultra-compact which you'd carry around, but sometimes it's nice to mount it for macro and other shots. I would have seriously forked out the extra cash for this camera but the lack of a tripod mount was the clincher.Canon S500 (87.0 x 57.0 x 27.8 mm)Pros: Size: I like to use this camera as a benchmark for size comparisons with other cameras. Design and form factor: almost as good as Sony: very elegant. CF - cheap, very cheap. I've previously had the Canon S230 (3.2MP 2X optical) and it was an excellent camera.Cons: VERY, VERY POOR: no battery life indicator - with the S230 I have been caught out many times, this is especially so when other members of your family use the camera and you have no idea how much charge is left. The solution is to get a spare battery, but Canon should have rectified this issue by now and they have deliberately chosen not to and that tells me something. Video at 320 x 240 (15fps): if you want 640x480 only available at 10pfs: compare this with Sony and Fuji, both at 640x480, 30fps!! Now I know that this is a digital camera and not a camcorder - but it's nice to know that you can take VGA quality shots at an instant - so you're always prepared - because who carries the camcorder everywhere?!!Pentax Optio S4i ((83 x 52 x 20mm))Pro: Size. Size. And price.Cons: No AF assist lamp: therefore poor in low light. Although a good camera, you'll read that it's more a `fun' camera than half-serious like the Sony P100 or Canon S500. Of course the Fuji F610 takes it up a notch as far as manual features go. Also the video quality is poor: similar to the canon S500 - although I would imagine Canon would still do a better job of it.Nikon 3700 (95.5 x 50 x 31 mm)Pro: Scene selection. Size. Cons: Some have claimed a disparity between sound and video - not sure about this though. Appearance: very uninspiring, like the rest of the coolpix family.CONCLUSIONSRank overall:1. Sony P100 (image quality, scene options, video quality, it's a Sony)2. Canon S500 (two downfalls - and both quite big - no battery life indicator and low video resolution)3. Fuji F610 (NO AF assist, can't switch off digital zoom)If size and form factor the most important and tripod mount absolutely not necessary (e.g. if will be in handbag all the time): Sony T1", "Date": "June 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, Great Features", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2IBG48PCLP8KS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing about 2 months of research on a digital camera, I decided on and am very pleased with the Sony P100.  I had narrowed my choice between the Canon S410 and the Sony P100.  I could not justify paying more for the Canon when the Sony had triple the features. However, I purchased both these cameras so I could compare picture quality for myself.  Much to my delight, once I got it home and played with it, I found out the Sony took better pictures.  Yes, that's right BETTER pictures than the Canon S410.  Isn't that the bottom line?  Great pictures have always been #1 on my list.  And yes, all the other reviews are correct, it is incredibly fast.  I have two young children and I will not be missing many, if any, great memories.  I would have to say that the Canon does feel a little more solid in the hand but that is just personal preference.  It comes with numerous special features that I hope to learn.  But until then, it is nice just knowing they are there when that time comes.  Also, strangely enough, the Canon does not have a date stamp option.  Something that my husband and I really use.  Try it, I think you will be very happy.", "Date": "July 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "This little thing rocks!!!", "Author": "Kristin F.", "ReviewID": "R27MVIHRPA8D2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not be more happy with this camera!  It was between the Nikon 5200 and Sony W1 and I am so glad I chose this one.  I tried out the Nikon for a few days and returned it; too light and awkward and terrible colors.This camera is perfect!  Just the right size, small and pocketable but still with enough heft.  Although, for one-handed shooting I feel much more comfortable with the wrist strap on, since it is small and feels like it could almost slip out of my grasp, although it hasn't happenned yet.I previously had a Sony DSC-S85 which is HUGE compared to this thing and was so slow, you could never catch any action.  But it took beautiful photos, and this one is even better.  I have not had one bad picture yet, and I've taken about 150 so far, in all kinds of lighting situations.  The only editing I've had to do is a couple of red eyes, not bad at all.  I haven't noticed any \"purple fringing yet\" and the pictures are clear and crisp and gorgeous.  Skin tones are right on (which is a problem in many digicams), and the histogram feature is really nice in questionable lighting.This little puppy is blazing fast.  You push the on button and you are snapping away in literally a second.  Lag time is next to nothing.  It's a little more if you program it to show a quick preview after each picture, but you can turn that feature off. Speaking of features, there are tons!  The scene pre-sets are handy, and the menus are intuitive.  Although, I have had to adjust to the slightly different layout from my previous sony.  This one's is better though.When reviewing pictures this camera is speedy.  You don't have to wait at all for the pictures to load clearly.  The multi burst feature is cool, you can get dramatic slow-motion effects.  But I don't think you can view them anywhere but on the camera, at least I haven't figured that out yet.The battery lasts forever.  I shot about 80 pictures and video (standard) at my nephew's birthday party today, used a lot of flash and reviewed the pictures many times, also turned the camera on and off lots.  There's hardly a dent in the battery, in picture mode it's telling me over 150 minutes left.  My last camera had the infoLithium also and it was so great!  Sony has it figured out.The video quality has improved dramatically but don't plan on using as a substitute for you camcorder -it's not that good yet- plus you'd have to spend $1000's on a couple 1GB memory stick pro's to hold those enormous files.  But in a pinch it works nice.  Speaking of the memory sticks, those things are expensive, so factor in at least one 256MB pro stick (512 would be ideal, but more $$$) which will run at least $60.00 if you go sandisk or lexar, etc.Another great feature is that you can get conversion lenses.  However they look a little bulky and awkward but I think I may invest in the telephoto someday.  Hopefully by the next time I'm ready to purchase a new digital camera they will be putting higher optical zoom lenses in them at this price rance.Overall, you get a great little camera for a lot less money than many with less features and less quality.  I have finally found a camera my husband will use (and can actually produce printable pictures on!).  I couldn't recommend this little camera more.

It really has a very fast start up time as well as a very short shutter lag (0.3-0.5s )also as mentioned at imaging-resource.com. It rivals some of the D-SLR's on these parameters! It has a Carl-Zeiss lens that provides excellent quality iamges. The colors and saturation of images are well balanced, I do not feel to play around with imaging software to make them  look better. In addition, it is light and thin, can be carried around w/out much hassle. It has a great macro. Finally, the battery goes and goes and goes without dying out...

I haven't even had to edit pictures with software. Just point, shoot, and print.  Of course I have the Epson PictureMate (must have)and no one can believe that a digital camera can produce such high quality images.After reading many reviews from several different websites, I purchased the Canon Powershot Pro S1 IS.  It didn't take long to realize that I wasn't going to get sharp images from that camera.  The images were too soft and had to be edited with software.  I sold it, took a loss, and purchased this fine Sony Camera.  I'm so glad I did.The camera is so easy to use (unlike the Canon), and produces excellent images.  The movie mode is awesome, too.  Takes great movies...you need at least a 1G memory stick.  I am so happy with this camera, I am going to start buying all of the accessories (lenses, filters).I suggest that you buy at a store that has a return policy in case you are not happy with your purchase.  Staples offers a 14 day return policy.  But I won't be returning mine!Try it...it's worth a cyber-shot!!!Update 3/13/05If you're trying to decide between the Sony DSC-P100 and the Sony DSC-W1, maybe this will help make your decision. I have had the recent experience to play with the DSC-W1. The pictures were okay, a little soft, but sharpness can be increased in manual mode.  I like the pictures from the DSC-P100 much better.  The movie mode wasn't quite as good as the DSC-P100 either.  The DSC-W1 produced blurry movie mode scenes without even moving the camera.

During a recent vacation, my niece received a camera for a birthday gift. I watched her take pictures, and I loved the idea of instant gratification by being able to see the picture immediately. For the rest of the trip, I looked at digital cameras, and finally at the end of the trip decided to purchase the Sony Cybershot DSP 100 camera. I took pictures the last week of vacation, and had them printed out. I was so pleased by the quality of the camera. The day after I returned, I took pictures of some flowers at a local Botanical garden, and I was so excited by how well the camera captured the beautiful colors. Everyone that has seen these pictures have remarked on the clarity and color.  The Carl Zeiss lens was the deciding factor over the other 5.0 cameras I looked at. My dad recommended this lens to me, and I must say, it makes all of the difference.  I have not had a chance to try out all of the special features, but I am already so happy with my choice.

It's worth every cent and much more!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2WTFI3ZS0Y5KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has to be one of the best cameras out there. When i first got it I noticed its sleek design. Its so small and light. It fights in the palm of my hands and I can carry it anywhere. I actuallly noticed too that its basically smaller than my nokia 6800 cell phone which is shocking. anyway the camera has a nice 1.8 inch LCD screen. The photos look amazing when you view them. When you are dealing with this camera you also get the FASTEST performance. The camera starts up in like 1 or 2 seconds and it shoots with NO LAG. Even if you are shooting with flash the shot to shot time is awesome. The zoom pops out very fast too which also makes a funny noise. i don[t reallyh ahve to explain the picture quality because you know Sony is always EXCELLENT with that. Others say that canon is better but I think Sony's a tad better well atleast with this camera anyway. The movie mode on this camera is comparable to a camcorder. It shoots VGA (640x 480) at an option of 15fps or 30fps. 30 fps is basically smoother but requires about twice the memory so 15fps would be sufficient for any user. To tlel you the truth i bought this camera for the movie mode too because its much better than the Canon S500. Lastly, the battery is outstanding. You can shoot pictures a little over 3 hours worth. I recommend geting the accessory kit from sony (comes with battery, case, wallet thing) about $65 on ebay and a 256mb memory stick card or 512 memory stick pro card. You can get the 512mb one for under $120!! Oh and I forgot to mention the cool accessories available for this beastily camera. You can get 1.7X telephoto lens, 2.6X lens (turns ur compact camera to almost a 8X optical demon, lol), .7X wide lens, marine pack (underwater case) and external flash (some say the flash on the camera isn't bright enough so people buy external separate ones)", "Date": "June 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera, you can't go wrong with this one!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2QB2VNSFNS6OQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of searching for the perfect ultra-compact camera I came down with Canon S500, S410 and Sony P100.

The Sony's 640x480 video clips are certainly markedly improved from the 320x240 days, but be aware that they aren't equal to the quality one would expect from a camcorder.  I do notice that the autofocus tends to change focus too much during video capture and this highly transient focus can detract from the quality of the video clips.

I'm no photography expert or even so much as a hobbyist, but the comparison in picture quality between this and my previous camera, a Nikon point-and-shoot 120 ED, is night and day. The difference can be seen vividly when viewing pictures on a computer screen. I can now blow 2MB pictures up to poster size before any noticeable pixellation occurs; with my old camera, a picture scan of that quality would use up at least 60MB. (You read that correctly: two versus SIXTY megabytes!)As others have pointed out, you need to know going in that Sony includes a rock-bottom bare minimum of storage in the Memory Stick provided with the camera (only 32 MB), and you will almost definitely want to purchase a larger one (it doesn't pay to buy anything less than 256MB). And be prepared to spend some time with the camera's manual in order to understand some of the basic settings.

Even in bright light there was a 50/50 chance that the picture would turn out well.  We took roughly 1000 pictures and finally decided to sell the P100 on ebay.  [...]Maybe mine was defective and others perform better.  I wish I could change the 5 star rating I've given the camera but I can't.", "Date": "October 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Little Camera", "Author": "MateoC \"Matt\"", "ReviewID": "R3UMCVPOFSYXDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow! This camera is great! I'm not too sure there's anything wrong with this one... There are some features that have been removed since my last Sony Cybershot 2 Megapixel, but those have been replaced with some great NEW features. I especially like the histogram display, it tells you (when you're going manual) if the picture is too dark or too bright. Pretty neat idea. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera at Amazon's price. I bought it the day after thanksgiving for a little cheaper, but the Amazon price is still good. I'd like to mention the dock too. I haven't bought it yet, but I plan to. ANOTHER THING: Rechargable LI-ION in the cybershot! FINALLY!, the charging port is in kind of a wierd place, but there are ways to work around that.THE ONLY CON (perhaps?):The USB is on the bottom of the camera, it doesn't use the traditional mini connector, it's a whole new fandangled connector. The box includes two of these, one for USB and one for connection to the TV (MONO SOUND TOO!) YOU CANNOT HOOK THE USB AND TV SIMULTANEOUSLY!!!! (It's not possible) UNLESS... you buy the docking station.Overall, through what i've done with it so far, it's a great little camera! BUY THIS ONE! It should last you an amazingly long time too.

Horne", "ReviewID": "R22EESEJ1N033P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera to replace my Fuji Finepix 3.2MP camera.  I wanted a camera that I could use to take photos of my pets, and according to many sources, this camera has great red-eye reduction.  Well, when I take pictures of my dogs, they turn out great and the pictures look like they are fresh from a regular film SLR.  However, it's about 50-50 when I take pictures of my Ragdoll kitten.  It may be because he has blue eyes, but for some reason he always ends up getting more red eye than anyone else.  Although this is dissappointing, it is still better than my old camera.  It has a lot more features, some of which I still haven't used.  Another fault of this camera, however, is the fact that in considerably well lit places, if you do not have the flash on, anything that is moving in the picture will be a blur.  This basically forces you to use the flash in all conditions other than extremely well lit places, like the beach.  The LCD screen is very easy to see, and is a lot bigger than the one on my old camera.  Again, how well it works depends on the situation.  In very sunny situations it's IMPOSSIBLE to see the screen.  At least there is a viewfinder to help you out.  The software that comes with the camera is pretty bad, and I can't figure out how to save pictures to my computer.  Much harder to use than that which came with my old camera.  The battery is a plus so far, as that it lasts a very long time compared to my old camera.  Charging it isn't a pain at all.  The memory stick that you must use is a bit of a pain because they are more expensive than a lot of the alternatives that I could have used if it did not require the stick.  The accessories, other than the memory stick, are fairly priced.  The video taking capabilities on this camera are awesome.  Some people have complained about them, but they are SO much better than any I have seen before on a digital camera.  It really helps that I can connect the camera to my TV, using the cables provided by Sony (this is one of my favorite features).  All in all, I do not think that I regret my decision on buying this camera (yet), but I wish that I would have considered other choices that may have had less of a red-eye problem.", "Date": "February 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Easy and Fun, great for digital virgins!", "Author": "T.

My laptop is VAIO, my palm is a Clie, my camcorder is a Sony MiniDV, my surround sound, cd, alarm, you get the picture. So when I decided to get my second digital camera (don't want to discuss the first, a Kodak easy share I bought about two years ago, the wounds are still fresh) I knew I would get a Sony, I just didn't know which one.After doing some research I decided on a 5.1 megapixel for quality, and I wanted small, but not so compact that I would lose it. The DSC-P100 is small, but not microscopic like some out there. It's also made of metal and easy to grip, I don't feel like I'm going to break it when I use it. I've had it for about a week now and the pictures are magnifficent and the resolution is unbelievable! It comes with a 32mg memory stick which is enough for just taking pictures casualy at events, but eventually I plan on purchasing more. The sound playback on the video is great, I can clearly hear what is being said on playback on my camera.Sony does well with using the Carl Zeiss lens, I also have it on my miniDV and knew I wanted it on my digital camera. I have yet to use the burst feature, I didn't even know it was on this camera until after I bought it.I didn't have much luck with my first digital camera (OH! the terrible pain!) so I consider this my first real experience with one. I love it, it's easy and fun to use. The LCD screen on the back is big enough that I can clearly see the picture without having to squint.Side note: I bought my printer when I bought my camera and I have to say I tried about 15 different printers for picture quality and the Sony color 4x6 printer was horrible. The best picture quality I found was an Epson Stylus Photo R320, the pictures look like I just got them back from the developer, not my printer.

Pruss", "ReviewID": "R35M18OR4N7PAG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the P100 (for free using Sony Visa bonus points), as a companion to a three-year-old F707, which is a wonderful camera (at the high end of the non-pro spectrum in its time) but sometimes too big to take on a walk with a toddler.  I was in some ways pleasantly surprised.  In every respect except of taking still pictures, the P100 is better.  That's technological evolution at work: much nicer movie mode (excellent quality of video and sound!), a nicer directional pad/selector, a handy stand-alone delete button, faster picture taking, accepts MS Pro cards, nicer LCD.  Photos aren't as good, especially indoors, but that is to be expected with the tiny lens and small flash of the P100--but tiny is why I got it, so I have no complaints.Outdoor pictures can be excellent.  Indoor pictures can be quite good if one is careful.  As always, some pictures won't come out, but that's my fault as photographer.  I am quite happy--for my purposes, the camera does the job quite well.  It's not going to produce pictures that a high end consumer camera can (the 5MP spec is certainly not everything--the F707 is also a 5MP camera), but if one wants a small camera that one can carry around in a pocket and quickly fire up whenever something picture-worthy shows up, this is a good choice.I particularly like the focusing spotlight, because it lets me know what the camera is pointed at without my having to look at the LCD/viewfinder, which for certain shots is nice.  I wish it came with some sort of a case, but I guess people might want different ones.  (I just use a draw-string little cloth bag that a flash for my F707 came with.)I'd like to address two complaints in other reviews.1. Focus issues.  Some reviewers complain of focusing problems.  My impression is that this is when one is taking pictures in multi-area focus mode, which averages out the data in different areas, and which can ensure that no areas is in focus.  This is the only focus mode available in the easy-shoot mode (the one with the \"camera\" icon).  I tend to switch to the program mode (the one with the \"P\") and set everything on automatic except make the focus be center-area only.  Then I point to the part I want in focus, press the shutter half way, compose the picture, press the shutter all the way.  One really does need to control which part of the picture is to be in focus--no camera can read one's mind!  And outdoor this is a lesser issue because with more light the lens will tend to be stopped up more, and hence have a wider focus range.  My impression is that the focus might still not be perfect in low-light conditions, but I haven't tested this thoroughly.2. Ergonomics.  Out of the box, the camera is hard to hold in one hand when taking landscape-orientation pictures.  For portrait, I think it's fine, and it's fine for landscape with two hands (which one really should use for optimal stability anyway).  For someone like me with big hands, it's easy to cover up part of the flash when holding with one hand, and the weight is inconveniently distributed.  But there is a way of fixing the ergonomics: egrips ([...]  These are very grippy sticky things to keep electronics from sliding out of pockets, etc.  If one applies them in the right places on the camera (I put a strip vertically along the rear right and two horizontally along the front, where the right hand makes contact with the camera), my grip became MUCH surer, and I could hold the camera reasonably comfortably without obscuring the flash.  It seemed worth the ten bucks plus shipping for the egrips, as it fixed the ergonomic issue.  (I have no connection with the people who make the egrips, but they're a good deal, I think.  The camera kit comes with a lot more stickies than one needs for the P100 so there may be enough for some other uses, too.)", "Date": "April 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great - Really", "Author": "Kurt W.

If you want to buy this camera, make sure you can return it w/o incuring the re-stocking fee.", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Simply  the Best", "Author": "Sujoy Ghosh \"Sujoy Ghosh\"", "ReviewID": "RNV7GT1KC9YOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a camera nerd... yet, I would say this is the best camera I have ever owned.", "Date": "November 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "An almost 8 year old camera", "Author": "A very picky photographer", "ReviewID": "R4M5NIY6W6IN8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was excellent when in was introduced IN 2004!!!

But if you are a hardcore photography junkie then pass up this one.  I bought this camera just for shooting.  Film cameras are a dying breed and I could edit my digital pictures on my computer, not to mention how easy it is to send pics on e-mails.  Well so far I had no problems with the camera, easy to point and shoot.  There are many great features on it, my favorite is the candlelight setting, which makes pictures look soft when taken in a dim room.
