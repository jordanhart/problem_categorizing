{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Great Portable Camera", "Author": "Ruth Adamson", "ReviewID": "R390VGWOIXONU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this Sony.  I bought it because I needed a portable camera.  I use a Canon S10 IS but it is too big to carry around on vacation or casual events.  I was wary because the reviews on Amazon were varied but a digital camera review site gave it extremely high marks.  After having this camera for 3 weeks, here are the pros and cons:PROS:The best auto - mode I have seen anywhere. I took pics in Disney world in daytime and low light conditions, indoor and out, and the pictures came out great with no flash needed...ISO adjusted automaticallyBurst mode - press and hold button to take 3 consecutive shots10x zoom - almost unheard of for a camera this smallShutter speed is great, yes really.  But if you are in auto mode and the setting has changed (daytime to twilight for example) your first shot will be delayed while it changes to the new modePortrait mode will recognize up to 8 faces in your picture, great for families or group shotsSony now has a slot for an SD card in addition to their Memory Stick, this was a big selling point for meCONS:Shutter speed for changing modes as above.  You can manually set the mode to bypass that.I have not yet figured out how to stop the preview after a pic. Not sure that is Sony's fault.No optical viewfinder.  They are more rare in small cameras but help when it's sunny out.This camera takes some practice.  Not a lot, but you really do need to look at the online manual to get the best use from it.MY CONCLUSION:Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  If you want a point and shoot that is easy out of the box, there are better suited cameras out there.  If you want a camera that's a few steps up from a basic point and shoot, this one is great if you are willing to take the time to learn how to use it.  Once you do, changing the settings is fast and easy.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Typical Sony camera...GREAT!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "ROP7WOSGUKH6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Sony camera and like the others it takes great pictures. What I mainly like about the camera is the SteadyShot stabilization and the Active mode that is available for videos. Other cameras usually only have an electronic stabilization which doesn't really do anything. Sony's actually physically moves the sensor. Getting up in years, my hands are not as steady as they used to be and at full zoom, taking a picture or video with other cameras at full zoom is very jumpy. Another cool feature is the Sweep Panorama which creates some great shots. Unfortunately the only way I have found to view them in sweep mode is using the included PMB software. Viewing them in a slideshow only gives a static image though. All-in-all, you can't go wrong with this camera.PRO's - Steadyshot, great pictures. zoom rangeCON's - Zoom noise is very prevalent in videos", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony 16mp camera", "Author": "Roy Allen \"rlaj\"", "ReviewID": "R290KP4N9FCW0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera five days ago.

The panorama actually works pretty good and I got it to take a panoramic photo on the 3rd try. The movie quality is outstanding, and again, easy to use.

I use to use a olypmus 10x zoom and a kodak 10x zoom but this little camera in my opinion takes nicer looking photos and is a lot smaller then those other bulker cameras i use to use, I think this camera is a bang for the buck.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Oh so disappointing experience", "Author": "Veese", "ReviewID": "R1W221VYANI375", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Really wanted this camera to be as brilliant as it's described but after using it for nearly a month it just wasn't the case. Really fell in love with the panoramic shot feature which originally clinched the purchase beyond all the other high tech aspects of this camera. But the results were mixed and in the end I returned the purchase to Amazon (Thank you Amazon for an excellent return policy!).I could not compensate for two big photo issues:1) I kept getting a bit of a \"fish-eye\" lens effect especially when I was closer to objects. But even when taking a group photo standing 10 or more feet away, the edges of the image slightly curved off to the background while the center was pulled forward. I couldn't understand why this was happening and it became annoying.2) Camera had a hard time handling bright light or objects with bright colors outside. Other reviews here mention a type of \"photoshopping\" effect they noticed in their photos or odd diffusion. I now know what they meant. Again, no matter how I messed with the settings, and I messed with them A LOT, the outdoor images in sunlight were somewhat hazy. Say a subject in an outdoor shot wore a bright color shirt...that shirt would generate a \"hot spot\" in that area of the photo or a hazy glow. I may be describing it poorly but the bottom line is that outdoor photos were not crisp, sharp or all that colorful. If anything I think the colors were dulled or washed out in end results. In some shots it's almost as if I had vasoline on my lens...diffusing everything in the shot, a la how the \"The VIEW\" is shot.I've seen people comment here that well, maybe the white balance needed some adjustment. Ok, I did mess with that but at the same time this model camera should be able to be used straight up as a point-n-shoot. With today's technology, it's not too much to ask for a 16M digital camera to just give me very good images outdoors without having to mess with settings for every kind of circumstance.Just to say something positive, I was very impressed with the zoom feature of this model. I could stand on the opposite side of a yard, zoom in on a subject, then take that digital image and crop it in even closer and the details were still held fast in the end result.Also, I tried out the HD video once or twice and was pleased with the results of both image and sound. Now I just need to start all over again and find a camera that can put it all together.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Josie \"momofone\"", "ReviewID": "R1YVDQN0GGIUZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried several $150.00 cameras.  That was my \"limit.\"  This one is so much better!  I read a professional review that said this camera was really not good enough for action shots involving animals and kids.  So untrue!  All of the other cameras I have experienced had what I think is called a long shutter lag.  You would hit the button and the picture wouldn't snap for another second - you always lost the good shot.  It seems to me that this one shoots very quickly.  The review said the time between pictures was over 4 seconds.  It was fast enough for me, and didn't seem to be 4 seconds at all.  I love this camera and am very happy to have spent the extra $40 over what I wanted to spend.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H70", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R2BWWTEL0AOP8L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased 14 July 2011 (to replace a Canon SX30IS that I sold after a few months of very unsatisfied use).Though I am definitely only a hobbyist, I am very experienced with photography, film and digital. Now-a-days, most of my photos are taken while hiking/Geocaching.I like the \"In Camera\" guide, it goes wherever the camera goes. Now, when out on a hike and I want to learn about a function... I can!!!  Along those lines, the \"In Camera\" guide is better than the printed \"Instruction Manual\"  but not as good as the online \"User Guide\".When there are more than just a few photos on the card, it takes a fair amount longer than I've previously experienced with other units to arrange them and then eventually display them for viewing.Close-up is focus is slower than I would like. It is common for me to see a bug/insect along a trail where I try to move the camera as close as possible before the critter flies/jumps away. Compared to similar shots I have taken with other cameras my percentage of \"keepers\" is at the low end.The mode selection dial turns MUCH, MUCH too easily. I've accidentally turned the dial numerous times, even while in the process of taking a shot.A minor irritant, for some odd reason, when attached to a computer via USB for downloading photos, the lens pops out, then back in when first turned on.I have more than enough software already on my computer and I did not load the supplied software, choosing to manage my photos by less proprietary means, as I have with my previous digital cameras. The H70, unlike other units, when opened with MS Windows Explorer, sees it as 3 independent drives. What a pain-in-the-axx.Four times (so far) the battery door popped open when pulling the camera out of my pocket or case.The LCD screen has developed a \"spot\" appearing as a blurry dark area, about 1/4\" x 1/8\" in size. It does not affect the digital image but it is an undesirable flaw.A function I really miss is an option to select ON for the flash. The only options available are AUTO or OFF. I've found the AUTO function to be rather inconsistent, for example, on occasions the subject is shadow but the flash does not fire. On other occasions (rather often really) I've been taking photos of scenery, with the nearest foreground object hundreds of feet away and yet the flash fires. I really don't mind so much the flash firing when it does not need to but it's really irritating to NEED flash and yet it just won't fire.Not unique to this camera but it would be nice if there was an option to enter \"If found please contact:\" owner data. i.e. that on start up, the owners Name, phone number/e-mail address, etc. could be displayed.Not my favorite digital camera but I've found it to be an acceptable unit that is easy to use and takes pretty good pictures most of the time. Though my comments may seem overall negative, I really do think the camera is worth the price.Previously owned digital cameras:Olympus xxx (don't recall the model but it was a great camera)Sony Cyber-shot 5.1 mp, 3X zoom - loved itCanon PowerShot S3IS 6.0 mp, 12X zoom - loved it moreNikon L22 Coolpix (wife's camera) - good (but battery door broke)Canon SX30IS, 14.1 mp, 35X zoom - got rid of it after a couple of months use", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Quality", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "RFNKXQAS6SEEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worth the money!There are only two minor problems that I found, easily fixable:1) There is a tiny bit of stretching at the corners of pictures. As an example I took a picture of my girlfriend standing in front of the Eiffel tower. She wanted the entire tower in the picture, so I basically had to take the picture looking straight up (we were at the base). When I tilted the camera so that just her upper body was in the picture, her face stretched. This is due to the fact that the camera has a wide angle lens.If you want to take pictures and focus on a person's face, it works great! But if there face is the size of a pinky nail and is located in one of the corners of the lcd screen (and therefore the lens) expect stretching. I'm sure most people won't find this to be a problem anyway. To fix my picture I just had my girlfriend get closer to the camera, fixed everything.2) Night shots aren't the best, but for a point-and-shoot, there pretty damn good. The first ones weren't always clear, so just press the delete button and try again.Overall, this camera is a steal. The smart camera function works really well and it is a 16 mega pixel camera... for $200! I got it. I love it. Don't second guess yourself!

The H70 model has 16mp and 10x zoom. I liked that I could continue using the same battery and use either the SD card or my memory stick pro duo cards.  However, there is no viewfinder, which made it very hard to take video because of the glare off the screen in bright sunlight. Also, the camera mode dial is on the top, which I find harder to use than my previous Sony. I am not a pro, just wanted a point and shoot. The battery discharges faster, perhaps because of the increased pixels? The video, although stated as 720p, does seem a bit better than the older camera which stated the vidio was 1080p. That was a pleasant surprise; it did help with shooting video of my grandids' sports events.I bought the bundle, it was a better deal. But the camera case is really tight; it does not hold an extra battery unless you jam one in. The case does not have a neck strap either.

I did some research looking for a replacement and finally decided to give Sony a try after doing some comparison shots in the Imaging-Resource web site. The shots taken by the Sony H70 fared really well compared to shots taken by the more expensive Canon Power Shot ELPH 500 HS. I went ahead and bought the Sony DSC-H70 with the blue finish. Right after the first picture taken with this camera I was concerned. Light management was terrible and the picture itself looked bad, not sharp at all. I took more than 300 pictures playing around with all the possible settings in different locations -all in daylight- and I have to tell you, I am so very disappointed with this camera. I am unforgiving with a camera that takes mediocre pictures. I am all for quality pictures. I have been a photographer for well over 40 years and I know a good picture. Call it trained eye or whatever. The best way to describe pictures taken by this camera is that they seem to be processed by a software that makes them look like a painting. I am sorry to say it, but I don't recommend this camera to anyone looking for great quality, sharp pictures. My old Canon A2000is and my current Canon A640 takes wonderfully sharp, natural pictures that put this Sony to shame. Today, I am returning the Sony H70 even though I'm going to lose around 30 dollars for the restocking fee gimmick of Frys Electronics. One last word, it seems to me that the Imaging Resource web site it is not a site to trust when deciding for a camera.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "What else do you need?", "Author": "Phillip J. Klein", "ReviewID": "R1EN2GZP2W9M5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera because my wife didn't want to lug one of our Nikon SLR's around on our recent trip to Spain and South Africa.  It quickly became our go-to camera.After comparing the picture quality of photos taken with the Cyber-Shot to similar photos taken with a Nikon D70 (w/18-200 zoom lens), they are of near equal quality.  The metering on the Nikon is just slightly better, but with photoshop, that doesn't really matter.  Zoom is fantastic and compares to about a 150mm lens on a SLR.  The panorama feature is really neat and gives good quality coverage.  Having the built in movie feature is great.  Photos cannot begin to capture the essence of Zulu dancers.I'm willing to bet in the future that this camera gets used 5x more than our two Nikon SLR's.  I purchased the 16GB high speed memory card and didn't once have to worry about running out of storage.  Having a second battery came in handy.  Leaving the camera on means that the LCD viewing screen is on and that cuts into battery life.

I broke it last year during my senior year of college, and wound up getting persuaded by a salesperson to get an Olympus Stay Tough to prevent breaking another camera. I absolutely hated how it takes indoor pictures; all grainy and the shutter time is very slow. After doing a LOT of research, I finally decided to go back to Sony last week and purchased the H70. I have not seen a bad review on this camera anywhere. I tried it out over Father's Day Weekend and could not be happier with the crisp, clear pictures it produced. I got some awesome action shots both inside and out by the pool. I'm never leaving Sony again!!Pros:*Crisp, clear pictures*10 x zoom*Cropping feature in the camera.

Based on that experience, I had hoped it only got better with the DSC-H70 as a 'purse puppy' for my wife from a local vendor.  Alas, I'm in the 2-star camp on this one, especially against the price.  Compared to my quite dated 'H1', it has all gone backwards.One indoor flash and one lightly zoomed outdoor test shot in good light, both in auto mode, instantly sent me back to the returns department.  The indoor flash shot (actually several of one scene) never focused right.  An outdoor shot of our house in good light looked fine in a letter size print, but at 11x17 that 16mp should support, focus resolution and noise were just not acceptable. A point behind 16mp is preserving resolution in a crop .. unh, uh ... not with this camera.I'm wondering if the pixel wars have hit diminishing returns in small sensors.  Sometimes, less is more.

Porter", "ReviewID": "R19GJFR0E8ACPQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had an old dinosaur of a Sony that took 1280 by 640 photos, max quality. It weighed a ton and was a solid 1/2 cubic foot block of dead weight (or so it seemed). So it was HIGH time to upgrade.  So seeing the wonderful reviews on this camera, and being happy with my previous one in spite of it being outdated, I happily ordered this one!Boy, what a PAIN this one was.  We have incandescent lighting and no matter how many \"auto\" settings I tried, I couldn't get the pictures to come out without them having a yellowish tint to them. On top of it, since we have a large family, the pictures were consistently ruined by one kid or another moving and making a big blurry area. It was terrible!  So I did research and changed some settings on the camera so that the shutter speed and other settings were better. I changed the White Balance to get rid of the yellow tinge (FINALLY!!).  Still, it was very much a pain to have to constantly reset the white balance before I took any pictures. Some of the pictures were still blurry, but it was ACCEPTABLE, barely.  Then I brought it to my new daughter's baptism and I got NOT ONE good picture because of the light coming through the windows. I am SO frustrated.  I would have used my DINOSAUR camera if I would have known that this brand new, almost $200 dollar camera COULD NOT TAKE BETTER PHOTOS!!!!  What good is a camera if you have to be messing around with settings before each one? Who has time to be messing with this before your child's special event, in the Church, etc???  I am FLABBERGASTED by all the 5 star reviews on this thing!So to continue the saga, I brought the camera to Best Buy to pick out a new one... and to see if I had a lemon.  Lo a behold the camera was acting fine THERE, under their fluorescent light... but was still a bit on the blurry side and the colors weren't quite right. Picked out a new Nikon Coolpix S9100 that took excellent pictures in the store, brought that home, and it's PERFECT. You point it at your kids, it takes a picture perfectly. You then point it out the window at the bright light and it adjusts and comes out perfect. Voila!  A camera that works!Oddly enough, I went to Sam's Club later that day after Best Buy and guess which camera I saw there? This Sony one!  And guess what it did as soon as I tested THAT one in the store? Yup, blurry picture and glare coming from the door of Sam's.  How in the WORLD did this camera get such good reviews??!!!  Needless to say I'm returning it even though I'm past the 30 day window and probably won't get my full refund back.  Adios, piece of junk!

I'm pretty good with digital cameras and typically try most of the superfluous features on them - but this camera (Cyber-Shot DSC H70) just doesn't take good photos even with all of the fiddling with features.You will find this feedback point in other reviews, but whenever there is a white object in your photo - such as a white bowl in the center of the table or someone wearing a white shirt in a portrait photo - the white will be severely overexposed and will ruin the rest of the photo (even post-photo touching up doesn't work because the white-wash effect is so stark).  This is a major, major negative.  Honestly, indoors or outdoors, this effect occurs and it ruins pictures.Another aspect of this camera that ruins photos is that there are far too many options for simply taking a plain old portrait photo.  I needed to take a photo for a professional purpose.  I donned a suit and went to a building to have my photo taken with this camera (I'll admit upfront, I should have used something more professional).  We took 20 photos and the background was either far too dark, too yellow / orange, or completely grainy.  If a digital camera cannot take a straight-forward portrait of a person sitting down indoors (with or without flash), then it's worthless.  We had to go outdoors to take the photo, and then the white shirt caused a massive white-wash to occur in the photo which almost ruined it (I cropped the photo to a head shot which was usable).If you plan to use this camera for outdoor photos of landscapes when there is nothing too bright in the field of the photo, then this camera takes good photos.  The panorama function is good and works well.  These 2 points keep me from giving this product a 1-star rating.The auto smile detection, auto skin adaptation, and other bells and whistles are useless.  I want a camera that takes basic photos very well.  This is NOT that camera.I paid $189 (vs. $169).  It's not worth $169 either.  The zoom and hi pixel rating are attractive features, but the photos are grainy and cropping to a small portion of a hi-res photo doesn't look good.  I used to own Sony (T6) and had the memory card which I wanted to re-purpose.  This camera was not worth it.

(So much for using it at a wedding or similar occasion!)The door at the bottom where you insert the card and battery is very weak, in the way it closes.Last straw was, the second week I had it, a piece of plastic showed up in the lens mechanism which was removed by the Best Buy service desk and called, \"A piece of production material.\" ?????

When my equipment wore out and my vision wasn't good any more I lost interest and gave it up.  About 12 years ago I received a hand me down digital camera from a family member who always has to have to best and latest of everything.  It was a nice little camera...simple to use; but with my poor vision it wasn't much fun; and I only used it on a rare occaision; but it wasn't for a hobby.Recently, I was looking for a new camera and, I compared several of the major brands that were priced under $200.00.  They sure have come a long way in technology.  I was able to narrow my search down to 3 camera's and spent much time weighing the pro's and con's of each. I carefully examined the cameras that were in the running for simplicity, quality, function, etc.  It was the large 3-inch screen that finally sold me on the DSC-H70; as well as, the extra features that allow just the right amount of creativity for me at this stage in life.WOW what a difference!

You can actually see what you're taking a picture of and; I have not had any problem with glare or being unable to see what's in the screen when using it out-doors.  I'm still learning about all of the extra features; but it was so easy to set up, and I was able to try it out in no time.  The instructions could be a bit more thorough and perhaps include a comprehensive index.  But the on camera help is good for when you don't have your instruction booklet with you. It is a great camera for the price.  Plus their shade of Blue is my favorite color.Hooray! I don't have to squint or point and guess what's in the photos now.I do wish the camera came in a box-set with all of the accessorries.  If it does, I couldn't find it.The camera came with a corded strap, a transfer cable, a software disk, one battery and a battery charger.I was disapointed in the quality of the battery charger...flimsy plastic which looks and feels like it could easily break.  I can actually slightly squeeze the sides of the charger...it is not made of solid hard plastic like the ones I had seen before; and it does not have an charging adapter for travel use.  The charger did charge the battery without getting either hot.  Take note that it does not come with a memory card.  It does have enough internal memory for 3 photos.In conslusion, FOR THE PRICE IT'S A GREAT LITTLE CAMERA!  It's not just a point and shoot...it has some extra features that allow you to be creative. ie. self-portrait timer, manual operation mode , automatic mode option, plus many that I haven't played with yet.  The extended video option sounds like fun...I'm waiting for my memory card to arrive along with my hard shell camera case that has a memory foam lining so I can start enjoying my new Camera.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for your money", "Author": "R.

The convention is a perfect place to test the camera because the event has a lot of people (live subjects), products on display (still life), and big banners (scenery).  I use only the intelligent Auto setting for all my shots.The camera lens is fantastic.  The pictures that I took of banners 30-40 feet up in the air came out great.  The pictures that I took of figures and other merchandise inside display case are acceptable.  From past experience, I note that the glass and the lighting can be tricky, and distort the shots that I want to that.  But the H70 camera made auto adjustments with the flash, and the shots had minimal glare from the display windows.The camera is very user friendly.  I hate referring to instruction manuals, and the H70 has a button that pulls up the user guide, and allow you to search under terms for the topic you're looking for.My biggest problem, though, is that the camera is VERY SLOW in transferring pictures to the view screen.  Once I click on the button to take a shot, it took approximately three seconds for the picture to show up on the screen.  This is fine if you're taking scenery shots at a leisurely pace. It's horrible when you're taking shots of a cosplayer (a person in costume) who is posing specifically for you. I find myself able to take only two shots for a ten second pose.  I ended up taking shots, and praying that they came out right.  Something is wrong here when my cell phone camera can take photos faster than the DSC-H70 camera.Thus, this camera is a mixed bag for me.

I use it as a point and shoot in 'Auto' mode since I just didn't want to mess with settings on each shot.  And so given that I use it in auto mode, I'm 'ok' with the results but not delighted.  What surprised me was that the still pictures were not as good in quality as with my very old DSC T9 6mp camera, also set for auto mode.  So I agree with many who have said its not really the mp number, but there are other factors.  Regarding the H70, I don't like the long lag when you turn the camera on or off----it takes too long for the lens mechanism to extend to to retract.  And the processing time is very long, so if you want to take action shots, be sure to use burst mode.  The image stabilization feature does work well with or without using the zoom, and the video shots do look good.  The look and feel of the camera are fine, you surely know the mechanical and case design are solid.  I've concluded that to get really good digital shots, you need to spend 400 or more dollars.  This is a good solid camera but it gives only slightly above average results in my opinion.  My old DSC T9 does a better job for me, which as I mentioned, was a surprise, but it is what it is!

The biggest problem is that it has a minimally helpful owner's manual, little more than a Quick-Start guide, and then a myriad amount of on-screen potential directions which lack focus or explanations. My last digital was a 2006 Kodak 6 Megapixel that had less features or power but was infinitely better explained. The menu, preferences and settings have a ton of jargon without any explanation of what the feature is or does, or why you might want to use it. Some of the features are just meaningless abbreviations. I guess one could Google each term and maybe figure out what it was, but what would have been so hard to provide explanations as you explore the camera's features.

I haven't had much time to play with it. Only took a few  trial pictures and they turned out  good for the lighting. The only downfall initially is that although it takes the picture quick it has to think a few seconds before it gives you the picture.  This is as far as I have gotten EXCEPT for the SD card.Something that isn't being said  in the reviews for this camera  and can become an headache if  you are not aware of it is the memory car. You cannot buy any card for this. It takes a sony  card. No other card will work.  I bought a 4g  all purpose card. SDHC and the camera kept telling me to reinsert the card. I called the store up to find out about it and the guy told me Sony takes only Sony.Well, needless to say this presents a major problem because I have 2 other cards which are 2g and they are kodak.  They do not work in this camera as well SO if I  wished to download some of those pictures I cannot do it.What does this mean for me in the end? It means researching another camera and  finding one that will be compatiblie with my kodak branded memory cards as well as any other card for that matter.It really is a shame because from what little I did see of this camera it looked very promising.  I think if it weren't for the memory card situation it would be a keeper for me BUT that becomes a huge stumbling block. BUYER BEWARE!Oh, I gave it 3 stars because I only used it a little bit and it seemed promising but with a major issue such as the memory card I figured this deserves some serious attention and it may end up costing some people unneeded headaches for the future.

I've purchased their products for years.  TVs, DVD players, digital cameras, video cameras, etc.  Before, you bought a Sony and you could depend on a quality product, typically lasting forever.  Those days seem to be gone.I purchased 3 Sony digital cameras for my family and myself.  Last Christmas I gave my mother in law this camera.The quality has gone way down. ALL 3 of these cameras broke including a brand new DSC-H90 that we bought.  All had the same problem.  The screen just goes black.  The same thing happened to all of them so obviously there is some major design flaw.Fortunately on all of them I saved the receipt and they were all under warranty.  I sent them in to the Sony repair center in Houston, Texas.  I have to say I was not pleased with how long it took to get it back.  My last one that I sent in, it took a very long time and communication was poor.  I was dealing with Mr. Vargas out of the Houston repair center.  He told me the parts to fix it were on back order so he said they would send a new camera upgrade.  Only to tell me the next day to forget it and the parts will come in and they would send the old one.I emailed him to tell him my disappointment that ALL 3 Sony cameras I bought in the last year all had the same problem and he admitted that there was a design problem with the motherboard and the engineers were working on it in Japan.The frustrating part is that my camera was in repair and I didn't have it for a vacation so I had to rush out and buy a new digital camera for the trip.  I bought the DSC-H90 and believe it or not, that camera too is having the same problem with the screen going black!Sony should do a major recall on ALL of their digital cameras that are affected by this \"design flaw\".
