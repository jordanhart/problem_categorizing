I bought it to replace an Olympus D-435 that was driving me crazy.  The old camera had a few flaws that I was careful to look for when shopping around this time.  Most importantly, I needed much less shutter lag.  The Exilim takes a picture immediately when you press the button, so you never miss action or candid shots.  It also has a much bigger display screen so you can tell how well your shots turned out right away instead of uploading blurry pictures.  The menu system is easy to get the hang of and there are plenty of settings for many different types of shots (scenery, portrait, candlelight, fireworks, pets, kids, etc.... even FOOD.)  I bought mine in combination with a 2GB memory card and that was a wise choice.  I can now take up to 461 pictures with everything on the highest settings and thousands if you lower it at all, which is great if you don't want to be uploading pictures every day.I have used the camera in different situations and on many different settings and so far all my pictures have turned out beautifully.  I even took pictures while riding in a bouncy golf cart and they are still crisp and clear as can be.I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a small, easy to use digital camera that takes great pictures with little effort.  And it definitely comes at the right price.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice Choice!", "Author": "klmccrary \"klmccrary\"", "ReviewID": "R25I2TQCTUTT2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son asked for this camera for Christmas.

They had a version of this camera.I made the mistake of not checking the version of camera and was SHOCKED when I found on casio's website that this camera's max file size in 10 minutes. not a GB size but a time size? I think this is for youtube compatibility? this is totally regardless of your SD card size. I could have a 32 GB SD card and the camera will still not shoot longer than 10 minutes.[...]google casio exilim ex-z77 10 min file size and you'll find \"Maximum Recording Time per File: 10 minutes\"also when you zoom on this camera it makes a loud clicking noise that shows up in your videos.the fact that the file size is max 10 minutes made this camera useless to me for recording presentations which are usually 30-60 minutes. The picture quality and sound are GREAT but these setbacks lead me to rate it 3 stars. with very small improvements to my two problems it could be a 5 star camera.to see videos using the camera see [...] all my first videos are with this camera. On my hedgehog video you can hear the clicking from when I zoom in.compared to another camera I got, the Sanyo Xacti VPC - HD100 [...] this camera does a great job re-focussing when you move from one object to another or zoom in. It also has  a better on board microphone.

While it did take good pictures, it's a brick now; I'm seeing that \"lens error\" message that apparently happens when the lens tries to pop out but can't, causing the small servo motors to \"smoke\". I've read that this can happen if certain buttons are accidentally pressed while the camera is in your pocket or carrying case.The \"lens error\" is the equivalent of a \"blue screen of death\" on a computer, since it will cost more to fix than to purchase a new camera.Also, before the lens problem, the battery died completely, with no capacity for recharging, so we had to replace that.Going back to my old 3.2 megapixels Kodak...", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lens Error", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Poopsmear\"", "ReviewID": "R1UREG2FY8KIUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Mine broke of course directly after the warranty ran out.

For my next camera(as a gift to my nephew) I compared other cameras..Of the cameras reviewed,  canon powershot A590 was a bulky looking model (but other features were nice)...Fuji finepix z20 had this cheap looking exterior (though again its reviews of product quality was nice)... olympus fe-360 needed a xD card instead of a SD card (I already had an extra SD card). Plus my prior experience of exilim was good pictures, decent video , really compact and did not break your back paying for it. So far my tests with EX-Z77 has proved it to be decent camera.... decent pictures and video quality. I think the voice recording quality was superior in the older model though, I also like the silver frame of the older model...the black one is no great shakes.So overall, the following improvements would really make it worthwhile1) Better voice recording2) Better Frame3) Better zoom range4) Better pictures in low light.Of the current features I like1) Really compact and lightweight too.2) Great LCD3) Value for money4) Decent pictures and video", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera", "Author": "Cassidy5 \"Brennan C\"", "ReviewID": "R2RSM54QNCQOWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased this camera off amazon, had it for a few weeks, and its been amazing.Photos- The photos are great. They come out perfectly as long as your not shaking or moving, but even if they come out ok (with the flash on, without its blurry).Taking the photo- There was only 1 serious problem i found with this camera. When i was at the Celtics parade (for winning the championship) they passed us and we walked around Boston. When we returned, the boats came back, so i wanted to take some quick pics. But when i held down the top button to take it, it took about 4 seconds to get ready, then it took the pic. It happened several times. Then i took a pic of the ground, and it was back to normal. It might have been a one time thing but it was something that i considered a flaw.Computer- The pictures are easy to put on the computer, but they have a lot of kb space. Also, if u plan on turning that pic to your background or screensaver, its not going to look like the picture. Its going to be a little more blurry. Uploading takes a while, but its not that bad.Places to take the pics- This camera can have pictures taken almost everywhere. ALMOST. I went to the Pawtucket Red Sox game last Friday, and i saw Clay Bucholz pitch. I tried to get tons of pics, but when i took em they were not as good as they should be. It could be because it was night, but their were lights, so the mix was not good. Its good everywhere else i've been, and its great at night when its pitch black because you can be looking for people and take a picture of any random place and it shows whats over there... perfectly. It makes a fun game of hide and seek (if you are young).I plan on using this camera this camera for about 3-6 years or more until i get a new one, unless i brake it. This is a great camera, and its one of the best digital around.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dont Buy This Camera", "Author": "Andre Terzian", "ReviewID": "RM6MSRCBSKHE1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very disappointed with this camera for the following reasons:1.
