BEAUTIFUL PICTURES Works fine.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good bargain!", "Author": "Songhai", "ReviewID": "R2HVMU0FUDOW61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bundle is a good bargain.I got mine here on Amazon at about $1720:00.The 70-300mm IS USM lens alone goes for between $400 to $600 that is about 25 to 35% cost of the bundle.The Camera body is about a grand.You are left with $100 to $300 change to buy the rest items which include:1. A Canon 18 - 135mm IS STM lens that goes for $400 to $500.2. The canon bag,class10 64GB Trascend card,battery. These three items will cost you $100 here on Amazon.3.Then you still have the  remote control, tripod, flash, an extra camera battery, battery charger  and the other goodies to buy.Every item here is worth it, even the tripod and filters, I thought would be cheap imitations. The tripod comes with a sleeve for storage and easy carriage.The filters are of excellent quality.I do have the more expensive Tiffen and B&W; for comparison. The memory cards come with their own little plastic bag for storage. Then, you have the USB cables and cleaning kit. Did I leave out the Canon camera bag and the neck strap for your camera?This is a well thought out bundle at a give away price. I have searched online at other sites and I can not find this same bundle. If you are to buy the items individually, you will be lucky if you spend below $2000:00! If you can, please show me where.I highly recommend this bundle, if you can find it. You can not go wrong with this bundle.UPDATE (1/28/2014)Complaint:1.The Vivitar remote controller does not work. This is false.It does work.You have to go to the drive on your camera to set the camera up for remote control.The quickest way to do so, is to press the drive button on your camera after you turn the camera on.This will take you straight to the drive function.Using either the multi controller dial or main dial select 2sec/remote and you are done.Make sure you have the battery on the Vivitar remote correctly placed with the positive face facing you.Press the remote button on the Vivitar remote  and your camera shutter should work.2.An alternative method is to use your smartphone to remotely view pictures on the camera or see what the camera is seeing before you take a picture using your smartphone. First you have to download the Canon EOS UTILITY app from goggle store to your android phone.Follow the instructions on the CD manual that comes with your camera and synch your camera to your phone.If using the app on your smartphone to remotely control your phone, you do not have to go to the drive function on your camera to set it up as you would do in #1 above.Wishing you a happier remote control of your camera!", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them in the future", "Author": "KG", "ReviewID": "R2Y8JQ0M5OB4NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was concerned purchasing a fairly expensive camera bundle on-line however Cameta Camera is an authorized Canon dealer and I was happy with the bundle price and the speed at which I received the gear.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Package with excellent Master in it, the Canon 70 D", "Author": "venkatesh", "ReviewID": "R444F9452I1EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was doing a literature review on the performance of mid-range DSLR cameras for over a Year.From my understanding People who support Nikon do slightly have a Biased (YES) opinion (for ex, its ISO, longer shutter life, two Memory card slots, etc). But I don't agree. If you see on the TV/Media most of the media persons mostly use Canon (YES) very few use NIKON (the Boaster !!!)For best reviews on the outputs just visit: http://www.dpreview.com (The have side-by-side comparison photos of same subject taken using various DSLR cameras, Thanks to their efforts !) There are plenty of youtube videos as well by several experts.One of the reviewers told that Nikon produces slightly REDDISH images whereas Canon produces slightly GREENISH images (although the sensor chips are manufactured from a 3rd parties like Toshiba).It will be sometimes annoying if I (I'm an Asian-Indian with wheat-brown skin tone) take a photo standing next to White men the (Nikon's) sensor somehow enriches the white skin tone and dulls mine (than my true tone). Nobody cared before because most of the so-called \"developed country's men\" are white (things may change in the future !!!) But technically speaking it should be perfect after all the sensor is a semiconductor device, more to do with a firmware instead.Until the launch of 70 D from Canon I was more inclined towards Nikon D7100. But luckily It got released just at the time I had almost decided to purchase D7100.  So I waited again for its review to come. Several people have positively reviewed about canon 70 D with exceptional features like(i) Dual-pixel 20 MP sensor new and amazing !(ii) Built-in Wifi,(iii) Vary-angle LCD,(iv) Phase detection-(Auto-Focus shooting of moving objects)(v) Built in quality of the body(vi) easy operability of the various setting from the touch screen module(vii) High ISO range ++++ etcetera...I bought this through Amazon from the Cameta Camera, USA seller. I ordered it on 25th Nov (Mon) it got delivered on 29th (Fri) when I paid $43 for shipping (In addition to the cost: $1749).  [They should relax their policies to deliver to a Hotel address as well].It was a nice deal compared to others.In addition to the default kit lens 18-135, It included a 70-300 mm lens ( I could shoot the Moon, with the craters seen sharply, using this telephoto lens), additional Battery (a MUST), 64 GB card etc., The bag was little bit old fashioned, though, 'Precision' brand accessories like, the 56\" tripod, external Flash, remote controller (of course I could also shoot with my android phone by downloading an app from Canon,...Guys, it was an amazing experience, I could literally live-view in my mobile screen and control with a touch to alter various settings and shoot images)Luckily I used this camera right from the box during my visit to MIT, Harvard University and during my working at Stanford University in Dec, 2013 (Temperature was below 0 C but I had no problem with shooting using this camera).I'd recommend any one who wish a mid-range DSLR to go for Canon 70 D.--Dr. Venkatesh", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "DEJAIR BRAULIO DA SILVA", "ReviewID": "R3687422APKHX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Boa Noitesim estou satisfeito,.porem n\u00e3o estou de posse da nota fiscal deste produto em meu nomegostaria de receber,obrigado.Good NightYes I am satisfied. however I am not in possession of the bill of this product in my namewould appreciate, thanks", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is perfect and good but all others are worthless", "Author": "Max", "ReviewID": "R2T3FRBPXGGVDA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this bundle with hope to save some money, Flash is worthless and Remote does not even works.
