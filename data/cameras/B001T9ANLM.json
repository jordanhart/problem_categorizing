A++++", "Author": "A. Psarianos", "ReviewID": "R3T7B0QNP9EEK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this DVR system several days ago, at the beginning I doubted the price, because I have accessed several DVR systems from my friends, and they all cost very high, I never excepted a system at this lowest price, but because of the cash crisis, I had to try my luck and purchased this system at about $200, Package arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled time although I selected regular shipping, I am quite happy with it!The camera has 30 IR illuminators which making them for day/night surveillance.I had problem when installing the DVR card to PC. The PC did not detect the DVR card. I emailed the seller and they provide instruction to set the jumpers. Then it is OK to use.One word, I am very satisfied with the system! I recommend it to anyone who need DVR system and look to save money. One suggestion: please do not forget to purchase separated cables for extension, I am so lucky that I got them from my friends.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,329.95", "Features": "4 channel H.264 compression triplex real time industrial stand alone DVR, 1500GB hard drive included\nTwo USB interface, one for data backup, one for mouse operation\nSupport daylight saving time, PIP and EZOOM function\nSupport the live video, parameter setting and copy playback video via network\n3.5\" SATA hard drive (HDD)", "Name": "VideoSecu 4 CH CCTV Security Camera DVR System H.264 Network Real Time Remote View Digital Video Recorder Complete Surveillance System, including 1 Stand Alone DVR with 1500GB SATA Hard Drive, 4 Security Cameras with Audio, 4 Camera Extension Cables, 1 of 4 CH Power Supply, 4 Security Warning Stickers WC8", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LZ9FJsJmL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001T9ANLM"}}
