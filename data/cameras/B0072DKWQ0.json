{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very versatile camera/video recorder, has DSLR like shutter performance, robust automatic settings.", "Author": "austin_Larry", "ReviewID": "R35HG0KUQQWEZF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had many digital cameras over the years both point and shoot and DSLR. Mostly from the names you would expect: Nikon, Canon, Pentax, and Olympus. I hadn't frankly ever thought of Sony for a camera although I have had Sony camcorders that were very good. I have quite enjoyed using the DSC-HX30V as it has provided vibrant photos in a variety of settings. The 30V really shines in the automatic settings. Although you can set shutter speed and aperture, the 30V was intended to be a high-quality point and shoot that uses the built in powerful software to produce good, well-balanced and saturated shots both indoors and out.There are two automated modes: superior auto and intelligent auto. Superior auto gives you the fewest options. There was a learning curve to what is available with each type of shooting. The best thing to do is press the menu button. Depending upon the shooting mode more or fewer options show up both in the menu and for options chosen by the 4 way wheel button. For instance I was interested in trying out the burst continuous photo option. That is not available in the superior auto. But it is available under intelligent auto. The smile detect which does actually work (pretty cool you can focus on a subject and the camera will just wait till it detects a smile then fire a shot) was available in intelligent auto not superior auto. Another example: you can't select an ISO until you are either in program auto or manual exposure shooting modes.There is a built in product manual where you can search by keywords and subjects. This is handy but it was only by trial and error that I found what features were available in which modes. The written manual (fairly sparse overall) and the on-camera version don't list which modes which features work in.Wifi: Obviously Wifi use with this camera is going to be something many people are interested in. I know I was. So far it has been a mixed bag. Wifi to the computer has worked very well. It located my computer and then I had to one time connect to the access point (my Wifi router) and put in the network password. Decent speed in downloads and it will download pictures and video. Downloading to a smartphone. I was very interested to use this feature as you could be out and about say at a child's ballgame and take a great action photo zoomed in way more than a smartphone could and want to share it. I have an iPhone. You need to download the app Playmemories mobile. There is another app Playmemories online but you want the mobile one for sharing with your smartphone. The camera sets up its own network with password. Connect to that network in settings (with an iPhone) and then fairly quickly start the app. Although I get an error message every time that says cannot connect to device it has reliably been connecting and then allowing me to copy photos to my iPhone photo folder. What I have not got to work is video. There are 4 video resolutions and I tried them all. On both the iPhone and iPad. It simply will not download video onto the phone. I am sure Sony is working on this and I expect it to get fixed. It is a nice feature to get to download the photos at least onto a smartphone when out and about.There is so much else going on with the 30V I am going to summarize the pros and cons below.Pros:Extremely fast shooting. I have the Nikon P7000 which I really like but the 30V rivals a DSLR with how fast it shoots when you press the shutter button, especially in Superior auto. You are much less likely to miss a shot.Very nice, well balanced and nicely color saturated shots in the auto modes. I like my DSLR but with a soon to be 2 year old I have daddy duty when out and about. It is often just too much work to be part of the families day AND have a DSLR and have to change lenses.Zoom. I love having a 20X optical zoom. It also has a very good digital zoom. I went all the way to 4OX and shot a small wren or warbler across our backyard. There was still a good amount of light in the photo and you could pick out the individual feathers and veins in the leaves. So I would say yes Sony did make a very good digital zoom once you go past 20X.Size. I held it against an iPhone 4. It is about a quarter of an inch less in length and around the same in width. Much thicker though. Still very impressive.Video. The great thing about digital cameras nowadays is their ability to act as video cameras as well. I have gotten good video indoor and out with extremely smooth zooming (very impressed with zooming while shooting video) and good audio. Just be aware AVCHD is not the best format for social media sharing or even burning onto DVDs. The two 1080p modes warn you that you need a Blu-ray burner to create a disc. So I have been shooting in 1080i mode. It is still very good. I also have software that allows me to change the AVCHD to a variety of other media formats.Good interface. A lot of information is presented to you and changing settings is very simple once you play around with the camera for a bit. You get a variety of options for deleting photos for instance. Delete one, delete a range, delete by day. The interface was well thought out and the playback and screen quality is very good and I haven't even used the highest screen resolution.Decent software. Not the most powerful software but I LOVE that playmemories home allows you to view all of your photos in a calendar format. It is fantastic to be able to go by year or month and see the photos displayed on the day they were taken. And the software quickly found all my photos going back years and added them to the calendar listing. Small amount of editing features but all the basics are included.Cons:Battery is so-so. Just a decent battery. You might want to invest in a spare.Video: Overall this is a pro but right now at least for me I can't get video to share to a smartphone or tablet with playmemories mobile. Also I am not a huge fan of AVCHD for sharing or burning discs. But there are work arounds  for this.No shoulder strap option. For cameras that are also going to be used for video, there should be a shoulder strap option. There is just a wrist option.The 30V does not shoot in RAW but there are an impressive variety of options for DSLR enthusiasts and people who like to expriment with their photography. The 30v is intended to be an advanced point and shoot not DSLR like. That being said it shoots fast which is the one best DSLR feature (aside from a big sensor) I would want in a point and shoot. And the sensor is pretty impressive. I have not noticed a lot of noise indoors and I get around 7.5 MEG photos in the highest quality setting. One thing to note is that you change EV setting easily in ALL modes including Superior auto. And for the DSLR users thinking of a point and shoot Program auto mode gives you a lot to play with including changing metering, changing focus points, changing white balance, ISO control, color saturation level, and contrast control.Overall the 30V is an impressive technological package. It continues to surprise me. For instance I was shooting video and focusing on my daughter and up on the screen it started flashing infant. It knew I was shooting an infant. In the auto modes it identifies the best scene very well. I have taken many great shots in the auto modes and I suspect most people will use these modes the most: the 30V does not disappoint here. I love my DSLR but I frankly use point and shoots more. I know many people don't but I like having a 500mm lens in my pocket and a good video camera to boot. What has really impressed me is how fast you get a shot. This was the missing link for me to really enjoy a point and shoot. Sony did a great job here and I am not missing shots anymore. Even though this is a long review there are many features I left out. Sony/Amazon did a good job though explaining them. From a user perspective this is an enjoyable camera producing well-balanced, well-lit, crisp photos and good video. Add the speed of shooting and I highly recommend the 30V.Update August 23, 2012. The camera continues to operate great. But I wanted to update that I have taken video in many more lighting situations than before. The video is VERY impressive. Crystal clear and fantastic colors outdoors and also very well balanced colors and impressive quality indoors. In fact it is better than any stand alone video camera I have used previously. I shoot video in what Sony calls FH mode. It is 1920 by 1080 at 60i. It is the 3rd out of 4 video quality options and still quite good. Outdoor video played on my TV looks like an HD TV broadcast. And, the HX30V produces the best indoor video quality of any video camera I have used.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "New Sony HX30V is improvement on HX9V", "Author": "Rob Blackthorn", "ReviewID": "R2XE3TBJ0KQW78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the new Sony DSC-HX30V/B yesterday from Amazon.  Like the Wifi module built into the camera.  Tested sending pictures to my Galaxy Nexus and it worked great!  I had the HX9V.  The HX30V/B is faster and more responsive.  New picture effects are ok, not great.  Video looks amazing; better than the HX9V.  Very disappointed that it did not include the wireless battery charger.  As I write this post, it is still listed in the specs on Amazon's website.  Deal breaker? no.  But do not like being mislead either.  Is it worth the extra $20 (compared to HX20V) for the Wifi?  Yes.Likes:- Movie button is easier to start (compared to HX9V) and not lag- When reviewing pictures, very responsive and populates the pictures quickly- Wifi built in with WiFi sharing (camera to phone, camera to tv, camera to computer)- Tog wheel is easier to turn (compared to HX9V)- Display screen is beautiful and crisp.- Improved focus speed and 20x optical magnification- GPS (works great with Google Earth/maps)- Video, for a point and shoot camera, is awesome!  Looks great on HDTV.- Stereo microphones seem improved over HX9VNot a fan of:- misleading advertising concerning \"Wireless battery charging is available with the included multi-station dock\"- added picture effects could be better.  You can alter them on the computer for the same effect.  Would like to see miniature mode for making movies.Great camera!  Lots of features!  Amazing picture quality in image and movie mode.  If you need a new camera, buy this camera.  If you want to save a few bucks, get the Sony HX20V.  Same camera without the Wifi.Peace and much love,Rob Blackthorn", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Upgrade from the HX9V", "Author": "Kal Rubaye", "ReviewID": "R392TBBVGEAQXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved my DSC-HX9v so much that its still in the family, just couldn't bring it to my heart to sell such a great camera; and believe it or not the DSC-HX30v is better!- First thing I liked about the 30v vs the 9v is the buttons on the 30v are bigger and easier to use (dummy proofing of the camera).- I haven't tested the video out enough (review shall be updated accordingly) but it does look nice! and I believe the steady shot is a bit smoother. There is no lag when pressing the record button like the 9v. You can now also take 13 megapixel pictures while recording video without interrupting the recording (This doesn't seem to work with 60P but only 60i).- Macro (Haven't played with enough, but this camera has better macro specs then the 9v).- Pictures are great (I'm no pro) but I have always loved how these cameras have the ability to take quick smooth shots (especially in superior+ mode).- 20x optical is amazing, there is also the \"clear image zoom\" feature which provides further zoom as well as a digital zoom (I Personally have both non-optical zooms turned off).- Panoramas: everyone loves my panorama shots, they are further amazed when they realize its my little point and shoot that made it all happen.- Wifi: I have used the Wifi feature to share photos on my Android Photon 4g as well as my PC (Keep in mind you have to install the Sony Play Memory software on the device you are connecting to).- I was disappointed that there was no charging dock like advertised (I saw a review here that mentioned that but received a bunch of negative comments, I think its a legit gripe because I was disappointed when I opened my brand new camera box and found no dock).- Micro USB connection!!!! This camera was switched to a micro-usb wire for charging and sharing pictures which means I can now use the same micro-usb wire to charge my phone, mouse, headset and camera.- I also like the look of the 30v, it does not have that metal ring around the lens portion like the 9v so it looks much stealthier.- Battery feels like it lasts just about the same as my 9v.- GPS actually functions, my 9v's GPS just couldn't get it going on my trip to Hawaii. This GPS connects quicker.- Flash: what I like about the flash with the 30v is that it comes up flashes and goes back down instantly unlike the 9v which had the flash pop up and stay lingering for a while. (Low light performance is so good that using the flash usually makes the pics worse I noticed)The Camera itself just feels like its more responsive and quicker to the punch then the the 9v.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replacement for DSLR?  Yes and no depending on your needs.", "Author": "Puck", "ReviewID": "R3GO3FPVNPSI6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to write this review for all those angst ridden camera buyers out there.  I was one of you until very recently when I finally pulled the trigger on this camera.  This is more about the use of the camera than the camera itself.Here's my situation which from what I've read, many are in similar circumstances so I hope this helps you.1.  I normally shoot a Nikon DSLR, carry a dedicated sling style bag loaded with a flash unit and a second zoom.  This backpack would also include a few accessories such as cleaning supplies, chargers, wires, a point and shoot camera, a camcorder plus extra disks, plus other \"stuff\".  This bag weighs in at a good 15-20 lbs.  I got the sling style back so i can access and shoot faster than a normal backpack.2.  Enter 2 little kids a 6 year daughter and a 2 year old son.  My daughter was very good at sitting still or waiting around while I messed with the camera, the bag, and the gear.  My son is a completely different story, he needs constant management and supervision to keep him safe.3.  Managing the camera, bag my kids and a now mad wife at the same time became almost impossible.  I simply could not be fiddling with the bag and watch my son who would tear off in any direction without either waling away from the bag, running after him with the bag open, or leaving it to my wife all the time.  The situation got to be unworkable.  The bag was also too heavy and cumbersome when I had to pick up my son which I often do since he's 2.So I needed something small but good enough to give decent results.1.  I looked at Nikon, Canons G series, Panasonic Lumix, Fuji (which I loved).2.  I was looking for the following, lens quality, fast lens for Bokeh, largish zoom, image quality, portability, ease of use, wifi, and HD movies.3.  You guessed it folks no one camera does all of the above, so I narrowed the field to what I truly needed.a.  Minimal size but not so small I can't grip the thing.  This ruled out the interchangeable lens micro 4/3 cameras.  Really if I want to carry little lenses and have a protruding lens I'd just suck it up and carry the DSLR the difference to me was not great enough, if I was going small I wanted to go built in lens.b.  Very good picture quality but also HD video so I would not have to carry a separate camcorder.c.  A big enough zoom so I am not missing a ton of shots, especially since I am with kids and can't run over to everything to get my perfect shot.d.  Last, I wanted wifi so I can upload the photos on the run to a phone or laptop and not have to deal with wires and connections.So I looked at quite a few very good cameras from the listed manufacturers above.  I was really tempted by the Fuji X10.  The controls, size, form factor was fantastic.  Also most of the cameras had better sensors than the Sony.  But the problem was they all had subpar video, non HD, and smallish zooms of 3-4ish times.  Plus no wifi.So the angst began, it came down to this one decision, do I want the better sensor and controls or do I want the better video, zoom, and wifi.  Oh how I agonized!!  I almost went for the FUJI X10, it is an AMAZING camera.  But I had to think about how I will really use this camera.  Am I making larger prints than 8x10?  Do I have time to use all the manual controls with the kids near by?  Am I happy with a small zoom?  Do I have to wait until I get home to connect and upload the computer?Well, I decided what I really wanted is a all in one camera that is easy to carry, has a big zoom, easy to use, has great video, and can upload to my phone.  I sacrificed higher quality sensor, better controls, and a faster lens in order to get \"everything\" I wanted.So here's the scoop on the Sony, I have had it for 3 weeks and went on one vacation with it.1.  You can not beat the portability.  I bought the retro case that cradles the camera and the top half snaps off to shoot, so the camera is always somewhat protected even when shooting.  This is great as it allows me to wear the camera and shoot with the case on.  If I need to do something such as grab my son from the edge of a boat, I can do it and let the camera drop to my waist.  I have no bag, no lens cap, no heavy SLR that becomes a flying weapon if i have to run.2.  This Sony has a few tricks up its sleeve.  I don't have to sacrifice the nice Bokeh effect with a slower lens, it will take 2 pics and merge them into one, this allows a soft focus background.3.  This puppy has a 20x zoom and 40x digital.  It's is simply amazing how far you can reach and it really does cover beyond what my multiple lens do for my DSLR.  The lens is decent with little distortion for casual nor architectural shooting.4.  The video is fantastic, full HD with sterio sound.  Camcorder eliminated.  It does zoom and refocus while recording.  Since i am not a heavy camcorder user this is enough to let me leave the camcorder at home.5.  Wifi, this version has wifi.  It took a little fiddling to make it work with my Droid phone and I am still learning about how it works.  But on my second day of using it on vacation i figured out how to quickly upload all the pics I want to the phone and then on the phone I can Facebook, Instagram, etc.  There is some learning curve but the wait to connect at home issue is now eliminated.  I don't need to carry a laptop with me and there's not even a wire needed to connect to the phone.  The uploads however do not look as great as the originals on the camera, I'll have to play around a bit more with that.6.  Another trick is low light capture, the camera will fire a bunch of shots in succession in low light and merge it into a reasonable shot with out a tripod.  Is it super sharp, no, it is it good enough for a 4x6 or even 8x10, probably.  Best of all you eliminate the tripod and the flash for nice natural low light scenes.7.  Drawbacks?  Still learning the camera, it has a lot to offer and no paper manual included.  The quality is ok for the web and up to 8x10 but if you blow it up on the monitor it simply is not anywhere close to DSLR quality, but I knew that going in.  Looks somewhat like water color effect when blown up.  It might be the auto ISO kicking when, I have to figure out how to control that.Conclusion, this IS the Swiss Army knife of cameras.  High quality, has many many functions, great video, great little specialty settings.  It is not a full size comparable, it does not have as many manual controls as the X10 or G12, however for my situation, purpose, and use it is nearly a perfect solution.Have fun deciding!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony's top-of-the-line compact zoom camera: Zoom, Stabilizer, WIFI, Fast Shutter, 1080@60p, Dual Recording, Panorama...", "Author": "Kiyo M.", "ReviewID": "R1LFO7PF72BW1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's a short version of my review:What I love most about this camera: the zoom, stabilizer, WIFI, grip, panorama, fast shutterWhat I wasn't so excited about: The 18MP quality has a lot of detail loss.Sony HX30v vs Canon S100============================================================Picture quality: S100 Winner (also shoots RAW)Video: HX30v (Before, I wrote the S100 had a slight edge in detail, but HX30v is clearly the winner in video. Canon has this clicking focusing noise issue and exposure flicking problem when it's confused between adjusting to bright or dark scenes. Sony knows video. Most people will find it hard to believe a video shot with this camera came from a digital camera and not an actual video camera. HX30v wins in smoother frame rate as well: 60 vs 24 FPS)Lens: S100 (Max F2.0 vs 3.2 - Focal Length is roughly the same: S100 is 24mm / HX30V is 25mm)Zoom: HX30v (20x vs 5x)Macro: HX30v (1 cm vs 3 cm)Body: S100 is slimmer and more compact; HX30v is better for bigger hands/better gripHX30v motor mechanics are more silent than S100If you want a serious compact camera, go with the Canon S100 (if you also don't mind 5x zoom, 24FPS video, and no WIFI)If you want an all-around versatile packed camera, go with this HX30V, especially if you don't need to shoot in RAW or extremely picky about pixels, don't mind being a little bulky (S100 is slimmer), need lots of zoom, easy automatic modes - it makes it an handy camera to carry.Sony will be releasing a new camera called the DSC-RX100 (although pricey!), which will have a much bigger sensor for compact cameras, to compete against the S100 and micro-third cameras.============================================================I used to work in camera sales and have played with all the latest compact cameras from Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, Fuji, Olympus, and Pentax. The Sony HX series cameras (HX7V, HX9V, HX10V were the old models and now comes the HX20V and 30V) were one of the easiest cameras to sell because of the many features it includes that stand out compared to others. I've been a Canon guy, but Sony has really impressed me (especially with their NEX/Alpha series) and they definitely rank near the top.First things first, A LOT of customers who aren't too familiar with cameras assume more mega pixels means better image quality. This is NOT true. Do not purchase a camera going by that rule. It's a great marketing tool, but get that out of your head! The mega pixels are simply the resolution, which can be good for printing large photos or cropping -- HOWEVER, if the sensor isn't capable of even handling that large amount of pixels then it actually goes against you; it gets to the point where there is no detail and it just looks more like a smudged out mosaic painting. It's similar to a quality difference of an actual optical zoom to a digital zoom; digital zoom is worthless and you want the actual optics to be moving, to zoom, rather than the sensor digitally blowing up the picture. The sensor on the HX30's true EFFECTIVE resolution is more around 9MP and increased to 18MP, so the quality is lost. Cropping at 18MP will pretty much be useless in this case because you will see that the detail isn't there at all and it will look like a washed out painting.The Canon's S100 has an effective 12MP sensor. If you are VERY picky about quality then you'll be happier going with the Canon S100 in terms of overall image quality (in terms of compact cameras, of course - if you want the best quality image you'll have to get a DSLR, or an \"EVIL\" camera such as the Sony NEX 5N with APS-C sensor). The Canon S100 also has a wider aperture at F2.0 (the lower the number generally means it can take in more light) and the Sony HX30V's widest aperture is F3.2. At it's widest angle 25mm, you can only switch between 3.2 and jump to F8.0The image quality comes down to the actual sensor and lens. With that in mind, a DSLR, which has a bigger sensor, that is a lower mega pixel will still have a much better image quality than a small compact point-and-shoot camera with a really high mega pixel.Generally, Canon and Nikon are mainly known for cameras, but Sony has shown that they can compete with them as well, having years of experience in technology. (Sony actually supplies the sensor for Nikon for their DSLR!)This camera is also very user-friendly with its built-in manual guide, the display showing what each mode does, as well as having two auto-modes; the intelligent auto mode is standard, but in Superior Auto mode, it will take several shots and combine them to create the best picture possible.Pros:============================================================- Fast shutter (if you've ever experienced slow shutter delay on lower-end cameras, well, you'll be happy how quickly this thing takes pictures and in continuous shooting mode, it can capture 10 pictures in one second -- at full resolution) - Sony has the fastest automatic-focusing as well.- 20x optical zoom (it's more silent and faster than Canon S100's 5x zoom)- Excellent Stabilizer (zoomed in at 20x and it creates a nice gliding steadiness)- Full 1080p at 60FPS (Canon S100 only has 24FPS). However, you need a modern computer or PS3 to play this back. You can shoot in MP4 (youtube format) at 1080/30 frames and 720/VGA too. 1080p60 frames will be in AVCHD .MTS format. However, see Cons)- Panorama - Again, Sony has the best built-in panorama feature where you easily sweep it across the direction that you want and it stitches it together for you to create a wide picture. Canon still doesn't have this feature and other brands like Fuji and Nikon's panorama assist is no comparison.- Very nice grip - feels great in the hands (not like the puny \"grip\" on the Canon S100)- Dual recording (you can take still pictures while shooting video; however, not in the 1080-60p mode) - But they will be in 2MP - you actually don't need to take a picture while recording; you can always take a snapshot at any frame during playback of the video.- Manual focus area without having to re-compose the shot (however, the Canon S100 has much nicer manual options with its custom ring)- Wifi! - you have to download Sony's PlayMemories app, but once that's done, it makes transferring photos to your phone easy! I thought the WIFI would be a gimmick but if you have a smartphone, it's really nice to be able to send it right away. With the 20x zoom, I can take far away pictures or nice panoramas and immediately send the picture to friends and they'll think it was all done with my camera phone!) - However, the WIFI upload will compress the pictures to 2MP resolution!- Face Detect works really well and there is a also a self-timer to shoot 2 seconds after a one/two faces are detected; it can detect up to 8 faces to correctly focus/set correct exposure on them.- Digital leveler (so that you know your composition is perfectly horizontal and not tilted)- Good Macro- In playback video mode, I do like that you can use the wheel dial to fast forward/rewind frame by frame and fast forward up to 4xWith the Sony HX30V, in playback mode, you can zoom out 3 times; if you zoom out once, it'll display 4x4 rows of thumbnail pictures (16 pictures); zooming out again will display 5x5 (25 thumbnails); zooming out a third time will show a nice calendar display where you can easily select the date/album of the pictures.With the Canon S100, playback will display 2x2 (4 thumbnails), 3x3 (9 thumbnails), 6x6 (36 thumbnails), 10x10 (100 thumbnails) and using the custom front ring allows one to jump between dates(but no calendar display like on the Sony)The Canon is able to display the thumbnails much faster than the Sony.Cons:============================================================- 18MP hurts the quality (the S100 has better detail)- Although 1080 resolution and smoother frame rates, the colors and detail seem rather faded compared to S100- Does not seem to have a trim/combine video editing feature in playback mode (you can with the S100)- No manual whatsoever for video recording (S100, you can lock the focus before recording)- No aperture/shutter priority manual control- No custom self-timer setting; max is 10 seconds or 2 seconds. it can take 1 picture after 10 or 2 seconds; or takes 10 continuous shots after 10 seconds (not for 2 seconds) and shoots 2 seconds after one or two faces are detected. (With the Canon S100, you can customize up to 30 seconds and up to 10 shots; so you can set it to, let's say, take 6 shots and set the timer to 5 seconds)- the \"Custom Button\" next to the dials can only be set for Exposure Value, ISO, White Balance, Metering Mode, Smile Shutter -- but I would like to assign it for other options too like quickly changing the Focus Mode without going into the Menu.- 105MB internal memory, but you cannot record video with it- You must remove the memory card to view what's on the internal memory.- the body and buttons feels a bit more plasticky and a bit cheaper than the previous model HX10/9V; this is also the similar with Canon's S100/S95. I guess they are trying to save costs/weigh less? The dial does feel cheaper than Canon S100's dial.- It comes with a USB-charger, so you still need to charge it through the camera as opposed to removing the battery - it's a separate accessory you have to buy.- Some may find it to be a bit bulkier than most compact-cameras- the WIFI feature does not work for uploading videos- In burst shot mode, you're restricted to a maximum ISO800- When viewing photos, it does NOT allow to zoom in WHILE MAINTAINING PORTRAIT ORIENTATION! It ends up going back to landscape mode even if you're still holding the camera vertically (with the Canon, it will still be locked to the orientation you're viewing it as when you zoom)- Pressing the play button just to view photos will turn on the screen, but if you press the play button again hoping to turn off the screen, it would actually end up retracting the lens instead to start shooting; with the Canon, I can press the play button to view photos and then press the play button again to turn off the screen without the lens retracting out -- minor annoyance. (you can also press the on/off button to turn off thescreen without the lens retracting in playback mode)- The side menu system could be designed/organized better for quicker navigationSome might not be willing to spend this much money for a digital camera, but you really get what you pay for. If you need to shoot in RAW, then this camera might be deal breaker for you. If you don't need the high-zoom/panorama/1080 at 60frames and something a bit more compact, then I would definitely consider the Canon S100.If you don't mind the size, I would also consider the Sony NEX-5N 16.1 MP Compact Interchangeable Lens Touchscreen Camera with 18-55mm Lens (Black).The difference between the HX20V is simply the WIFI, so if you don't have a smartphone or don't need it then you can just get the HX20V.Overall, the Sony HX30V is packed with many features: WIFI, high zoom, fast shutter/focusing, good grip, panorama, dual recording picture - it makes it an all-around solid camera; however, it will not replace my Canon S100. Mainly the minus one-star for me is the image quality and manual controls compared to the S100. The Canon S100 and the Sony HX30V are both fantastic cameras in their own way. In the end, what is best will depend on YOUR needs.I'll try to use this camera more and see if I would love it more than my Canon S100.

Good for static subjects only - you pan the camera as you take the picture and the camera processes the parallax changes of the images to create a nice synthetic 'tiltlable' view. You can preview the 3D effect by tilting the camera and its accelerometers will change your point of view on the synthetic 3D image. I don't have a proper 3D screen to test the depth of it.- The GPS has a 'gps logger' function. I've wanted my GPS cameras to do this for YEARS (since I had a GPS-enabled Ricoh for work purposes in 2007). Haven't had the time to see how much battery that eats up. It produces an NMEA log file under the Private/Sony/GPS folder. The camera logs even while \"Off\" so watch out if you stow it away for a while! It logs Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Time and Heading - but not speed.- I got the bundle w the extra battery as these GPS-enabled cameras can unexpectedly eat up your battery. The extra battery in the bundle is not Sony brand but some other manufacturer \"Premium Tech\" (whatever). Included SDHC card 16GB is Class 10 Sony -brand. USB SDHC reader is USB 2.0- Face detection trigger is nice for self-pictures from a distant tripod. Next best thing to a remote.Cons:- For a medium sized pocket camera, the pictures are good, but the compression artifacts seem to appear at lower magnification than another camera (Lumix) at comparable megapixel/zoom/iso/etc settings.- Moving videos, when recorded in some interlaced mode, show drastic interlacing. every edge looks like a comb, even when the camera has a little of movement.  But while in a progressive scan mode, the edges look smooth but with a ghost, like a trailing chromatic aberration. This however is common of all small-lens HD video cameras I have seen.- The description says \"...and wirelessly charge the battery on the included dock.\". There is NO DOCK and the camera does NOT SUPPORT wireless charging. I don't blame the seller (BeachCamera) for this, just warning other users. I was looking forward to it. Charging is done via a MicroUSB connection to the camera, it does not even include a separate charger. Sony sells the accessory extra charger but given the misleading description of the item, I think Beach should change the price or include a compatible charger in the bundle.-WIFI Sharing to smartphone is a gimmick. You have to connect from the smartphone (iPhone in my case) using Sony's App to a WIFI exposed by the camera. In other words, the camera is exposing its own 80211 access point and you have to connect to that wifi via your phone's wifi settings. Once connected you use Sony's proprietary app (which is really amateurish, it even doesn't keep the right aspect ratios when showing thumbnails) and select photos to copy to your phone's album/stream. BUT now you are connected to the camera's access point, so you have to DISconnect from that one and Reconnect to your main/home wifi or 3G to share the pictures back with the cloud or the world. I would have like to be able to connect the camera to a wifi network and just browse to a NAS and point to a folder and ask the camera to dump things there. I fell for the Sony advertisement on this one.- The sony site has a page for connecting the camera to a Mac but the page returns 404 Not Found!! Even their support staff cannot locate this file. After 1 hour they can't get me to transfer the pictures to a computer via Wifi.- As a general con, I'd say a con is dealing with Sony in general. Their support website is terrible, customer support chatrooms 'fail' when you get to meaningful parts.- The SD & battery compartment door seems almost designed to have gaps open to the outside world. I predict this will be a source of problems with dirt, dust etc.- Not stop-motion! It would be a great feature to add.I may send this back in. I'm sure just for image quality and GPS I can get a better bargain. And not have to deal with Sony.[This review is cross-posted from the bundle I bought the camera with]", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding! Zoom in on windows 7 viewer to bettter see sharpness. Stunning images on 13x19", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R1HIMZMZ1EQZD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with this camera. The results I have seen so far on the computer are stunning. When previewing the images on windows photo view, the image is so large that you actually have to slightly zoom in to see and appreciate the sharpness of the lens. When I first downloaded and looked at sample images I wasnt seeing the sharpness of this lens. Then I realized that the file size was huge, and zoomed in just a little on windows image viewer.  It made a world of difference, the sharpness instantly came forward. 16 mp is huge size for a compact point and shoot with a small sensor. But technology is clearly improving because every photo I have taken thus far, has turned out stunning results. The watercolor mode is a lot of fun as well, and the video quality is the best Ive seen on a point and shoot. To be honest, Ive never really been a big fan of Sony cameras.  Canon has and continues to produce some amazing point and shoots. There were three principle cameras I was looking at after more than a week of searching:  The Canon sx260, and this Sony.  I bought them both figuring id give them both a good three day test run.  I was imressed with the canon, but not nearly as impressed as I was with this Sony. I found the sx260 to be overexposed, in many shots. I used the same setting on program mode, and manuel mode of the same framed shots on both a tripod, and handheld . The sky was often washed out and took on a white look with the canon, (something that can happen with any point and shoot if your not careful with your shot)..but this camera it happened a lot less, which is indicative that Sony got it right when it comes to exposure.20x optical zoom: Theres something that Im not sure if a lot of people realize yet about the zoom on this camera.  Its 20x zoom in the 16mp mode. But, if you turn the size of your image down to 10 megapixles, you are able to get 26x zoom range without distortion (it even says without distortion right in the manual)  On that mode the digital zoom goes from 40x to 53x but the zoom range itself (free of distortion) goes from 20x to 26x.  If you drop down to five megapixels (which will still get you a good quality 8x10 print), your non distortion zoom becomes 36x. At this point you would probably want a tripod, because 36x is a huge distance to cover for a camera this size. I havent tried this yet. But I will.  What I can testify to though, is that the camera takes good shots at 20x outside during the day. I had some good results with a humming bird zoomed in all the way to 20x in my backyard.Resolution: 16 mp.... You can print 16x20 sized pictures with something that fits in the palm of your hand. Its hard to complain about that especially when the photo results are quite impressive for a point and shoot camera.The colors: The colors are great in every shot I've taken. The CMOS senor really helps out a lot in terms of speed.In conclusion, I would rate this an excellent camera. I spent the last week going over camera after camera, review after review, picture sample after picture sample, comparing on a pixel level various cameras. In the end it came down to a choice between Sony's HX1, this Sony HX30v (or 20v without the gps), and canon's sx260.  Every shot I took with the canon in the exact same environments turned out overexposed pictures in comparison to this Sony. This Sony was faster, did better with video, did just as well with color, and had an amazing screen.  So it then came down to a choice between the Sony HX1 and this camera.  The HX1 was in its day a 500+ dollar mega-zoom. It body looks quite similar to a DSLR.  That camera has a sharp lens...but there are two principle things which made this Sony stand out.  1. SIZE of camera body. 2. PRINT SIZE...  Having something that takes great photos with a 16 mp setting that allows you to zoom to 20x distortion free, and a 10mp setting which lets you have a 26x distortion free provides versatility. You really can print a good 8x10 on a 10 mp setting. Ive done it, and the printed photo looked outstanding.UPDATE (After having purchased a Canon Pixma 900 Mark II printer and printed some photos taken on this camera at 8x10 and 13x19.. absolutely Stunning. My final comment if I have one is to not judge the sharpness of the lens by what you first see when you open a sample picture in windows viewer.  Photography blog has some full sized images with this camera.  The image is large, so due to its large size, zoom in slightly, and you will see the sharpness of the lens come forward.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera", "Author": "m. hudson \"mudson\"", "ReviewID": "RM3DE6QRQXCNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera for a day.

For 30 years I have tried to maintain both a \"serious\" (professional) camera (my first being a Canon AE-1 Program) for certain/special occasions and a \"go to\" camera that I can stuff in a pocket/backpack and bring anywhere.  I have discovered that virtually all of the most meaningful photos I possess have been taken on a \"go to\" camera.  The SONY CYBER-SHOT DSC-HX30V completely won me over as a \"go to\" camera with \"serious\" camera quality.While camera preferences vary from user to user, I found the DSC-HX30V to be superb in covering my basic needs:  image quality, zoom range, flash, panorama mode, ease of operation and reliability.  To date, the DSC-HX30V is simply the best \"compact\" point-and-shoot camera I have ever owned.  High speed auto focus and shutter (up to 10 fps), image stabilization and sweep panorama serve to enhance my basic camera needs.  Motion detection and anti-blink capability make it seriously difficult to take a bad picture with this camera.There are a multitude of additional features that are more superfluous in nature, such as Wi-Fi sharing capability and 3D effect.  While I have not fully explored these options, I appreciate their availability. I am enjoying the special effects capabilities of the DSC-HX30V which allows me to play with lighting, exposure and clarity that are more associated with expensive (\"serious\") 35mm cameras.  The camera's video capability has forced my Sony camcorder into retirement.  My only frustration with the DSC-HX30V is that having so many options crammed into a portable device can make a simple point-and-shoot task more complicated than it needs to be and the button-pushing required can be tedious for those with larger hands.  But, the end results the camera produces lessen those frustrations significantly.As with most high-end electronic devices, digital cameras are evolving continuously and at this moment, I believe the DSC-HX30V is proof that Sony's Cyber-Shot family of cameras is delivering a cutting edge product.  It gives me the reliability and compact nature of a simple point-and-shoot picture-taking and video with professional camera capabilities ... I bring it with me everywhere.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera.", "Author": "FlamingoNut \"Tracey\"", "ReviewID": "R23FYWQX0QAJLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 4 months now, and joins my family consisting of various brands: Fuji Finepix 3800, Kodak EasyShare Z5010 , Casio EX-Z550, Olympus Evolt E500 DSLR.  The Casio was my favorite pocket cam, especially when I didn't want to drag the DSLR and it's accessories around and the Olympus DSLR for my serious shots.  I can say I've been using Sony Cybershot camera exclusively since it's receipt, and I truly love just about everything about it.It's a solid, well made camera, a bit larger than your typical pocket cam, but that's my preference; I hate those tiny pocket cams. I've played with a lot of the settings, but am sure there's a few I missed.  I'm a avid photographer, but not privy on the technical side, so I can't go into depths of details about things.Typically, I use the 'Superior Auto' setting.  I tried taking the same picture using 'Superior Auto', 'Intelligent Auto', and 'Program Auto', and really didn't notice any differences.  I'd need to do more research to find out exactly what the differences are between these modes.  'Superior' works well for me.  I love that if I'm taking a picture of a person, it recognized the head, and if it's a flower, it shows the flower logo on the display.The 'iSweep Panarama' mode is cool, not perfect, but interesting.  I took a (close) picture of the plants lining my deck railing and it came out looking like a bent, rounded deck railing.  Another beach landscape picture came out beautifully.  If you take too long to sweep, you get a short picture that's blackened on the end.  After a few tries, you get the hang of it and know exactly how fast (or slow) you'll need to move.The '3D' setting is useless for me.  I took a few pictures with this setting, just wondering how they'd come out.  They weren't viewable, and apparenty only viewable on a 3D TV.The 'Movie' mode confuses me a bit.  I thought I could only shoot a video in that mode, but while in 'Superior Auto' mode, I hit the MOVIE button and it started recording.The 'Picture Effect' setting is really cool.  I played with the different colors, and some of the pictures came out really nice.  For instance, I took a picture of my hydrangea, which blooms are blue & purple mixed.  I set the color for 'Partial Blue' and the picture is black and white, but anything blue shows blue.  Using the 'Partial Green' setting, I took a picture on the beach of my daughter, who was wearing a green & white stripped tank, sitting at a table, under a palm tree, and the green stripes and the palm fronds popped in green while the rest of the pic was black and white.  I'll post a few pics showing this.The zoom is awesome.  Recently on vacation, we were at the Holiday Inn in Ocean City MD, 8th floor.  From the balcony, I was able to get a clear shot of my dd in the water.  Also the dolphins.  I wish I knew how far the actual building was from the water, but I was impressed with the zoom.This camera also takes decent low-light photos, and even though they're not perfect, they're not even close to being blurry, just a bit off color.  My white cat on the brown & beige carpet comes out looking a little yellow.  But the same pic with any of my other cameras always comes out blurry.I rarely use the flash.  Some of my low-light photos come out better (albiet off color) without using the flash.The one and probably only thing that really bothers me about this camera is the placement of the flash.  Habit makes one hold the camera on the top edges with the index finger.  Well, the flash is on the top left hand corner.  When I have the flash on, I have to slide my finger down on the slanted part of the camera to hold it.  Minor flaw, but a huge annoyance.The LCD screen shows crisp images, unlike my Casio EX-Z550.  I particularly like that if I rotate the camera, the image flips with it.  Also, zooming in on particular areas is a huge plus for me, considering I love to take pictures of nature, bugs imparticularly.  The screen itself gets so grimy & dirty that I'm constantly wiping it, only to be filled with more fingerprints.  Another annoyance I don't recall having on my other cameras.  My screen also has some scrapes & scratches on it already, despite me trying to be careful with it.I haven't really used or cared about the GPS feature, although I did finally manage to get it set up and available.I didn't have much trouble setting up the Wifi, but I still prefer to remove my SD card and plug it directly into my computer.  You know the saying about teaching old dogs new tricks...My 12yo daughter has been taking pictures over the last 6 or 7 years and is a decent photographer as well, and I trust her with my cameras, even the DSLR.  She's been using this camera as well and also prefers it over the others, just as I do.  We've both taken plenty of pictures with the Casio that had to be deleted due to blurriness, and have had very that had to be deleted due to imperfections using the Sony.  We both just love this camera.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "softer then the HX9v but faster and wifi works great", "Author": "Joosby C.", "ReviewID": "R4KL9RPAGX4AE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The bottom line on the hx9v comparison in my eyes was that the pics were in fact a little softer on the hx30.  The chip is faster but not of the same quality as the hx9v.  I haven't yet extensively shot lower resolutions but in general as others will vouch for, using a point and shoot at anything over 12mp and you're just pushing your luck anyway.  My quick impression on the few I did shoot at lower resolutions, the pics were stellar and closer to the hx9v, but not it's equal.  a minor issue but I liked the build of the body on the hx9v better as well.That said, everything else about the camera was superior, the general operation was quicker, shots were quicker, video recording was quicker.  the sony menu system needs work but just in general, the experience has been that of an upgrade I am happy I made.  I am in the minority here but I found the wifi option a very nice addition.  The complaints about having to switch your ipad to the camera's wifi network were pointless to me.  When you look at it, there just isn't a way around that issue, this is exactly how the eyefi cards work as well, it's probably an available api issue.  Sony in my eyes has made the experience as painless as it possibly can.  Would it be more advantageous not to have to switch wifi networks?  obviously yes but givent hat's not feasible, it works great.  I found it ridiculously convenient to be able to send a few shots to the ipad or iphone when on the go to quickly post to facebook, texting or something like that.  I also without any problems, loved the feature to wifi send and offload images to my home desktop when at home.  I could have just been lucky or maybe I am network savy enuf, but for me, everything worked as advertised on the wifi front.  a 20$ premium for the wifi has been a no brainer upgrade for me.  I get home and just in a few menu options, send all the pics from the card to my pc to where I can do what I want to do with it.  usb charging is great as well.  the gps is also much better.end of the day, with adjustments, the pic quality gap can be narrowed quite a bit to the hx9v which by most accounts, was the industry standard for the best of the best point and shoots available. the gap that is most definitely there in pic quality for me was blown away by the other upgraded features to the point that I do feel this is a great upgrade.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera.", "Author": "Coug Moog \"s_gil\"", "ReviewID": "R3M08S6I780GCT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Upfront I'm gonna tell the truth; I returned this camera. Not because it's not great; just because it's not great for me. I tend to shoot more close up, indoor and low light stuff with my point and shoot and my S95 with its 10MP sensor so completely outperforms this new Sony in those situations that it didn't make sense to make the switch. This is mostly because the S95 and S100 have much, much better lenses in low light (f/2.0), and they can output a RAW file. The Sony is a bit noisy, so that it is acceptable only in situations with pretty good light. Once you have to bump up ISO the noise (typical in P$S cams) gets so pronounced that Lightroom can't do much with it. Plus, although Lightroom can do a little to denoise and sharpen a .jpg file, it can't get it to look as good as a RAW file. So if you post-process using Photoshop or Lightroom, you're probably not looking at this camera.Now, to those daylight situations:Wow.White balance, aperture and speed decisions in the semi-auto modes are really, really good. Sony's barrel distortion algorithm seems to be perfect--I can see no artifacts of the long, long zoom in image distortion. Image stabilization is very good--my carry cam doesn't have anywhere near this zoom reach and will once in a while kick out a soft photo. This Sony, as long as you are doing your job, will give you tons of sharp pictures. If you lean toward capturing distant subjects, the telescope on the front of this camera is very nice, and in good light its limited aperture is obviously a non-issue. It outputs quite beautiful color. Long zoom means you need image stabilization, and this one does a remarkable job at full extension.My bottom line was that I'd really like to keep this camera; it does a lot my S95 will never do. But the things the S95 can do better just happen to be the things I do the most. I can't afford two point-and-shoots of this quality, so this fine camera goes on to another happy user. If you're reading these reviews then chances are you're looking for a small cam with a big zoom, and don't fool around with post processing.If that's you, then this little Sony is state of the art and I can't imagine being unhappy with it. Just know that for this amount of money you will not get big zoom and big low light performance out of the same lens. That's not a complaint but a nod to optic reality. Sony's done a good job with its in-camera .jpg encoding, and you get all-purpose sharpening and denoising that is as good as any other $400 camera currently on the market.If you're a point and shooter who wants a pocketable long zoomer that outputs really beautiful .jpg images, this camera is one of the best, if not the best out there. It's kind of expensive, but to get a 20x optical zoom to fit in your pocket requires a certain amount of somewhat costly miniaturization. I'm glad Sony made this camera. It should find a great following.Now, if I were looking for a super zoom (and didn't need it to fit in a pocket) I'd probably go with the Canon SX40 HS with its 35x zoom lens. The thing's got a mini Hubble telescope hung on it out there; the very definition of 'stalker cam.' Out of the box, the SX40 HS doesn't shoot RAW. But since it's a Canon, you have the CHDK (Canon Hack Developers Kit) community. With CHDK for the SX40 HS installed, you can shoot RAW and do a bunch of other things Canon usually makes you buy a more expensive camera to get. It's $70 or so cheaper than this Sony and with CHDK installed it's a much more advanced machine, ready for full Adobe post processing of its images. Yep, it's bigger and bulkier, and doesn't feel as...fancy...as the nifty Sony. But it can take some incredible long distance shots, in RAW. Try doing what the SX40 HS can do with any other $350 camera, and you'll be back to buy the SX40 HS. Everybody makes a superzoom P&S;, but only the Canon has CHDK.It's a killer setup, especially in daylight. Once again, I'd buy one of these cameras but I can't justify two different P&S; cams in my possession.The Canon is a good all-around camera if you install CHDK, and if you can handle the bulk. Sony still has the edge in pocketability of this much zoom range.Bravo, Sony, wish I could use ya.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is what it is.

I find that it's almost hard to take a bad picture with it.  Detail and color rendition are superb.This camera has a mountain of features and capabilities.  I confess to not having the time to explore all of them.  Generally I set it to \"P\" (Programmed) and shoot away.  It does a great job.  They have programmed it right in that I rarely see \"noise\" in my photos and things are rarely if ever blurry.Oh! The built-in Anti-Shake!  Worth it's weight in gold!  I zoomed out to 20X at the beach and hand held these usable pictures of a seagull probably 400 feet away.  The Anti-Shake (what I call it) also works very well for the movies.  It may be a large factor in why I get a much higher percentage of clear, usable pictures on this camera compared to my old Fuji A70 (God bless it, it's gathering dust now..).Taking pictures using Manual setting:  Occasionally I will set force flash (Always On) or No flash.  It's easy to do.  The fill flash this camera provides is very natural looking.  I have (once or twice) raised the the still sensitivity (ISO rating) to 3200 / 6400 and turned off the flash.  It gets a greenish muted Rembrandt look - but I'm not complaining.  Even at that sensitivity the rendering \"noise\" is at least smooth and even.  It's still a usable, recognizable photo even if it looks like an artsy impressionistic dream.MOVIES:  Movies are very very good considering the scope of this camera and price point.  What is REALLY cool is that when you zoom, the focus tracks / refocuses very quickly and there is no motor noise on the * stereo * soundtrack.  While this camera is capable of 1900 X 1080 60frame per second progressive output, I generally take the movies on the \"lowest\" (ha!) quality setting which is 60i 1440X1080  Reason?  \"Shareability\" tied to sheer size of the data output.  I can still fit a 7 minute movie on a CD to mail to relatives at the bottom quality video setting.  It still looks pretty good on our LG 60\" plasma.  Anything above that resolution setting is pretty much best streamed from a hard drive or, if you do snail mail (USPS), plan on sending a cheap USB drive to your relatives.  (Some of the 8GB drives are down to $5 bucks now on Amazon.)MINOR complaints:1. I confess that I get lost in features or menus sometimes and simply power cycle the camera to get out of it all.  It works.  It may be humiliating but it works.  : )  I simply don't have the time it would take to understand the absolute plethora of features this camera has.2. If it is brightly sunny, you'll find yourself shrouding or shielding your eyes so that you can see the screen framing and readout.  It's an annoyance with most modern cameras and this is the * one * place where a DSLR outshines this camera.  HOWEVER..... * THIS * camera is quite pocketable.  It's not micro but I have not problems putting it in a standard shirt pocket or front pants pocket.3.  When you open the battery hatch cover it seems a bit fragile.  I see that complaint on a lot of cameras.  What is more of a concern is the little blue colored, retractable, plastic retainer \"footie\" clip thing that holds in the battery.  Be very gentle when you toggle this to release the battery.  It's a design that works but you're dealing with a delicate piece of engineering there.  Common sense and good judgment.OVERALL CAMERA BUILD QUALITY:  Superb.  The lens resolution is very crisp.  Color rendition is excellent.  The lens is marked as a \"Sony Lens G\" but I think they've been learning a LOT from Zeiss on their nicer cameras.SUMMARY:  This camera is NO slouch on quality. For what I paid (around $310.00 on a Xmas special) I feel I got an awesome deal. The pictures generally all look so good, I have to sometimes force myself to delete some of the similar near duplicates as I can't decide.  We upload pictures to Shutterfly and the 8X10's look fabulous.  I don't need anything else, this suits me just fine!  Sony must know they have a winner here as the price is now $100 more.  It's worth it!If I lost this, I would mourn and buy another one immediately.  It's that good.ACCESSORIES I BOUGHT:Class 10 (data transfer speed) SDHC flash memory card  SanDisk 8GB Extreme SDHC Class 10 High Performance Memory Card (SDSDX3-008G-P31)  $18.68 as of March 2013.  Don't buy a Class 4 or 6 card as it will make your save times longer.  Also, be aware that there are many bogus SD cars out there that \"say\" they are Class 10 but are rebadged or misrepresented Class 4 or 6.  Buy from a reputable brand and vendor.Case - Sony LCSCSU/B DSC Carrying Case  $13.50  Very good case for very little money.  While it has a strap, I used the belt pass-through.  It works GREAT! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00336EHAM/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  Highly recommended.Spare batteries and Charger:  Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony  $22.99  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049XR5MK/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  Works as good as the factory battery.

Usually my pocket camera has been a Canon compact, but I wanted a longer zoom and none of the \"S\" series of bridge cameras have done very good when I tried them--plus they are too big.  So after seeing some posts about the low light performance I took a chance on this one.I couldn't be more happy with it--it is not a replacement for a DSLR but is a near perfect travel camera.  What has most surprised me is it can take clear pictures at the full 20X zoom, often in cases I thought a good photo would be impossible.  But there is a requirement to make this magic happen--your subject has to be still.  This is because the HX30V uses a lot of post processing to clean up the image, and in some cases there is a little of a \"computerized\" look to things.  But in general I've gotten unbelievably sharp images even when shot from a bouncing car.The other features are there that we almost take for granted--HD movies, scene effects, and so on.  It has a 10 frame per second burst mode--but only for one second before it has to write the images to the card.The night photos for a compact are very good--but for best quality in scenes lit only by streetlights it needs to be shot from a rest as the shutter speed drops to 1/8 second or so.  In normal indoor lighting the photos have nicely saturated colors and are sharp.There are a few things I wish could be better; if it had an EVF for sunny days, was a little smaller as it's at the outer edge of convenient pocket size, and in general had an overall faster operation.

I can't get over how great the video looks both on the camera screen, and on an HDTV via HDMI.  Clear, bright, smooth.  Other reviewers also commented about the great video of this camera, but I was expecting it would just be the best among small cameras.  However, I have an HD Sony video camera and DSLR with HD video, and neither of these will get used for video anymore because the HX30 has better looking video, greater zoom power, smaller size, and easier to use.  I'm not easily impressed, but this camera has done it with its video capabilities.HX20 or HX30?  I was split between the two, and didn't know if we would use the Wi-Fi function of the HX30 enough to justify.  Turns out it works very well, and great to show pictures on a Wi-Fi enabled TV to visiting relatives (note Wi-Fi works with photos only, not video).  Takes just a bit to set up the initial connection between devices, then works quickly in future uses using just the camera, with no scrambling to find the cord.  We like this feature and have used it several times already, so glad I went with the HX30.  If you can live with a cord to connect the camera, or don't have many Wi-Fi devices, the HX20 would be perfectly fine.Other Likes:+ There is now a separate video button, so no more fiddling with the dial to select video, then fiddling again to take stills.+ 20x zoom is great - Sony does a good job removing the jitters and keeping the picture clear.  Their 'Clear Image Zoom' is also great and allows additional zoom with less reduction in image quality than other cameras.  For example I get 53x zoom (when set at 10MP picture size) with acceptable image quality.  Rather amazing.+ 3D panoramic photos are neat, and show up well on a 3D TV when wearing 3D glasses.  Not something I'm likely to use often, but fun. (Note 3D images do not work with Wi-Fi, so I have to use an HDMI cable to view these - as I do with video.)+ Nice Screen:  Some cameras only have 2.7\", which is noticeably smaller than this 3\".  Also the quality of the screen is very good with very clear images.Dislikes:- Pop-up flash:  Always tries to pop-up under your left index finger which is the only place to steady the camera.  This is the biggest annoyance we have with the camera.- Battery life:  Noticeably less than our 3-yr old Sony compact which uses the same battery.  This is probably aggravated by us taking more video than we did with the old camera.  But in any case, I'm glad they didn't change batteries from our old Sony so we have a back-up.Overall - a great higher-end compact camera.  It replaces our separate HD video camera, and fills in for our Nikon DSLR on short day trips when we don't want to lug the DSLR gear around but still want good photos and video.

When the flash pops up to take a picture, great, but it doesn't go back down.  You are not supposed to push the flash down, so you have to turn the camera off so it will retract.  Second, when you just want to view your pictures, it works great, but when you turn off the display, the camera goes on without me pushing the ON button.  I don't want to take pictures; I just want to view pictures!  Seems goofy.  Lastly, the WIFI transfer from the camera to my Droid smartphone leaves a lot to be desired.  You only get to see them in the phone's Play Memories app when the camera is talking to the phone.  As far as storing the pictures in the phone's photo gallery, you can SEE them, but when you press on a photo to view it, it won't display...all you get is an icon.  Good luck with that feature.

I initially gave it a 3 stars, saying it was an update over my DSC-HX9V but not great in terms of noise.Now that I have used it for a few days, I must say I am blown away.1. Simplicity: The iA+ (intelligent auto plus mode) is just amazing. The decisions it takes regarding ISO and shutter speed are dead on in most cases. I have ceased to experiment with the other modes now.2. Versatility: I bought this as my travel camera (upgrade to DSC-HX9V). At home I mostly use my Canon T2i with external flash, lenses etc. which is way superior in photos. However, this camera (DSC-HX30V) has blown me away in terms of its versatility on low light and home situations. So I use it (and expect to continue) use it more at home as well - I prefer to not use the flash and get amazing pictures with it.3. ISO/Noise/Processing: UPDATE (May 26 2012) A little noisy. At 100 ISO its noise level is about the same as my Canon T2i at 1600 ISO. At normal viewing sizes, the photos look stunning at ISO 100-1600. However, even at ISO 100, if you view the photo at full resolution (1:1 cropping) the amount of processing is a little disappointing. However, the fact that the Sony's ISO goes so high and usable up to 3200 easily is pretty impressive. Even the 6400 and 12800 settings are useful under a bind - a noisy photo is ANY DAY more preferable to me than a blurry or totally underexposed picture.4. Zoom: Wow. Simply wow - I am blown away at how sharp the photos are at 20X optical zoom. Pin sharp. Very noticeable improvement in optics, very little distortion at wide or fringing at zoom. The 40X clear zoom is useless to me.5. Size and feel: Perfect. Solid metal feel.6. GPS and compass work pretty well.7. Video is quite awesome in both picture and a huge improvement in sound (compared to DSC-HX9V).8. Fast! Quick on, quick focus, quick and natural feel to zoom.9. Battery seems to last a long time.10. WiFi: UPDATE (May 26 2012) \"Send to Computer\" via WiFi feature is awesome. As soon as I am done taking pictures or back from an event, I hit play, and \"Send to Computer\" and put the camera way - if my MacBook Pro is on, the camera automatically pushes all the pictures to it into a date folder it creates automatically, and turns off after sending all the new photos. Very convenient. The second useful WiFi feature that is useful is playing photos on TV (most modern TVs that are connected to the home network, WiFi or ethernet). The 3rd feature is mostly a gimmick - viewing the photos on the iPad, as you have to connected the iPad to the camera instead of the home router. But the first two features are very useful, making the WiFi support of the DSC-HX30V over the DSC-HX20V definitely worth it for me.11. Missing Sony wireless charger. What was that all about, Sony? I was disappointed as I like cool features and a wireless charging station would be so cool. However, I got over it. I have 3 total batteries and all is well.12. Beach Camera bundle was awesome.

The record button for starting and stopping video recording is slightly recessed and not easy to push to start/stop recording with my big fat thumbs. I just wish Sony would allow you to push the shutter button to start/stop recording when you have the dial set to video mode.2. With track focus enabled it is sometimes impossible to get the camera to take a photo. In some cases I will keep fully depressing the shutter button but the camera will be measuring and focussing  while I just wish it would take the damn photo.3. The hx30v seems a little sluggish to me compared to the hx5v/hx9v. I feel like the camera needs a processor upgrade (in comparison to the previous models).4. The flash is a big improvement over previous models but still not great. Flash photos always seem overexposed in auto mode.On the positive side. The camera overall has a ton of nice features. I love the wifi and gps features and the quality of photo is superb. You probably do not need 18.2 mp but the camera sure does capture a lot of detail.

I've been on the lookout for the perfect companion camera, one that I could take along on most occasions without breaking my back and still deliver good photos.In a nutshell, the HX30V is not the perfect pocketable superzoom, but it gets about as close to it as current camera offerings as of Summer 2012. The zoom range is a very useful 24-500mm (full frame equivalent), image stabilization is the best I've seen in this category of cameras and photos are very pleasing right out of the camera. Speaking of image quality, Sony is infamous, on their small-sensor cameras, for their watercolor appearance when viewed at 100% magnification on the screen (pixel-peeping, as it were). The HX30V is no exception, but in real life no one should have a need to pixel peep anyway. When viewed to fit a screen up to 2560x1600 this isn't an issue, nor when viewed on a TV screen.The HX30V also features built-in Wi-Fi acting as its own access point, allowing photo transfer to a smartphone even when not in Wi-Fi range. This feature requires a free smartphone app, available in the app stores.I've never used its GPS capability, so I can't comment on it.PROS:1. Very fast autofocus acquisition given the camera type. On par with the better m43 cameras, but still short of phase-detect AF used in DSLRs.2. Very pleasing photos out of the camera, generally not requiring post processing.3. Good dynamic range for a small sensor.4. Decent low-light image quality due to multi-frame stacking to eliminate high ISO noise5. Exceptional image stabilization, even when zoomed in all the way.6.

It does not shoot pics in RAW, of course, but it has surprisingly good noise reduction, good low light performance, good color and contrast for a point and shoot camera.  Controls are responsive, and the image stabilization is good enough to make free-hand shooting at 15x to 20x zoom feasible.  Part of this comes from the image stabilizer itself, and part from the camera's ability to take shots at high ISOs to keep the shutter speed high.  There is some real distortion in the lens (for instance, there is VERY noticeable pincushion distortion when shooting wide angle shots), but this camera doesn't pretend to compete with interchangeable lens cameras like the Sony NEX-5N 16.1 MP Compact Interchangeable Lens Touchscreen Camera with 18-55mm Lens (Black) (see my review), so I can live with it most of the time for casual pics.This camera really is sold as a high end \"feature-camera,\" though, and that's where it delivers for the money.  This camera is absolutely chocked FULL of gadgets, starting with the super-wide 20x telephoto zoom, to image special effects, panorama modes, 3D modes, a GPS module that stamps images with location data, and a built-in WiFi access point so you can attach an iPhone or iPad (among other things) to the camera to offload photos.  Frankly, I'm a bit surprised to say that most of these gimmicks are implemented pretty darn well, and I find I both use and enjoy using a lot of them.Physically, this camera is a delight to hold, sturdy and well built, with good fit and finish - much more practical and easy to handle than micro-portable cameras like the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX55 16.2 MP Slim Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.3-Inch OLED touch screen (Black) and its ilk (again, see my review of that camera if you're interested).

Yea, I don't buy cameras that often.I compare the results of my HX30V with my Dad's big SLR NIKON, most people will not see the difference and I can put it in my pocket.What's really great is the ability to eliminate the back light problems. (only in superior auto mode)By the way, I grew up around cameras and got bored.  This thing got me interested again.There's so much on this thing, you might not use them all.  It helps to know a little about cameras, just don't be so picky and enjoy.

You'd think I was standing next to the singers. The pictures were crisp and only required editing because I wanted the colors to pop a little more than they already were.It fit into my pocket and over the course of a 2 hour concert I took around 1200 pictures and 20 some videos (approximately 7.20GB total media) and never had to change the battery. It works great with or without flash and I really love continuous shooting in sports mode, especially in the concert environment.

The detail and color is pretty impressive, certainly much better than my older Canon which of course it should have been.  It is easy to operate and the various settings are all I should ever need.  I have not shot any movies yet; but I generally do not use this feature much preferring still shots; nor have I used the 3-D setting. I have also not printed any pictures yet, just downloading my images to my computer.  I did shoot some free hand night shots last night; and the results were pretty impressive. I cannot wait for a \"full moon\"!The camera is very light weight and small; it easily fits in my small purse or a jacket pocket which I had already expected. The 3\" LCD screen is fairly visible in bright light but I was still hoping it was a little bit brighter.  Also when I try a vertical shot, the LCD screen gets more difficult to view.  I haven't figured out why yet.  It does not have a separate optical viewer but I cannot use that feature anyway since I cannot see close-up anymore without my glasses!  I am not a camera expert and just enjoy \"point and shoot\" with most of the options readily available which this camera does very well.

I was looking for an upgrade over my Coolpix camera and after much research, HX30V seemed to be the best compact camera with DSLR features.  I am not a professional nor do I claim to know how to use all of the features on this camera, but there are many to learn.  The options are vast, picture quality is very good, video quality has been superb.  I especially like the ability to take pictures while recording video.  The panorama mode is very easy to use and takes great pics.  The 3D mode is intriguing, but I haven't viewed pics on a 3D screen yet.  The blur-background mode so far has been rather worthless, but you can do focusing yourself and remove the need for a \"mode\".  Battery life so far has been quite good, shooting around 100 pics and about 15 minutes of video at a hockey game only took 1 \"bar\" of battery life (non-consecutive with constant turning the camera on and off).  The auto-modes for picking settings for pictures have been rather flawless so far, but much customization is possible in manual and programmable modes.However, a few issues have arose through limited use.  As you will read elsewhere, the flash is in a terrible location.  It is natural to hold the camera on both sides of the camera.  But when the flash pops up, I find myself forgetting where it is and it pushes my finger out of the way.  I fear breaking the flash motor or dropping the camera altogether.  I'm sure with more use, this will become less of an issue.  Just annoying.Also, one of my first uses outdoors, I found the camera to work for a little bit, then froze.  I'm assuming it was the cold air that did it, but I had to remove the battery and replace it in order for the lens to go back in and the camera to turn off.  I have not had this problem again despite more cold weather use.  I not fear how sensitive and fragile the camera may be.Finally, I have been having problems with the wifi function.  Either the camera won't connect to my computer, or freezes after connecting and uploading a picture or two.  I have only had success with this process once.  Granted I haven't used it a lot, but I would say I'm about 1 for 5 or 1 for 6.  Not to mention, it only remembers 1 wireless network and 1 computer.  So if you move around and are expecting to just connect to wireless anywhere, expect the set-up time for wireless connection to take as much if not more time than just connecting a cable.  Honestly, for the trouble I have been having so far, I find it much easier to just connect the camera to the computer using USB or just removing the card.  This feature costs around $100 more to have, and I haven't found the worth in it yet.  I haven't given up, but if I could go back, I wouldn't have wasted the extra money.  Part of this extra expense is a result of GPS function.  I don't use it, and don't find beauty in it.  So that can be an extra consideration for those that may use it.  I also have not used it to connect to my phone yet, but my expectation is that it will be about as good as the wireless computer function.Overall, I do love this camera, and I definitely got an upgrade over my coolpix.  The pictures come out clear, the image stability has been very nice, the video with full zoom (optical and digital while recording) plus the ability to take pics while recording has been excellent, functionality and options are more than enough for me.  All of this added up makes me very happy with this camera.

You can download the PlayMemories App for Apple or Android platform of your choice and then connect your phone/tablet to the camera wirelessly! The whole process doesn't take very long and it is REALLY cool. I usually download by the date and look for all pics on that day. Once you do that, the app comes up with all pics shot on that day and lets you select the ones you want to transfer to your phone/tablet. This is extremely cool and really ups the wow factor of this camera even more. If you think \"I can already do that with my phone\", think again! This camera will run circles around your phone's \"camera\". No contest.2. I was asked a question about the tripod mount and yes it does have the standard tripod mount \"hole\" (sorry, I don't know the technical term).3. This camera is FAST! The Zoom is amazing! I visited SF last Saturday at the Farmer's Market and I tested the zoom out. It zooms in literally within seconds to subjects well over 100 ft. away in just a few seconds. Also, the time it takes to turn it on to snapping your first photo is literally about 3 seconds. It's that fast! I have never owned a camera that can operate that quickly. This is really another huger benefit for those pics you want to take but only have a few seconds to take them.-----------------------------------------------------I bought this Sony Cyber-shot camera for my wife for Christmas and have had a chance to use it with different settings and in different lighting situations. I've owned other cameras like the T-50 in the past, and I have to say that Sony has really outdone itself! Here are a few things about it which are awesome:1. Quick shutter time - this thing is fast! 1-2 seconds between shots.2. shoots in low light situations -I actually took a picture of a night light with fairly accurate lighting and detail!3. Use SD cards instead of Sony proprietary - nice.4. It has sweeping panorama - cool feature that takes a little getting used to but the results are amazing! No manual stitching anymore!5. It's has WiFi - no cables!6. You charge the battery by plugging in the camera, and not taking out the battery - much like a cellphone.Overall, it's a great camera with a vast feature set. And to top it off, I bought it for around $300! That is just icing on the cake!

After returning both for poor performance we fell in love withte HX20-V but it didn't have wifi.  I couldn't imagine spending $350 on the same size camera and not being able to wifi the pics to my iphone/ipad so I can send them to all our family.  So we bit the bullet and ordered this one.CONS:Setting up the wifi was a bit cumbersome at first.  Once you get used to doing everything MAC and it is so seamless, maybe it makes me a bit lazy when I have to disconnect from regular wifi to connect to the app and share the photos.  Here is the process:Download the Sony Share app FIRST while you are connected to the internet: THEN, configure the wifi and you are able to share photos.  Once the initial password is setup it's always there which is great.  The other plus is you do NOT need internet to transfer your photos to your iphone or app since it's a straight wifi connection.Flash is weird because I keep putting my finger over it when it tries to pop up - getting used to it though.The charger is located on the bottom of the camera? So you have to gently lay it on it's side while charging, weird.PROS:The quality of the shots, the usability and functions of the camera are well thought out.  We have a 4 year old Cannon Rebel XTI with all the upgraded lenses and I've been shooting my kiddos all day and my wife and I CANNOT tell the difference!I love the night/low light shots and I am not kidding they are just incredible.  This is the smartest AND fastest camera I've ever used for this size and I tried falling in the love with the Nikon and Panasonic with the lower price tag but I couldn't justify keeping them with such poor quality shots and such laggy zoom features.  The low light photos don't turn out cheesy so speak and when you are ready to snap a photo you do not lose the moment with a delay like the Nikon and Panasonic in the same price range when trying to actually use the 10-18 x's zoom they advertise.  My mom's Cannon is a close second but this camera is simply amazing.  Best purchase we've made in a long time.I couldn't end this review without mentioning the insane quality of the video! It will blow you mind how amazing the video quality is and also how smooth the video transitions from zoom/non zoom at such a high quality.  The stabilizer that's built in somehow makes your home movie look extremely professional.  I would guess this quality would have cost you $2000+ in a camera maybe 5-7 years ago.Sony got it right with the HX30V.  I was nervous about the price tag but it's worth every penny.

None seemed to be the right one, until I bought this Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V.  The pictures just turn out great!

I have also been quite pleased with the inside photo shots I get (my house is dark and it seems to adjust the auto setting accurately to get a good shot).Couple of things I found out:  the camera likes authentic \"G\" batteries.  I have several \"generics\" I have purchased on-line and when I try to use them I get an error message.The flash readiness is not super duper fast, but is slower if you don't use a charged battery. I was trying to use old batteries from some of my other Cybershots and I noticed the difference on the flash readiness speed from the new battery that came with this camera and the old ones.  So I have already gone on line and ordered another \"new, authentic sony\" G battery (Amazon had the best prices).

Ishizue \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2M7MUQ40PP4ME", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the DSC-HX30V hoping that Sony addressed the one glaring weakness that was apparently ignored in the DSC-HX9V product design - namely audio recording quality for video. But before I discuss that in detail, I would like to note that for my use, I was hoping that the 24 mm minimum wide angle focal length in the HX9V would be kept since this was very useful for close range indoor shots. Unfortunately, it appears that Sony decided to extend the maximum focal length (16x to 20x) at the expense of the minimum wide angle (25 mm). The low light performance has also appeared to have declined a bit, as well. I would have also liked to have seen Sony increase the 1/2.3\" sensor size to compete with the larger 1/1.7\" sensor used in the Canon S100 for improved image quality (this specification has more significance than the total megapixel count, which is a marketing ploy for the unknowing camera buyer) which is especially noticeable when printing photos 8\"x10\" or larger. That being said, I generally agree with the other reviewers' comments about the improvements, so I will not re-state them in my review. The main reason why I purchased the HX30V was to hopefully get better audio quality for my HD video use. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The HX30V still records audio with the same low audio recording bit rates (128 kbps for mp4 and 256 kbps for AVCHD), which translates into highly compressed audio. This is what makes the audio almost un-listenable when played back on a full range system. Live music sounds very thin and distorted while human voices sound very \"tinny\". I suspect that Sony purposely avoids using uncompressed PCM audio (or even superior audio formats such as AAC) for the sake of conserving available memory space, but at the expense of audio quality. I've only owned 1 other camera that had outstanding uncompressed PCM audio (Canon SX1 IS), so it's definitely not impossible. However, that camera does not have the HX9V's strengths in the image stabilization and low light performance. Even the Casio EX-ZR100 has better audio (less audio compression and uses the superior AAC format), but does not have Sony's noted strengths, either. I just hope that in time, Sony will make audio recording quality less than an afterthought in product design For a sample to demonstrate this, watch my YouTube video, \"Sony DSC-HX30V versus Casio EX-ZR100\". Update 5/25/12 - When I contacted Sony Technical Support on this matter, the Rep told me that the audio sampling rate is fixed and cannot be changed. This is very disappointing for those looking for CD-quality audio in their video recordings. Update 5/26/12 - To put this camera to the audio test, I tried shooting video at a local karaoke night club that I knew would test if this camera was up to the challenge when it came to demanding audio. As confirmed, the audio recording was no better than the HX9V. In fact, the recorded audio clipped so badly that it was un-usable for post production editing. As with most AVCHD and mp4 that I've used, the most noticeable areas that the camera struggled to accurately record was from the low bass to the upper midrange, especially at higher volumes. In comparison with the audio recorders of the Canon SX1 IS and Casio EX-ZR100 cameras and the Olympus LS-20M and Zoom Q3 HD PCM digital audio recorders, the HX30V was not even close to matching them in terms of being able to record studio-quality audio. The best way to describe how the audio sounds is like the sound from an amplified telephone speaker. There is no reason why Sony could not design this camera to match the amazing HD video with CD-quality audio. I suspect that they figured that most buyers would not pay much attention to this critical area of product design to a point where it became an afterthought, as stated earlier.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Softly fuzzy pics forced me to send it back", "Author": "S.

Amazing how a company like Sony could introduce a camera in this price and capability range and leave those modes off. I first looked at this model at Fry's in Sacramento when looking for a walk around camera. I shoot with a Canon 50D DSLR normally and consider myself a semi-pro shooter. Not one Sony at the time had these modes - and every other vendor comparable cameras did have them. Prior reviewers write that these are settings the beginner does not need - and for a beginner that wants to stay a beginner I would agree.Most purchasers it would seem to me would want to move up one day to a DSLR, or, be able to have the flexibility to learn more controlled shots with Aperture and Shutter priority modes with whatever point and shoot they purchase. My niece has this camera and has asked that I show her some of the techniques I use - but the best I can do is how her how to overcome the lack of these modes in other ways. A beginner should be able to move in the direction that the more advanced camera they may one day buy would afford them. Also, if going to a school or reading on line tutorials, traditional and long time uses of these modes would not work with this camera.I finally purchased a Canon 260SX for my walk around. It does a great job - and with most every other camera in this class, has Manual, Shutter, and Aperture priority modes. And finally, Sony has seen the light and includes these modes on the latest model -- their HX50V. Unfortunately, they still do not have a RAW format so that's a bummer for a pro that wants a walk around.So my recommendation is that if you could care less about ever moving up with a camera or learning photography past point and shoot -- this would be an excellent camera.

The x20 zoom is awesome; the camera starts up quick and focuses right up. Loaded with features (that I really never use) offers cross between tiny point-and-zoom and a hybrid camera. The case is solid and feels like it can withstand a drop or 2, which in my case, has been tested and the test passed. The LCD is great and very clear. Movies look and sound great on big screen TV. Wifi does not work on a mac and the GPS is slow and takes more juice so I don't use any of these features. Camera has lots of shooting modes and does pretty well in low light. I prefer the Intelligent auto vs. Superior auto mode, think the superior auto looks more grainy, especially when magnified. The original battery lasts very long and is highly recommended over a non-OEM replacement.I've had this camera for 1.5years and it's still working great. Dirt got in between the lenses once but Sony replaced the whole lens assembly under warranty.

You'd think Sony would spend a few bucks developing and supporting a robust application for a high quality camera, but that is simply not the case.

It has exactly every single feature I wanted and even more features I didn't know I wanted.In a new camera I required: Excellent low-light, Wi-fi, panorama, movies, compact, high zoom, reasonable price, and high picture quality of course. There were a few other cameras that matched most of my requirements but I was not about to budge for lower quality.I wasn't so sure about the price but I found a great deal here on Amazon for a used camera. It has a few scratches but works BEAUTIFULLY!The zoom is crazy awesome! I was at a convention recently. Standing way in the back, I zoomed in on the men on stage, at 75x zoom the picture began to look like watercolor, but that's still amazing!The picture quality is brilliant! You can easily leave it on Intelligent Auto if you desire, it picks up on the exact mode needed rendering clear, beautiful pictures.For low light, the High-Sensitivity mode is marvelous!!! Around 10:00pm I took a picture of my dark living room, there was some light streaming in from the dinning room, but the room was very dim. I set the camera on High-Sensitivity, it looks as though there is sun light streaming in illuminating the entire room!The background defocus mode is a definite added bonus! I love my DSLR but I can't take it everywhere and I don't have the money to buy extra zoom lenses. This mode truly enhances my pictures to look like they came from my DSLR.This compact camera even has Program and Manual mode! I have yet to use these but I plan on utilizing these modes.I wish it had a view finder but not a necessity for me.Setting up Wi-fi required looking on-line for assistance, once I got it all set up, it's a breeze! I haven't connected it to my computer yet but I've sent plenty of pictures to my phone through Wi-fi.If you have not done so yet, I recomend you look up the pictures and videos of the moon this camera can take!

McWhorter", "ReviewID": "R3Q7KRPUVCAVR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this preliminary review after getting the camera and putting it through its paces. My first impression is that this is a great camera. I took the camera out of the box, snapped the battery and a memory card in, and went and snapped a picture of one of my Peacocks on the camera's default settings and maximum zoom. I uploaded the photo to the amazon product page above. In my mind this is a very impressive picture for a point and shoot camera on default settings. The focus is sharp, the colors brilliant, and excellent contrast. The camera also has low digital noise, resulting in sharp beautiful pictures.What I liked about the Camera:1) Takes brilliant pictures2) Default camera settings give excellent results3) Movie camera takes excellent full HD video, reducing or almost eliminating need for separate camcorder4) Easy to navigate menus and I was able to utilize all features of the camera without reading instructions.5) Feels like a well made product.6) Functions as advertised.7) The camera does surprisingly well in low light conditions, without the flash. In fact, I suggest you will get better pictures by turning the flash off in the menu.8) The zoom function is smooth and intuitive. I found it easy to hit the target amount of zoom precisely.9) The LCD display is SUPER sharp.10) The Wireless sync and picture transfer works and I got it hooked up without reading instructions.What I did not like about the Camera:1) It did not come with a memory card. I wish they would include even a small one so you can play around with it out of the box without having to hunt down a card.2) LCD display is useless outdoors. This is a common issue with these point and shoot cameras. They no longer have a viewfinder, and outdoors you can not see the screen. So, you point in the general direction of the subject and hope you get something in the frame. If they are not going to include a viewfinder, I wish they would have some sort of readable screen that can be seen in sunlight.3) Not sure what value it is to have a GPS in a camera.I have given this camera a 5 star rating based on my preliminary work with it. The rating is because it produces excellent pictures and lives up to its advertisements. My major concern with the camera is the size and price. It is bigger and heavier than what conveniently fits in your shirt pocket. I am not sure the extra bells and whistles overcome the drawback of being larger. The Canon Elph series of cameras take excellent pictures and fit easily into your shirt pocket, and at a lower price. I prefer the advantage of the compact form over the added features of this camera. If you want the added features that this camera offers, like built in GPS and 3D capability, you will not be disappointed. I will admit that the longer I use this camera the more I appreciate its enhanced functions. I am about to decide that it will be my primary compact camera!Bottom line is that this is another excellent product from Sony, and one you will enjoy using.REVIEW UPDATE - 5/31/2012After using this camera for some time, I have gained a few more insights into it. First the more I use it the more impressed I am with the picture quality. The pictures are simply stunning and the best I have seen from a digital camera.Now for some new concerns. The WiFi upload is not ready for prime time. As I started trying to use this feature regularly, I have found that most of the time I can not upload pictures with the WiFi. When it does not work, you get a cryptic error that does not allow you to debug/troubleshoot. Hopefully we will see a driver update or software update that makes this feature more robust.Also, if you plug the camera into the computer, the camera tries to force you to use the Sony software to transfer the images. I spent the better part of a day trying to force it to just act like an attached USB drive, like the Canon cameras do. I finally got it where it would not launch any Sony picture software, but then I found that the pictures appear to the computer as Read Only Files, so if you are using Picasa, you can not erase the pictures when you upload to computer. The camera does not play well with Picasa, as the camera would prefer you to use the Sony image software. In the end, I broke down and just used the old fashioned technique of taking the memory card out and plugging into the computer. This appears to work as expected with Picasa or other software packages. Finally, I could not get the feature of \"Display Pictures on Your Smartphone\" to work with my Samsung Galaxy. I could get the camera and phone linked over WiFi, but camera refused to send the pictures giving me some odd error messages about my country of origin.So yes, there are some nuisance issues with connectivity, but I am willing to live with them given the stunning quality of the pictures.Update: 6/19/2013I have been using this camera for over a year now. I have a Canon Rebel, Canon Elph, and various Fugi and other digital cameras, but I must say that this Sony Cybershot is my go to camera. In a variety of conditions, it simply takes the best pictures.

Everything I've read had me believing this would be the camera for me...This is supposed to be a dramatic upgrade from an old Canon Powershot..

Upclose pics of people and things have an odd fisheye effect which I don't like.Primarily I want this for pocketability, quick portraits around the house, bird shots in the back yard, landscapes.  I knew I wasn't getting DSLR quality here but for a couple hundred more I could have bought a Sony RX100 which would get me that quality..Unfortunately the RX100 does not have as powerful a ZOOM lens...Which is where this camera has shocked me.  The extended digital zoom is noteworthy.  I can see feather detail from 50' shots in daylight... A zoom lens for a DSLR might cost me as much as this camera..I'm also still trying to figure out the wi-fi transfer feature.  It won't link with my PC or Ipad..

It took beautiful low light photos, in fact the photos were brighter than the actual lighting at the time.  The sun had already set and the photos look like they were taken at dusk.  The zoom was incredible, as I was able to get close up photos of petroglyphs that had to be a half mile away at minimun.  They looked like I was standing right next to them.  The colors are vibrant and accurate in bright sunlight and low light.  I also did a few short videos and they look fantastic, though I haven't viewed them on the TV yet, so still waiting to see if they are true HD.Cons: The only thing I noticed that may be a negative, is the panoramic photos have a distorted appearance.  This may be normal, as I've never had a panoramic camera before now.  I was also disappointed that one of the batteries I had from the camera I was replacing wasn't recognized as a compatible battery.  I have no idea why, nor how to correct the problem.  The other battery that I had works just fine, so at least I still had one spare.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this camera.  I purchased this to replace a Sony H10 that had a bad CCD.  I was able to get a replacement part, but unfortunately the capacitor (I think) slipped as I was reassembling and shorted out on the shutter button.  Oops. :)  One dead camera.

I know a lot of reviews have this as a difficult task, but it really wasn't.

An aggressive, un-defeatable noise reduction incentive has been added, perhaps to offset the inherent and unavoidable accumulation of noise that results from cramming WAY too many pixels (20M/pixels) onto the HX30V's tiny sensor. Photos are reasonably sharp and richly hued but only upon normal viewing (PC); at full scale, the pictures are horrendous! However, he defocus effect is absolutely sensational, as is the HDR, and its capacity to capture images in dimly lit situations is second to none in its class.

I'm still figuring out if the problem I had was resulting from a bad memory card or the camera itself.First, it started having difficulty reading the memory card (or even accessing it), making one of my photos disappear--gone, completely.  Second, after that incident, it would alternate back and forth between discovering and not discovering the card.  The card can be read perfectly by my laptop.Third, after that, a photo that a family member had taken looked quite skewed on the outer edges, looking like it was taken by a fish-eye lens, even though I had used the auto shoot feature.The first few months were wonderful with the camera giving me DSLR type images.Because on/off switch opens and closes the lens with a motor, the battery seems to drain rather fast if you're constantly turning the camera on and off.I hope I have more nice things to say after I see what happens with the fish-eye and memory card problem; such a healthy investment.----I'm updating this as of 8/3/2013.  A month or 2 ago, the screen developed what looked like a half-moon shape burn in each of the photos.  I thought it was the screen, but then in appeared in every photo.

Sitting in a pavilion with many rows between you and the stage kind of does that to you.  Trying to take pictures with a low end point and shoot camera results in an image of something that might, just might, resemble the artist(s) that you had paid good money to go see and wish you had some pictures (or video) to remember the event by.Thanks to a credit card that offered me free rewards, or at least greatly discounted items if I used my reward points on them (and added some cash/credit to the purchase), I was able to pick up Sony's equivalent of a camera I bought later, the Nikon Coolpix P100 (Nikon Coolpix P100 10 MP Digital Camera with 26x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)) which seemed to be the camera that I saw some other regular concert goers using.  Looking over at the LCD display and seeing the results of that camera's high zoom (26x Optical Zoom) and also watching the nice flexible LCD panel angles that could be achieved (pull the display out, then flip it to any angle that is needed to be able to see the display even as you hold the camera high above your head) made me, well, a little jealous of the equipment that the nice concert seat neighbors seemed to have.  As jealous as I was of that camera, I wasn't really in the mood to quickly toss too much of my disposable income towards purchasing one, at least not without perhaps considering and trying Sony's equivalent first.With the reward points and such that I had available, I was able to get the Sony DSC-HX1 (Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1 9.1MP 20x Optical Zoom Digital Camera with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 Inch LCD) at a pretty low out-of-pocket cost, figuring that even if I found it lacking, I could later still go back and get the Nikon if I wanted.Those two cameras (the DSC-HX1 and the Coolpix P100) are very, very comparable.  Honestly, I've still not really chosen a favorite between them, though I suppose I lean a little more towards the Sony since it was the first \"nice\" camera I had purchased and started using.  In reality there are things I really, really like about that Sony, and things I really like about the Nikon, so choosing between them just isn't easy.  Eventually one of them is destined for my daughter, while I'll keep the other for my own uses.Later, while realizing that I'd kind of like a nice pocket size point and shoot that still offers fairly high zoom, I wound up buying my then fiance a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K (Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)) that I seem to recall showed up as a Gold Box special (refurbished I think) at a very tempting discount.  That camera is very nice, does easily fit in a pocket, and yes, it does offer a pretty nice level of zoom-ability, but still left me tempted to perhaps eventually go back and snag another Sony camera with some more reward points when possible.Here I am now with a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V in hand and I'm left, well, not quite completely satisfied.  The HX30V has some very neat features, and I can see where I'd easily be happy using it regularly, but I can just as easily see myself still wanting to lug either the HX1 or the P100 around when possible.  The biggest advantage, for me, to the HX30V is the size.  While it's a little large, it will still fit in a pocket. I say large, I guess I need to clarify that to \"a little thick\".  It is not an ultrathin camera.  Honestly, given the high optical zoom, I know it just isn't possible to get the \"body\" to a super thin size.  There has to be room in the body space for the lens to be able to retract and later be extended out as needed.  Unfortunately, that big advantage is a little blown because of that thickness.  With the P100 and HX1 not seeming to be that much bigger, or that much heavier, I look at the HX30V an question whether I'd really want to favor carrying and using it regularly.That leaves me looking to other features that the P100 and HX1 lack, at least natively - the Wi-Fi transfer mode that the HX30V offers.  That is definitely an area where the HX30V shines.  Use the Sony PlayMemories features and software on a phone or tablet device and you can easily work with the pictures you've taken on the camera no matter what smart card you've installed.  Hmm, that opens up a quick tangent where I can note that I do really like that the HX30V uses \"regular\" SD memory as opposed to the Sony specific (Sony 4 GB Memory Stick ProDuo MSMT4G/TQ1 (Black)) memory (that tends to be a little more expensive than SD memory cards).  Anyway, returning back to my point, with this camera you don't need an Eye-fi card (Eye-Fi Pro X2 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-8PC) as you can instead rely upon the camera's own built-in Wi-Fi functionality.The camera itself comes loaded with a PC version of the PlayMemories software.  Simply connect the camera up via the USB cable and you'll find the required software on the \"drive\" that shows up on your computer.  It really is nice and easy, just as the software for phones and tablet devices is.The question for me is whether that feature is enough to make me look past other things I really like about the P100 or the HX1 and I think my honest answer is not so much.  I love the \"viewfinder\" window that the HX1 and P100 offer me.  Turning off the standard LCD display and using the viewfinder window offers me privacy in what I'm taking pictures of and really takes me back to old school style photography, back in the days when viewfinders were the only way to line up the photo.  The image is, of course, very small, but well good enough for me to know what I'm taking a picture of without lighting up the LCD for everyone around me to be distracted by whatever happens to be showing on my camera's screen.I am glad to add the HX30V to my arsenal of high zoom cameras, and really may come to absolutely love it over time, but I'll have to get over my few complaints first and grow, perhaps, a bit more frustrated with the size and heft of the HX1 and P100.One quick thought about this particular camera package, at least in the standard sales configuration - it does not include a memory card.  Buyers will want to pick up one of their own choosing.  With SD memory cards as inexpensive as they've come to be, that doesn't add all that much to the cost of this item.  On the other hand, I'll probably sound like I'm being incredibly greedy just as I was somewhat dismissive of added cost a moment ago, when I say I think it was a bit silly of Sony not to include some sort of small camera bag with this camera.  Of course they did the same thing with the Playstation Vita (PlayStation Vita - WiFi) where you have to purchase an accessory kit separately that includes a nice Neoprene case, but it is a bit frustrating to have to go find a case to keep the camera in so help keep it from getting dusty, or keep the LCD screen from getting scratched up.  With the suggested retail price on this camera, the few extra pennies that a bag would add to the cost seems to be a sign of Sony cutting corners or being incredibly cheap on value offered to their customers.Final results/recommendation here: not a bad camera at all.  Certainly very useful and nicely featured for someone that doesn't already own a high zoom camera that they already favor.  Purchase with confidence and expect to be satisfied if you buy one from Amazon. :-}", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stick to the HX20v", "Author": "Mark Steiner", "ReviewID": "R116JK0W93KURK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera itself is great.
