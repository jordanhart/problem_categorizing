I took it to my son's officer school military graduation.  All was fine until noontime on a sunny day when the squadrons were on parade.  Trying to take pictures outside, I discovered all that I could see on the screen was my own reflection.  I could not correctly aim the camera as the event unfolded.  There is no viewfinder.  I had pictures of the tops of peoples heads, the ground, etc, because I couldn't see what I was aiming at.  Later I called Kodak.  They suggested the beach setting, the snow setting, etc.  Nothing made a difference outside in sunlight.  I liked the camera very much, but because I take many pictures outside, I was forced to return it.  If only Kodak would add a viewfinder like my previous Easyshare DX 4330 had.  Reviews I had read did not mention this problem.  Most of my inside pictures were fine.  I also bought the dock, which I now cannot use, and rechargeable batteries.  The camera would only work in the dock with the battery pack that came with the camera.  Even though the camera itself will work with Kodak rechargeable batteries, the dock cannot sense it unless the dual pack that came with the camera is inside when you want to transfer pictures.Kodak EasyShare C813 8.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not overly impressed and I wanted to be!", "Author": "S.

The time between the button press and the actual picture being taken is almost nonexistent. The camera uses AA batters, however after all the pictures I have taken, I still have not had to recharge my 2500 mAh Ni-MH rechargable batteries. Not to mention the picture quality being much better than I had anticipated.When I installed the Kodak Easyshare software that came with the camera, my computer froze several times over the first three or four days I had it, forcing me to restart it several times.

They've been sitting there for 10 days and I doubt Kodak will pick them up. Kodak is not honoring their warranty. I even bought a new one from a camera store and it didn't work either. At least I could take that back to the store and get my money back. Kodak is a horrible company to try to deal with. I finally filed for a charge back on my credit card for the cost of the two cameras. Too bad. It used to be a good company.Update! I finally received two cameras that actually work! Just in time to cancel my chargeback. I did spend $35 for a rechargeable battery and I have to admit that works best, but it does take 2 AAs as it should SOMETIMES, but not always.

When I opened the camera it didn't work correctly and instead of just trying to return it to the store I followed the instructions inside the package stating that I shouldn't return the camera to the store and instead should contact Kodak support. HUGE MISTAKE! I was directed to send the camera to a repair facility (at my own cost I might add) and told they would fix it and send it back. I received a letter from the repair facility stating that they couldn't fix the camera and that Kodak would send me a replacement camera. Kodak indeed sent me a different camera; one that was refurbished and a different color. I specifically bought the camera because it was pink as I already have a silver one. I called Kodak customer service which was another joke. I could barely hear or understand the people. In addition, I was told that they had no pink in the C813 so I was out of luck. They told me the had a cheaper model C713 in pink that they could send me instead. I asked for a refund since this isn't what I had originally purchased and they told me they couldn't do that, that only the store I had purchased it from could've provided me with a refund but since I followed their instructions (sending the camera in for repair), I no longer have the original camera to return in order to get a refund!!!! I looked on this website for a refurbished C813 in pink and what do you know, they have one!! When I pointed this out to the guy on the phone, he told me that this website and the warehouse where they were sending my replacement from were two different entities and therefore I still couldn't get the camera I wanted. So in the end, my options were to either keep the silver one that I didn't want or suck it up and take the cheaper one in pink. I really wanted a pink one, so I'm out the $10 price difference, the difference in camera features and the original cost of shipping the camera for repair. They did arrange for UPS to pick up the old camera at their expense, after I told them I wasn't paying to return a second camera. I guess the moral of my story is that if you buy a camera that doesn't work, insist that the store you bought it from take it back; DO NOT send it to Kodak for repair because who knows what you'll end up with after all is said and done!!UPDATE: So the pink C713 I was suppose to get never arrived; instead they sent me back the Silver C813. Obviously the communication within Kodak stinks because they thought I sent the C813 in for repair! They returned the camera with a note that stated \"we found your camera to be in working order....\" when it was in fact suppose to be exchanged for the pink one. AGGGGGHHHH!

The only small issue, is that you cannot see the screen in the sun. BUT, just point and click and the pictures were perfect!  And that only happened in a few of the pictures taken.  There is a setting for bright snow and it worked great.I am not a seasoned photographer, just a person who loves to take pictures to capture memories. Easy to upload to facebook, kodak easyshare or your local store for online developing. I would definitely recommend it. At least, give it a try before you believe all of the negative comments.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little 8.2MP camera for the price", "Author": "Dana Jones", "ReviewID": "R39X48RNZ7OTBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Still getting compliments on this snazzy little camera a year after I bought it!

I like the camera and think it does a good job overall. As with most products, there are some positive and negative points to mention:The LCD screen on the back of the camera is very user-friendly... it's very large so it's easy to sight in your subject. On the other hand, as someone else pointed out, it is often difficult to take shots on a bright sunny day, because the image you see in the LCD screen is almost \"washed out\" by the sun's glare. Sometimes the prints I get back from these shots look over-exposed, but usually they turn out all right.The camera has a light exposure function but it's rather awkward locating it and using it. Plus, when you stop it down for less light and then take the picture, the light exposure returns to its normal wide open position and you have to manually stop it down again for the next shot. Another thing that's very important: look to see whether the date stamp is turned \"on\" or \"off\" in your camera. Because if it is \"on\", all of your photographs will have the date printed in big, bright gold numbers at the bottom of each picture. And the date CANNOT be removed once the shot has been taken, not even with photo editing sofware. So if you don't want the date stamped in big gold letters on the bottom of each photograph, then be sure to turn OFF the date stamp function BEFORE you start taking pictures. I took some pictures of landscaping once with beautiful flowers and shrubs and trees, and the date is on every one of them in big gold letters right across some of the most beautiful parts of the photographs... a real BUMMER!I gave the camera 4 stars simply because the vast majority of the pics I've taken have turned out very well. They are very sharp, and the colors are incredibly vivid and true. Plus, I like the fact that the camera is so small you can actually put in your shirt pocket.

This camera does not take good night pictures of lights [like Christmas] but fulfills all my other needs year round.  Two things I would suggest purchasing are Lithium batteries as Alkaline are not long lasting in the camera,[copper tops don't work well at all], and a larger SD card. The lithium batteries I put in last year are still going strong and I purchased a card for a few dollars on line which holds 300 pictures.

I was always reluctant to go to the digital cameras, as I always prefered film - and the suprise of the prints that comes with them. I had my C813 for about two weeks when the first day that I took it out beyond taking a few pictures around the house it stopped powering on. Now I have to wait for a replacement and am a bit dissapointed in that. Not cause I have to return it - but, I got my mother a C613 and right when she took it out of the package the lense wouldnt open - thus needing me to return that one. I hope it is just a HUGE coincidence that both my Kodak products purchased within 3 months barely worked and that both my mother's new camera and the one I am now waiting on works for the long run.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak C813 Camera", "Author": "David  L Southworth", "ReviewID": "R2W3F9UNEDQDX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got back from a trip to California and back to Florida, took 800+ photos. All turned out exceptionally good.  This camera took about 300 photos (none w/flash) just on the rechargeable battery pack (about $9 or $10) and I had two AA cells in a case as back up. It took photos inside very dark Spanish cathedrals because of the great 1250 ISO rating.  I took lots of photos from the car window while moving and they turned out very clear and any street signs were very readable. I simply connect the camera to the computer with the USB cord and the camera shows up as another drive, so then I just copy/paste photos from the camera to the computer.  Also I can use the included Kodak software for transfer but I prefer the simpler copy/paste.  The camera has no problem showing up as another drive (much like a flash drive added to the computer USB port). If you copy/paste photos they are all numbered serially to help keep them in order for viewing if you should add them to a viewing program.  The only minor problem is that in a very bright outdoors environment it is somewhat difficult to view the area to be included in the photo, but certainly not impossible, not a problem for me but maybe for others. This is a very easy to use camera; when I wanted someone to take a photo for me I just asked they push and hold the button for a second or two and no one had any problem taking a good photo. The simplicity of photo taking is a real advantage as I could pull the camera from my pocket and snap a photo in seconds, then review it to see if I needed to take another photo; if so, I snapped the next photo within 5 or 10 seconds.  I have the recharging/printing dock also which is really helpful; keeps the rechargeable battery always fully charged and camera ready to go anytime. Photos printed from the dock look just like from any photo shop w/excellent color.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice for the price...", "Author": "Floyd Goodrich \"Jim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y49X5D6Y6S5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my ten year old grand daughter and she took to it like a duck to water. In no time she was using most of the modes and having a blast. For a low priced 8MP camera its pretty nice. It lacks image stabilization, face detection, and the video is 15 frames per second not 30 like more expensive cameras, so the video is slightly jerky. When reviewing the video on the camera, the video lacks sound but you get the sound when you download onto a computer. I was impressed on how well it took photo's in low light using the low light setting, as good as much more expensive cameras. This camera gives you a lot for the price so the 5 stars are based on price versus performance. Remember, its meant to be your first digital camera but definitely not your last. If your looking for a good cheap camera, you've found one, you really can't go wrong with this one.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Piece of Unworthy Trash", "Author": "Mattiene A.
