What do my dogs do all day? Can I watch my new little baby play and maybe take its first steps while I'm at work? This product is one of the simplest electronic products I've ever set-up. All I had to do was plug-in the camera, attach it to my home router and log in to the Astak site. My cameras were up and running.This product can be used for so many different purposes: to be a video security/surveillance system, check on things at a business or home, or whatever else you can think of doing. Check out the stuff posted on You Tube. People actually caught people robbing their business.This is what I like about this product:1. Setup was a breeze2. Only one wire to plug it into an outlet for power.3. I can move the cameras around as needed. For example, some days I put it in my garage to watch the dogs while I'm gone. On other days, I have the camera sitting on the dresser in the babies room.4. They are linked to your internet wirelessly5. The website and camera functions are very easy to use6. The image quality is great and the night vision works awesome.7. I can share my camera with my family anywhere so that they can see whats going on. (Even my Brother-In-Law in the Army)8. The range of my camera seemed just as good or better than my wireless home phone.9. Works great with my iPhone to check in via the web.10. The Yoics software program is very easy to use and easy to see other family members camera on a secure network. ( Many additional features also for remote desktop applications)11. Directly posts videos to You Tube12. Email alerts, motion detection, scheduled recording times, etc.13. 270 degree turning radius with full tilt14. Audio- so you can remotely hear what's going on15. Remote viewing,sharing, and controllingThis is what I wish the product would do better:1. Provide me with an iPhone app soon so that I can quickly check-in with one push of a button2. Have a way for me to zoom into an area to get more clarity.3. Have a battery back-upOverall, I think the product is excellent for people that want to see what's going on in places when they are not there and they are not tech savy enough to hook up more difficult systems. I would recommend this for anyone and plan on buying more cameras in the future.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, does what I need it to do", "Author": "Paul Hee", "ReviewID": "R2OGK22EI6D2G0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:- Initial setup very easy.- Able to view easily from the web on computer or iPhone.- Email alerts for motion detection works great.- Video capture works well and will automatically upload to You Tube.- Works well on wireless.- Came with a 2GB SD Card (maybe only for Costco purchases).- Night time pictures are decent, better than expected.Cons:- Initialy could not view from the Mac or PC. See FAQ: [...]- Software on the CD is worthless. Mac version did not work, didn't bother with the PC version. Recommend ignoring the CD.- Software downloaded from [...] for the Mac worked once, then after would never load. Ended up removing it. Recommend ignoring this software as well.- No ability to delete images or videos stored on the SD Card from the camera. You need to remove the SD Card and delete the files from a computer.- When trying to watch a video stored on the SD card, it may crash the browser. You need to save it to your computer first then play the file.==============================================================For those interested here's my setup guide:Mole Camera Setup:- Get started:  -- Plug in LAN cable.  -- Plug in power.- Register Your Camera:  -- Go to: [...]  -- Create a new account, it will detect your camera and bring up your camera's home page.  -- Note: If Yoics' site is down (unlikely), you can go directy to your camera's home page by typing in the IP address, e.g. 192.168.0.111- Update browser:  -- At this point your camera is running, but you may not see a picture.  -- Reason is that you need to install an ActiveX Plug-in and/or QuickTime.  -- Instructions: [...]- Setup Wireless:  -- Attach WiFi antenna.  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [Network] tabs.  -- Click the [Search] button and select your router.  -- Enter in the security settings for your router.  -- Unplug the power to your camera, unplug your LAN cable, plug the power back in. This will reset the camera so that it will now start using WiFi.Setup Alerts and Remote Storage:- Setup email notification:  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [e-mail] tabs.  -- For this you need to have an email account with SMTP. This is so that the camera can send the alert using this email account.  -- Enter the your email account settings.  -- Typical email settings: [...]- Setup Alarm:  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [Alarm] tabs.  -- Check \"E-mail Alarm\".  -- Check \"Send with Picture\".  -- Check \"Save Picture on the SD card\".  -- Check `Save Video on the SD card\". Must have this checked to upload to a remote storage.- Setup Remote Storage for Video (optional):  -- Create a YouTube or Twitter account. This is if you want to upload your videos on the web so you can view them easier.  -- You can make these uploads private so that no one else can view them.  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [Remote Storage] tabs.  -- Enter your YouTube and/or Twitter account settings. Select \"Private Youtube Upload\" if you want to.  -- Note: You need to have selected \"Save Video on the SD card\".Setup Motion Detection and Schedule:- Setup Motion Detection:  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [Motion detection] tabs.  -- Select the areas where you want the camera to detect motion. I just used one window and expanded it to the full screen.  -- Select the sensitivity for each window. I set mine to 26. At 45 I was getting too many alerts.- Setup Schedule:  -- This is when you want the camera's motion detection to be running. Generally you want to schedule it when you're not home.  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [Schedule] tabs.  -- Set the days and times.- Setup Auto Capture (optional):  -- This is if you want to pictures to be taken at regular intervals.  -- I didn't bother with this.  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [Remote Storage] tabs.Setup Camera as Virtual Web Server (Optional):Normally you should be able to access the camera from [...]However, if you want to remove any dependency on Yoics' server, then you can setup your router to operate the camera as a virtual web server. I did it mainly for fun.- Setup User Access:  -- Out of the box, camera authentication is not active, which is ok if you're going to access via Yoics' site. But if you want to access your camera directly then you'll want to enable authentication.  -- From your camera's web site, click the [Advanced] --> [User] tabs.  -- Check \"Enable\".  -- Enter passwords for Admin, User and Guest.- Find out your camera's IP Address:  -- From your camera's web site, click the [System] --> [Device Information] tabs.  -- Note the IP Address.  -- The default port is 80. Unless you changed it at [Advanced] --> [Network].- Log in to your router's home page:  -- Typically: [...]  -- Find out what your router's public WAN IP Address is. Finding this information depends on the router, e.g. 111.222.333.444  -- Go to the virtual server settings.  -- Select the public port you want to use. e.g. 6000.  -- Enter the camera's IP Address and port. e.g. 192.168.0.111 port: 80  -- Save the settings and you can now access your camera using your IP Address and port.

I was looking for a wireless IP Camera to use as a baby monitor that could pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) and that I could view it from my computer or Android phone . This camera seemed to fit the bill. Setup was pretty easy and I can barely use Excel; I was able to connect it to my router via wifi fairly easily and could view it on my computer and my phone over the network by typing in the camera's assigned router IP address. While it says it supports all browsers, it works best with Internet Explorer. Unless I'm missing something, I could only get sound when using H.264 streaming using Chrome and Firefox. JPEG streaming would only produce a picture and no sound. I prefer using IE anyway, so it's no biggie to me, but might be to others. Also, there is virtually no delay with PTZ when using IE, but a slight delay with other browsers. PTZ was more delayed and the video choppy when using my Android phone. And since Android does not have a Quicktime plugin for their browser, I didn't have sound. They also have instructions on how to view the camera through dyndns.org if you were away from home without going through their Yoics website. This was the hardest part for me because I didn't know how to open a port on my router. Once I figured that out, it was easy. They say it's less safe, but someone would have to know your IP address and know which one of the 65,000 ports the camera was on. If you are paranoid about someone accessing your camera, you can always set up a security password in order to view the camera. I actually prefer going through dyndns as it's less choppy and it's free. I would recommend not going through their Yoics setup as it's not necessary and is only there so they can get you to sign up for their premium service. The night vision is good, although the edges of the video are a little dark. Motion detection is great; you can set up 4 zones and choose how big each zone is and how sensitive the detection is. Email notification setup was easy and pictures were sent quickly and came in pretty clear. I haven't tried the built-in DVR yet.Now for the things I don't like about this camera. As I mentioned earlier, I can't get sound when I use my phone's browser, but that's not a big deal. What I really wish you could do with this camera is turn off all the LEDs. Unless you cover up the LEDs, the camera isn't incognito at night. Sometimes our baby wakes up in the middle of the night and stares directly at the camera. Also, the IR lights around the camera used for night vision have a red glow and click when turning on and off; it would have been nice if they did not light up like our Summer Infant baby monitor camera and was quiet. It also gets a little warm to the touch. I would give this camera a 3.5 star if I could, but since I can't, I rounded up. I'm on the fence about returning this camera, but I have not found another one that is wireless and has all these features for about the same price. Turning off the LED lights and having a no-glow infrared would make this 5 stars.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just Bought My Second One", "Author": "Water Dog \"lake tech\"", "ReviewID": "R6B7N7YMB2EXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We just got our second Mole here at the lake, We've had one for about a year now and while this camera is not perfect, it is far better than any of the other cameras we have tried.  We've got a Foscam FI8918W and a Lorex LNE 4001 and they are far less of a camera than this one.  We have played with numerous high quality professional cameras (IE Samsung), and besides build quality all these cameras are a better choice and performers for the consumer.One thing that we did that made a big difference to our older camera is update the firmware, our newer camera had much better firmware and we even found a newer one on the Yoics Support forum than made it perform even better.  It is very nice to have the image player and a click to streaming option.The Good:-Email alerts and Private YouTube upload are fantastic.  If you have a Gmail account and you have it linked to your YouTube account you get video embedded in your email, which you cannot ask for better, we have an account just for our moles that make it into something of an online DVR.-Efficient H.264 video for high quality streams.-Color is much better in daylight than our other cams because of its mechanical IR filter.-We like Yoics, for dead simple setup and mobile viewing.-iPhone and Android App support via Yoics Launch and Yoics View (these are new and free! Total Bonus!)-Built in SD card storage for video and snapshots.-Works with MAC, PC, iPhone, Android.  One of the only cameras that works very well with the Mac OSX.-Much better than the flock of \"professional\" IP cameras that I've played with that only work with IE or proprietary software and no mobile support.The Bad:- Blinking light you cannot turn off.- MAC setup for streaming can be a challenge as you have to follow their FAQ to get it configured for quicklime (but worth it!)- 2 Way Audio only works with Internet Explorer on PC.- Clicks when the IR cutter switches in or out- PTZ noise is recorded and pretty loud.- No Sound on Mobile phones.- UI can be confusing to setup motion alerts and recording and you need to make sure you have all the boxes ticked under multiple settings to get what you want.- As easy as it is I can see how people might still get confused (but no different than the other cameras I've seen)-Playback from Memory card needs VLC player on some platforms (doesn't affect YouTube)Compared to our other cameras:-slightly closer view than our 2 other cameras giving it less of a field of view, they should offer different lenses.-Far better audio and video streaming than the Foscam that only does JPG/MJPG image streaming (and separate audio stream).-Works on the MAC, we cannot get the Foscam to reliably work on the Mac with sound.-Lorex LNE has ok streaming video, but its controls do not work at all, but the color quality is better on the Mole.-You must port forward the Foscam to view it remotely, Lorex LNE and Mole have Yoics which we use.-Much better Yoics implementation than the Lorex LNE.-Much better feature set in GeneralWhat you need to know:- On Mac Lion they changed QuickTime defaults so streaming will not work unless you configure QuickTime.- Some Windows Quicktime builds also needs configuration to get streaming (Apple get it straight!)- The default bandwidth settings might be to high if you have slower DSL connection, you may have to adjust this to not get video streaming to cut off.- There is likely newer firmware for the camera than what comes with it.- Camera uses Yoics for remote access, though you can set up remote access via port forwarding and dynamic DNS exactly like the foscam.  We for the most part like Yoics, and even more like their iPhone and Android apps (of which the only way the Mis'ess can use the cameras)Wish list for an IP camera:Flash streaming display for PC/MAC/Linux Viewing (IE RTMP)Apple Live Streaming for iPhone display.Streaming for Android (new androids support apple live streaming)2 way audio for mobile.In Conclusion I believe that the Astak Mole is the best of the current crop of PTZ cameras that we have seen, I've seen the other reviews and I can only think the negative ones on this camera have to resolve around older firmware and not being able to setup QuickTime correctly.  These are the only two issues that I see being a problem with this camera.  Having said that, although it isn't perfect, the performance, feature set, ease of installation and image quality is the best of the cameras that we at lake tech have seen.

There are cheaper wireless IP cameras out there but guaranteed they can be very frustrating in the setup process. I tried couple of other brands but they all require that you have technical knowledge about network protocol, port forwarding, dynamic DNS, etc. By comparison, the Mole's instruction was easy, non-technical and I was viewing the camera within a few minutes. Works well with the iPhone so that I can view the camera from anywhere.Prompt tech suport is another plus. Many reviews of products neglect to examine and report on a company's tech support. What takes companies like Apple from good to great is their outstanding tech support.There are a lot of extra bells and whistles with this camera (video recording, motion activated capture, email alerts when motion is detected, etc.).

I think I know whats going on in this type of cameras pretty well. Here are what I found, and wish these ideas can help whoever wish to purchase an ip camera.1. Easy installation.Not technically plug & play, but it really gives the ease of setup. I usually need to configure my router to install an ip camera, and it normally wil take about half hour. But this one, it only needs me to hoop it up to the router and run the cd. I got it setup within 10 minutes!2. Image quality.This one has the best ip camera quality I have ever seen! It doesn't lose any color during day time and also it has a pretty good night vision.3. Motion detectionIt has built-in motion detection sensor for video recording, and the very important point - email notification with snap shot picture. I need the camera to let me know if something goes on when I am not at home!4. Remotely access & PT controlIf I receive an email with a picture, I can easily access and control the camera with my iphone. This can help a lot for any false alarm.5. Running 24/7 without additional requirementsThis is why I need an ip camera, not a web cam! I don't need to leave my computer open at all time when I go out for a trip.Now, here are some suggestions:1. Out-door versionFor me, I wish this camera can be used out door so much~2.

The only requirement of Yoics service is to setup an account with Yoics.com then you also register IP camera to the server then your are ready.This Mole IP camera has the best video quality compare with Panasonic, Linksys and Logitech which I have own. The camera's video displays a nice and clear picture in the day time and about 25 ft distance at the night time.The Mole IP camera has a build-in SD card DVR which can be recorded a motion video to the SD card when it detects a motion. In addition, it also send an email with a picture and/or upload a video to the Youtube or a FTP server.This IP camera supports two ways audio when you use Windows IE. It also works with Apple Mac or Linux. Another feature is you can view the video from iPhone, iPad or Google phone.I use Mole IP camera not only for security purpose but also to monitor my teenage boy to see when he is coming home or going out.

I have it installed at my vacation home, viewing through a window to the outside where my boat lift is.  So, I am able to remotely monitor and/or remotely pan the camera if I want to watch live.  I have it set up to email me still pictures whenever it detects movement.  To use the mole for these purposes, I can attest, it works very well.  Other features (youtube, twitter, mobile phone)  I have not tried.The set up was a bit of a problem, I made a \"beginner\" mistake by connecting mole to computer (by Ethernet cable).  It is supposed to be connected to the ROUTER by ethernet cable for the setup process.  ANYWAY, Once I figured that out it went okay.  One disappointment:  I was hoping to be able to use the night vision feature, but, unless the camera is mounted outside, it won't work well at all, reason is that the infra red light, needed to \"see\" at night, reflects back off the window glass and almost blinds the Mole.  If you carefully experiment with the right angle, you can lessen that to some degree, but it is awkward, and I found it not worth doing.  The infra red night vision does work well when the mole is watching inside.I see others have complained that you might have to pay for the web portal to monitor/control the Mole.  At this point, you do not, you have access free, but it is time limited (I think 30 minutes per day).  So, if you want to constantly monitor something, you will have to pay for the \"PRO\" version (can't remember what it costs now, but look it up, not too bad, I think) I think you also have the option to set things up so that you do not have to go through their portal at all, but that process looks complicated to me, so I've never done that.  (And, as you can imagine the web site doesn't really give much in direction about that).ANYWAY:  I like it, it works well for what I want, once it is set up it hasn't given me any problems.  I can unplug it and move it to a different window, upstairs, downstairs, whatever, and once plugged back in it automatically connects to network, no further set up needed.  At this point it mostly catches the action of some outside cats who like to stalk around the dock.  Since I have it at vacation home, it is nice to be able to monitor what is going on around the dock area.  It was very useful when we had some work being  done on the bulkhead replaced, I couldn't be there, but could monitor what was going on.PROS:  Set up wasn't too bad  Sends pictures triggered by motion to email  You can remotely view live and pan/tiltCONS:  Can't use night vision through a window", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD CAMERA!!!!!!!1", "Author": "KC", "ReviewID": "RIT43UXNNV270", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are some features are really good in Mole camera.

However, the more you use the software the more you'll hate it.  The con's far out weigh any benefits that I would like to focus on. If you plan on mounting this camera to look outside, say through your kitchen window to monitor your vehicles say at night time, then you have to manually turn off the night vision, otherwise you will see nothing but brightness from the infrared light reflecting off the glass back at the camera lens. Even if you do turn off the camera's infrared lights, you will quickly see that the camera can't see much going on at all, the images becomes milky, grainy and the quality of the camera is made very apparent.  This is fairly typical of cameras in the $200 range, but I will say that TrendNet does make a wireless N IP camera of which I also own ($150 range), and the night viewing aspect is by far 1000% better than that of this camera.  Now I could go to the trouble of setting up and independent infrared system that turns on at night time that I could point towards areas of interest, but this requires more money and time and this is not something I feel anyone should have to do. The idea of remote viewing and controlling this camera via an iPhone is neat concept but the reality of it is it's a joke, the image is blurry, it doesn't move very fast and you will have the feeling that your suffering from technological hype that can't match your expectations to any degree of satisfaction.  Bottom-line this is a camera that needs refinement, the makers would do well to read my constructive review and make changes that allow for the technologies that they have hyped to meet up with our ever increasing expectations.Comparison: This camera is like expecting Windows 7 but instead they shipped you Windows Vista without any service packs updates.Conclusion:  Keep looking for something else, depending on your needs, this camera for outdoor viewing is a total nightmare.  The camera disconnects from my network at least 3 times per week, and the bottom line is this is not a camera you can depend on to be a second set of eyes and ears for you when your not at home.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Web connections last for 2 hours & Yoics Pro Plan  $24.95/yr", "Author": "Alexander W.

The camera appeared to use a weird combination of Astak's interface and something called \"YOICS\" interface and the combination of going back and forth was confusing at best and with no explanation of why, or if, using both interfaces is necessary or even advisable. Neither Astak's nor \"YOICS\" software was capable of finding my WiFi network despites several hours of tweeking the router and the camera settings. A call to the so-called \"support\" number was answered by a man with a thick accent that was extremely difficult to understand and who claimed to be located in California. I got the distinct impression that this individual was handling tech support calls from home. He sounded unprofessional and as if he had been sleeping. He was totally unable to analyze or solve my problem in any meaningful way. When the few lame suggestions he made (e.g. \"Try moving the camera two feet away from the router\"), predictably, didn't work, he simply became silent. There was no step-by-step analytical problem-solving that one usually associates with a well-run professional tech company. My impression is that Astak is a start-up company with a skeleton tech support system and that the product itself is very buggy and unreliable. This company's version of this product is definitely not ready for prime time, in my opinion. I'm packing it up as I type this and it's heading back to Costco for a full refund as well as a bill to Costco for wasting my valuable time.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "didn't work", "Author": "Dylan Wood", "ReviewID": "R3CGZSSVK0NG5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Its simple - I bought this from costco, brought it home - setup seemed easy - I skipped the yoics connection and went direct to an ip.

To access the camera, you use a browser, but if you use a browser other than Internet Explorer, many of the features end up missing and the few that do work are painfully slow. It's really geared only to Windows machines.Additionally, if you want to access video files recorded on the SD card (you need to buy this separately), you have to manually download each file, then use third party software to actually open and view the files. This goes back to the days of DOS computing. There is no way to delete video files from the SD card. When it fills up it will simply overwrite the older files.The power brick has a cord that's only about 6' long, so think about that when you install it. That short of a cord really makes placement a pain in the rear and chances are you'll be running extension cords to it.It does not have a zoom feature.When motion is detected, it will send you an e-mail with a snapshot, which is a nice feature. Then it will continue sending you e-mails every few seconds until the motion stops. Unfortunately, there is no way to adjust this.It would be nice if you could tell it how frequently, or infrequently, you wish to receive alerts.On the good side, the wi-fi enable camera works well, the quality is good, and it does have sound, which many of these types of cameras don't.

First, while the camera has a built in mic, you can only hear audio on a few select devices. Audio is not support on Apple products. Image comes through on an iPad, but no sound. If your device does not have an Internet Explorer browser, no sound for you. Since we purchased this to use primarily as a baby monitor, that would have been nice to know.Second, to view the device remotely you must use a third party. In this case set up automatically uses yoics.net. Terrible choice. Yoics floods you with ads and multiple hoops to jump through every time you try to view the camera remotely. You can pay them money and they claim they will take down the ads. We did not know that prior to purchase. I would not have purchased had we known about Yoics and their ridiculous service.Third (and related to Second), Yoics quickly times-out the viewing display and requires you to log back in after several minutes. Navigating through their multiple ads is bad enough, but then Yoics limits the number of times you can log in to view the camera. If you are viewing from the same network the camera is on this is not a big deal (but see Fourth, below) because you can bypass Yoics and enter the IP address in the web browser to view the camera.Fourth, even when viewing the camera on a local IP address and by passing Yoics, the camera frequently freezes and you must refresh the browser.The camera quality itself seems ok.

The MOLE camera delivers as promised. With a simple online account setup, I was able to begin viewing a live feed of the camera through Safari on my iPhone! A relatively straightforward solution than perhaps most of the competition.While it is no SLR-quality camera for sure, it gets the job done. The image quality is understandably low to keep an efficient data speed for a live stream - but a bit too low for my taste. Good thing video quality can be adjusted. As long as you can make out the figures in the pixelated, choppy video stream from your phone (or computer), the MOLE gets the job done.Of course, this necessitates the camera to be connected to the Internet. But aside from that, there is no additional equipment that needs to be set up. You are just presented with the versatile camera itself, complete with an integrated WiFi antenna.What the MOLE's greatest strength is its convenience. Online viewing is as simple as logging into Facebook. I just wish there were better software design, but it gets the job done. Camera quality is reasonably poor, as a live HD stream simply would take too long to load. Overall, if you just need a camera to quickly check up on home while away from home, or watch the baby (or the dog), or scout for thieves... the MOLE is a convenient solution both in price and in function.Did I mention that it looks a bit like HAL 9000?

After about 9 to 12 months, BOTH of them no longer will pan (move left and right). At first, the pan was sticky, it would seem to get stuck, then move a little, would pan if the camera were tilted high. Now they just don't pan at all. Contacted Astak customer service and they recommended that I reset to factory conditions, because that had helped some customers. I'm sure that's not going to fix my problem because it deteriorated over time, and I can hear the pan motor running through the audio link, but the camera does not move. The camera is in a remote location, 550 miles away from me, so I cannot reset to factory conditions or I will loose all connectivity until I can next visit the camera. I also updated the camera firmware to the latest on a prior visit, but that didn't fix the problem. Now the warranty period has passed, so I'm probably stuck with two broken cameras.There are actually some great qualities of this camera: the Image quality is good and color is accurate, so they must be using a UV filter. Motion detection is excellent: there are 4 different detection zones that can moved anywhere within the image and the thresholds of each of the 4 zones can be set independently. Another feature I used was to write images and video clips to an SD card that can be inserted into the camera. I used a large card and would copy it to a portable HDD every 1 or 2 months when I visited the location.Set-up was pretty easy. I used the Yoics capability at first because it was easy to set up. Later disabled Yoics and just used port forwarding in my router, set camera to have static IP address on my LAN, changed the camera's http port#, set up a dyndns.com account, and enabled update client capability in the router to track IP address changes. Have about 6 different devices at the site that are also set up in this manner (other cameras and energy monitor).Would have rated Astak Mole 5 stars if I didn't have two cameras fail. However, with my two cameras purchased from different sources and many months apart, it sure seems like a chronic problem with this camera, and not related to a quality issue in a single manufacturing lot.With what I know now, I'd definitely purchase a Foscam FI8608W instead. FI8608W has audio, SD card, tilt/pan, WiFi, but its motion detection has only one zone and is not as flexible as the Astak Mole. Have 3 other Foscam cameras at the same location and they are reliable so far.

Part of this maybe related to my internet connection if slow will cause this hang as I try to move the camera to fast. The thing that works so well in my case is that Centurylink changes my modem IP all the time. With the mole I do not have to worry about that as the mole connects to a site and I log into that ( free). I have a foscam which requires me to connect to camera with IP with modem which changes all the time so foscam is worthless.

I am familiar with IP cameras and how to configure them on my network, so I didn't used their website to register and configure the camera.  It took me longer than it should have to configure the camera due to some quirky firmware issues that would modify settings after I had saved them.  For instance, I configured the camera to have a static IP and spent 15 minutes or more not being able to connect to the camera wirelessly. I finally discovered that some how my settings had been changed to have the IP assigned dynamically.  So just verify all your settings if you're having issues configuring the camera even if you are sure that you have configured and applied the settings earlier.Overall, the camera does seem to work pretty well and has some nice features.  What amazes me is how long it takes for products like this to hit the market.  I have been looking for IP cameras and have bought quite few of them starting in 2006, and they all seem to have issues primarily with the firmware and features that don't work or have quirky behavior.  It is a bit frustrating that a manufacture has not figured out this rather simple technology and can not deliver a real quality and rock solid product.  Maybe I'm in the wrong price range to find a nice IP camera with rock solid features.  It seems to me that most of these types of products are developed overseas by companies that just don't have the workforce or processes in place to design and implement a solid product.This camera has the most features of all the IP cameras I have purchased to date, and so far, appears to have implemented most of the features.  A few things mentioned in the specs like Twitter do not seem to have been implemented in the current version.  Support for multiple browsers is not there either.  But as long as firmware updates are a possibility and the camera is new enough to be supported, these issues should eventually be addressed.For now, I'm pretty happy with the camera given the price and implemented features.

The pan/tilt gears grind disturbingly. The microphone is vintage-45 or less quality.Advertising Makes It Not Happen #1The advertising implies that the Astak Pan/Tilt Night Vision IP Network Camera (CM-MOLE) is a DVR. It's a DVR *IF* you purchase an 8G SD card. Even if it's connected directly to a powerful workstation, it won't record. You must pay more to play - Or, in this case, record.The advertising implies that MOLE is an webcam. The webcam won't work at all unless you register it with YOICS (free). You have a paperweight until you go to YOICS. After you register, you have a partially functional, unreliable webcam. It's an webcam *IF* and only *IF* you pay $26 annually to ASTAK for their YOICS service.The advertising implies that MOLE is an ipcam. The ipcam won't work at all unless you register it with YOICS (free). Repeat previous paragraph.The advertising implies that you can stream and record and share your MOLE content with friend and YouTube. You 'can' stream, after you register with YOICS, but, then, YOICS (or the software or the firmware or the hardware) turns off the ipcam after a couple of hours.In YOICS's large print it implies that you can share and upload. In the fine print it says that you can share, kinda-sorta, but you are limited on what you can share, limited on quantity of bandwidth, and, you do not get 'priority' bandwidth. If you pay them $26 annually and you get moved to the front of the line and you get to share with your friends. Note the lawyers' chorus: FriendsarelimitedtotenandmustberegisteredYOICSuserspay$26anuallyandalsouseAstakPanTiltNighVisionIPNetworkCamera.Evil SoftwareThe installation and usage software does what it wants when it wants and in the order it wants. If you deviate from the software's unpublished steps, you fail. Even if you follow the unwritten rules of life, the software might fail. And, yes, the download manual is as bad as one would expect. It contains little functional information. When you go to ASTAK's site, it tells you there's a firmware update. The link 404s.The pan and tilt software controls are sluggish and rudimentary. The buttons depress on selection, but you never really know if they took input or just moved to get you to go away. The incomplete manual doesn't cover it or answer questions.  At least the pan and tilt software controls don't show up in your remote browser.I still haven't figured out how to successfully share. There's a sharing page on YOICS. You enter your friends' emails. You select \"Send.\" Nothing happens. It must have something to do with that 8G SD card, not included, or paying $26 annually to YOICS.The software/website allow you to configure the port for port mapping purposes. It's a red herring. The port mapping doesn't work. It maps to wherever it wants to map.Advertising Makes It Not Happen #2When you go to YOICS and register, EVERY page diverts to an advertisement suggesting that you pay $26 annually to YOICS. EVERY page.When you finally get the whole thing on, configured, and 'streaming', you discover that the software leaves a large hole in your security wall. (Without paying the $26 annually) You either share your unencrypted password with the world or you don't share. It says 'admin', 'user', and 'guest'. It's actually 'Come and get it!'And it has an amazingly nasty knack of ignoring you when you tell it to remember your login and password. \"Remember me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Sucker!\"Tech Suppor- Gotta go.On the positive side, their chat-live tech was very responsive - for the first three or four questions. Then they quit responding. In mid-conversation they disconnected.User: \"Just like the software instructions said, I did this step then this step.\"Tech: \"Don't do that.\"ConclusionIf you purchase the Astak Pan/Tilt Night Vision IP Network Camera (CM-MOLE), be prepared. It doesn't work until you register. It isn't fully functional without an 8G SD card. It doesn't configure readily, easily, or understandably. It doesn't share. It shuts down of its own free will. YOICS constantly begs for $26 and promises 'more'. If you don't pay the $26, you are scum and won't receive equal treatment under the YOICS law.Ads. Obfuscation. Ads. Evil. Ads. Less is the norm. Ads.#####[Insert Apple logos via Option-Shift-k, here.]Apple AlternativesMOLE and EvoCamEvological's EvoCam supports the Astak Pan/Tilt Night Vision IP Network Camera. You can use EvoCam to stream video from the  Astak Pan/Tilt Night Vision IP Network Camera through your router or computer. EvoCam accesses the pan and tilt controls - and they work better than YOICS's web-based controls.As one would expect from someone who hadn't paid their $26 annually to YOICS, either Astak Pan/Tilt Night Vision IP Network Camera turns itself off or YOICS terminates the camera-computer link every couple of hours even though the video stream is NOT going through YOICS.iSight and EvoCamBuy a couple of Apple iSights on ebay for $50 each. Unfortunately, iSights are NOT pan and tilt.Buy EvoCam for $30. With EvoCam, you can stream and record audio, stills, and video. You can do time lapse. You can web server or ftp or email server. You can schedule. EvoCam works great with iCloud. EvoCam performs http live streaming with HTML5. You can view your iSights from anywhere.Configure.Create tinyurl links to your iSight/EvoCam ports.Enjoy the way Astak Mole SHOULD be!-30-", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as good as the manufacturer claims", "Author": "Video Jockey", "ReviewID": "R1YOS589JL5MZT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I connected the camera with little difficulty and could view the image via my own network.  Connecting remotely was a bit more difficult, but made it through okay.  However, the quality of the image is FAR from HD....far from SD, for that matter.  The color is horrible and quality of the image makes images of the original moon landing look like a million bucks.  I contacted customer support, they jumped on to my desktop, and claimed the image was just as good as the samples on their website.  I just had my eyes checked, so I think they need to do the same.

I will assist you today.Jane:hime:helloJane:what's the issue you are facing?me:As I told \"Denny\", the image on my camera is awful.  He looked, said it was alright, then cut off the conversation.  It is horrible!!!  Not even a SD image, let alone HD as it is supposed to be.Jane:oh ,i am afraid that there is no problem with your mole camme:REALLY?  Why is it so distorted compared to those images on your examples?????Jane:the resolution mole can support is up to 640x480me:So, why is it so different than the examples shown on your website?Jane:that's the 640x480 imagesme:So.....this image -[...] is the same as mine?Jane:yesme:Have you compared both?  How can anyone say they're the same quality?????Jane:yesme:I will save this conversation when I pursue this further.  I don't know what YOU'RE looking at, but the two aren't even closeJane:fineSpend far less money on another camera that can be viewed in another manner than their website, which constantly requests you to upgrade to their \"Pro\" package for $24.95/year.
