However I am not satisfied with this product and in the process of returning it.  I followed all the directions for charging the light and adjusting it as well as fine tuning the sensitivity so it was not overworked or in a high traffic area.  Three full days of sun light was spent charging the unit and adjusted it using the test feature during day light hours.....verified it when it turned dusk on the auto feature and all was tuned it good.  When i went back out 3 hours later the unit no longer functioned.  It came on for about half a second then immediately off.  Pretty indicative of the battery had already been fully discharged.  The company is a very good company but this product in my mind was a waste of time and money.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Many parts not available", "Author": "Gsaxon \"Greg\"", "ReviewID": "RKJQWA6M6AVHN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have the model SL-7, and I tried getting replacement parts but the only parts available are the battery and the bulbs.The screw-on lens covers on my unit have yellowed through age and the light therefore is not as bright as it could be - but no replacement covers.  Althought the solar panel on my unit is cracked, it still charges the battery, but no replacement solar units are available.My unit no longer lights even with a replacement battery, but I am leery of buying bulbs because if the unit still does not light, I am out of options.The light worked well when it worked, but be aware that there are few replacement parts.", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does not last", "Author": "Hobbyhobbit", "ReviewID": "RADWAPJBUXNGC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have gone through 3 of these lamps in the past 2 years.The first one failed after 8 months.Makers offered a replacement under warranty. That one failed after 1 year.In the meantime, impressed that they replaced the lamp under warranty I purchased a second light, hoping the first was a isolated failure.That one has now failed, also just over 1 year in service.On examination I found in all cases the lead acid battery was not charging. Checking the PV pannel output in full sun indicated a bad solar cell.Out of interest, I opened up both pannels and found that the solar panel was subject to water ingress and had corroded the contacts of the wafers which are not well sealed.Bottom line is that although the concept of the design is good, the quality is poor and the product will not last.3 units which all failed in such short time is not a coincidence.I should add these lamps were not purchased through amazon, but from Northern Tool.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not well built", "Author": "C.
