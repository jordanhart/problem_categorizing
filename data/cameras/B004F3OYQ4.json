Worked perfectly with the Canon SX40--screws on and off very easily. Well threaded to receive and remove the filters. Feels surprisingly sturdy. A warning, however: I've since bought the SX50, and it's a significantly tighter fit on that camera. Much harder to get on and off. You have to zoom the lens out and hold onto its barrel while you're putting on the adapter to make sure you don't put torque on the lens itself when you twist the adapter ring. In reality, it's probably not a bad idea to use that approach with the SX40, too, but more important with the SX50.

However, the SX50 is SLIGHTLY different on the barrel, not allowing this to mount properly.

However, I was able to easily make it work by filing the inner diameter out slightly at a few key spots, and then sanding it smooth so it didn't damage the barrel. It works ok, and is very snug, but lacks a true locking detent with this modification. A small quibble for something so cheap.
