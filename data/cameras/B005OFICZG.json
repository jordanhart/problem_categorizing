{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review of Sealife DC1400 duo strobe and video light", "Author": "Lisa Featherstone", "ReviewID": "R2ATAEC1674CAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We upgraded to the DC1400 after using a \"underwater point and shoot\" for underwater photography for 5 years. Although the DC1400 is technically a point and shoot, the features, strobe and video light make it a good intermediate camera for those who have graduated from a point and shoot and want higher quality images without a massive SLR and it's accompanying equipment.First the bad news. After using the camera on a dive trip I realized I didn't like the strobe and video light combo. I tended to take photos more than video, so the video light was redundant. Also, the ergonomics of holding the arm while trying to press the shutter button was irky and cumbersome. What I did was take the video light and arm off completely and moved the strobe over to the left side. Underwater, (as a right handed person) it was easier to be able to press the shutter with the right hand and have the strobe on the left side so my left hand could adjust the flash from a variety of angles. Furthermore, after I took off the video light, I took off the 8\" piece of arm and added it to the flash's arm, doubling its length. This gave me the opportunity to distance the flash from a greater radius of angles and reduce backscatter in the images. This left the video light which we put on a wrist strap.The DC1400 doesn't allow to take RAW images which take up more memory but show higher resolution. For most instances, JPEG files are fine for the computer, but if you want to blow them up to magazine or poster size, JPEG images will be somewhat granier. This is the major disadvantage that I found. If you're a beginning or intermediate photographer, it shouldn't make a difference.There are many more positives. As an intermediate photographer, it was nice to have manual options for aperature and shutter speed. The shutter speed has a nice range, but the aperture's range is more limited. However, working together, they give photographers a range of options for metering and depth of field. When these have been exhausted and you want RAW files, it's time to drop $5,000 on a high end camera because you are thus an advanced photographer.The size ensures that it can be taken apart and put in your luggage so that it doesn't take up much space. The large buttons are easy to work underwater and the infinity and supermacro settings are awesome. Make sure you invest in a good battery charging system for the AA batteries required. Hope this helps. Happy diving!", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera Set", "Author": "G. Siler", "ReviewID": "R1PMN0ZLVLAAIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great Camera set.
