It is ready to shoot out of the box with no settings to mess with, but also has many adjustible settings to help make great pictures. It comes with all the accesories you need, but you should plan on getting at least a 32mb Memory Stick. Also, right now Sony is giving a $[money] instant credit for an accessory from their webiste when you register the camera. I used this to buy the Quick charger kit. This comes with an extra pair of NiMH batteries, Quick Charger, and custom camera case. with the discount, it is about [money]. The quick charger will charge 2 batteries in about an hour and a half, or 4 batteries in about 4 hours. The charger included with the camera takes 13 hours to charge 2 batteries, so this is a good investment. The camera is small and easy to hold in your hand. The LCD screen is not big but good enough to size up your photos. The movie mode is OK, no sound but cool for taking little clips. The Twlight modes are great, I have got some great dusk and night pictures using the twlight modes. Overall, After buying a Memory Stick and the Charger kit, I feel I got a great camera for under [money] total.", "Date": "July 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good Price, Good Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2Q5JTAS1QCWMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have read all the previous reviews everywhere about this cameras and decided to get this babe. I am very happy with the price and the extra free 128 MB memory stick offer that I got.The only bad thing, which nobody mentioned previously, is the charging time. Sony includes a charger but not a fast charger. It means the NiMH batteries will take approximately 13 hours to charge! Interestingly, you can get chargers from Kodak and Olympus that charge four NiMH batteries in 4 hours.In the user manual, Camera Starter Kit Model # ACC-CSNQ has been suggested which has a Super Quick Charger that charge the batteries faster, but it has not mentioned how much faster. Sony web site has no information about charging time of that Super Quick Charger unit either. So, if anyone knows the charging time of ACC-CSNQ Charger please write a review for others because it may be the second purchased after Sony P31. :)Anyway, everything about this camera is fine except the batteries charging time which if you do normal shooting it won't be a problem for you because you may need to charge batteries rarely (once a week or in two weeks). However, if you take more than 150 photos non-stop every 3 hours, you probably need to get a faster charger just in case. I suggest Kodak K2000, Olympus B-50SU, Lenmar Pro711, Lenmar Pro744 or Millenium CH4 Chargers which I have not used any of them but there are many kind people who wrote some reviews on them.Thanks to all people who write reviews, God Bless You All ;)", "Date": "June 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "A great camera, but made of plastic.", "Author": "IVE", "ReviewID": "RVUV1MRTRJTW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The P31 is a great camera but  I have three complaints.  1) I am used to my old Canon AE1-P, in wich the camera body is made of metal.  My AE1-P camera is 17 years old, I doubt that the plastic body of the P31 will last that long.  Of course, it is much, much lighter.  You can carry it in a shirt pocket.2) It has these two plastic tabs, one covering the AC input and the other covering the USB/Video Out connectors.  I am almost sure that before two years those fragile tabs will break.3) Another contra is that it doesn't bring a camera case.  Sony includes the Ni-Mh batteries and charger but doesn't include even a...case?Aside from that, as I said, this is a great snapshot camera.  If you keep the LCD turned off and don't use the flash frequently, the batteries should last long.  The included 8Mb memory stick is not enough, so buy a 128Mb stick with the camera.  I got a Lexar, and that is the one I use.  The 8Mb stick is gathering dust in a drawer.  I will buy another 128Mb stick when I go on vacations in the future.  The 2Megapixels images take about 800K each, so you can store about 150 to 160 images.The manual says that the batteries take 13 hours to fully charge.  I don't know why they take that long, but I clocked them, and I was surprised to see that in fact, I took exactly 13 hours to charge them.  No less, no more.  If you take a lot of pictures, be prepared to buy 2 extra batteries also.I was forgetting about my fourth complaint, the manual.  There's a mention that you have two USB modes, Normal and PTP.  They only say, you should use Normal.  No further explanation of what PTP is.I did some research and found that PTP stands for Picture Transfer Protocol.  Windows XP understands it (I don't know if other versions do),  and basically instead of showing the camera as an external drive in the windows explorer, it activates a Wizard that makes it simpler for non technical users to transfer the images to a PC. I prefer the \"Normal USB\" mode, but it would be nice if the manual explained all the features of the camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "GREAT DIGITAL CAMERA!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RXILMRGTU1ABV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the SONY DSC-P31 on the recommendation of a friend.

I was talked into buying it, as I normally run away from Sony products, especially those using Memory Stick.It takes great pictures and connects nicely to my laptop computer.  Sure, the 13-hour charge is a drag, but part of that is due to the 1750 mah capacity of the batteries.  That's a powerful battery for NIMH AA-size.  I've had the camera 2 weeks, shooting all over the place, and am still on the first charge of the battery, filling up my 64 Mb card twice.

Just a couple of months before I bought my Sony, I bought a 1 megapixel camera and was thrilled with the pictures I was getting, so I moved up to the Sony.  My first set of pictures were on a cloudy day.  They were sharp but nothing special.  Later I took pictures on a clear day and was blown away by the color.  Absolutely stunning.  There is no comparison between this camera and the others I was using.  I am still trying different buttons and learning what my camera is capable of but was up and taking pictures right away.  My only regret is that I didn't get an optical zoom.  I can tell the difference, but I don't use that feature much and am able to crop away any distracting objects and still have crisp photos.

But no problems with XP and this little baby. No software to install. Just plug in USB, XP installs, you re-boot, and just as others say, your camera is a disk drive. Don't buy a PCMCIA adapter! Having used CF etc, I beg to differ with the motorcyle guy--memory stick is better (as most Sony storage devices are). Works as expected. Very light. Fast (no optical zoom to wait for--or bump into). Wish it had ISO800 equivalent and 1 cm thinner, but it fits in my pocket. Also, will not turn on accidentally as my Canon S10 did. And it does not have a proprietary battery that sells for US$100 like my Canon has. The NiMH's seem to go a lot farther, too.

It is small, and lightweight, but very well built and feels sturdy to the touch.The camera features 1600x800 resolution (2 mega pixel)and a digital zoom. Surprisingly the pictures taken with the digital zoom turn out acceptable. They are not nearly as nice as if there was an optical zoom, but for images that don't require a lot of detail they are ok.  Even so, if you plan on using the zoom feature a lot you'd be better off buying a camera with optical zoom instead of only digital zoom.The camera comes with an 8mb card, enough to hold about 20 pictures. It also comes with 2 rechargeable AA batteries and a charger. Finally, contrary to the other review I read it does come with a USB cable for connection to your computer.The camera has a lot of nice features including the ability to record motion mpeg's. Unfortunately it does not include a microphone so you can't record sound with your \"movies\". The only thing that I do not like about this camera is the flash. The camera has red eye reduction, but the way it is implement is annoying. The camera flashes several times before taking the photo, almost like strobe. The effect is very disconcerting for people and all too often the photo that is taken is of people grimacing because of the multiple flashes. Even with red eye turned off the flash fires twice, again causing people to blink when the picture is actually taken.But other than the flash I've been very happy with the camera and happily recommend it to others.", "Date": "April 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "The little go-get-it camera", "Author": "YSC", "ReviewID": "R1K0LMPJMPJRK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Excellent value. Intuitive user interface. Laden with useful features without becoming confusing. Relatively light and compact. Decent image quality. Respectable battery life. Good display. Quick response time. Durable. No time limit for movie shots. Low noise for low light situations. Fixed lens has a slightly wider angle than most zoom lenses. Overall quality is excellent.Cons:Lens distortions makes portraits its weakness. The lens is on the soft side. Lack of zoom may be trouble for some, then there are those who can appreciate a fixed wide angle. Low light focusing can be a tad slow or inaccurate even with the focus assist light. No extra long shutters (only up to 2\"). For those who care, no sound with movie clips. Conslusion:This is a great snapshot camera. The simplicity and speed of its interface makes it a joy to use. Useful features at the touch of a button that both novice and advanced photographers will appreciate. Respectable battery life reduces the inhibition to joyfully snapping away, and the quality of its images did not disappoint. The robust body is durable and allows its use in less friendly conditions. I have used quite a few digital cameras from Nikon, Minolta, Sony, Canon and Olympus, yet none feels as \"willing\" as this camera to shoot pictures. The speed, quality, battery longevity, simplicity and durability of the camera allowed me personally to concentrate more on the photographs than on the gewgaws, delays or battery exhaustion. I have indeed shot an incredible amount of pictures with this camera, more than with all the other much more expensive cameras. The P31 is build for quick snapshots, with features that inspires creativity, and at a price that I can only love. A wonderfully balanced combination, if you can only overlook the lack of zoom.Recommended:128mb Memory Stick, Extra NiMH batteries.

With any standard driver installation, InstallShield asked if I would like to restart the computer so the driver will work, I clicked restart and after the startup sequence Win2k Pro arrived at the desktop and immediately I got 3 error messages with Explorer.exe. I shut down the system and restarted again and right away got the same error messages. I restarted the computer once more and this time it gave me different error messsages about memory allocation error and svchost.exe error, sysfader error, csc notifications error. Also at this time I noticed that the regular icons in my Task Tray at the lower right corner (drivers for my printer and Palm)  failed to load on start-up. Throughout the day I tried everything from uninstalling the driver to booting in Safe Mode to no avail. I called SONY's absolutely useless tech support and the guy was absolutely clueless and simply pointed me to SONY's even more useless support website. This tech support guy then told me that the latest driver is on the support site and download that and everything will be fine. I went to the site and downloaded the driver and then did a properties check and found the \"latest driver\" to be about two years old and the driver was created for the older SONY cameras!I continued to try to fix my computer on my own with help from my brother who is a computer systems engineer and he tried everything and nothing worked. As the day went by my computer just became more and more unstable with truly scary and strange error messages. I called SONY again and got this tech support gal and this woman was rude and obnoxious. Before I even finished describing my problems she cut me off and said it is not SONY's problem and it is my computer's fault. I told her I have used computers all my life and installed many drivers and this lousy SONY driver is the only driver that ever created havoc with my computer. She became very rude and told me that it is not her problem and not SONY's problem. She said that as long as I am not an owner of a SONY VAIO computer with this camera she is not going to help me. I asked are there documented cases with SONY's support group regarding Cyber-Shot driver issues with Win2k Pro, she of course denied that there is no such thing, what a flat out lie. After I hung up the phone with this useless SONY tech dope, I used my Macintosh to surf the Web and found hundreds of message board psotings on the horrors of the Cyber-Shot USB driver....I ended up calling Dell and Dell's awesome tech support walked me through many more elaborate diagnostic routines. After an exausting 2 days calling non-stop to Dell's tech support and Dell's tech support finally threw their hands up and gave up (this includes Dell advanced support for Win2k). The only solution was to reformat my 60 Gig HD and reinstall Win2k from scratch to get rid of all the residual pieces of [junk] that the SONY driver had installed on to my system and causing havoc.So before you buy this camera, please consider the consequences I suffered by a lousy 20 second SONY USB driver install that led to two full days of horror and no support from SONY. I am so appalled that SONY shipped such lousy driver and on top of that such [junky] and useless tech support to boot!Buyers beware!", "Date": "May 28, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2-megapixel sensor captures 1,600 x 1,200 images for prints at sizes up to 8 x 10 inches\nAutofocus lens with 3x digital zoom (no optical zoom)\nIncluded 8 MB Memory Stick holds 12 images at default settings\nConnects with PCs and Macs via USB port\nUses 2 AA batteries(rechargeables included)", "Name": "Sony DSCP31 Cyber-shot 2MP Digital Still Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31mmjS7ANLL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000063S4I"}}
