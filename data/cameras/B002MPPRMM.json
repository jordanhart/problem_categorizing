{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for the beginner with room to grow", "Author": "Kristi W.", "ReviewID": "R2B5MPNK78PMAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my a500 for a few months and am very happy with my purchase. This is a great camera for someone wishing to switch from advanced point-and-shoot to full d-SLR. The menus are intuitive, and this camera is generally easy to use. It has some nice features like HDR imaging, manual live focus, and an amazing live view. I tested this camera with Nikon and Canon models in the same price range and felt this was the superior product. I also like that this camera has the autofocus motor inside the camera itself (unlike many similarly priced models by other brands), making it compatible with my 20-year old Minolta lenses. As you probably know, lenses are as important, if not more important, than the camera body so it's nice to be able to use older, reasonably-priced, solid glass. This generally takes nice low light shots although there is some noise at higher ISOs. This is to be expected from a camera in this price range. Also the kit lens is not the greatest, but this is usually the case with entry level SLR cams. I'd recommend buying the body only and picking up a 50mm prime lens. Then start shooting. I gave this 5 stars because it's great at what it is --- a starter SLR camera with some room for the photographer to grow. This of course can't compete with $2000-$3000 full frame models, but it has none-the-less exceeded my expectations. Great value. In general, I think this brand is underrated in the digital camera world. If you are in the market for your first d-SLR, give Sony a try.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Alpha", "Author": "W.

It does everything I've asked of it so far and I haven't even begun to explore all the special features and functionalities.  It is amazing.

Previously, I've had an A300, Canon XTi, and Nikon D5000, all of which were very good cameras too.  However, this is quickly becoming my favorite camera of the bunch.  The build quality seems very good and the picture quality is awesome.  Its heft and size feels nicely in my hand too; the other ones are smaller and lighter by comparison.  That is all.
