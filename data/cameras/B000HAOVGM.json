{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I really like this camera", "Author": "C. Winton \"cwinton\"", "ReviewID": "R1N2RZAA2Y9CSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, this camera is worthy of a 5 star rating, one of the few I've ever given.My experience with cameras in this class started with a Canon S-100, which I upgraded later to a Canon S-400, both of which proved to be excellent for my on-the-go photography needs.  My only criticism with this class of cameras was that they lacked two features I really wanted:1.  wide angle lens2.  image stabilizationI guess the Canon folks read my mind with the introduction of the SD-800, and after reading a number of positive technical reviews for the camera on the web, I purchased one as an upgrade for my beloved S-400.  I was particularly suspicious regarding image stabilization, since my only prior experience with a camera using this technology had been disappointing (Canon S-1, a larger 10x zoom model).As might be expected with the advances in memory technology, the SD-800 takes movies at a higher resolutioni (640x480) than the S-400 (320x240) and has a higher maximum pixel count (7.1 vs 4.0).  It also uses the smaller SD memory cards as opposed to the bulkier CF cards for the S-400, and the lithium battery pack has a different form factor (which means you can't reuse stuff from an earlier model).What I consider to be the 2 real upgrade features for this camera, the wide angle lens and the image stabilization, are what truly distinguishes it from its competition.  I've had this camera for about a month now and can happily report it is a significant advance over the S-400.  The image stabilization is a dream.  With the S-400 I had to rely on bracing the camera in many circumstances where with the SD-800 I can count on sharp images just holding it out, composing, and taking the shot.  In a recent work session where my group had accumulated a great deal of writing on a wide white board along the side of a narrow conference room, I was able to capture in a single, sharply focused shot the entire board, something the S-400 would have taken 2 shots to achieve followed by a photo stitch.  There is some distortion at the outer edges, but I personally don't see this as a drawback given the advantages to getting the whole image (after all you can crop the picture if the rather small amount of distortion truly bothers you).What else?  Well, the camera is lighter and more comfortably contoured than the S-400.  It does retain the view finder (thank heavens ... there are simply circumstances where this is the only reasonable way to compose a shot).  A single door is used for both memory and battery (vs. 2 doors on the S-400).  As others have reported, the door has a flimsy feel, but my first camera in this line (the S-100) had a similar door and I never broke it.  Anyway, the USB-2 picture download pretty much eliminates needing to pop out memory cards to get a faster download speed via a card reader.  I did invest in a 4Gb high speed SD card since maximum movie length is 4Gb at 640x480, 30 frames per second, or about 25 minutes worth of pretty darn good movie taking.  My experience to date is that with this level of capability and convenience I doubt I will every use my cam corder again for family movies.Out of the box I found the controls and interface to be easier and more intuitive than the S-400.  I have all the capabilities I had with the S-400, plus some \"gee-whiz\" features I've had fun with but I doubt I will use routinely (e.g., color swap).  I can also recommend Canon's leather case for this camera.  It provides an extremely easy way to carry the camera on your belt (it uses a belt loop, which I think is far superior to a belt clip).  I was initially put off by the magnetic flap used with this case, but now agree it's a superior design (their earller cases used Velcro).", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very good value for money", "Author": "R. van Bakel", "ReviewID": "R2WDAKL4HS6GX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a professional photographer who shoots with two Nikon SLRs and an array of Nikon lenses; some of the lenses alone cost five times the price of the Canon SD800. But I got tired of lugging heavy camera equipment around for family and travel photos and general grab shots. So when I'm not working, the SD800 is what I use.It's not perfect for sure. To name just a few annoyances: it suffers from red-eye effect when you take flash pictures of people; like all point-and-shoot cameras, it has noticeable shutter lag; it has rather a lot of image noise at ISO settings over 200; and its 'manual' mode doesn't let you set an aperture value or a shutter speed. I also notice quite a bit of lens aberration, which becomes especially evident when pictures include straight lines, such as doorways; the SD800 gives them a slight curve.But maybe all that is the wrong way to look at it. For a $375 featherweight camera, this thing can't and shouldn't be expected to deliver SLR-like quality or features. And what the SD800 DOES do well is more important: It takes lush, pleasing pictures with very good color fidelity (a Canon trademark) and with minimal thought and fuss required from the photographer.It's also a very pleasant camera from a usability point of view, and not just because it slips easily into a shirt pocket or into the nicely made but optional Canon belt case ($15). The SD800 has only nine controls (buttons and dials), which is usually a recipe for confusion as functions either tend to get hidden deep inside menus, or require counterintuitive pushes of several buttons to access. But the camera is more logically laid out and designed than any compact I've ever shot with. I only had to crack the manual for a couple of advanced tricks, like photo-stitch and color-swap. The rest of the SD800's operation is pretty much self-evident.I appreciate that the power button is recessed; whenever I tried to stuff my old Canon Powershot G6 into my pocket, or pry it out, that camera would turn itself on due to the poor placement and design of the power switch. It got annoying enough that I sold it. There are no such design goofs on or in the SD800.The camera's proprietary battery provides lots of juice, the screen (which is as big as on my $1,600 Nikon D200) is bright and clear, the image stabilization works really well, and the range of the lens is just right (being able to shoot at 28mm -- respectable wide angle -- is a wonderful thing, very uncommon among point-and-shoots, whose lenses typically start at 35mm).All told, I quite smitten with this nice-looking, well-thought-out little picture-taking machine. Considering that it also takes decent video footage, the combination of quality, features, and value is, in my book, untouched by any other digital compact currently on the market.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Takes fantastic photos, but has some design issues.", "Author": "N. Schweitzer", "ReviewID": "R1LR1ZCIMMEE63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my fourth camera from the Canon Digital Elph line (previously, I had an S330, S400 and SD400). They have always taken great photos, and Canon has truly earned my repeat business (I also had a Digital Rebel and now I have an 20D).I've had the SD800 for a few days now. Like its predecessors, it takes fantastic photos. The image stabilizer works wonderfully, and the camera functions quite well (and faster than most compact cameras). Other reviewers have spoken about the photo quality, and you can also get detailed technical reviews elsewhere on the internet, so I won't get into that here. What I want to focus on is the functionality of the design of this camera.Digital Elphs used to be chunks of stainless steel. I dropped my S330 from a 12ft balcony, and it emerged unscathed. This is the first camera I've had that felt like it is going to break at any moment. It is larger and clunkier than the previous generation of Elphs (e.g., it is 36% larger than the SD200/300/400), and feels \"plastic-y\" and cheap (despite the fact that it looks nice). The buttons are small and offer minimal feedback, so it is easy to press the wrong button, especially if you have large fingers (and even if you have only average fingers). The \"mode select\" dial switches between Auto, Manual, Scene, Movie and Playback modes, but it is difficult to move. The dial is stiff and has only a small raised ridge on one side, making it difficult to set the dial to the proper mode on the first try. In sum, the design of this camera makes it operation more difficult than necessary; not something I expected from a camera from Canon, espectilly one at this cost.This camera takes amazing photos, but Canon needs to brush up on their design. For a brief moment I considered returning this camera and keeping my SD400, but this camera's features are too good to pass up. I suppose everyone will get used to the poor design, but for this amount of money, none of us should have to.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Another great Camera in the Canon Digital Elph line", "Author": "A. Santiago Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1B3OPLH3IW5GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just spent a good 1/2 hour here reading reviews on the SD800 IS, and didn't agree with many of them so I had to write one myself.  I have previously owned Canon's S400, S500 and SD550.  I usually pass my previous cameras on to family so I can get the latest and greatest, and once again I am not sorry I did.  I am extremely happy with my 800 IS.  I quickly charged my battery, then took 60 photos or so using every feature I could find in the camera.  Macro, flash, no flash, wide, telephoto, B/W, sepia, vivid, you name it.  I couldn't take 1 bad photo even if I tried!  I loved the results in all of them.  My only complaints were test shots at ASA 800 and up.  Yes, those will be very noisy and unusable, but when printed in a 4x6 size how bad will it be, really.  Not much worse than film cameras at ASA 400 or 800.  How many situations will you find yourself in needing that high an ASA rating?  This camera is beautifully built, it looks and feels expensive and I think it's a quality built camera.  It is not a tank like my old S400, and it's lighter than the SD550 but it does not feel or look cheap.  This is an outstanding small camera.  As for soft or blurry edges at the wide angle setting, NONSENSE.  I just can't see it in my photos.  If you are a previous Canon Digital elph owner and want to upgrade, go for the 800 IS.  I picked this one over the 900 because I didn't like the looks of the 900, didn't care for 10 megapixels (when is it enough?), and the 900 did not have the IS feature, which is outstanding on my 800 IS.  It really works!  I took many photos indoors without flash, hand held and they were unbelievable, with excellent color balance.  My flash photos seemed to cover the room just nicely too.  I just loved every photo I took today with this camera.  So, I don't know what all the whining and bickering is about, but this is one fine piece of camera engineering.  As for the battery/SD card cover, yes, it's light and plastic, so open it carefully the way you should handle a $400 camera.  There must be many clumsy people out there who break things.  I never have, especially with my cameras.  So, do I regret giving up my SD550 for this 800 IS?  NOT ONE BIT!  Both are outstanding cameras.  I did a lot of research before forking over the cash for my next camera, and I'm glad it led me again to the Canon line.  If you want one, treat yourself.  I also hope I have made your selection easier for you.  Between my wife and kids, my siblings, my nephews, brothers-in-law, you name it, they all have digital cameras now.  We see many crappy photos, but almost never from those who went with the Canon Powershots.  What does that tell you?I have had my camera for more than one month now and I am still very happy with it. My wife has my previous SD550 so I've got the best of both worlds.  That SD550 is also a great little camera, so I'm glad we've kept it.  It just doesn't have Digic III or the IS feature, but that hasn't been a big issue.  What I have now noticed is that for some reason I'm getting more red eye shots with these cameras.  I have been taking a lot of photos of my young daughter and her dance class partners, and it seems to be more of a problem with children than adults for some reason.  I have read that because of the small camera size, the flash is just too close to the lens and that is the reason.  I don't really know but it could be true.  I use a software program provided by Kodak Gallery to upload many photos at once, and it fixes that very quickly and easily so it is not a big issue to me.  Also, some have written about the white spots that show up on photos.  That I believe are dust particles in the air that come out magnified in photos, which is another common thing with these small digital cameras. Remember, at 7.1 MB you will see incredible details in your photos.  If you have a digital camera, trying taking shots outdoors at night around a camp fire and you'll see what I mean.  As for the round dust spots that show up, I just copy and paste a surrounding area without the spot and paste it over the spot and it's gone.  There are many software programs that let you tweak your photos, so it's easy and fun to make corrections, which was virtually impossible with film photos.", "Date": "December 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best in class.", "Author": "Maine Writer \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R3LH4E5HDKFJOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sure, there are some legitimate quibbles about the SD800. For example, while generally solid in construction, the USB and video out are hidden behind a remarkably flimsy cover. In fact, when you pull back on the lid, it feels as if the slightest additional force would break it, although so far so good. And, yes, as some reviewers have noted, the mode changing dial might be difficult for someone with clumsy fingers.You also should know that, while it has a manual mode, this is a not a camera for someone who wants to tweak apertures or shutter speed. It's a point and shoot, after all. That's the category. If you want more, look elsewhere. So, that isn't a complaint. It's just a caveat to those who aren't fully sure what they want out of their camera.Also, some have complained about the camera being \"only\" 7.1 mega-pixels. This kind of \"insight\" doesn't really help when looking at cameras as light, small, and easy as the SD800.  Certainly, if you need to make prints bigger than 16 x 20 (after cropping), then perhaps you should be concerned -- and ought to be looking a something other than this point-and-click beauty. This camera is about a beautiful form factor, easy portability, and stunning pictures, not making posters.These points being said, the SD800 is a very special camera. I've owned a number of digital cameras (Fuji, Nikon, and Canon), and checked out way too many cameras before I purchased the SD800. The picture quality is superb--the best I've seen under most conditions. It's incredibly fast on recharge, focus, flash, and picture snapping. It also has a wide-angle lens that grabs enough extra real estate (and people) to make far more stunning pictures than the typical lens on a point-and-shooter. The SD900's lens pales in comparison. I dare you to see for yourself!As for overall build, this is a solid, virtually all metal camera. Would it survive a 12-foot fall?  Maybe not. Few cameras would. My last Nikon broke on a 5-foot fall. That's life.  Just keep it on a strap.This is a great camera. The camera to get, in fact, if you want gorgeous pictures, a great lens, and more features than you can shake a stick at, including amazing optical image stabilization that really works, and software that identifies faces in a shot and makes sure they all look as great as they can.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera !!!!!", "Author": "Joe B.", "ReviewID": "R1YINXKEH49KEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great  camera!I am an ex-wedding photographer and am very picky about the equipment I buy.  This camera produces beautiful images and downloads them very quickly to your computer using the included Canon software. Be sure and get a 1GB fast SD card...it pays off in fast image save times as well as image upload times.The 28MM eq. lens is very rare in this size camera as is the optical image stabilization system. The portrait mode does a great job of eliminating red eye, unlike many other cameras.  There are even a few manual settings available for those so inclined. Try using the exposure compensation to darken up a shot to add some drama.The only con is that the zoom switch is a bit jerky, but that's a nit.  Another great camera choice in this category is the Casio Ex-Z850 which I have used and also love.  The Canon 800IS beats the Casio for 2 reasons, 28MM eq lens and true optical image stabilization vs. the digital kind.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "R8KWGBU8JY5SU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First...A lot of other reviewers have talked about how 'cheap' or 'flimsy' this camera feels...I think I have a different take on this coming from a Mechanical Engineering background (and actually making similar products in consumer electronics)I had an old SD100 and decided to upgrade, and indeed the old SD100 'feels' like a tank, and this new one 'feels' flimsier...but I dont think it ACTUALLY is.  First off, the new camera is very lightweight, and from a customer usability standpoint, lighter is often confused with 'cheaper'.  Second, this camera uses metal luster plastic parts...which scream 'plastic!' whereas the old camera used plastic that was matted and painted...so it looked like the metal surrounding it.  People also complained about the 'inside' being plastic now instead of metal...this is actually a good thing, as the internal metal on the SD100 was punched sheet metal (aka bendable, warpable, not structural) whereas the SD800 has molded plastic that perfectly fits the desired shape, actually providing more internal support....These cameras get their extremely small size by using the case as its structural support anyways...and here like previously, the case is metallic (basically...the case is titanium to support the product, and marketing decided to sell that as a 'feature').That all being said...it still DOES 'feel' cheaper or breakable, even if I dont think it is from the engineering standpoint...and part of product design is making something that 'feels' good...so I have to dock canon one star on this thing for not completely following through on the design front.As for everything else....Amazing optics, this thing takes wonderful pictures...it is SUPER responsive, statup time is non-existent and focus etc time feels twice as fast as the SD100.

Some shortcomings compared to slightly less compact models.", "Author": "David V.", "ReviewID": "R2UK95DPSTK7CA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've gotten this camera to replace a Canon S45 that I bought in January 2003 and this review is meant as a contrast to that type of camera (i.e., this review may not be too useful if you're coming to this camera from another point of view).  I chose the S45 at the time over the top ELPH model back then (S330, I think) because I expected that it would be my only camera for a while and so wanted manual control, RAW support, etc.  As it happens, the Digital Rebel came out in September that year and when I got one, the role of my S45 changed: A take-anywhere camera for taking snapshots and video clips. The latter came a bit as a surprise, because I thought I'd prefer using my more full-featured miniDV-based video camera.  However, it turns out that \"compact\" often beats \"full-featured\" (the S45 is not as small as the SD800, but it's still pretty small compared to my video camera).In its new role, the weaknesses of the S45 were (a) not compact enough, (b) poor low-light performance, (c) limited, low-quality movie recording functionality, (d) relative slow response times.  (That's all relative, of course: At the time, it was a reasonably good compromise in those areas.) On the plus side, the S45 is sturdy, I really like its user interface, and I got some really nice pictures out of it.How does the SD800 stack up in that context?  Very well, but not perfectly. I like its build quality and the subcompact size (though it's a bit on the large end of its class; not a bad thing per se). The plastic parts are no worse than the similar parts on the S45, but I get slightly anxious at the thought of scratching the shiny surfaces. The 2.5\" screen make for bright and sharp previews (it feels more fragile than that of the S45, however). Image quality is a step above that of the S45 in general, and easily two steps above for low-light work (where the image stabilization function and better ISO 400 performance really shine).  ISO800 seems somewhat usable, beyond my expectation.I don't care much about some of the more exotic features like \"swap colors\", but one feature I've unexpectedly come to appreciate is the face-recognition contribution to focus and exposure: It works, and it works really well!  (It also ties into a built-in categorization feature, in that the label \"People\" will automatically be assigned to pictures containing faces; that's clever too, but I don't think I'll use it.)Unsurprisingly, the wider-angle lens is a boon to many snapshot situations. (It was one of the factors that prompted me to order the SD800.)  There is considerable corner softness at the wider end, but for this type of camera it doesn't bother me too much. I wish the long end were a little longer of course (and slightly less compact models from Panasonic do better in this regard), but again I don't feel strongly about that considering the camera's size. This also appears to be one the most responsive subcompacts out there: It's certainly a whole lot faster at starting up and zooming than the S45 (though it still feels sluggish compared to a DSLR).The movie clip recording mode is far better than that of the S45: The higher (VGA) resolution and the image stabilization are the main factors there.  Still, I wish it could record a using a tighter codec (like H.264) and I wish the optical zoom could be used during shooting. A 1GB SD card will hold a little over 8 minutes of 640x480 30fps video, but once downloaded I can convert that to a H.264 file of about 70MB. The digital zoom in movie mode works well in good light (almost 5X for 640x480 clips), but in low light zooming in more than 3x or so results in exceptionally pixel-noisy clips.Finally, the overall interface is relatively intuitive and generally well executed.  My one beef is that \"review\" mode is part of the general mode dial. On the S45 (and Canon's DSLRs), \"review\" is entered using a separate switch (or button), which allows the general dial to indicate the recording mode: A half-press on the shutter and the immediately goes back to recording mode.  On the SD800, if I'm reviewing images and suddenly see an opportunity (which happens all the time), I have to first fumble with the dial (being careful to select the right mode) and only then is the camera ready to shoot.  On the plus side, when shooting a picture the camera automatically displays the image shot for a customizable amount of time (I set it to \"until shutter pressed\") and allows zooming into that picture.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best reason to upgrade your point and shoot", "Author": "K. Chung", "ReviewID": "R3A4E9C3V2SRK3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Canon 1DMarkII Pro DSLR and all Canon L series lenses. I studied photography and love manual control, BUT I also want to take my camera everywhere for those impromptu moments. For a point and shoot, I want the camera to be well priced and take great pictures on auto mode, yes, AUTO - otherwise I might as well take my professional camera body with me. Another reason why I want Auto mode to work as advertised is because I want others to hold this camera and take photos of me. How many times have you let others hold your camera only to find the image blurry or not focused on your face.I've owned or used regularly the Canon Powershot S50, S60, SD700IS and now SD800IS. You'll find lots of technical data reviews on the SD800IS but I'll focus on actual usage for the average person who's not a technical data freak.I upgraded from the S60 to the SD800IS for the image stabilization. Higher megapixels is not a reason to upgrade a relatively new camera, but Image Stablization is. You'll get much better shots period. All point and shoots suffer from the problem of camera shake; Canon IS works! You'll also be able to shoot at lower ISO's resulting in less grainy photos. Most point and shoot cameras work well at ISO 100 and progessively get worse above ISO 200, the SD800IS is no exception. Bottomline, image stablization helps you stay at ISO100/200.Yes, this camera is feature packed and the buttons are sometimes hard to push but there's no perfect small camera. The problems people write about, I can live with it, it's not as bad as it sounds and I quite like the buttons on the SD800IS. The power button is nicely recessed so you won't accidentally turn it on - this is usually the biggest concern for me since I put in my pant or jacket pockets.The images are amazing. With the IS and face detection capability, anyone without photography training can take great photos -- the #1 complaint for most amateurs are blurry shots or where the camera has not focued on the person's face. Canon has done a great job with technology that works quite well.The images are sharp and look good printed. It's not as good as my DSLR but it rivals any other point and shoot of its size and weight. I'm also not sorry they dropped RAW recording format as from what I've read, with these small sensors the difference compared to JPEG is not noticeable. The battery lasts a long time unlike the older Powershot S50/S60's. Sure, the camera body is a bit plasticky, wish it was more solid, and you have to be more careful about not dropping it. Same goes for most other point and shoots so the problems people are nitpicking about with the SD800IS are typical of other cameras in its size and price range.The video is also fabulous and works great with the image stablization. This camera is perfect for a new dad like me who wants to always have a camera around to take pics and vids of my child.The wide angle lens is also handy. I'm more likely to use wide-angle to get group shots indoors than the telephoto range. Not many point and shoots have the 28mm wide-angle range so you're sure to notice the difference in family shots in tight spaces like living rooms.The gravy on top feature has got to be the Grid Lines feature for rule of thirds (helps you compose your shot) and 2:3 aspect ratio (if you're printing 4x6 and want to avoid cropping wrong areas). The LCD screen is bright and works well on sunny days.The flash is a bit weak, but that's the same with all point and shoots. Add a $129 Metz 28 CS-2 compact flash and this camera is set for anything. I carry the SD800IS and Metz compact flash in 2 small custom-fitted $10 neoprene cases that I found on eBay and this setup goes with me everywhere. Hardly noticeable in my jacket pocket.Bottomline: if you're looking for a new point and shoot, look for one with a wide angle lens (if you plan on taking indoor photos), image stablization and face detection technology. I'm not loyal to Canon just because I own lots of their equipment; I'll buy any brand point and shoot that meets my needs. After several months use, I'm still extremely happy with my SD800IS and believe it's the best point and shoot Canon has released so far.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "LOVE it", "Author": "Em", "ReviewID": "R29JQ6ECI4A6XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera about a week ago to replace my old SD200 that died and I am having a ball with this little thing.  I do a lot of photography so I need a camera that takes good, sharp pictures consistently and this camera really delivers.  I'm absolutely in love with the image stabilizer.  I can actually use the digital zoom and still get a sharp picture. I'm amazed.  Another plus about the image stabilizer: you can take low light pictures much easier.  I took a picture recently of a carosel at dusk and its completely clear.  Another criteria of mine is a very minimal delay between pressing the button and taking the shot.  Most of the other cameras I tried out had at least a half second delay. This camera doesn't have a delay.  At all.  You press the button and it takes the shot that second.  The only exception is in low light when the shutter stays open longer but thats a different matter all together.  I also love all the little features. I haven't quite figured out all of them yet but this camera has a color accent feature that will pick out one color and put the rest of the picture in black and white.  Its really fun to play with.  There seems to be a setting for everything, so you can get the perfect shot every time and not botch the special moment.  The LCD screen is amazing.  Its so clear and has awesome colors.  It also flips the pictures for you so no matter what orientation the picture is you can see it full screen.  The buttons and menus are really easy to figure out, but then again its identical to all the other elphs so i already knew how to work it.  I haven't printed any images that I've taken yet but I'm pretty sure that they'll be good.  Overall, i just love this camera.  I was sold the moment I saw how clear the pictures were, even on 10xs digital zoom.

But don't expect it to do the job of a larger and more expensive camera.I consider myself to be serious about photography, and I have an EOS 20D as my main camera. But I'm not going to take that everywhere, so I need a small point and shoot camera for snapshot occasions. I've taken this approach since film days, when I had a Leica Mini (way bigger than this camera) for my \"little\" camera.I was in the market for a new \"little\" camera, and the key things I wanted--beyond taking good pictures--were a 28mm equivalent wide angle capability, a viewfinder, small (but not necessarily tiny) size, and an underwater housing. Then this camera came out with all of those!Another feature I like is that it can mask the LCD screen to show a 3:2 aspect. I normally crop to this aspect in Photoshop, and while I generally take pictures through the viewfinder there are occasional shots where this ability to check the framing is useful.Some reviewers have complained about softness at the edges at the extreme wide angle. I haven't noticed this, but I haven't used it for the sort of picture where it would be critical. (I'd choose my 20D for that sort of situation.) If you want wide angle photos that are uniformly sharp across the frame you probably shouldn't be using a pocket camera. There is only so much manufacturers can do with optics that will fit in a camera this size.I think the construction of the camera is fine. There is always a compromise among weight, toughness, and price. Canon has made reasonable choices here. This camera may not be the best choice for every photographer, but it isn't reasonable to ask one camera to be the best choice for every situation.Judging this camera against previous small cameras I've had and my expectations for it I am very happy. Judging it against my 20D it does better than I might have expected, but I never intended to judge it that way. Expecting a camera that costs less than 400 dollars and fits in your pocket to do what an expensive SLR with an expensive lens can do is silly. Even comparing it to a camera that costs twice as much and weighs three times as much is silly. But what you get for the size and price is terrific.If you want a small camera that takes great pictures and can go wide this is the one!", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent ultra-compact camera with great features!", "Author": "R.

Shooting speeds are excellent and the camera operates and turns on really fast.I was trying to compare the SD700 IS, SD800 IS, and the SD900, and I would definitely recommend the SD800 IS. The SD900 does come with a higher megapixel resolution, but I think the image stabilizer will be more useful.The actual camera is even more attractive than what you see in the pictures.

That's when I saw that Canon came out with two new models, the SD800IS and SD900.  While the SD800 had image stabilization and a wide angle lens and the SD900 just has more pixels with no image stabilization, I decided to go with the better features found on the SD800.  BOY was I glad I did!!Putting each camera I purchased to the test, I'd take it home and make lots of \"test shots\"...  To test the Image Stabilization, I would bounce the camera up and down and take a picture -- and most if not all pics would come out blur-free. The Macro Function is MOST EXCELLENT...  And the Accent Color feature is SUPER COOL...  For all intents and purposes, all three cameras (SD600/SD700IS/SD800IS) were just what I was looking for in a compact camera.  That is, until I decided to take some indoor (average to low light) pictures without using the flash... For the Canon SD600 and SD700IS -- I have one word to describe it -- BLUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRY....

This was an important factor for me since I take a lot of indoor photos of my pets and they don't care too much for the flash.So if you like to take a lot of indoor (average to low light) photos without the flash, look no further...

This is my third digital camera and my first Canon digital.The image stabilization feature is what sold it for us.  We purchased this as a replacement for our stolen Sony DCP-100.  We liked that camera a lot and looked to Sony for a replacement.  But after reading reviews and handling the Sony's we weren't impressed at all.In looking back at the photos we had taken with the Sony we realized how many of them were blurry.  So we went with the Canon as it was one of the only cameras in our price range that had Image Stabilization.  We have already noticed a difference in our picture quality. IS is an excellent feature for a camera this small as the slightest movement of your hands passes directly to the camera.Battery life seems good so far but we haven't really stressed it yet.All of the hatches for the various compartments seem a little too delicate for my liking, but I thought the same thing about the Sony and it never failed.I don't like the fact that I have to remove the battery from the camera to charge it.  thats a lot of moving seemingly delicate parts just to charge the battery.  Why can't it charge through the USB cable?The other issue I have with the camera is the finish of the front of the camera.  It is VERY delicate and scratches VERY easily.  I suggest buying a case for this camera ASAP.  I delayed purchasing a case and now have scratches on mine.  Our previous Sony had scratches too but only after two years of use and still weren't as noticeable as these after just two days.Overall we are very happy with this camera.  The menu is easy to use and set up for your preferences.  The big 2.5\" screen is bright and works well even in bright sunshine.  The buttons have a very solid quality feel.It takes better pictures than the Sony it replaced and we were very happy with that.  The macro mode could be better as it doesn't allow me to get as close to a subject as I would like but that inst a deal killer as I don't shoot that many macro images.Overall a great point and shoot camera that anyone should be happy with...from first timers to professionals just looking for a pocket point and shoot to carry around.

Granted I've been using a old Kodak DC280 2MP camera for the last 6 years and was happy with it for what it was, it was time time move up for higher resolution, low light capability, wide angle, and ability to do movies. I'm not a camera guru but have taken some nice pics with my old Nikon SLR. I've only had the camera for a couple of weeks and have taken ~ 500 pics so I'm still learning all the features and quirks but here are some observations The not-so-great:1. zoom only moves in steps so it's sometimes hard to get it exactly where you want it.2. Funky on/off button3. No button for playback... you have to rotate the not-so-easy functon dial.4. Function dial is small and it seems like it couldn have been designed better ( Although I love the small size of the camera ).5. I havent owned a Canon before but other reviews point out the fact that earlier models were all metal. This one is metal on the front and plastic on the back. Not a big deal to me but the plastic will probably have worn off paint after some use around the corners6. Plastic battery/memory card door probably could be better designed.7. Other reviews said pictures look \"soft\" and I'd agree with that. Not quite as crisp as I wouldn have hoped for. But editing the pic's a bit can help that.8. Photo stitch software isnt as easy to use as I'd like and doesnt work perfectly... some pic's the border between pics is blurry.9. Plastic door cover over USB jack feels a little flimsy and I worry that the plastic piece that holds it on might break someday after continued opening and closing.10. The camera is a little slippery without any type of textured gripping surfaces and I worry a little about dropping it.11. To delete all pics on the memory card at once, you need to go into the menu system and select that feature but cant do it easily from the review mode.12. When taking video's, the focus seems to be locked at the beginning of the shot.. if you zoom while taking a video things will be out of focus unless you return to the original zoom level when you started the video.Pro's1. Size matters... Easily fits in a pocket and thats worth it when traveling.2. Image stabilization seems to work well.3. Fast start up... turn it on and you can take pictures immediately4. Great pictures and great in low light.5. Feels solid and optical viewfinder works with the zoom (although with the LCD display I rarely use the optical viewfinder)6. Beautiful LCD display... very detailed and crisp.7. Auto image orientation works great.8. Color accent feature is fun to play with9. Having up to ISO 1600 availible is nice although you definately notice more picture noise at ISO 800 and 1600.. especially noticable at 160010. Face detect feature works great. I'm amazed how well it works.11. Battery life is good and the compact charger travels well and works european voltages just fine.Overall, I'm not disappointed in this purchase and would buy it again.Battery life is good. I bought an extra battery off amazon for less than $20 just in case but never ended up using it on our trip.. as long as you charge the battery every day one battery got us through 1 day... although we didnt shoot much in the way of video's and that might drain the battery quicker.

A wireless slave flash is available but (according to what I've read) only works when the builtin flash is on.An underwater housing (Canon WP-DC9) will be available soon (yay!) but at a price not much below that of the camera (boo!).  I would love to see a rainproof compact digital camera that could survive an occasional dunking, without an expensive and bulky housing.Most of the case is metal, but one end (including the battery/flash card cover) is plastic, and in my judgement, this will require careful handling to avoid breakage.

A 28mm focal length on the wide angle side  2.  It had fit easily into my pocket  This camera fits both requirements well.  The 28mm requirement is the result of many years of taking pictures of family, friends, scenery - having that extra angle of view compared with the 35mm or 38mm more generally offered opens up many possibilities.  If you haven't experienced the difference, give it a try before you buy.  Another feature of a camera I discovered, when lugging a 35mm reflex with a big zoom lens on it (the proverbial potato masher) was that it didn't matter how good the camera was if it was at home when I wanted to take the picture.  Thus the pocket-size requirement.  I have taken thousands of pictures over the years, moved from film to digital, and now see the cameras getting smaller and smaller - and doing more and more.  Happily, it all comes together in this package.  It takes wonderful pictures - Canon seems to have figured out the software as well as anyone - and it's easy to use.  Not lots of settings and adjustments, but I've had cameras with them available and never used them.  The anti-shake feature is a miracle.  You can use any focal length in almost any light where the camera will work without flash, and not worry about the shakes.  One general comment - in the Auto mode, the camera will increase the ISO setting as the light falls, trying not to turn to flash.  But at ISO settings much above 100, the resulting pictures are noticeably grainy, and at 800 and 1600, they are pretty ugly.  I shoot in Manual mode, just to keep the ISO constant, set at 100.  And the flash is really quite good for a little guy like this.  In the rare case where a higher ISO is a better solution, you can set it at other values, up to 1600, and fire away - and accept the consequences.  Sometimes a grainy picture is better than no picture at all.  I got a neat little case at Staples, made by Case Logic, which fits the camera snugly, and offers some foam protection.  It has been dropped numerous times in the case, and it just happily bounces and comes back for more.  The camera spends a lot of time in my pocket, and having it handy enables taking lots more pictures, in fun circumstances.  When people don't expect you to have a camera, you can catch them out better than when you have to do \"Hey, hold that until I go get my camera\", or \"Dang, I wish I had brought my camera\".  For comparison, Panasonic has just brought out this camera  Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)which also has a 28m wide angle.  The 10x zoom goes well beyond the 4x on the Canon, but the Panasonic is enough larger to make it a bit less of a pocket-fitter.  The longer telephoto is attractive, though, and it has the required anti-shake.  For cameras of this pixel count, it's interesting to note that you can put almost 1500 pictures on a single 2GB SD card.  On a trip?  That's 100 pictures a day for two weeks - not bad.  And the cards aren't expensive.  So, for my requirements, this camera is near ideal, and I'm very happy with it.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "R36YVAPC1DMBGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for about 2 months now and am extremely happy with it! Prior to my purchasing this one, I had several other Canon cameras (s45, a400, s1IS) and, overall I was happy with them, but they had some limitations and downfalls as well. I decided to sell them all (while I still could!) and use the proceeds to upgrade to the SD800 because it had everything that I every wanted/needed (image stabilizer, AF lamp, large LCD, W-I-D-E angle lens, and very small, compact size) and more!I frequently take pictures of various kitchen/bath remodeling projects that my company does and I found myself really needing a wide angle lens. The SD800's works GREAT! For instance: Previously, if I wanted to take a picture of something like a small bathroom, I was forced to try and take 3-4 pictures using stitch assist mode, and then spend 15+ minutes on my computer trying to cobble them together. My results were mediocre at best though because stitch assist is really only designed/suited for large, outdoor panoramas. Now that I have the SD800 with its 28mm wide angle lens, I can get the same type of shot in ONE picture and the resulting image is usually perfect, and requires no extra computer work on my behalf. I love it!This camera also takes excellent pictures of people and animals, as well as outdoor scenery. It produces colors that are very accurate and \"true to life\". It powers on very fast and is easy to operate. The power and operational buttons, as well as the menu interface are arranged nicely (logically) and work well. The flash seems to be adequate for the lower light indoor and night shots that I've tried. The image stabilizer is a fantastic feature that works great! (I've tried turning it off/on for comparison and the difference really is \"night & day\"). The 2.5\" LCD is a very nice/welcomed feature and is very bright and sharp, and the battery seems to last a very LONG time before it needs re-charging! (Without a doubt, the SD800's lower power consumption/battery life is a HUGE improvement over the previous models that I had).I usually find myself using the full auto mode (which works beautifully), but I like the fact that I can switch to the manual or scene modes and adjust a few settings if I need to, or just want to play around a bit. I haven't experimented with the facial recognition mode yet, but from reading other reviews it seems to work very well. I don't really have any use for the movie mode, (yet) but from my limited experimentation, what I can tell you is that it works very well for short \"candid\" clips of a few minutes in length--precisely what its intended purpose is. (Not professionally videotaping a 2 hour concert!)I've read some other reviews where people are complaining about this camera's \"cheap appearance\" or saying \"it feels like it's going to break apart at any moment\" ...or that (get this) \"it's a piece of junk because it broke when they \"accidentally\" dropped it\". I'm not sure what other cameras they've used, what they're comparing the SD800 to, or what they expected to happen when it fell to it's demise, but I would wager that those people are fairly inept, tend to find fault where there isn't any, and have no accountability for their own actions. The truth is, the Canon SD800 camera is very well made, looks great (I think anyways), and has a very \"solid\" feel to it. It's a precision engineered instrument though (read: computer with a lens) and if it were \"dropped on the floor\"...or \"off a balcony\" (accidentally or not) it would be only logical/reasonable to assume it WOULD break! (What would you expect? What camera wouldn't break?) Most, if not all camera manufacturers (including Canon) include a nice little wrist strap with their cameras (you can buy/make one also) that can be worn to prevent the camera from being \"dropped on the floor\"...or \"off a balcony\"! The wrist strap is a pretty simple concept, and it's really easy to use! Just attach one end of the strap to the camera, and place the other end of the strap around your wrist, Problem solved! Now, If these people can't understand that, they probably shouldn't be using a nice camera like this, and would be better off using disposable cameras...or, perhaps a box of crayons and some drawing paper. Also, I have yet to take any pictures using this camera that have any noticeable barrel distortion or pincushion (blurry corners/edges) using the wide angle or zoom. I don't see ANY problems with the location or operation of the on/off power switch. The battery doors construction is just fine, and the operation of it, and the round mode selector dial is easy if you use your thumb to slide or rotate them. (Respectively)My only real gripe is that Canon (as well as other manufacturers) insists on providing a cheap, \"throw away\" memory card with their cameras. In this case, it's a puny 16MB card. What's the point? It's grossly inadequate. In order to get the most out of this camera, you will need to purchase a larger capacity card. I bought a 1GB Ultra II which works well, and seems to be very adequate for my needs. (I usually use the M2 setting and superfine mode)Bottom line: This is a pretty remarkable camera that, if treated with reasonable care, (ie: kept in a \"sunglass sleeve\" or dedicated camera case when not in use, and used with a wrist strap when it is) should provide its lucky owner with years of service and very high quality pictures.

The reviews about the plasticy  body and wide-angle  optic problems gave me pause, but i figured I could learn to live with the problems.  Not so much.My first major disappointment was with the face-recognition focusing feature, the main reason I bought this camera.  The little brackets scoot around on the LCD and settle on faces all right--that part is cool.  But much less cool is the fact that out of scores of photographs, with both natural light and flash, I have yet to capture ONE photograph in which ALL the faces are in focus.  Objects near, but behind the faces, are often sharply in focus, but not the faces themselves.  Bad news.  Face-recognition focusing is a great idea, but Canon has not yet perfected it.My second disappointment was the obvious loss of sharpness at full wide.  I went to a local camera store to compare my SD800 with a SD700.  Same loss with the SD700.  Clearly Canon rushed the SD800 to the marketplace without addressing a prevous problem.Another optical problem is pronounced CA (blue fringing) in high contrast area (especially at intense white boundaries), a major issue since fringing is almost impossible to remove.  The SD700 also had this problem, but it seems worse in the SD800.  I'm also getting far too many overexposed photographs.The flash also varies all over the place, and too often doesn't properly illuminate the subject.  I've fiddled with exposure controls, read the user's manual closely, and still haven't figured out a solution to this problem.Other reviewers have addressed the camera's flimsy body, and those reviewers are correct.  I still can't believe Canon would release a $400.00 camera whose battery compartment alone is so inadequate.In sum, I strongly advice cosumers considering the SD800IS to check it out IN PERSON at a camera outlet.  My sense is that Canon rushed out this camera for reasons of marketing, without addressng the problems of the SD700 and without adequate testing the SD800's new features.  I'm sending back my SD800IS and will wait until Canon (or another company) works out the glitches of face-recognition technology and all the other problems of the SD800IS.By the way, the one feature that works great is Canon's Image-stabilization, but I already have a pair of binocs that do that.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "WONDERFUL camera", "Author": "Odwalla", "ReviewID": "R1NR1RYWGO1JU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I are both completely in love with this camera. I did hours and hours of research before buying and it definitely paid off.--- PROS ---IMAGE STABILIZATION: The image stabilization (IS) works wonders, making many pictures that would have otherwise been blurry turn out just fine. Blur was the biggest problem we had run into while using our other cameras (Sony DSC-P72 & Sony T1).WIDE ANGLE LENS: At first I was skeptical of getting a wide angle camera like this. I nearly got the SD700 instead, but now I'm very glad that I didn't. I had always wanted a point-and-shoot that would let me zoom in farther than the standard 3x, so with the SD700 I almost jumped at the chance. But then as I got to thinking about it I realized that the average point & shoot user (life myself) is more often in need of fitting more into the shot than of zooming in on some distant object. I think this wide angle lens is the way to go for most folks--though obviously not for everyone.BATTERY LIFE: Excellent. It seems to never run out. I've taken 250+ photos / videos without even seeing the low battery indicator turn on.RED EYE: We'va had very little red-eye problems with this camera, though I'm not sure what about this camera would make such an improvement over our old ones. Maybe it's just that we don't have to use the flash as much since our lower-light photos are saved from blur by the IS feature.VIDEO: The videos look fantastic, though they eat up a LOT of memory. A 12 minute video I shot took up 1 GB. That could obviously be compressed with some post processing software, but most people don't have this type of software.FOCUS CHECK FEATURE: There is a great option that--after snapping a picture--shows you a zoomed in view of the object you focused on and which allows you to see whether any motion or focus blur occurred. This feature is fantastic because it lets you snap a photo and then move on confident that it came out correctly. With our old Sony T1 we used to have to snap two or three shots of everything just to help increase our odds of taking a photo free of motion blur.--- CONS ---CANON SOFTWARE: With the exception of the cool photostich program, the canon software is horrible.SCRATCHES EASILY: I made the mistake of storing the camera in a small waterproof camera case that I rented while hiking the narrows at Zion National Park. The case had a few stray grains of sand that had fallen into it that really did a number on my camera's finish.

You RARELY have to retake a photo.Image Stablization = Again, Awesome!  I did a lot of research between this camera and the SD700 and i eventually picked this one b/c of the image stablization.  Boy am i glad i did.  Of the 200 photos, i think maybe 5 were blurry.  I was so impressed.Wide Angle Lens = Good! Yes, there are blurry edges once in a while when you are taking pictures with no zoom.  I probably would have never noticed it, but sometimes when you are viewing it 100% you notice them.  The blurriness is such a small thing, the great things about this camera outweigh it.Video = Awesome! It does a great job.  I have not noticed any feedback from the microphone either.Time Between Photos = Great! As soon as you turn this camera on, it is ready to go.  I am taking pictures in literally a second.  After you take a picture, i think the longest thing, is displaying the picture for two seconds.  I think it is like 2 seconds betweeen taking pictures, literally.  That is such a great improvement over my old nikon camera.Construction = Good!  What can i say, its a small camera.  If you want easy to use buttons and a more durable frame, get a bigger camera.  If you want a camera this small, you are going to have to make some sacrifices.  The design of this camera is definitely not a deal breaker.Overall = I am glad i made the choice i did!  I am so glad i got this one versus the SD700 or another brand.  The pictures are great and the small quirks about the camera are not enough to outweight the great things about it.  If you want an easy camera to use that works when you need it, you will not be disappointed with this one.  Don't get me wrong, you still need to read the manual b/c it has cool stuff like \"scenes\" modes that you can use to improve your pictures even more.

I also have an S230 which I still use and it still takes excellent pictures.  I also have a Fuji F10 which I bought for the extremely long battery life and great night shots.  All cameras have their pros and cons.  I don't think you can beat the color quality of a Canon photo.  The SD230 had a minor flaw where I had to check to see if it was in video mode or shooting mode, because the switch would easily flip from one to the other.  They fixed that with the SD800 and now it stays in place.  I like the size and portability of the SD800, it's as easy to carry around as a cellphone or drop into your purse if you are a female.This is the only camera that I don't shoot in auto mode.  I just think the pictures look  much better if you shoot in manual and select an ISO like 80, or if you use SCN mode.  At any rate I'm learning, and the more I fool with it the better the pictures look!  For example at wide angle, some may be disturbed at the physics of perspective, buildings tilting inward, that kind of thing.  It's sure easy enough to correct with any software that has perspective correction included.  For me it's Paint Shop Pro.  Many of my shots are indoors, at family and work events, and at least the wide angle gets everyone into the picture!After having owned other digital camera brands, I do still come back to Canon for the beautiful color rendition of the pictures.  I'm going to keep the SD800 IS!!  Oh, and one more thing, I bought a 1gb SD card that folds in half and makes its own usb connector, eliminating the need for a card reader!  That's great for traveling.  I do any deleting, etc. from a card reader or the folding usb SD card, because it holds enough pictures to where I don't want to use extra battery power.

I use a Nikon D200 w/ over $5K in lenses, but have found that while my pictures from the sd800 are no wear near the quality of the D200, they are more numerous, meaning it comes w/ me everywhere and i never miss a shot, unlike the large D200 which sits at home most of the time. I brought the sd800 on my recent trip to PR and it was great. 600+ pix on a 2g card, no need even to bring the laptop as the file sizes are small enoug and the 2g card big enough for a weeks worth of keepers ( itossed several hundered bad photos). While most will complain about, the corner softness, the design, the this the that, remember this, it is about getting the shot and the sd800 is always thier when needed and performs in 80% of all situations (low liight is ok, lots of noise at iso 200 +, but better than the LX1, flash is weak and recycles slow, and high contrast is tricky but use AE compensation and AE lock to get it right). Bottom line, if you pixel peep at 100% and make your decision on this camera, you are stupid. It is a PS digicam w/ great features and very good photo quality. As far as some design problems and cheap plastic material, it is metal and the Sd door is cheap, but when the sd700 came out it was $499, the sd 800 is $360 from amazon and has better features in the wide lense.

Movies are drastically more watchable with IS than without. Wide angle is wider than most point-and-shoot cameras and it is very helpful. Underwater case is good to deep water and is cheap for such things.  Highly recommended. (Other camera is 300D).Cons: you can't control much.

The photos don't look the prettiest when zoomed in 100% because the sensor just isn't as good as the rest of the camera.  As for the rest of the camera i want to stress a few thingsYou just CAN'T compare this camera to a 35mm or 38mm camera because the difference is huge.  Some people get caught up in the zoom rating but here is basically all zoom is good for:Sports (sort of)WildlifeOccasional random subjects that you can't get close tooHere is what wide angle is good for:Group photosLandscape (beaches, mountains, lakes)Scenery (buildings, sports stadiums)That latter category covers about 95% of most people's photos.  And of course zoom can be accomplished after the fact (crop), but you can never go back and take a wider photo.Secondly I want to say that IS is a fantastic feature.  Every picture in marginal light will benefit and even many pictures indoors are possible without a flash now.  If i concentrate on steadiness and use the 2 second delay I can get sharp photos all the way down to 1 second exposures.The face feature on the other hand is somewhat gimmicky although its neat to watch it re-white balance and bring out the skin tone as soon as it detects a face.As i mentioned earlier the image quality suffers from noticeable noise and average resolution.  It looks somewhat muddy compared to the sharper, cleaner sony i just replaced.  Color on the other hand always shines with canon and thats exactly what I've seen here.  The wide lens also leaves its mark in the form of edge and corner softness.So overall while the CCD is clearly lacking, the rest of the camera is still probably most well rounded and versatile compact on the market right now.

Haven't these people ever used any other cameras?Let's start with the good.1)A 28mm lens is a great feature.  The spotlight review says it's the only one. Wrong!  Panasonic had one way before Canon. Ricoh too.2) In good light the camera takes good pictures - colors are good, I haven't had too many blown highlights3) Image Stabilization makes the videos nice and smooth4) Design is nice, but that's subjectiveThe not so good1) Average low light performance.  OIS doesn't help much when you have to limit exposure to ISO200 without getting noisy/grainy pictures2) Flash performance is terrible. Try a Fuji with intelligent flash and you'll know in an instant what I mean. The flash is weak and if you're close to someone they get blown away and the background is black. Red eye is pretty bad.3) If you want to put it on Auto and shoot, you can - outdoors.  Indoors you have to go to manual mode and limit the ISO to 200 max (I limit mine to 100).  If you don't you are guaranteed to get grainy pictures.4) Build quality. Came with 1 dead pixel on the LCD, after 3 hours of use it had two.  We'll see how many at 11 months and 29 days when I call Canon. :)  LCD is pushed in at the upper right corner. Came from the factory like that and is a common problem.5) Picture sharpness. Pretty disappointing. Even in bright light many times the pictures just are that clear. This camera gets knocked for that.  Go to dpreview dot com's Canon Talk forum and you'll see others complaining.I actually tried to return this camera, but Dell messed up the order so I got stuck with it before I moved out of country.The awesome feature is the 28mm lens.  If you aren't interested in that get the SD700 if you can't get clear pics by hand holding a shot - if you can - get the SD900 (or SD750 and SD1000 are showing the same image quality as the SD800) or a Fuji F-series. (indoors Fuji will blow any Canon SD away)Panasonic has the FX30 which matches this Canon for features, but it's low light performance might even be worse - but the video size is 33% bigger.

I myself have sold almost a dozen of these little marvels just by showing people mine!  That's how good the picture quality is, and how good it is at taking pictures on Auto Mode.Size:  3.5\"x2.3\"x1.0\".  Easy to fit in a pocket/purse/backpack, etc.  It's about the size of a pack of cigarettes, or a 1\" thick credit card :)ISO Quality:  You can get away with a good quality print at ISO400 easily.  Anything less will be beautiful.  At ISO800, the noise increases and picture quality decreases, but it's still usable (more or less so, depending on your situation).Color Accent:  Not as much a gimmick as I once thought.  You can get very creative and have beautiful pictures that don't look fake or overprocessed.Auto Focus:  Very quick and responsive, with minimal shutter lag.  You will get the picture you were shooting, not a picture a second later!Face Detection:  Oddly enough, the software was advanced enough to pick up facial recognition on a 12\" resin figure I have.  It can occasionally not work, and doesn't pick up the faces of animals (it's not intended to, I'm just warning anyone thinking about it), but the feature is very effective.Flash:  Much more powerful than I expected.  I encourage you to stand at least 4 feet away from your subject before using a flash, or else there will be excessive overexposure.  The flash works a good distance away as well, able to light up a whole room.  The flash's ability to make skin tone come out with beautiful and natural colors is phenomenal.Video:  In good light, the video on this camera competes with dedicated digicams.  In low light, there is very noticeable pixelation.  In less active scenarios, this won't be a problem, but if you're in low light and there's a lot going on, the compression algorithms will miss some of the detail.Zoom:  Amazing.  The wide-angle lens is the buying factor for this camera and, if you want wide-angle (28mm) I'm telling you not to hesitate buying this camera.  The 3x optical zoom on the far-end is also nice, but obviously nothing abnormal (all cameras this size have about a 3x optical zoom).  In good light, the digital zoom works amazingly well.  I was able to take a picture of a baby's face from across a living room with no more than one or two endtable lamps, and the picture came out clean and very usable.  I also could zoom in on a sign from across the street (40 feet away) and have it completely fit on the screen.  Again, the quality was impressive.Image stabilization:  What more can be said -- this camera has it, and it works well.  If you intend to rely on lower ISOs to avoid grainy pictures (as I do), image stabilization is a must.This camera also supports 4GB video recording, allowing you about 40 minutes of video at the highest resolution setting (640x480).  The ability of this camera to handle almost every lighting condition flawlessly on auto is amazing to me.  And the ability to manually change any setting (besides shutter speed and aperture -- if there is, I haven't read the manual well enough yet!) helps a lot.I can go on and on about this camera, but you need to try it out for yourself to be a believer.

I'm not a sophisticated photographer, but I travel regularly and take a lot of pictures.  The features I appreciate most in this camera, apart from its compactness, are image stabilization, high resolution, big display screen, talking movie mode, deep zoom range (from wide-angle to 3.9X optical), large storage capacity (I use a 4GB card), and rechargeable battery.

This camera worked out great for a recent vacation... and I'm glad we didn't lug around the old camera.The biggest concern I had was the shutter delay.  Apparantly all non-SLRs have some delay but I couldn't find any definitive information about this particular camera. Again, perhaps all modern cameras are similar to this Canon--but I can say without a doubt, that if you pre-focus you can take action pictures with this camera.  I am impressed.My ultimate reasons to choose this camera were:--wide angle lens--sizeSurprisingly useful features:--image stabilization (one of those rare features that actually has great utility and not just marketing value).--video capture (I just didn't expect to ever use it and it's quite fun).--\"scenes\" for auto-settings.  The aquarium setting worked great for example.Negatives:--corners of wide angle lens are definitely soft and off color sometimes... but, really, it's minor and the primary drawback found in any wide lens.  I find the gripes about this issue a bit unwarranted because I think all similar cameras have (effective) 35mm lenses.  Bottom line: I love the look of wide angle that I'm glad to sacrifice a tiny bit of quality to get the great shots.--Flash is not that great.  Personally, I found myself using the \"AUTO HI\" ISO setting (where it's still auto-ISO, but tends to use higher values) in order to take low-light photos.  They're grainy, but if you have at least some light I still like the results better.  I don't know if the flash is just poor at picking the right power for the subject's distance or what--but the flash pictures just didn't turn out that great.Regarding the review comments about the flimsy battery cover...  When I first saw this I thought, \"oh, is that all they're talking about? who cares\"  The door cover on the battery is fine.  It's not metal like the rest of the camera case but it's fine.  However, the cover for the AV and USB cable hook up is totally flimsy.  It has this plastic tether/hinge thing that makes me very concerned... however, it seems to be well designed and simply \"feels\" cheap.  Even if this fell off I wouldn't be terribly concerned. I guess my point is that the battery/SD cover is fine!Finally, something I noticed as I was optimizing a bunch of vacation photos today...the exposure and color balance is awesome in this camera. Again, maybe I'm just easily impressed but if I had gone through 30 images as I did today with photos from that old camera I know I'd be using Photoshop's Auto-colors or Auto-levels to improve at least half of them.

While you're at it you might as well turn off the Red Eye lamp because it doesn't do anything but annoy your subjects.  The 28mm wide works really nicely indoors and there aren't many that have that.  Unfortunelty, they had to give up a little sharpness over the sd700 to do this, but it's a fair trade.  Almost wish when you turned the camera on it started around 32mm and you had to de-zoom because the widest setting isn't used that much, and it's less sharp, but nice to have.  One thing that seems off is how low the volume is even at max when you are playing back a video.  And, there seems to be a lot of camera noise or something going on, although I've only watched and listened straight from the camera, I haven't downloaded a play one on a tv or pc/mac to hear if it sounds the same.  I hate how much work you have to do to delete a picture or even view the last one you took.  Sure, you can set the post view long but to see it later you have to go to Play.

I took a hand-held macro close-up of a bee hovering over a flower in less-than-bright light, and it came out sharp sharp, like with a tripod - all the little hairs on the bee's legs.  Generally, though, brace the camera as best you can when shooting in low light.  The image stabilization is very helpful, but it is not absolute.Having lots of extra pixels is useless if you just print whole pictures at smaller than poster-size. 3.2 megapixels is plenty for that.  But if you like to crop to a tiny piece of the whole picture and blow it up to a regular size, the extra pixels let you do it -- the more you have, the tinier piece of the whole will be usable as your final picture.  The 7.1 megapixels this camera has is excellant for the purpose -- but I would not scoff at having more.  At some point, the quality of the lens becomes the limitation.The reviews say the 1600 ISO is too noisy to be useful.  It is noisy -- but it lets you get a picture where you could get nothing at all without it.  I closed myself into a totally dark room and tried it (without flash, of course) -- not surprisingly, I got nothing but black.  Then I opened the door a tiny bit, letting in only enough light to begin to see some shapes without detail.  At 1600 ISO, that's exactly what the picture showed.

The image stabilization worked perfectly even at full zoom.It is extremely easy and quick to change ISO settings which is very handy for changing light conditions.In terms of  picture quality, ISOs up  to 400  have little or no grain.  Pictures taken in ISO 800 and 1600 have noticeable grain, but are very sharp and produced  excellent 4x6 prints.Overall I am  VERY pleased with this camera and am glad I didn't settle for the picture quality of the W90.UPDATE: June 10, 2007  I took this camera on a trip to Singapore a few weeks ago and had the opportunity to take some night shots along the river that runs through the city.  I used a railing for stability and the 2 second timer to take the shots.  The 2 second timer allows any shake to stop after the button is pressed.  I took about 20 pictues using the nightshot setting.  All 20 turned out with no bluring even when zoomed in.  The 8x10 prints looked like they had been professionally taken.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "800 vs 700 settled toss up", "Author": "ksoe \"k\"", "ReviewID": "R2XA739RJQYYF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When comparing the elph IS features, if all other things are roughly equal except what I mention here, it was tough, but I chose the 700.  I bought the 700 for it's longer than average 4x zoom on a point & shoot.  Then I thought maybe I should try the 800 because of the wide angle, new processor, and higher ISO and megapixels.  But, even with the 3.8x zoom, because the 800 lens starts off lower already (28mm eqv.) to get the wide angle, it's max range of 4.6-17.3mm zoom does not even come close to the 700's 5.8 -23.2 max opt. range..plus though somewhat useless, the digital range is less too and the small bump up in MP doesn't compensate.  If you find you are always wanting to get more in a shot, get the 800 with the wideangle; as the other features are better.  For the shots I usually take, I find I crave the higher zoom so much that the other upgrades were not as important to me.  If, like me, you think you'd be bothered by not being able to zoom in as closely, get the 700.

Before buying the SD800 I tried an SD400 and SD900.  I wanted a quality camera, a small camera, and one that had resolution high enough that I could take  pictures of objects some distance away but be able to enlarge them without great loss of qualityThe image stablization feature of the SD800 became an important feature.  These small cameras do not have much heft and so I found that it was very easy to introduce body tremor and therefore blurring into the pictures.I have found that I can take a picture of a bird 15-20 feet in the distance and enlarge the picture to the extent that I have a quality \"portrait\" of the bird.  For me this is satisfactory.Although the SD900 has higher resolution, the difference between it and the SD 800 was not sufficient to cause me problems.  Camera motion seemed to be a greater consideration in taking pictures and then enlarging them.The finish of the SD900 is of a higher quality than the SD800 and I feel this is something to consider.  The price of the SD400 is less and of course this is something to consider as well.I liked my old G1.  It was a substantial camera.  I liked the movable screen and the buttons and knobs were, of course with the larger camera, more substantial.  But having a smaller camera enabled me to have it always at the ready when travelling.  The lag time between depressing the shutter and the actual taking of the picture was slow with the G1 and seems very quick with the SD 800.The SD800 has quite a few user controls but lacks the manual settings of larger cameras.

For example, most old 35mm film cameras use a standard 50mm lens as their basic lens. To get a wide-angle, you might step up to a 28mm lens to get a wider field of view at shorter distances. This camera has similar capability compared to it's peers. You can't actually translate the lens equivalent written on the camera (I think it says 17mm) one-for-one with the 35mm example I used above. However, I believe this offers the equivalent of about a 24-28mm lens.Speed. Ever get tired of missing the shot because your digital camera had either a) put itself in sleep mode or b) even worse, was ready to go, but took too long to focus on the subject. I've been disappointed with the delay in both Canon and Nikon cameras in the past. This camera is quick. It's closer to point and shoot (i.e., like film) than any digital I've used or picked up and played with in a retail store.

This camera made in Japan, so you can be sure the quality of this camera is strong.Picture was great. I try macro shot and the picture comes up better than my Nikon D50 camera. There are many other features like color swap, color accent, multi-shooting modes that you need to play with more to get familiar with this. I will give you more updates after downloading the pictures. Highly recommended!Updates 11/7/06I downloaded the pictures and it comes up beautiful, crisp, natural color. Didn't notice any corner softness.Stabilizer works great. Now I can take low-light photograph without worry of getting blurry pictures. Pictures without flash also come in great shape. For me just unbelievable! Macro shot also excellent. I can take very2 close pictures while my Nikon DSLR unable to focus within very close distance. One thing that I really enjoy is color accent feature. Just pick any color from your object: live! , and the camera will automatically select only the color you choose to be taken. Other than that, will be black & white. For example you want only flower shown in color on your picture. Or maybe you want to swap the color of your flower from red to yellow? isn't that cool? not to mention it has great movies features which allowing you to take high quality video at 30 fps!Other advanced features that you might be able to find only in proffesional camera also available such as:- Exposure Lock(AEL)- Flash Lock(FL)- Focus check modeI really recommend this camera for everyone.

They keep posing for a still picture as I video and it makes for lots of laughs later on. Some benefits I've seen in comparison with my old SD300:1. Red-eye is almost entirely eliminated. I took a ton of pictures in a bar and observed red-eye on only one person, a red-head. Not sure if it's a retina thing.2. Stabilization is great.3. Wide angle is great. I compared side-by-side with a standard focal-length camera and the difference is noticeable.4. Battery life is excellent. Much better than the NB-4L battery packs in the SD400. I always carried a spare NB-4L, but haven't needed a spare yet with the NB-5L included with the SD800.5. I love the video zoom. You could not zoom in video with the SD300, but with this camera you can.6. Obviously uses more memory than the SD300, but I'm able to use my old 1GB cards. Will probably go for a 4GB card.Coolest experience so far: My brother-in-law's father has a \"garden railway\" which is an outdoor train set. He put a flatcar on the front of the locomotive (which has a full diesel sound module in it), I put the camera on the flatcar, started the video, and then he drove the train around the layout. Perspective and sound were incredible. Viewing the video was like being on a train and seeing the \"scenery\" from the engineer's perspective. I included the video in this review. I compressed it for upload. Uncompressed (300MB) it is perfect.Only drawback is the size of the camera. I actually liked the brushed stainless block of the old Elph series and almost bought an SD1000 instead of this, but I made my decision based on the image stabilization and wide angle.A good choice.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Matches the product reviews I read before buying", "Author": "D.

The reviews I read prior to my purchase mentioned the following negatives:o  Flimsy plastic cover for power/usb data porto  Good, but not great, low light performance.My thoughts so far have been to be very careful with the plastic cover and definitely use a tripod if you are attempting to capture absolutely perfect low light pictures.This review might sound negative, but actually it is very positive.  There are too many great things to say about this camera, so instead I highlighted the only 2 average characteristics of this camera that I have experienced.I would definitely recommend the purchase of this camera.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "A decent camera with you all the time?", "Author": "Asgarius \"Asgar\"", "ReviewID": "R1G2U6YD7QMGVX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Look and feelThis camera is beautiful, sturdy and elegant.The dark grey finish  is much nicer than your typical silver digicam.Although it is an ultra compact camera it has a great balance. It's really small to fit in almost any pocket but it's not so tiny to feel crumped or unbalanced.  The SD800IS is really small, but it feels pretty solid.Lens and zoomI really love the 28mm wide end. It's really useful for interior photography, landscapes and group shooting. Most cameras have a 35mm wide end. I really find the 28mm a more versatile option. The 3.8x zoom is good. In overall the focal length is very usable.Image qualityIt  really is  much better than any camera phone, yet it's not a dSLR. Image quality is very good, although in my opinion it's not excellent. After inspecting the photos at 100% size I found that a slight blur and some color aberrations came from the lens. OK, it's a small lens and a tiny sensor, and for most people this won't be a big deal, but I thought is good to tell you.ISO performance and resolutionI mostly use ISO 80 for this camera, because it's kinda noisy with ISO 200 and 400, and ISO 800 is really awful. I really appreciate that Canon didn't go for a higher resolution, because with more pixels crammed in the same physical space you end with a lot of noise. And 7.2 megapixels are actually a very good resolution, enough for nice and detailed big prints.Image StabilizationOk, it makes no miracles, but it's much better to have it than not. Camera shake is a problem with ultracompacts and if you turn of the flash the IS technology is a true life saver.Scene modes & processorThe Digic III processor is a good improvement with better performance. The scene modes are actually very good. The SD800IS has not manual control for shutter speed nor aperture, ergo the camera is almost fully automatic allowing the photographer very little room for personal adjustment. If you are looking for a full manual, Tv or Av modes the SD800 is not for you, the camera is in command. The good news is, you have a good commander.Display and Battery performanceThe LCD monitor works very good under direct sunlight, but you even have a tiny yet usable optical viewfinder just in case. The battery performance is OK, but if you buy the camera consider buying an extra battery.Speed and performanceThe performance of this camera is actually pretty good. Autofocus is fast and accurate. In general de camera is very responsive and reliable delivering rich color and accurate exposure.ValueOverall, what you pay is what you get: beautiful camera, very good images, fast response and reliability. You won't find a better camera at this price and category. Canon has a winner combo with an excellent balance regarding the lens-sensor-processor equation.ConclusionThe Canon PowerShot SD800 IS is a very good camera that stands out of the crowd.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Ali S. \"Go Gators!\"", "ReviewID": "RUJM9JY3BBPBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing. I spent about 9 months (sad, I know!) searching for the perfect camera, jetting in and out of Best Buy and annoying the heck out of my boyfriend asking him which camera he liked best. I had my heart set on the Canon SD700 until this model came out. It was like love at first site.I am not a professional photographer by any means. I am a college girl who just likes to take action shots of my friends and me. Also, I was going to Europe for 2 weeks and wanted something that would take amazing pictures. This camera did just that! In churches and museums where you're not allowed to take flash, the image stabilizer really helped. A lot of my pictures came out crystal clear, something my old camera didn't do. I took pictures on the beaches, in rainy condition low light conditions and detail shots and they all turned out truly amazing.Unfortunately, my camera was stolen while I was in Greece. I switched my memory card halfway through, so I only lost a good two weeks worth of pictures and my camera. This camera is so amazing, that I am buying it again. Now, instead of being $400, the camera is $300. Let's just say that I'd still buy this camera even if it were $400...It is that amazing. So if you're like me and can't decide what features work right for you or what technical ability a camera should have, do yourself a favor and get this one.

The controls are easy to manipulate and understand, and the pictures are turning out great under varied conditions. The flash is powerful enough for all the shots I've needed it for, and I especially love how easy it is to vary the exposure so I can take pictures of people in front of bright backgrounds. I also appreciate the small size, and find that since it's easy to take it anywhere I'm taking many more pictures. Even so, the camera doesn't seem flimsy at all. Of course, the additional megapixels mean that I can crop my pictures and they're still big enough to print clearly.The biggest surprise so far is how well it shoots video, something I hadn't even considered when I bought it. I took a short, impromptu video the other night, and it turned out better than my 5-year-old camcorder takes. Of course, it had to be short, but I was able to record the important part and even put it on YouTube.

When it finally died I started hunting for another Elph. After researching what Canon had to offer I decided that the two features I most wanted were the 28mm wide angle, and the image stabilization. So that left me two choices, the SD800 and the SD870. After comparing both models I chose the 800 for the following reasons:Size: It's slightly smaller and lighter than the 870. I travel for work every week, so I wanted something small and easy to pack and carry in my bag or my pocket without drawing attention to myself as I would with a large camera.Price: For $100 less (at the time) I got basically the same great features as the 870. The 7.1 MP and the 2.5 inch screen on the 800 are more than enough for my needs and not really worth the extra money for the 870.Cosmetics and controls: I like the way the 800 looks compared to the 870. For some people this may not be a big deal, but I just couldn't get myself to like the look of the 870 with the black plastic trim, nor did I like the layout of the buttons and controls. The 800 looks great and I found the controls easier to navigate than the 870, but it's really personal preference. It feels comfortable in my hands, but it can be a bit slippery, so I have to be careful to always use the wrist strap. Another thing I do like on the 800 (that the 870 doesn't have) is an indicator light to show when the power is on.Image Quality: Excellent, though I am still experimenting with this.  I am taking good pictures in both the manual and auto modes, with and without flash. I find that generally I am able to take good photos without flash due to the image stablization, but it's not a miracle worker. When I have to resort to using the flash it darkens the background quite a bit even though the subject in the foreground is illuminated, so I prefer not using the flash if possible. That being said, when I do use the flash I haven't had any problem so far with redeye, which was quite problematic with my old S400.Movie Mode: This is a big improvement from my S400. The image and audio quality are excellent. I know some reviewers complained about the sound quality, but I had taken a video of my cat, and when I played it back after downloading on my computer, my cat (who was sitting in the room with me during the playback) heard me calling him on the video and came to me thinking I was actually calling him (and that's pretty good for a cat who never comes when called!)Wide Angle: Once you get a camera with a wide angle 28mm lens, you'll never want the standard 35mm wide angle again! I am able to get amazing shots without having to back up all the way to the edge of the Earth. Soft corners? I haven't noticed them. But then I'm not trying to blow up my photos to hang in an art gallery.Con: The only negative I've noticed was that on one occasion when shooting indoors under artificial lighting, blue vertical lines were running through the image (I was shooting a movie at the time). I have played with this and noticed the lines came up in any shooting mode and only when shooting towards the light source (usually a ceiling light). I thought it was a flaw with my camera, but my roommate's SD400 does the same thing. So it seems to be a design flaw. This hasn't been a major problem, however, as 99.9% if the images are fine. It probably has something to do with the type of light source and the angle I'm shooting relative to the light, because if I move a step to one side or the other the lines go away. This really is such a minor problem that it's not worth downgrading my review from 5 stars.Overall, a great camera, and with the prices coming down it's a great value! There are a lot of features I have yet to use, and I am actually reading the manual to take full advantage of what this camera has to offer. The 870 may have a couple more minor bells and whistles, but I'm happy with my choice. As one who likes to take lots of pictures and videos during my travels and at home with my family and friends, this camera serves me well.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Hits the sweet spot - performance, size, features and price", "Author": "Joel R. Eaton", "ReviewID": "R1K7O6LCBFKW3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera after much research.  The main features that attracted me:  +  28mm wide-angle zoom.  Most compacts start at 35mm, which can make it hard to take pictures of groups of people without moving way back.  The 28mm is wide enough to capture a wide shot, even in a small room.  +  Optical image stabilization.  I prefer to take shots with natural light whenever possible.  Without image stabilization and with flash disabled, any shutter speed below 1/25s or so gets you a blurry image, unless you use a tripod.  With this camera, I'm getting good shots down to 1/10, even 1/8 second (if the subject doesn't move too much).  That means I can disable the flash almost anytime, to capture, say, the ambience of a rainy day on the back porch.  And as a bonus, the image stabilizer works full-time when using the...  +  high-quality, low-compression, 30fps, 640x480 video recorder.  Video on compact digital cameras is usually a novelty.  But I found myself using the video recorder on my old Canon Powershot S50 more often than my bulky 8mm camcorder because I had the Canon with me, and the camcorder was back in the car.  The video was poor quality, but it was better than nothing.  Now, with the SD800IS, I can have my cake and eat it too.  The video is as good as my digital 8mm Sony (640x480, 30 frames per second, low compression, few noticeable digital artifacts).  Usually video on a compact camera is shaky, looking more like a cell-phone video than anything semi-professional, but here the optical image stabilization helps tremendously.  I can pan as smoothly with the SD800IS as I can with a more bulky camcorder.  And since large capacity SD cards can be had on the cheap, recording capacity is no handicap.  I purchased a 4GB card for $50, which gives me 30+ minutes of video recording.  16GB can be had, and bigger ones are coming.  That's 2 hours of high-quality video on a camera that will fit in your pocket - which means you'll actually have it with you when something video-worthy happens.  The only downside: you can't zoom while you're recording video.  You have to set your zoom beforehand.  When you start recording, the camera sets focus and white-balance based on the first frame, then uses that for the duration of the shot.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "small, lightweight, powerhouse", "Author": "Michele", "ReviewID": "R16FGMDPAHZHMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a ton of research looking for a small, lightweight, multi functional, not too expensive, ultra compact digital that I could carry with me all the time.

I've been playing with it off and on for the last couple of weeks and have not had to recharge the battery from first time I charged it.  Part of my decision to buy this camera was the viewfinder which makes the camera very versatile.  The only thing I don't like about it so far is that the access doors are plastic (my husband says this is for weight) and hinge on flimsy plastic but I figure that if they break, it would be an easy fix.  Also, you absolutely need to buy a larger capacity memory card.  I could only take 8 pictures with the one it came with before it was full.

Initially, I was only wanting more zoom than the A80 provided (3X).  But when I saw the SD800 IS, I had to have it.  The main attractions for me were the image stabilization, the compact size, wide angle & the quality of the LCD (very bright & sharp).  The face recognition focusing was an added bonus.  After using the SD800 for about 2 months now, I am very pleased.  I think the single most valuable feature is it's ability to take such great pictures in low light situations without having to use flash--all due to the image stabilization allowing slower shutter speeds.  This results in VERY natural (not flash washed-out) indoor photos, and combine that with wide angle, extremely fast shot-2-shot times (due to the Digic 3 processor) and you have a class-leading sub-compact camera.  There is a little corner softness noticeable in wide-angle, but you really have to look close to even see it.  In prints up to 8X11 you won't see it.Throw in a very nice movie mode (even though you cannot use the optical zoom during filming--digital zoom only), and you have yourself quite a camera in a very compact package.Yes, the USB port door is quite flimsy as everyone says, but with just a little careful handling, it's not likely to break--definitely not a deal breaker.I still wanted more zoom, so I also bought the Canon Powershot S3 IS 12X zoom in addition to the SD800.

I've set the camera to Manual and used the Vivid setting and found this to be the most optimal setting for image quality. Colors are well saturated.... no take in mind, this is all with proper lighting and if the subject/subjects are close enough for this camera's mediocre built-in flash.CONS: After over 100 shots testing the image quality at each ISO setting in low light conditions, I've found that anything over ISO 400 with the SD800 is VERY noisy.  In fact, you can probably get away with the noise at ISO 800 if you don't print anything larger than a 4x6. But the noise is just unbearable and using post processing software will remove the noise at the expense of detail. The Image Stabilization is fine during most light conditions, but it does a really subpar job in an indoor environment.OVERALL: I'm impressed by this camera. It's above average amongst most ot the point-and-shoot cameras I've used in the past. As I said, this camera's performance is like night and day in regards to lighting conditions. Many people tend to expect DSLR results from a point and shoot, but that's what this Canon SD800 IS is, a POINT-AND-SHOOT.  I have yet to see a P&S; shooter have the equivalent result of an SLR or DSLR. Of other P&S; I've tried that are not as expensive as the Canon SD800, I would try Panasonic's line of Lumix cameras.

I can press the shutter button down half way to autofocus and then do the full step to take a picture and then release the button only half way to maintain the previous focus. Doing this, I can take almost 2 pictures a second! I've read about some people getting 'dust' or 'ghosts' with some high ISO shots, but so far I haven't noticed anything but incredibly clear pics. Night shots are just GORGEOUS. If you set it up on a little $10 tabletop tripod and aim it almost anything at night outside, then set it for 3 to 8 seconds of exposure, the PICTURES WILL LOOK FANTASTIC! Such a big aperture on this camera. Sounds great, yeah? Well, there's more! Canon's newest Digic III processor will boot this camera up and allow you to take a picture in about 1 second (I had my gf time it with a stop watch and it's factual). That is just amazing to me! My old Canon S45 took at least 5 seconds. When you aim at someone's face and the face detect is 'ON', it's really cool to watch, because it puts the subject's face in brackets so you KNOW that its working (up to 7 faces!). This is a quality product and I'm looking forward to capturing important memories on my trip to Holland in a week. When you do get this camera (not if!), you MUST get a case. And it MUST be hard or semi hard and leather.. well, its just a personal preference really. You also MUST get a screen protector. NOT OPTIONAL. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:I am going to Holland in a week with my GF, so I got some extra SD cards for it: Transcend 4 GB 150X, Corsair 2 GB 133X, 3 Kingston 2 GB (not sure of the speed). With the Kingston cards, I can take almost 2 pictures a second without flash. NO JOKE. Same thing with the other cards, too, but I'm still in awe with how well this camera performs. I also ordered some extra chinese LN-B5's and they seem to work OK so far. I didn't want to chance it, though, so I also ordered the Tekkeon MP3300 and the Tekkeon MP1500, WOW! You could hook the 1500 up to your cell and get almost 6 hours of TALK TIME! Literally! IT USES 4 AA's! Look it up! If you're into digiscoping, you'll have to get a universal mounting bracket, cuz the SD800 doesn't have a thread mount yet (as far as I know).I hope you get this camera, because you'll have a lot of fun!

So I thought it was time for another try, and that image stabilization might be an important feature for her.Like many others I am sure, for me it came down to the SD800 IS, SD850 IS and the new SD870 IS.  I knocked the SD850 out of the running due to the lack of the wide angle lens.  So it was down to the 800 vs. 870.  No easy answer here, but the new features on the 870 were not quite compelling for me, and I liked the feel of the SD800 better as far as a place for your thumb while shooting (the SD870 has a bigger LCD screen, so less real estate for your thumb when shooting), and I liked having the viewfinder for those times when it can come in handy (like bright sunlight which can wash out the LCD screen).  Plus, the price on the SD800 at this point is very compelling (right here from Amazon), and almost felt like a steal for the camera I was getting.The early results from the SD800 IS are excellent.  I love the wide angle lens, and it really is a nice option to have.  You can always zoom in, or move closer to your subject if necessary, but if you need a wide angle lens, then only a wide angle lens will do.  The pictures look great, and certainly better than the SD550.  IS works well, face detection works well.  All in all, a fabulous camera, especially for its current price.

This is a camera small enough to take with you everywhere, and whenever the moment arises, you can take a video.  A couple of caveats though: Video is best in good lighting, and the zoom kills the quality very quickly, even with just the slightest zoom.  Otherwise, the video quality is surprisingly good.ps - DVD Flick is a great piece of freeware that will easily convert any video into DVD Format or even an iso that can be burned to DVD or CD.

I tried the Nikon S50, but the picture quality was pretty poor so I sent it back. This Canon was the largest and heaviest (and most expensive) that I was considering, but I went ahead and bought it because of the high marks that most people gave it and because of the wide-angle lens.So how is it? Well, it's okay. I've discovered that all ultracompact digital cameras are a mixture of features and compromises, and no camera has \"everything.\" This one feels solid (nothing rattles) and it starts up really fast -- I think it's ready to take a picture in less than one second. Is it easy to use? Easy enough to take pictures in automatic point-and-shoot mode, and of course you have to do more diddling around in manual mode. I've seen worse and I've seen better menu systems on cameras. The battery seems to last a long time (not true of the Nikon S50). The barrel distortion in wide angle shots bothers me quite a bit, and there's nothing that you can do about that. It doesn't seem to have any intelligence in the flash system -- mostly either on or off. And I can't tell that the face detection is working -- I don't see it select a face very often in the focusing box. Speaking of the AF box, in auto mode it often focuses on the wrong objects in the picture, and it's hard to get it to pick out the right things. I need to switch to center focus, I guess.To be honest, after using the camera for a few weeks I'm not that excited about it.

The camera is pocketable, feels like it is of great quality, is very easy to use, the screen is big and easy to see, there are quick response and power-on times, and good times between flashes. The pictures taken are excellent, and the 7.1MP resolution is great for my needs. The image stabilization is great for preventing blurriness in general, and is expecially helpful for preventing blur with low light, nighttime, digitally zoomed and no-flash shots. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie mode, due to the great quality of both video and audio.I have only one issue with the camera, and two very minor ones. My main issue is that there is no battery meter; you don't know how much power you have left until the red battery warning starts flashing, and you have only 3-5 shots worth of battery left. IT would be nice to know how much power I have left to some degree, such as a meter telling me the battery is full, 75%, 50%, 25% and redline. The battery life is good anyway, but I take a may take 200+ pictures on an outing, and this is a concern for me, though having only been a problem twice in 3 months. The minor issues are that you might have to retake some macro shots because there aren't any manual focus conrols (to my knowledge). Also, don't expect the face-recognition to be magical; it doesn't work too well if people are not facing the camera, though the camera focuses well in general anyway.Despite the above small issues, I am very happy with the SD800 IS and I'll be using it for a long time.

Looking at a few models, the sd800 looked like a good option, with a 7mp resolution vs. our 610's 6mp, IS, which came in very handy during the holidays (we took 1600 pictures in about 16 days), and a familiar user interface we were well used to.Initial use of the camera was great.  My wife was VERY happy with the form factor, being able to drop it right into a pocket, vs. the 610 being about double the size, considering all the dimenions.Then about 5 days into our trip, as we were heading towards the active lava fields in hawaii for a hike out to the lava, and our camera died!  Battery dead!  Ugh!  It was fairly late in the day, so we decided to head back to our cottage, recharge, and head back to the lava flows the next day.  What had happened, was I had charged the camera the night before, then decided to transfer the pictures over to my laptop, and forgot to turn the camera off overnight, draining some of the power.In any event, after that, we looked in the manual to see what the average lifespan/picture capacity was on a single charge.  The manual said around 300 pictures w/ lcd, and 600 or so w/o.  The battery pack being around 1100mah, I realized the difference.  We normally use 4 AA 2300 mah energizer/dynacharge rechargables in our 610, which last -forever- and easily can take over a thousand pictures (i've never sat and tried to take that many), the sd800 has only 1/8th the battery capacity.Overall, I would highly recommend the camera, as a great quick point&shoot;, small compact you can toss in your pocket, purse, backpack, etc.  If you decide to buy it, I highly recommend that you get a second battery pack for it.  They swap in and out very easy, and will save alot of grief when you're vacationing somewhere and run out of battery power.  The recharge time on the batteries is great too, around an hour or 2 to completely recharge.dwight s.ps:  Just a quick note I forgot to mention in my review. After taking numerous pictures, I printed 62 5x7s, 10 8x10s and 3 11x14's from pictures taken with this camera, using walmart's online photo service (they are across teh road from my office).It was the first time I had really printed large size digital pictures and I must say, i was -thoroughly- impressed with the quality of the shots printed at 11x14 and gave them to my wife for christmas. She was quite surprised and very happy to see the shots printed and framed.We've got the two canon's now, the sd800 and an a610, and i would say we've completely switched to digital photography from 35mm film.

However, with SD800 you have to work much harder to take a bad picture with it, than any other camera I have owned. I've done a lot of testing of it, night shots and even (not recomended) bright sun in the picture on a crystal clear blue sky morning of jet contrails, they came out very good. The full auto modes work great. If you use the limited simi-manual mode, you'll have to learn how this camera works, to get the best use out of that mode. Buy at least a 1 gig memory card.

Hello?!? The camera is the size of a credit card and as thick as an Ipod. It has a huge LCD display. Of course the dials are small. But I bought the camera to take great pictures, and that's what it does. And for all those people obsessed with the flush mounted on/off button, get over it. It is simple to use, and is out of the way of vital functions. After half an hour of getting familiar with the camera and settings, those so-called issues will be gone. Also, unlike my previous Canon, the settings and menus are much easier to navigate.That display is incredibly bright and accurate. I was on the bridge in full noon sunlight wearing sunglasses, and the display was still easy to see and use.The books and literature that come with the camera look daunting at the beginning. But once you actually start using the camera, they become much less intimidating. The CD software installs easily and is easy to use.The one caveat is the memory card. The one that comes with the camera has so little memory, it is practically useless. Spend a little money and buy yourself one or two high capacity cards.

Start up is superfast and writing to my SD card is so much faster than my old camera. I have taken a couple of dozen indoor shots without flash and they came out great. The image stabilization really works. Outdoor shots came out clear and the colors are so vibrant. I didn't need to install any software to transfer the pictures to my desktop (I'm using Windows Vista). The computer detected the camera automatically and gave me options as to which photo program to use to view my pictures. My laptop will be even easier since it has a built in card reader.The camera feels comfortable in my hands and the controls are easy to access, although my hands are small and it might be a little harder for someone with large hands to use this camera. The mode dial is sometimes a little tricky to turn and I end up pushing it so hard, I turn past the setting I wanted. Best to use your thumb on that dial. I like the lighted power button and the LCD Monitor is large and bright. The one reviewer was correct when they said that the pictures come out clearer than the monitor sometimes displays. I haven't needed to use the viewfinder yet to take a shot, but living in Florida, I know that this feature will be handy on a very bright day. The lens opens and retracts quickly and I am enjoying the wide angle feature. We just remodeled our house and it's great being able to take shots of an entire room to send to family members. I haven't noticed any distortions on the sides yet.The one complaint that is justified is how flimsy the battery and terminal covers are. I'm really surprised that Canon would use such cheap plastic on such a quality camera. I actually feel like I'm performing delicate surgery when I'm connecting the interface cable to the camera to transfer pictures to my computer. It's not a deal breaker, but I'll be very disappointed if either of these covers break off. I would give this camera 4 1/2 stars if I could just because of this issue. I also think that Canon could do better than a 16 Mg SD card. Cards are cheap now and at least a 512 mg card would give you a chance to get started before you upgraded to a larger card.That said, this really is a wonderful camera. Please do not compare this to a more expensive SLR camera. This is a point and shoot with some nice features, but it's not what a professional would use. I love that I can easily take this with me anywhere I go and always be ready for that perfect \"photo op\". A camera won't do me much good sitting home in a camera bag (which is what my Kodak Z7590 does- great camera, but too big and bulky to carry around).Do your homework before purchasing any camera and be realistic about which features are most important to you. There a quite a few good professional review web sites out there. I think that this camera's best features are the size, image stabilization, and wide angle lens.* update 09/07/2011....

The still camera features are great, don't get me wrong. However, I have an S400 and to this day, it has hiss/sizzle-free video (even after it has endured incredible abuse I would not wish on my worst enemies). How is it that Canon screws up something that was fixed MANY generations ago? I just sent Canon USA a note explaining the situation and noting that I'm far more inclined to get a full refund from Amazon than endure weeks of waiting only to get another hissing/sizzling video mode SD800IS. If they don't respond in 3 days or less, I will move forward with the full refund. I LOVE my S400, and if it wasn't for this hissing/sizzling sound with video, I'd LOVE my 800IS too.Has anyone found a solution to this apart from gambling that I receive a hiss/sizzle-free 800is if I arranged an exchange? I've seen youtube videos of an 800is without this sound, so I know there are functioning versions of this model on this planet we call earth. The question is whether Canon USA cares enough to give a loyal Canon camera customer the quality product he was expecting the first time he bothered to buy a newer model.I look forward to updating this comment as my situation progresses.Oh, and yes, the battery/sd card cover is extremely CHEAP. Everything else about the camera feels nice and sturdy, why cut costs on the surface that's protecting the memory card and battery?If I didn't know video mode existed, I'd definitely keep this camera.

(wow, time flies!) It was an upgrade from my Canon SD300 4MP (my first digital camera, bought around in 2004. Paid $500 for it! But it was a good investment since I'm still using it, and it's still working the same -- close to 5 years later! I've taken it on many trips and it has taken a lot of beating.) Ironically, this SD800 camera, that was an upgrade for me, was less than half the cost. Was it worth the upgrade for me? Yes. The larger screen, wider lens, SDHC support (SD300's now outdated technology was limited to 2GB), LCD auto-rotation (portrait and landscape), image stabilizer (it was a lot harder to hold still with the SD300, especially when asking people to take pictures for me without using flash; to get around that, it's best to shoot in snapshots and hope that one of them comes out sharp) and the added mega pixels for larger prints/cropping was definitely worth it. However, I don't find the SD300 obsolete because it's still much smaller and still shoots great photos.Many cameras these days shoot in HD (1080 or 720) now. However, I was surprised to find out the video quality on this camera (max resolution at 640x480) still beats the low-end HD cameras, with poor sensor, that just interpolate to higher resolutions (it looks so awful - I'm talking about you, Mr. Sanyo TH-1!). Even though the video capability on this camera is a bit outdated now, I still find use for shooting with this camera.Even after all these years, I still love both my point and shoot cameras. It's just a no question that Canon is a leading camera company. I also recently bought an old Canon A-1 35mm film camera (made in the 1970's) and the build quality and technology on it still impressed me. Canon has my trust in cameras. Period.

I use digital cameras mostly for art reference photos, and need them to have quick point-and-shoot capability.  After my first Canon Elph (the S110, I believe) fell into the Andaman Sea from a boat, I upgraded to the SD400, which I loved for its compact size and quick point-and-shoot feature.  I had that one for 2 years, until it fell onto a rock and broke.  I recently purchased an upgrade of that camera -- the SD800 IS -- after researching all the current digital cameras on the market.  I wanted 5+ megapixels, good optical and digital zoom (4X), compact size, and quick response.  I have been disappointed with the SD800 IS in nearly every way, except that it does take a good picture once it sets itself up.  However, this is NOT a quick response camera.  The on-off switch is very difficult to find without looking for it, as it is flush with the face.  It also takes the camera a second to adjust to any setting changes; the SD400 was much quicker that way, and took pictures of the same high quality.  I thought the image stabilization feature would make for clearer pictures, but I can tell no difference in quality between this camera and its predecessor, which did not have image stabilization.

And due to the scrutiny of the forums, I immediately had to test it. I compared exact duplicate shots from my SD550 to this \"upgrade\" sd800. I am very sad to say that in normal shooting conditions, this model just couldn't keep up. The main things I saw the sd800 losing horribly to the sd550 in were: picture clarity, sharpness (edge to edge) and color accuracy (the sd800's produces a very warm shot, too much yellow & red). This was a disappointment indeed when you compare the fact that my sd550 is almost a year old.Now, on the flip-side, and should you ever find yourself in \"overhead fan lighting,\" this will be where the true benefits of the sd800 become VERY clear. If this is how you shoot, the IS will become a lifesaver for every single shot. But aside from a museum or other \"no flash,\" location, RARELY am I not using the flash on my camera. And I found the trick to not having over-saturation or too much flash contrast (whatever the model) is to just lower the brightness setting prior to shooting and use a bit of Photoshop shadow highlight love. (Although this can never fully prevent your shot from the flashlight effect left on objects from shooting, but it helps). This camera is only ideal for shooting in an IS situation. Period. Or at least IMHO, but it is my review right? lolMy solution was simple. I ended up taking a risk against better judgment, returned the sd800, and got the sd900. Let me just say that the quality from this camera will NEVER be achievable from an SD800. So make the call. If IS is your \"make or break feature,\" go for the 700is, or800is. However if its quality you want from your shots, and you aren't found in low light situations often, the 550 or 900 are the way to go!

I own six cameras (Canon (2), Nikon, Olympus, Panasomic, & Sony - point and shoot to a $1500 SLR) and this little camera is my FAVORITE.

I owned an SD700 which I gave to my daughter (I guess that makes 7) before I bought the SD800. What I really like about the 800 is the wide-angle (28mm vs.35mm)capability. However, you do give up slight zoom capability (3.8X zoom vs.4.0 on the 700). The camera is shirt-pocket small and for most travel photography the enhanced wide-angle is a real plus since you're often too close to large shots and the 3.8 tele is far better than other cameras its size. (For travel, I also carry my Panasonic TZ which although a bit larger has a 10X optical zoom for animal/people shots.) The stabilization and selectable focus aspects of this camera are far superior to anything in its class or price-range. In fact most point-and-shoot users will just use this camera in AUTO mode and never utilize its broad capabilities. Although missing on most new P&S; cameras, the 800, like the 700, has a viewfinder in addition to the screen-- this is important in varying light conditions and if you're conserving battery time.CON: I don't particularly like the small mode select button-- it's just kinda dorky.

The wide angle is fantastic but a little frustrating as well because you have to zoom in first to get the photo I used to get automatically on my Canon 550. However, I love the pictures this takes and of course its video features.  I'm a Realtor and I use it over my very expensive brand new Rebel XTi for which I also had to purchase a wide angled lens, to take pictures of homes. The Elph is the camera that is in my purse all the time. One complaint about the 800 is that very often the flash doesn't go off in dark rooms. I think it is confused by light in windows, etc. and I can't find any way to override that. I'm not sure why, not even if I press a second time to help it adjust. That is frustrating me still.

But it may be just a bit too stylish for its own good. For instance, the power button is a tiny, illuminated half-oval built flush into the top panel; without actually pressing it, you might easily mistake it for an indicator light or a design flaw.The Canon PowerShot SD800's mode dial curves slightly outward, flowing into the design of the camera, making a comfortable resting spot for your thumb. But it feels slightly slippery when switching camera modes.Beyond those quirks, though, the SD800 IS is a standard, straightforwardly designed Canon shooter, with a four-way navigation switch, additional buttons, and the shutter-release/zoom-rocker mechanism we've grown used to. The small, all-metal body weighs slightly more than six ounces, and at an inch thick, is just the right size for most pockets. Though small, the camera still has enough room on its body to hold both a 2.5-inch LCD and an optical viewfinder, a rare and welcome feature on an ultracompact.The SD800's most prominent feature is its image-stabilized, f/2.8-to-f/5.8, 28mm-to-105mm-equivalent lens. The 3.8X zoom range offers the flexibility of wide-angle focal lengths, while still providing a bit more zoom power than the average 3X point-and-shoot lens. Though the SD700 IS had a 4X zoom lens, the SD800's 28mm-equivalent wide shot more than makes up for the slightly smaller telephoto factor.In addition to the flexible lens, the SD800 IS has some handy snapshot features. The camera's sensor can be boosted to as high as ISO 1,600 for low-light or high-movement shots, though you'll want to keep it at ISO 800 or lower because of image noise. You can shoot 30fps VGA video, or bump it up to 60fps QVGA (320x240) to capture action footage for half-speed playback. If you're looking for manual controls, however, look elsewhere; like the SD700, the SD800's aperture and shutter settings can't be changed except for a long shutter mode, its focus modes are all automatic, and the camera's manual mode allows only exposure compensation, color correction, metering, and white-balance adjustments.The SD800 also uses the recent Digic III image processor, which Canon claims improves image quality, performance, and battery life. We didn't notice any significant improvements over the SD700's already good performance, but the SD800 seemed slightly more responsive than its predecessor. It performed excellently in our lab tests. Just 1.1 seconds after the power button was pressed, it was able to take its first shot and subsequently could snap off a shot every 1.3 seconds. Even with the onboard flash enabled, we experienced a lag of only 2 seconds between shots. Shutter lag was a negligible 0.4 second. The only disappointment was the camera's burst mode, which managed only one shot per second.Shooting speed(Shorter bars indicate better performance) Typical shot-to-shot time  Time to first shot  Shutter lag (typical)Casio Exilim EX-Z10003.5 1.8 0.3Sony Cyber Shot DSC-T301.6 1.8 0.4Canon PowerShot SD800 IS1.3 1.1 0.4Canon PowerShot SD700 IS1.6 1.5 0.5Note: In secondsTypical continuous-shooting speed(Longer bars indicate better performance)Canon PowerShot SD700 IS2.0Sony Cyber Shot DSC-T301.4Canon PowerShot SD800 IS1.0Casio Exilim EX-Z10000.4Note: Frames per secondPhotos were attractive, with fine detail rendering and solid color reproduction. Aside from some slight purple fringing along the borders of bright subjects, we noticed few distortions or aberrations in our photos. Image noise was acceptable to as high as ISO 800, manifesting as a fine grain that dulled colors but otherwise didn't mar photo quality too much. ISO 1,600 was a different story; a sparkly, static-filled mess that made the photo look as if it were received via a television antenna.The Canon PowerShot SD800 IS is a great point-and-shoot camera. It's small, it sports a stabilized, wide-angle lens, and it can pump out beautiful shots at a pretty rapid pace. If you want higher resolution and don't mind losing the optical image stabilization--though we don't recommend the tradeoff--the Canon PowerShot SD900 and the Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 offer 10 megapixels in ultracompact bodies.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera!", "Author": "DesiInCT", "ReviewID": "R3O5LD00EBAQ3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really nice camera and the pictures are excellent out doors and really good in low-light indoors.

Taking Pictures", "Author": "Kat", "ReviewID": "R1O9OYU5DSZEHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since sometime either late 2006 or early 2007, and I couldn't be happier with it, still. I own a Nikon DSLR but this little Canon point-and-shoot goes with me everywhere. Over the past 4+ years it has endured everything - it's been dropped, thrown (accidentally), sat on, spilled on, and even once submerged in water for a full minute... and it STILL works and takes great pictures! It is rare that I find a piece of technology that can withstand my day to day life, but this Canon camera has been my constant sidekick for years without fail.Pros: It's a sturdy little beast that can withstand a lot of unintentional abuse without being bulky and unattractive. It has a great battery life, I almost never charge it, even years later. The pictures come out with gorgeous color quality, much better than most point-and-shoot cameras (Canon as a whole seems to have a good rep for color quality). And it's such an easy to use camera, I've even given it to my technologically-challenged mother to take on trips and she was able to capture some great shots with it. You can use it as a plain old point-and-shoot, where you just press a button and are done with it, or you can play with the manual settings and give it a little more personalization.Cons: I honestly have a hard time thinking up anything bad about this camera. The only issue I've had is with lighting and flash. The flash tends to wash out images, to me, and detracts a little from the color quality. But without the flash, on automatic setting, the camera's \"Auto\" ISO setting won't pick up enough light and leaves the image grainy. So in darker settings you have to either stick with the flash and risk over-exposed, washed-out pictures, or really know how to play with the manual settings to get just the right exposure for the shot. For the majority of people though, that is a non-issue. Oh, and I do suppose another con could be that the resolution of videos tends to be pretty low unless you're in a very bright setting. But again, a non-issue for the main use of this camera, taking pictures.Overall, I'd recommend this camera to anyone. I know it's not on the market anymore, as Canon has upgraded several times in the intervening years, but if you're looking to buy a used camera to throw in your purse or backpack and take with you for impromptu photo ops, this is the one to get. I hope it hangs tough for another few years before I have to replace it... and when that sad day does come, I'll definitely be getting another Canon.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Go-To Camera for 5 or 6 years!", "Author": "Joe Harlow \"Torque\"", "ReviewID": "R217H2GVXNFDVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned one of these cameras since it came out, whenever that was (2005-2006?)and while I have several other Canon cameras this one is always with me.

I shoot it on \"manual\" all the time with the flash off normally.  You do have to check what it is focusing on and you need to really look to see what the light meter is doing to the photograph.  If it is too dark you need to cheat it a little is all, no problem.  I think that people that complain about this camera are not really thinking about what they are doing expecting the camera to do it all, ain't happenin'!  My only problem printing with these images is I get carried away sharpening it too much sometimes, consider the source I tell myself, it has a sensor the size of your little fingernail so what do you expect?

I have a backpack full of DSLR equipment, tripod, prime lenses, and so on, but carry this little camera in a pocket so that I never miss a shot.  Its handy to have, I pop it out of my pocket to record all my travels on a seconds notice.  The size and weight fit fine in a front jeans pocket.Key features:-FAST start up, power button to photo lag is short enough to catch anything, much better than some competing cameras.-Wide angle is just right, but don't forget to zoom in for most pictures-Image Stabilization is not a gimmick, work great.-COLORS!  I use -2/3 exposure compensation, colors and exposure are great.  Tip up or down to include more or less sky for quick adjustments on the fly, half press the shutter, then frame your shot.-Tiny portable battery charger and excellent battery life.The bad:-Soft lens, especially at wide angles-Front face and screen scratch easily when used as designed, carried in a pocket with keys and change, tossed in the center console, etc.  No actual harm though, just cosmetic.The useless:-Auto mode.  Never use it.  Use manual, turn the flash off, add -2/3 or so EC for better exposure and colors.-Viewfinder.  Battery life is good enough that I don't bother shooting with the LCD turned off.  Tiny, hard to use, inaccurate, dim.I have taken dozens of identical pictures with this camera and my DSLR.  I pop this baby out of my pocket, snap a shot, and slip it away again.  The DSLR gets set up with expensive prime lenses, a tripod, and mirror lockup.  Jpegs printed straight from each camera at 4x6 are HARD TO TELL APART.  Now that is some high praise!  However, when printed at 8x10 the difference is significant, and the canon is very soft.  I'm using a Minolta 7D 6mp DSLR, it has MUCH more resolution than the 7.1mp canon (megapixels are positively meaningless).  Fine color gradations are sometimes clearly better from the SLR, shadow areas appear much clearer, and noise is sometimes less.To restate: At 4x6 the canon SD800IS performs almost exactly as good as a heavy bag full of $5,000 worth of professional equipment.At 8x10, the difference is clear and obvious though and the SLR wins handily.  At larger prints, the canon is unable to perform unless your subject lends itself to low resolution.  Also, the little pocket camera cannot do super wide angles, long telephoto, blurred backgrounds, or other fancy setups.  Its limited to standard shots.  The IS works well, and you can brace the camera against fence posts, walls, or other fixed objects for longer shots.I highly recommend this camera and its replacement, the SD880IS.  A camera like this is a must have for anyone.  The whole SD series are great cameras, between friends and family I have tried about five different models and they all do well.

That was great though I always felt that that Casio isn't the one I wanted and didn't like the quality as much as possible.  Paid $200 for it too.At that time (2006), I wanted the Canon S600 or S630 but they went way over $200.  This year though, I found this great deal on a Canon...and guess what, it was an even better model (and not by little either).  An Sd800IS for $200 is phenomenal.Ok, now to talk about the features:Aesthetics: Looks great.  Thicker than my Casio Exilim but I guess the Exilim line is made extremely skinny and is a feature.  Everything seems sturdy (aside for the bottom cover).Video: Videos are very important to me and I love the quality of the videos.  Not too grainy and definitely an extreme step up from my Casio.Pictures: I knew that my videos on the Casio Exilim were ok but not good...but these just blew me out of the water!  The pics look crisp and clear.GUI: VERY confusing at first, meaning that there is a learning curve.  Even now, I get confused sometimes.  Though I guess the confusion comes from all the features that they included in this camera.  My old Casio Exilim was VERY easy to use and I loved that  but like I said, the features forces things to be like that.Features: The color swap feature is pretty ok.  Sometimes it doesn't work with darker colors BUT it does what it can.  One feature that I was really looking forward to was the the Color Accent.  It works well enough with what you have.  If you can find a good setting and you want to accentuate the colors, put this feature on and the picture really does become more than a picture...it looks more like a work of art.Battery Life: Extremely good.  I've only charged it once since I got it at the end of December and it is now February.  Sure, I'm not going around taking pics or shooting movies all the time but it has had quite a bit of use and it lasted a long time.Shutter Speed: I wish that this cam could takes pics faster.  Guess I'm spoiled a bit since my old Casio Exilim had a feature in which you could literally take pics one after the other extremely fast.  With this camera, it always takes around 1 sec to 1.5 secs to shoot again.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this camera and I'll definitely be keeping this for at least 2 years (and most probably 3 years).", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good camera, good pictures even for beginners", "Author": "Arthur Valadares", "ReviewID": "R300NAG6RZ7WJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not much of a photographer so I just wanted a camera that took good pictures with not a lot of effort.

It is an excellent camera in all respects.  While you read it over and over, the 28 mm wide angle lens really makes a difference.Recently, there have been some promotions at a big box store with some other cameras, so I decided to do a little test comparing the SD 800 IS (28mm to 105 mm), SD 850 IS (35mm to 140 mm) and the Panasonic Lumix TZ4 (28mm to 280 mm).  I just wanted to make sure that I had the camera that was right for me.As part of the test, I took about 70 photos with each camera in various lighting conditions, indoor lighting behind, indoor lighting in front, outdoor, zoom, wide angle, etc.  Because I usually use only 4x6 prints, I printed all the photos in 4x6 prints at a local photo lab.  There was no post photo processing on any of the photos.  I just wanted to see the results right out of the camera so to speak.Thus, to me, the test was as real world as possible because that is how people use the camera, you don't shoot screens of color swatches, you shoot people, things, landscapes, grass, etc.  Printing it out at a photo lab let me see the pictures as best as they could be.  All cameras were set on full auto and no special modes were used for any of the shots.The results were very intersting but hardly surprising.  With the exception of a somewhat noticeable difference in the telephoto and zoom ranges, at a 4x6 size, there is essentially no discernable difference in the pictures generated by the Canon SD 850IS and the Canon SD 800IS.  There was no difference indoors, outdoors, or anywhere else.  This is not surprising, because the cameras are very very similar, use the same processor, and only differ in the lenses.The Panasonic was another story.  It regularly failed to perform, had zoom hunting, poor focus, fringing, etc. on the indoor shots.  Outside, with plenty of light, it performed very well and produced excellent photos, but because I don't shoot exclusively outside, that was a deal killer for me.  You basically cannot shoot anything moving indoors with this camera.  Based on the reviews, I understood that this camera had limitations, but did not realize how much the processor hobbled this camera's indoor performance.So, for the SD 800IS, which is the one I will keep, here's the review:PROS:FAST: Very very very fast.  As fast a digital camera as you will find.  Noticeably faster than the SD 850IS, but they are close.PROCESSOR: Excellent photos in a wide variety of conditions.LENS: Wide angle lens is a real treat in a point and shoot.  I shot 22 kids all on one staircase and all of them fit in the picture, and I did not have to walk back any steps (or wedge myself into a corner, etc. to do it).  Also, outside, and especially outside, it is amazing what you will fit into a picture.  At 4 x 6 did not notice any distortion, but as another review noted, I don't really look at the corners of a picture, so this is not really an issue.SIZE: very small, fits anywhere.VIEWFINDER OPTIONS: Optical viewfinder, the screen is so good that you don't use this that often, but it is nice to know it is there for those really really sunny days (and they come up every so often).BATTERY: Battery life is exceptional.  Camera seems to go on for months with one battery (I think it is rated for 400+ shots, which is an astounding battery life for such a small camera).NEUTRAL:APPEARANCE: The looks of the camera.  I prefer black cameras as I used to own a film SLR and black cameras remind me of that beloved camera.  However, my wife seems to like the looks of this camera.CONS:LIMITED ZOOM: Would like a drop more zoom range, perhaps a 5x - 6x would be ideal, but it would be hard fitting a 28mm to 168mm in such a small package.FLASH: Flash is a little weak (similar on the SD850IS), but this is par for the course on a point and shoot.OPTICAL VIEWFINDER: Optical viewfinder is really small, is off center and not useful for every time composure on this camera, the camera is made to be used with the LCD on.Can't go wrong with either this or the SD 850IS, as they are essentially the same camera with different lenses, it just depends on whether you want a wide angle lens or not.

Prior to SD800 I've owned a S50 for almost 4 years and I must admit its still ways better than the new SD800. Now, I've paid only slightly less for SD800 than for my S50 in 2003 and have expected much better value per buck taking into account technology advances, yet I was miguided by many positive reviews of this camera. And it's not about the production quality but rather about the design of the camera itself.Cons:Automatic mode is useless, a lot of noise in the pictures taken indoors or when there is not su much natural light outdoors though Canon claims that there is a noice reduction filter built in. The only way to get around this is to overexpose the pictures using manual mode. Camera body is really crapy and is not resistant to scratches at all (ok, maybe I'm too demanding after havin titanium-body S50), yet my old good S50 has survived many travels, including taking it into the beach many times while SD800 has misteriously collected sand dust even after a single walk in the searshore (the sand managed to get into the background of the LCD screen with the dust visible as dead pixes when watching the shots).Pros:Wide angle is nice, yet not as useful as many claim in the reviews. The camera is light and performs relatively well when doing nightshots (in the manual mode of course). The handling is easy (until one goes to the manual mode), it is possible to zoom-in and out when taking video (which was not possible and was somewhat irritating in my old S50), the screen size and the battery life is also really good for the camera of such size.Haven't tried new S70 but my guess is that it might have retained some of the good qualities of S50, so my recommendation would be to avoid Canon IS line if possible and look at Nikon, they have some real nice cameras nowadays.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not sharp and crisp - poor image quality", "Author": "Yasar Faster \"World Traveler\"", "ReviewID": "R1DLJQ2Q08OB1M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been into photography for over forty years, starting with Pentax single lense reflex cameras.

Physically it is a beautiful piece of work, with very intuitive software, a pleasure to operate.  But aside from close-ups, the pics aren't crisp and sharp.

But my main concern is the picture quality I am receiving!! While on my camera (through the LCD) the picture looks good.  However, when I try to print, (either at home or at the lab) the pictures all seem to have a \"cast\" over them. Almost like a grey coloring, and VERY digital looking!

Wang \"Froggie\"", "ReviewID": "R74F1CFDUI2NW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is actually my third Canon camera. I had a S230 years ago and a S500. Eventually, I graduated to this SD800 because I wanted a wider angle. Upon receiving the product, I found that when I zoomed in to the max on a uniformly white object, i.e. a wall, there is a blurred shadow on the lower left section of the screen. If I try to focus, the blurriness changes. It looks like there is something behind the lens or in front of the CCD.Yesterday, I tried to wipe the fingerprints on the LCD with a clean T-shirt; the T-shirt got caught in between the LCD and the metal frame. Pulling the stuck T-shirt out produced a very unsettling sound. The SD800 does not feel like a sturdy camera nor does it feel like a precision tool as the S230. The color swap option on the SD800 is awkwardly designed and never works well. The body feels clumsy and unsturdy. If you face the camera and tilt it to an angle, you can see the power light shines through the upper edge of the optical view finder. You can also see the LCD backlight shines through the hinge of the closed battery compartment door. This camera feels like it was made in China rather than Japan.This reminds me of another problem I had with my SD500. Whenever, I take my first shot in the sunlight after shooting indoors, the image had horizontal stripes from top to the bottom which looks like the image was generated by an inkjet with dirty nozzles.On the other hand my S230 performed flawlessly.From the flawless S230 to the occasional problem of the S500, to this constant problem of the SD800, my conclusion is Canon's quality is on a downward spiral. The successors to the SD800 no longer have the wide angle lens, either. SD850 and SD1000 are steps backward from the SD800.I am not sure my next camera will still be a Canon.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Solid Camera", "Author": "vishal", "ReviewID": "R3MI7XNOCSDIQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon never fails to produce great cameras, and this is no exception.

Startup time is less then a second, and time between shots is about a second as well (if it has to focus, it takes longer).  In all the reviews I read, this was the fastest point-and-shoot camera.The main selling point for me was the wide-angle zoom.

I just felt it necessary to post a testimony.  I'm just an average online consumer who occasionally orders products online.  I have no affiliation with Amazon; nor do I know anyone who works for them.  I have enough experience with online shopping to see differences in customer service.With Amazon, I've ordered products ranging from books, electronics, small appliances, and \"other\".  I've never had a problem with security with my credit card.  And all the products that I've ordered from Amazon, whether direct from them, or, was forwarded to an associate of theirs, arrived on my doorstep on time or rather, more typically, ahead of the estimated delivery dates INCLUDING DURING THE MAD RUSH OF THE HOLIDAYS!For the products that I have ordered through Amazon, I have also experienced the value (cost savings).  I can state that fact because I have performed in-depth research on the products that I have purchased before I hit the \"OK\" button.After I order my items, Amazon emails \"status\" notifications.  I can also log in and check the status of my order anytime that I want.Only once, I needed to return an item to Amazon at no fault of theirs; I had ordered the wrong item.  I returned the item unopened, completely in the same condition as they had sent it to me, and then ordered the item that I really wanted.  Amazon credited my account within 3 business days of receipt of my returned item. And, I was delighted they credited me back the cost that I paid out of my pocket for shipping the item back to them.  There was a minor hiccup with the return where initially Amazon thought that I had used one of their prepaid labels to ship the item to them.  When I emailed them explaining the mixup, within 24 hours, they emailed me a formal apology and adjusted my account.I realize that each circumstance is looked at by Amazon, as they do have return policies in place.  And perhaps as you read my testimony you are muttering something different.  I can only account for my experience with them.If you are in doubt of ordering anything online through Amazon, you can be sure that they are stellar in customer service.  In my experience of dealing with various online and various in-store customer service, I honestly thought this particular Amazon \"return\" experience was going to be a nightmare.

The positives are that aside from taking absolutely superb photos (you do NOT really need 12 mp in spite of what the manufacturers like to pretend), and even though I later bought the SD960 which has the 12 mp, I didn't really see any noticeable improvement from the 7 mp of this one.  In fact, after I got the 960, I decided I preferred the 800 for several reasons.  Above all, the 800 has a VIEWFINDER, something I found I really really missed on my 960.  Later Canons have dispensed with the viewfinder entirely, which I think is a mistake.  If you try to shoot any camera in bright light, around snow or the beach, the LCD has so much reflection you just can't see much as you compose the photo.  While the viewfinder on this 800 isn't exact (parallax), you can at least get a better idea what you are shooting in bright light if you are unable to see anything on the LCD screen.  Second, the buttons/dials on the 800 are marked with icons indicating function and overall, I find it easy and intuitive to navigate and find the settings I want.  Another nice feature is that it has wide angle and zooms from 28-105.The 800 is a bit square rather than having the rounded edges of the later Canon models, and this square shape makes it much easier to hold without it slipping through your fingers.  My 960 is a bear to use and hold, and I don't have especially large hands, either.  This 800 is only very slightly larger than later models, not enough to matter.  There is also a video mode, which can be useful for short clips (not HD, if that matters to you).  However, if I wanted to shoot real video, I'd get a real video camera and not depend on a P&S; like this. For me, the video is just a little bonus I might use here and there.  We've used it on the ski slopes to film our technique, so video from such a small camera is great in that situation.Battery life is great, and it charges quite quickly on its little charger with a fold-away plug.  You can take a LOT of photos before needing a charge.  On a trip to Hawaii, my initial battery charge never did run out in 11 days of shooting photos!  Downloading of photos is a snap.Too bad this model isn't made any more, it really is an excellent camera.

But then again, other cameras have probably become more expensive too.I bought this camera more than a year back. it has some useful features that many other cameras in this range don't. The most attractive thing for me was the wide-angle lens. For a camera of this range, the zoom is pretty much the same for all models. 3x and 4x dont make a huge difference for photography that most people do- landscapes, parties, portraits, people in front of scenery etc. But the wide-angle is very useful for all this.The camera has some interesting features like 'Color Accent'. I used it quite a bit. It gives a great effect to pictures. Check out the pictures provided by other users.The clarity of pictures is great. Don't go for more mega-pixels unless you want to jump to a much higher class of cameras. even with 7.1 the quality is great and the image size of more Mpix becomes too much to handle, especially emailing and uploading on websites.In a nutshell, but don't pay too much for it.

I think they are by far the best point and shoot cameras for the money.  Our first digital camera was mostly plastic, and in shopping around, I found that many cameras were the same.  In contrast, the SD800 feels solid and well-built.  After a year of use and almost 2000 photos, it is no worse for the wear, except for some scratches.  I think the only thing I would change is the camera's finish.  It is beautiful when new, but it really shows every little scratch.It has a large, bright LCD screen AND a viewfinder.  It uses a lithium-ion battery pack, and this was a MUST for me.  I can't stand cameras that use AA batteries (or some other disposable battery).  They are always dead when you need your camera.  I've tried the NiMH rechargeables, and they just don't last long enough, so they are also dead when you need them.  This Li-Ion battery is awesome.  It lasts an incredibly long time between charges, and it charges faster than the Li-Ion battery in our old camera.  It charges outside of the camera in a very compact charger, so if you want to keep a backup battery ready, you can.  I did just that with our previous camera, but so far we haven't needed one with this camera.  I charge the battery just before events at which I know we will want to use the camera, and it lasts so long on a charge that between those occasions it is always ready.The wide angle lens is a great feature.  I am consistently able to get shots that other people can't get because they can't back up far enough.  Perhaps my favorite feature about this camera is the control it gives you.  While it is great in full auto mode (which is why you buy a point and shoot), it also offers some very useful scene modes, and it allows for manual adjustment of several settings.  For example, you can adjust the exposure by up to 2 stops up or down, in 1/3 stop increments.  I looked at several other PowerShot models, such as the SD850 and SD900, but I liked the layout of the controls on this camera the best.We have been very pleased with the SD800.  It is fast, reliable, and takes beautiful shots.  I have been pleasantly surprised with some of the shots I have been able to get with such a compact camera.  I would personally love to have a digital SLR, but my wife wants something she can easily carry in her purse, and SLRs are too expensive.  I have really enjoyed the creative control that this little camera allows.  Perhaps the most amazing part was the price.

This camera was marketed as 'the serious photographer's side arm' & I think that's dead right. I've carried it with me pretty much the all the time, which is the whole point of owning it.As a pro of 3 decades who owned & used all formats from 10\" x 8\" to 35mm, after a lot of thought & brain-numbing research, my compact digi camera had to posses 3 prime attributes. A few mega-pixels +/- was not an issue for a camera of this sort. The following points were paramount to me.1] It had to be able to fit with ease into a shirt pocket. 2] It had to have an optical v/finder. The 'sleep-walker' posture of framing up with the screen is a no-no for a variety of reasons, not least of which is vastly increased battery drain. 3] It had to have a 28mm [35mm equiv] lens.The camera has performed well beyond my expectations. It takes wonderful photos in a wide variety of conditions, some of which I found astonishing that it should produce anything at all, let alone images of such quality. If you run the results through a lab test or compare it with cameras much higher up the quality scale, you will find things to beef about. But for a camera of this type, in the sector it inhabits, it's amazing.The deduction of 1 star comes about because the covers for the card/battery bay and the connections bay are woefully flimsy. Real care has to be taken every time these covers are opened/closed. I have a silicone 'skin' on my IXUS [which I very much recommend] and peeling apart the cut-out over the card bay and then gingerly opening the cover needs 100% concentration. One slip and you could easily tear the cover right off.This camera is now no longer on Canon's current range and there is no direct replacement. The only camera that has a 28mm w/a has no v/finder. I've complained to Canon about leaving a hole where this model used to be. There is no alternative but second-hand or 'new old stock' sellers. And note: some of these new cameras are now right back up to the original retail price!

Thanks everyone for your great reviews.On to my review.The first thing I noticed about this camera was how pretty it was - It was packaged beautifully, arrived promptly and with all the desired and mentioned extra's included.  There are various metallic accents around the lens, and on the top and bottom of the camera.  Buttons are also chrome like, the photo's of the camera don't do it justice.  But besides physical appearance, I've had nothing but positive experiences with my camera thus far.I was concerned about some of the negative reviews, the lens problems, and boggled by the choices of SD Elphs (SD 850, SD 1000, SD 700, SD 750, SD THAT, SD This, it was kind of overwhelming, especially to someone who had no idea what they were getting into.)  I Eventually decided that any lens problems were in the minority, and that any (IF) issues down the road occured, I'd just deal with them, there's a whole support website devoted to fixing the problem, so I really didn't think it would be a problem.  *Knocks on wood*Here are the various reasons I decided upon this camera out of all the other versions.1. Reviews.  The majority of reviews were very positive, and in terms of the ratio of good vs. bad, it came out like so:475 good reviews (5 and 4 star) Versus 26 bad reviews (2 and 1 star) not counting the three star reviews.Reason #2. Photo Examples.  Out of all the photos I saw taken by this camera, on the amazon website and others, the photo quality seemed to be great.  This has proven true thus far from a personal viewpoint, all my photos of my cat and family turn out well lighted and sharp, and I find the flash works well, however sometimes turning it off auto is needed. (Because sometimes the camera thinks it \"needs\" the flash, when in fact the photo would look better without it.)Reason #3. Features and Extras.  This Camera has a bagoogle of stuff to play with.  All kinds of scene modes, Color swap and Color accent features, which can also be applied to video) as well as light distorting filters that I haven't really experimented with yet.  The fact this camera has a wide angle lens is also a big plus.  The color swap mode is more addictive than tetris or pong on a boring day.  I've seen myself green, hulk style (SO much fun, really...Imagine a short video with you ripping your shirt off.)  Friends white cars turned pink, hair turned green, etc.  I'm sure soon enough I'll have people saying \"OKAY, You've seen my skin blue, put the fricking camera down.\"Reason #4. Practicality and Navigation: This Camera, and all its bagoogles of features, are integrated into the camera beautifully.  I don't find them detracting from my photo-shooting experiences, because they're tucked out of the way, and don't clutter things up.  However, when you need them, you need but flip a switch to summon a plethora of options available, such as ISO and Scene Modes.Reason #5. It's pretty, Yeah, it's got a green light that emanates from the top of the camera, it really looks nice.Reason #6.  Macro.  I bought this camera originally as a means of obtaining textures and reference photos.  A lot of the textures I need are macros (Skin, dirt, etc) and I found this camera to have a very professional macro that seems to focus very well, even when almost touching the camera to the surface of whatever it is you're shooting.That's all! That's why I chose this camera.  I believe this camera would be a great choice for anyone who's not a megapixelfile, or too picky about having a ton of manual choices.  For the shutterbug who doesn't want to get too involved and caught up in all the complexities that a camera can present, I think this little Bugger will serve you well for simply taking good photos.Thanks for reading! : )PS: I bought an 8 GB SDHC Card along with this camera - search for transcend 8 GB in amazon.  For 35 bucks or so 8 GB is great, and the card is compatible with this camera and very reliable. : )PS #2: I'll be sure to come back and edit this review as I spend more time with my camera.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great quality camera", "Author": "Y.M.", "ReviewID": "R133KIIPBQTNY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love This camera.

This was her first digital camera and she has quickly mastered many of the advanced functions and taken some really nice pictures.  Besides taking great quality pictures, an AWESOME feature that sets this camera apart from most is that it has the ability to zoom out so far that you have a wide angle function.  This is very usefull when you want to take a picture of several people at the same time.  I considered the SD870 which has some improvements over the SD800 but the lack of an optical viewfinder was a deal-breaker and forced the decision to buy the SD800 instead.  We all ask others to take our picture and not everyone is used to using an LCD screen to take a picture.  Having an optical viewfinder is important.  Also, when it is really bright, the light tends to wash out the LCD screen on digital cameras and having an optical viewfinder is nice.  Hey Canon - don't leave this feature off of cameras!

The image stabilization appeared to be defective, because as hard as I would try, I could not see any difference in side by side shots with IS on, off, or continuous --- in spite of consistent attempts to create movement.  When IS works properly, it should allow for clear shots without the flash indoors, and that was never the case for me.  Also, the red auto-focus beam has an on/off option in the menu.  Whether I turned it to on or off, it did not matter, the beam always came on.  Considering I'm trying to photograph my newborn son, it creates a problem, cause the red beam disturbs the little guy.  Furthermore, the red beam keeps you from taking surprise/stealth pictures of people --- it always announces what you are doing.Some other things that I didn't like:-The picture quality was mediocre.  I used to get better results with my old Sony 2 mega pixel, and my previous 2 mega pixel Nikon.  Too, too many pictures were just not sharp and clear like I was hoping for.  What's the use of 7 mega-pixels, if the sharpness is not there.-Date stamp only possible on postcard resolution, which was 2 mega-pixel.  You should have the option regardless of resolution.-No \"review button,\" to see the most recent picture at any time.  You must switch the rotary dial from picture taking, to picture review, and then back to continue taking pictures to continue taking pictures.  Minor inconvenience, because you could adjust the time that picture remains on screen once you take it.-You can't crop pictures until you transfer pictures to computer.  My old, cheap Sony would let you zoom and crop any image on the spot.  Minor inconvenience.-Another minor inconvenience, but it would be nice if you could charge the battery without having to remove it --- lets say simply by plugging in the USB cable to a laptop for example.Things I did like include:-Beautiful casing and design.-The video was excellent, with good picture and very good sound.-Very good battery life.-Very feature-packed, even though some weren't functioning for me, as indicated.-Nice the way you could sort through the files on the memory card, by type, date, and other parameters.-Wide-angle feature is very handy even though it slightly distorts the images on the edges.", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon SD800", "Author": "Jose Hernandez \"JTH\"", "ReviewID": "R1WARSVM8188F2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best camera for the price.

Most people will never know the difference, unless you splice (stich) the wide angle shots, which is never a good idea (even when I used to do it with film cameras and prints).

Santamaria", "ReviewID": "R13ECNFR7M4FU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was recommended to me by a friend who works as a commercial photographer with one and only one caveat: that it doesn't shoot raw images.  He felt it was a top notch point and shoot which did its job and then some. As far as point and shoots go, the SD800 meets the important criteria: sleek, portable and very easy to use. What makes the camera really stand out, though, are the advance features and the ease of using them. A lot of times, the advanced features are gimmicks that sound good, but don't produce quality images. In this case, many of the ones I've tested improve the quality of the images. One example is the night shot. I found that it helps get a good image under reduced light whether or not you keep the flash on. I like that this camera allows the user to make a lot of manual adjustments, but works quite well, left on auto. Another strength of this camera is the user guide that accompanies the camera. Actually, it comes with a basic and an advanced guide that are laid out very clearly and allow the user to easily learn the camera's most sophisticated features.Out of the box, you have everything you need to get going for 5 or 6 photos. And that's the biggest shortcoming of the camera. They ship a 16mb sd memory card with the camera. This is kind of a not funny joke and you'll have to purchase a card. The 2 gigabyte cards(which will hold a lot of images) run about $25 to $50 depending on where you purchase them and if you opt for higher speed cards(not really necessary since this camera doesn't shoot raw.) You'll also need to purchase a case for the camera. And I recommend purchasing an additional battery as back-up. That said, the battery charger is small enough to travel along with you.Other: I was impressed with the quality and ease with which you can record 640 by 480 movies. And the camera display automatically rotates the image in playback when you rotate the camera(much like the new i-phone does.)Overall, for the price: this point and shoot comes and goes highly recommended.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "mimi", "ReviewID": "RR3R51KOK6A10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera for the pictures it takes and the fact that you can just pop it in your purse or pocket.

Not to mention the bump up to 7.1 MP from the SD700 (6 MP), this camera is definitely worth the extra $.

Do I understand that Canon's model numbering system is garbage, and that the numbers do not indicate relative quality, or even improvements/updates in a series?2.  Do I realize that cramming more megapixels onto a small sensor will do nothing more than add noise to my photos?3. Do I find that I'm constantly backing up to get everything into the shot while taking pictures?If you answered yes to 2 or more, then buy this camera.  It has all the features one would expect from something you can carry in your pocket and it is a piece of cake to use.  Any learning-disabled clown could use this thing, so don't worry about buying it as a gift for an old person.  Combine this camera with some Picassa 2 action and you've got great pics.  Movie mode is nice as well, and includes a high framerate option.Also, Amazon is the cheapest place to buy the underwater shell.  Morons on ebay are paying more than this price to get one used.

I was originally going for the Cannon SD630 but decided to upgrade to the Cannon Powershot SD800IS. After getting it home and trying all of its features this is what I found.1. The pictures have alot more \"noise\" (grainy) in them than my old camera's pictures even on the automatic setting. And of course the higher you manually set the ISO the more noise you'll get. The pictures looked flat with no depth to them and sometimes the colors were a little more washed out than my old cammera (which by the way was the same price as the SD800IS 5 years ago.)2. I bought this camera for low light pictures.  It doesn't really do much better than the other camera's because they all have the same small flash size.  I tested with over a hundred pictures and different settings and it still didn't impress me.3. As far as the color swap feature, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  I tried replacing red with blue and all's I got was a blue tint over the whole picture. I also tried color swapping my daughters shirt from pink to black and I just got the same thing - black tint over the whole picture.I have to be fair and say that other than these issues the cammera seemed to be fine.  But I'm taking it back because for that kind of money I expect it to take better pictures than my old cammera and it didn't. The only advantage it has is a bigger LCD screen and I care more about the quality of pictures it takes. I think Cannon went cheap on this product.  They don't even use the Carl Zeiss lens anymore.

The photo quality just isn't very good.  The photos I have taken are not noticeably better than - and sometimes worse than - ones I took with my 4-megapixel A80.  Everything looks gorgeous on the LCD screen when you first take the shot, but when you pull them up on the computer, you have noise, noise, and more noise, especially if you shot in Auto mode.  You can reduce the noise in manual mode, but it's still noticeable.  And the lens has a very low depth of field, even when you have autofocus turned off.Friends have told me I'm expecting too much from a point-and-shoot. Maybe I am.  I have concluded that if you go with a camera this small you need to be willing to sacrifice optical quality.  And I am not.Whether this camera is right for you depends on what your needs are.

Very amazing I must say.  * I was not thrilled with the dial on this one.  It's a pain to turn and not comfortable.  * Lastly, It's heavier than most of the other Canon's and a little bulky.Canon is an excellent brand and the only one I will ever buy, but save your money on this one and opt for one of the others- SD750 or SD800.  Especially if you want to photograph people.I returned this on and purchased the SD750 ...Again.

Here are a few examples:1. When shooting from a shadow or shade and taking a picture of something bright like a snow capped mountain or sun rise. Awful!!!2. Taking a picture during dusk on the beach where the sun will be bright but the rest of the photo is dark. The camera just struggles to adjust.On this latest trip i was on a friend had a DSC-T200 which took amazing photos of exactly the same things I did without having to tweak any settings. Plus if you do a feature comparison - they are not even close.The choice is yours, but I might go the Sony way next time.Good Luck!", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cannon Camera Purchase", "Author": "Winifred Matsumoto", "ReviewID": "R1ZTA5KJ4B30QL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very pleased with my purchase experience.

I take pictures of dancers... so theres more dust sweept of the floor... this is my theory Im not too sure yet.. but whats really frustrating is that I paid 500$ for it and I had better results with a disposable cam!!!

I just want a camera that I can point and shoot and get good photos regardless of the conditions.  I also want something I can carry in my pocket so that I actually have it handy when my kid does something cute!I bought the Canon Powershot SD800 with these things in mind.  The outdoor pictures looked great, but the problems started when I went indoors.  Taking pictures in a conference room, some of the pictures were very dark and grainy, even with the flash.  Yes, the flash was on automatic.  So I retook the picture and this time it looked better.  With several repeats, results were inconsistent, even with the flash on.  As the day progressed, I handed the camera to others to take some shots, and they came out grainy and dim as well, or overexposed by the flash.I can understand poor performance in poor conditions, but I cannot understand inconsistent performance in the same conditions.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "picture quality is poor", "Author": "L.

So I ordered one and use it for a week...and finally I have to return it due to poor quality picture. Compare to my Canon G3 and Nikon Coolpix 5400, the picture of this camera is unclear even though it has more pixel, the color is yellowish, and the multi point focus feature is hard to use. It's just a little bit better than my Cybershot Phone Sony K800. The reason I give this a 2 stars because it has a nice body (metal), a good shape, and the battery.

My fianc\u00e9e and I wanted this camera for our honeymoon to start on 21 Oct 2007).  On 5 Oct 2007 I ordered this camera online, using Standard Shipping.  Estimated delivery was from 11 Oct - 15 Oct.  No problem I thought.  On 9 Oct, I received a change in the ship dates: 16 Oct - 23 Oct.  I replied through the website, stating that I needed this by 20 Oct and I would be happy to pay extra to expedite the shipping.  I received a reply on 11 Oct stating that the dates could not be changed, and furthermore Amazon was unable to change the shipping method for this order as it had already entered the shipping process.  I was told that since this was important to me and the shipping couldn't be changed or CANCELLED, I could try placing a new order with different shipping.  Then I could refuse delivery for the original item.  I replied to that, stating that was unacceptable, noting that on the product page there was text very similar to this: \"Want it delivered Friday, November 9?  Order it in the next 8 hours and 35 minutes, and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout\".  I said that if I could order this item 6 days later and get it shipped next-day, why can't I get the original camera?  Upon this reply, I received an apologetic message from Amazon on 12 Oct stating that due to a delay on their end, the estimates were revised.  I received new estimates of 17 Oct - 19 Oct.I thought that seemed reasonable - at that time.On 13 Oct, I received ANOTHER mail stating that my estimated ship dates would be changing to 18 Oct - 25 Oct.  I immediately replied with similar information as before.  On 14 Oct, I received a reply stating \"Your order is currently being prepared for shipment, and should leave our fulfillment center soon...Unfortunately, because this order is already being processed, I am unable to upgrade it to a faster method of delivery.\"  But this message did not have any estimated dates.  I waited for that email.On 18 Oct I received an email stating my new estimated deliver dates: 25 Oct - 31 Oct.  Unbelievable.First thing in the morning on 19 Oct I had Amazon call me.  After the emails with the fluctuating dates and the misinformation about how to cancel my order (I was told via email I had to REFUSE shipment and couldn't cancel the order!!!), I told the customer specialist that if she couldn't get my camera to me on THAT day or on the next day (20 Oct) then I need it cancelled - right then - not after Amazon decides they can ship it to me.  I explained that after all of this time, EVERY time I went to the website I saw that I could \"Order it now...with one day shipping!\" and this was now 14 days later.  The email response was basically the worst I could imaging possible.After all of this, she did cancel my order and apologized profusely.  I then received a $10 credit on my Amazon account.I went to Fry's Electronics and purchased a Canon SD850 instead - with some accessories.  Paid quite a bit more money for it there than on Amazon, but it was well worth it.Note that I am rating this item as \"1 Star\" but that is because of the Amazon customer service.  Through my camera searching and testing I found this particular camera to be exceptional and would rate it 4.5 stars - especially after owning the Canon SD850 - which I would rate 5 stars.  Image stabilization is WONDERFUL and the camera performed excellent.  Unfortunately, Amazon lost this sale and quite possibly many more in the future.  I have been a customer with Amazon for many years and used to think of Amazon as the first place to shop on the Internet.
