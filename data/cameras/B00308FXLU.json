I use this device with a Altronix power supply and a GE Simon alarm system.  Shipping was fast and it was easy to track the status of my shipment.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked just like it is supposed to.", "Author": "fd1", "ReviewID": "R3RQN8W34VMYMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Used to add a louder siren on alarm system.  Wiring was not real logical to me, but there is good info online and had no problems and it works great.  I dropped the rating to 4 stars because the board is mounted with included double sided foam tape.  It worked fine, but I wonder if it will eventually let go after time and repeated temperature cycles.  Would have preferred a traditional screw/standoff mounting.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00308FXLU"}}
