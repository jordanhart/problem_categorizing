And have been working with it frequently at home. I was looking for a quality camera but not a huge price. I found it! I love this camera! I saw the other cameras with more pixels but felt it wasn't worth the price difference. I was looking for at least 2 lenses to work with and any extras I could get my hands on. If you are just starting out with cameras, this is a great purchase. I already had a tripod, which some of the other bundles came with. I felt the extended flash would be  more beneficial for me personally. The filters are merely a way to protect your lenses... good idea... and you get the extra battery and a charger. Which is great when you use it all day. The case is ok. It does not zip. Four buckles to close it. But it does hold EVERYTHING.I will say, the camera can do so much for you on the auto settings. If you never learn to use it otherwise it takes great quality pictures. However, I am teaching myself to use it on manual, but until then I can still take great pictures. I would definitely recommend this item.I also had some questions about the camera and the seller was very prompt to answer all of my question with email and phone calls. That too was nice.
