It is very cold and very windy ( here in Jacksonville Florida) at the time of this recording. The TV receiver is connected to a VCR Recording what you see and hear. The camera comes with a good recording software for the PC, BUT!!! the computer does NOT record the sound, that comes from the camera. Connect the receiver to a DVD recorder, will try that next, it will work. Picture quality is good, BUT! ( I know you wount like my but) The video is step motion, which is ok considering the total cost of this system. I will carry the TV receiver and Camera in my pocket,They both have their own rechargeable batteries, Hide camera, show receiver to friends, they will flip out when they see them selves.Mrpete  [...]", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Three Months on the Job", "Author": "W. Repak \"Walt R\"", "ReviewID": "R21C4ZIZGPYL4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this in the beginning of January, 2010, as the second camera in my outside video surveillance system so I could see who was at the door before opening it.  Uniden characterizes the camera as \"Wireless/Weatherproof\", yet in the second page of their User Manual, they state:  \"This equipment is NOT waterproof. DO NOT expose it to rain or moisture.\"Since Florida has its share of wet weather, I inquired from Uniden if I could use their camera outside under my soffet, and their answering E-Mail stated that it would be fine.  After installing it and experiencing several storms in the three months it has been in action, I can report that the camera continues to function perfectly.I am also satisfied with the camera's performance, but I never expected to get anywhere near the claimed range of 500 feet.  My monitor is set up only about 25 feet from the front door camera and about 15 feet from the driveway camera.  The pictures are very clear, and I can even move the monitor down another 30 feet or so to my bedroom to keep within range of the front door camera, although the driveway camera gives out at about 35 feet.I highly recommend the system, and bought two of them for my daughters to use as nanny cams to watch over their infants.  When visiting, each brings her own indoor camera, and I link it to the highly portable monitor (it can take up to 4 cameras), so she can keep watch on her baby in another room.  Without having to go through exterior walls, the range in the house is easily 100 feet, through 3 plasterboard internal walls. Since the camera picks up sound, it easily alerts a parent to take a look at the monitor to see if their physical presence is necessary.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Louie S. Gattis III", "ReviewID": "RFZS9KKXDCP7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth purchase of these cameras.  I started with another Uniden smaller set that has full portability (a major plus once you have that ability, take it to the bath, or basement, etc, and you can see the delivery person arrive.Anyway, bought a second set with two more cameras, still no issues, and now this is my fourth as I continue to grow with my system.Cameras are good.  The receiver choices have small issues, but they do work fine.  The bundle with the two outside cameras and a remote control does not have much range, maybe 40 feet from outside, through walls to the bedroom, not a good thing.  However the smaller set, that has the flat indoor (baby cam style) has very good range, just small picture area.

I currently have three outdoor cameras and one indoor.  I plan on getting another outdoor camera and not use the indoor, since I have another indoor camera system in operation.  The cameras for me have been definitely weather proof, being exposed to turrential down pours, sun and heat in the 90's as well as snow and temps dipping to -30F and no issues.  The cameras work great in the dark and even better if you mount them near any garage or deck lights.  The audio portion is great too, the mic is very sensitive and you can hear very clearly what is going on outside through the 7\" monitor.  Cameras are easy to install and easy to pair up to the monitor.

So here is my second review of this product: First, the pros: the camera turned on and was shipped in a decent time. Now for the cons:1. The item will not pair with my existing system. This is not from a lack of trying as I worked very hard by reading the manual in its entirety as well as spending 2 hours on trying different trouble shooting techniques to get it to pair. 2.  The customer service at uniden is non existent. Meaning I have called during normal business hours as well as sent 3 separate emails and I could not get a hold of anyone.  That's the jist. This is my first review after many  weekly smiley boxes on my step. I copied this review just jn case amazon tries to censor the negative feedback again. So ha!

However, a few notes for the critical buyer:The switch from night/led mode to the robust colors of day mode sometimes looks a little weird for a few seconds, and the glitchy frames will trigger your motion activation if using the uniden software.  Again, this is very minor and just a few seconds out of the day.The color during the daytime is spectacular as is the contrast and brightness at night.  Very nice, as most cameras excel in one and not the other.The range on the camera is less than hoped for.  Through brick wall, and 2 plasters at aprox 50 ft the signal begins to noticably weaken to the point where several frames are dropped, about 1 or 2 per second less, and have issues in placement around a computer, phone, etc with one of the cameras and the freq it is on.Overall, the cameras and system as well are a good value.  Very nice setup but wish the camera had a better resolution and the signal strength was boosted in the camera units.
