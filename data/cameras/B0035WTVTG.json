{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another great camera in the Fuji line-up", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R3M11KBH2CNWVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love Fuji cameras, this is my 9th one!  This camera takes the best of the former Z-series cameras, (except this model is not waterproof), and combines it with an affordable price and HD movie capability.I love the fit and finish on this camera (I own the black one).  The lens is protected by a sliding cover which also powers the camera on and off.  It is sleek-looking and it's rare to find a fairly inexpensive camera that is made of METAL nowadays.  The lens zooms in and out INSIDE the camera so you don't have to be as careful when you handle this.  Unless you drop it you probably won't get a zoom error that commonly happens with cameras where the lens protrudes outward when the power is turned on.One thing I like better about this Z70 than some of the older Z series is the USB connector on this camera is not located inside the battery compartment, it's on the side of the camera where it should be.  The older Z30 (and some of the other Z's) had the USB inside the battery compartment and that would have eventually caused the battery door to wear out from constantly opening/closing it.I didn't care for the buttons on the older Z cameras as they were too close together and it was easy to press the incorrect button, this new Z70 looks more like a conventional digital camera on the back, and the buttons are lit up, so if you're taking pictures in a dimly lit area, it's easier to see the buttons to press.  I also like the feature that you can instantly turn it on to take a movie, there is a button on top - you just press it and start filming, it's next to the shutter release button.My only complaint with this camera is the start-up time when you first slide the lens cover open. It feels like a 3 or 4 second wait. So if that is a concern for you, you may want to avoid this camera, or just leave the lens cover open (but it may get scratched if you do).Pictures are sharp and the colors are, if anything, a little brighter than normal, but I like that. Response time after taking a picture without using the flash was just about a second; response time between pictures with the flash firing was around 2 seconds or less before ready to take another flash shot...this was a lot better than some other cameras I've tried recently.  Response time also depends on the class of your SD card.The optical wide angle zoom on this camera is 5X (most cheaper cameras have  3X). It uses the standard NP45 lithium battery. I was able to shoot around 200 pictures and some short movies before it needed recharging - the plug-in battery charger comes with this and you can fully recharge the battery in under an hour.  I love the lithium battery over AA-type batteries because you get so many more shots out of one charging.  You just have to plan ahead in case you are going somewhere so you have a fully charged battery, or buy a spare.You can take the camera out of the box and be taking pictures as soon as the battery charges. SR-Auto automatically senses the scene and adjusts itself accordingly: Portrait, Landscape, Night, Macro, Backlit Portrait, or Night Portrait.  There is no dial to change settings, everything is accessed thorough menu navigation, except for the movie button which is on top of the camera.This camera has a new feature called AF Tracking, which helps keep the subject in focus while the subject is moving.  This works well sometimes, and at other times it doesn't.  Sometimes I think it's \"just me\" not holding the shutter button down correctly so this will work the way it's intended. To have it work correctly, you have to remember to hold the shutter button down halfway, while continually keeping the subject in the LCD screen.This camera has Image Stabilization (somehow built into the camera's software), but it is NOT optical stabilization.  Also you can choose this in the set-up menu to be \"on\" all the time, unlike other previous (cheaper) Fuji models, which is a definite improvement.Next, you have your movie modes - 3 to choose from - HD, 640 and 320 in the AVI format.  The HD video with this camera is just as good visually as my Flip Mino HD camcorder.  Optical zoom needs to be set before recording starts, it cannot be changed after the button is pushed.  Focus is also set when recording begins, but exposure and white balance are constantly adjusting during the recording.If you want to play the movies back on your TV, you will need to purchase an additional A/V cable (AV-C1) if you don't already own one. If you want to play an HD movie back on your HDTV, you will need to purchase an additional HDMI cable. There is also an optional Model HDP-L1 player available on Fujifilm's web site, which includes an HD card reader and a remote. Since I don't have an HDTV myself, I didn't purchase this so I can't comment on it.This camera comes with very basic Fuji MyFinepixViewer photo editing software. It's compatible with Windows 7, Vista, XP and Mac. This is a new version of the Fuji software and it's better than the previous, but still not as good as Picasa.This camera has only 13 MB of internal memory, so pick up an SD card if you don't already have one.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "What do you expect for under $150 buck?", "Author": "J. Sariya \"AZN electro\"", "ReviewID": "RAFTY86OMEZAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot apparently. I did some fishing around the net before I brought this camera. Not much info out there really. So I went to best buy and played with it a bit. I was not that impressed. But when I compared it to the other product in the same price range (as well as more expensive), it did stand out. After I got mine, I toyed with setting and read the menu, I'm loving it. Picture is very clear and in the same time very forgiving regarding imperfection on you face. HD movie looks great,very smooth, sound is good too. Just remember a mic is attached to the camera, you only going to give clear sound when you are close to it. I always been a Sony kind of guy, but now I think I'm in love with Fuji :)", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "CLEAR", "Author": "**Movie Reviewer**", "ReviewID": "R1PEA8D85XHU5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because of the price and since it can take HD VIDEO in 720p. Lets get to the deal breakers that I was unable to find anywhere I looked, unlike most camera that can take video, this one records in AVI format, not the MP4 / MOV. I like AVI because I can edit it very easily. AVI files cannot exceed 2GB in size, let it be on any camera or computer. On this camera you can zoom in and out while filming. A nice feature of this camera is the battery, its rechargeable. You can't recharge the battery while its in the camera, it comes with a separate charger and you need to take the battery out of the camera, I like this idea as I can buy multiple batteries and charge one yet still use the camera...Camera takes both SD & SDHC memory cards, if you do not have a computer drive that can read the more newer SDHC cards, the camera comes with a USB cable so you can transfer the photos/videos that way with or without using the included cd-rom. This camera has a ton of setting on it, so many I had to look through the manual thats on the cd-rom as icons were popping up on the camera screen that I did not know what they meant. My favorite feature of this camera is that it can take 2 pictures at a time, one with the flash and then one without so you can pick which one is better. The camera has other features too, but I have not yet played with them enough to see what they do. In terms of weight and feel, its solid, has a good weight to it so it does not feel like cheap plasic, parts of the outside are metal. It has a port on the bottom for a standard tripod. On this camera, don't worry if you break the battery / memory card off because it does not rely on that to keep the battery or memory card in place, I know lots of people worry about that...I had other camera with the same megapixel rating and the battery life was horrible! On this camera you can take many many pictures and HD Video with power to spare. Keep in mind though, I noticed some settings this camera has does indeed use more power (the fully automatic scene recognizer, dual image taker as I mentioned earlier) and flash usage all will vary the life of the battery before you need another recharge, the battery can recharge to maximum capacity in about 2hours. The pictures and video come out really clear. This is my first FUJI camera, I usually get KODAK & CANNON and I think I will always buy FUJI from now on. I would highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good compact camera in the under $100 price range", "Author": "W. Otto \"Laser Brain\"", "ReviewID": "R1D30PL8B9GKL0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: - great pictures - audio notes/comments - the lens does not telescope out from the case - good low light performance - large screen, but still room for buttons - great video - natural light/flash dual modeCons - like all compact cameras, resolution is limited to about 3-5 MP - Under low light levels, auto white balance can be slightly off - no panoramic mode - no histogram - a little slow to turn on and store images - the audio notes is difficult to accessNOTE TO THOSE WHO DISPLAY PICTURES AT 100% ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN:THE LIMIT OF RESOLUTION IS ABOUT 5MP FOR A COMPACT CAMERAFirst my standard comments about compact cameras with these tiny sensors (1/2.33\") - it is easy to show (I am an optical physicist, so at least it is easy for me) that it is physically impossible to get 12 MP resolution even if the lenses were perfect. In fact, the theoretical limit under the most perfect conditions is about 9 MP for this size lens. However, under average lighting conditions and lens settings, you can expect 3 to 4 times less. For example my test shots show about 2MP resolution for the Exilim z75 and nearly 4MP for the Fuji Z70. So if you think you want to get a 12 MP camera as an upgrade to your 5 MP camera or even 3 MP camera, save your money. You need a bigger and much better lens. The high-end Canon SD4000is camera actually achieves 5MP with a larger lens, under ideal conditions, based on measurements. If you want a real upgrade in a pocket camera, look there. Contrast this with a full frame 35 mm DSLR. The theoretical limit is well over 100 MP and the achievable real life resolution is 8 MP, based on actual measurements with a Nikon D3s.WHY DO THEY PUT 12 MP SENSOR IN A CAMERA THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY TAKE A 12MP PICTURE?There are two reasons. The first is that 12MP sensors are cheap nowadays and you'd rather buy a camera that says \"12MP sensor\" than \"5MP sensor.\" Admit it, you would. But there is a second reason to have twice as many pixels as the measured horizontal and vertical resolution. Some things are on a diagonal. So you need more pixels. The other thing is, the pixels are not \"color\" pixels but either red, green or blue. In theory you need about 3 times as many pixels to get color pictures. But in reality, the camera processor synthesizes a color picture from fewer pixels by making good guesses about what the color of something is. So the bottom line is you probably need about twice as many pixels as the actual resolution limit. That means about 5 MP for a low end compact camera and about 10 MP for a higher end compact camera, and 16 MP for a high end full frame DSLR. So, in the Finepix Z70, 8MP would have been enough to get all the performance you'll ever get out of this one. The test photos (see comments) indicate that the FinePix Z70 easily beat the Exilim resolution and is close to 4 MP of resolution.THIS CAMERA (LIKE MOST COMPACT POINT AND SHOOT MODELS) LETS YOU TAKE A PICTURE EVEN WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE HOPELESSLY BLURREDThe second drawback to the inexpensive compact cameras is the small lenses and cheap sensors combined with the point and shoot approach, can result in the user trying to take pictures under impossible conditions. The camera probably warns you with an icon in the viewscreen (such as a shakey hand) but you will ignore it and take the picture anyway and be disappointed and blame the camera. Indoors at night in natural light is always going to result in a picture with a lot of digital noise and probably a bit blurred as well.  The flashes in these cameras are very low power because there is not a huge battery in the camera, so you really can't take acceptable flash pictures more than a few feet away. It is unrealistic to expect any pocket camera to take great pictures at a party. The best you can hope for are the typical flash pictures that have bright foregrounds and very dark backgrounds. With a stabilized DSLR at high ISO and a nice f/1.4 lens, you can do natural light shots that compact cameras can only dream of. One way around this, is that the higher end compact cameras now take several short exposures and do a shift and add to synthesize a single picture. If things (other than your hand) aren't moving much, this trick works well, especially if you have optical stabilization. If you want to take low light level pictures in natural light, I suggest you look at the Sony DSC-TX7 or the Canon SD4000is or similar $300+ cameras. By contrast, a modern SLR can offer ISO ratings of several thousand, (compared to a few hundred for a pocket point and shoot) enabling handheld shots under low light conditions.BASED ON THE Z700This camera, the Z70, is the non-touch screen version of the Z700 and has a cheaper sensor and a cheaper processor. The Z700 in turn, is \"inspired\" by the Sony DSC-TX7 which I have also reviewed. The Fuji lacks the panoramic mode, the high dynamic range mode, and the exceptional low light mode of the Sony, but it is about half the price. Of course, the Z70 is about 1/3 the price, so, do not expect anything approaching the performance of the more expensive models. That said, the performance is very decent for a $100 camera.PERFORMANCECompared to cameras in its class, the Finepix does a fine job in bright light. I personally like the buttons better than the touchscreen, but you may feel differently. As in all my reviews, I have taken pictures of nearly identical scenes for comparison and posted them. Amazon tends to remove my links from the reviews, however. So let me say again that the resolution was easily 4 MP worth meaning about 1800 vertical lines. The 5x zoom range also beats some other low priced cameras.In bright daylight, the pictures are generally excellent. They are perhaps slightly saturated, reminding me of Agfachrome film, but very pleasing. This camera does not have a sophisticated multi-point metering systems, so I sometimes have to adjust the exposure up or down 2/3 of a stop. Be very careful, because it sets the exposure according to whatever is in the cross-hairs of the viewfinder.There is a sunset mode which allows you to take realistic exposures and not having the white balance messed up by trying to correct the scene to daylight. If you have tried to take sunset pictures with a point and shoot camera before and been disappointed, then this feature is for you.Under low light conditions, a fairly usable picture can be taken, if the camera is steadied, and you do not zoom in. The automatic white balance occasionally seems to do a poor job under low-level incandescent lighting, which you can override for stills, but movies are always in automatic white balance mode, so they can sometimes come out looking slightly yellowish under these conditions.Like most users, I tend to use this in the fully auto mode, but, unlike many point and shoot cameras, there is a \"program\" mode in which you can still adjust the exposure up or down from the metered value.I find that a 4 GB SD card is big enough for me, but I don't take a lot of video. If you do, you might want to go larger. The battery life is better than average which means more than 150 pictures per charge (a mixture of flash and non-flash pictures). The USB connector is a non-standard one, so make sure you don't lose it.I always respond to comments, so don't be bashful. If you only have $100 to spend and want a shirt pocket camera, this might be for you. I used to say I preferred my Casio, but I have changed my mind. After a year of using the FinePix z70, it is my favorite tiny camera.I have updated this review from my initial review of Jan 2011. What I have learned is that the auto white balance is usually good, and that the exposure compensation is actually pretty handy and works well. Also, the \"night\" shooting mode is what you want to use whenever you have low light conditions. Automatic scene recognition is good if you want to let the camera do all of the thinking, but you get no control over your picture at all. I also now have a Canon T3i DSLR - shooting with big image stabilized lenses and ISO 3200, the DSLR allows me to take very acceptable photos in very low light indoors hand held. Do not expect to come anywhere close to this with a pocket camera, with lenses that are only 5 mm in diameter, compared to the 50mm diameter lenses on a DSLR.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "First Fujifilm Camera, and satisfied (:", "Author": "Byoung K.

I used the camera for Christmas pictures, then stuck it in my camera bag, where I left it for over a month. On 2/2/12 I took it from the bag intending to use it. I discovered that the LCD screen had a dime sized fully blacked out circular area on it, plus a line of blacked out pixels running from the center of the screen over to the right hand side. So this is the first problem, the camera went defective in only 2 months and with really only one day's actual use on it.The second problem was with Fujifilm's so-called customer support and Fujifilm's customer hostile warranty policies. I called the number provided in the camera's box to find out how to get the camera repaired. They gave me an address to ship it to, but when I asked them how they were going to reimburse me for the cost of shipping it to them, I was told that it was Fujifilm's policy that the customer just had to eat this cost. When I started to protest this, the support person hung up on me.It is my belief that any ethical company would take the steps necessary to ensure that their customers are not out any additional costs due to the company's failure to produce a decent product. Fujifilm's policy of refusing to reimburse this cost displays a genuine contempt for the customer. I will probably be stuck paying for Fujifilm's shoddy workmanship here, but I can assure you that I will never again purchase anything made by Fujifilm. I highly recommend others to do likewise.

Im giving it 2 stars cause its pretty, different from the normal camera and the returning was easy enough to handle!However, its not worth the money for it to just \"look pretty\".I found that you NEED a tri-pod or a table to take a clear shot without a flash on. Even with great lighting if the flash is off, regardless of shooting mode, it blurs! And blurs BAD!If the flash is on it takes much better pictures but even then it blurs at times.Im not a shaky person, though im not as steady as a table! The camera should be able to ajust. My old Kodak can if i can keep it charged!!I also found that if the lighting is good and the flash is on the picture looks almost over exposed and the color is off! I have a chocolate poodle and in some pictures she was more red and our brown carpet was pinkish.Faces are ghost white almost as if you took the picture standing a foot from them.I understand this isnt the top of the line camera. Your not going to get FANTASTIC photos from a $100 point n shoot. But, they should be good and clear. My expierence with this camera was terrible and i wouldnt recommend it to ANYONE!!I had this for 6 days and  sent it back it was that bad!Another issue i had that was tolerable but very annoying, the beeping on the camera. It does get annoying. I turned it off and it turns the flash off! Im not sure what a flash and a beep noise has anything to with one another but it does. Its says \"hold the disp. (display  button to turn flash on\" but when i did this.. nothing happened! I had to go through the menus and turn it on the long way. Again, this was annoying but tolerable! If this was the only problems with on the camera i wouldve considered keeping it.In my opinion you buy a camera to take pictures and capture the moments you want to remember. This camera was almost incapable of taking a clear picture! Most of the time people looked like ghosts or a giant blurr!I was thinking of just trying a different series of the fujifilm finepix but not sure if i want to go through the hassle of this again.

I bought the Z70 looking for the next step up and in some ways it is. The added pixels are great as is the SD card instead of the ridiculous XD. But my favorite thing with the Z1/Z5 was taking short videos at car and motorcycle races. The Z1/Z5 had a pic/vid switch on top and you could power on in either mode in about 2 seconds. With the Z70 though, you have to power on in the pic mode then press the vid button. It takes about 3 sec to power on then another 3 sec to start rolling vid. So you're looking at 6 sec to take a vid instead of the Z1/Z5's 2 sec. This is a big deal to me because 4 sec is a long time in motorsports. On the other hand, the vids look and sound fantastic and unlike reported by other reviewers, my Z70 will zoom during vids.Taking pics with the Z70 makes you look like a pro. With practice and the right settings I can freeze or blur action as I please and take beautiful close-ups. Just what I've come to expect from a Fuji.To me it feels like the Z70's trying to do too many things at once and that just slows it down, so I'm giving a 3 star rating because the time delay is almost inexcusable and I know Fuji can do better.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent Camara", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RHN4TAM8LOT2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cam is excelent, the best price for design.

I, like others really wanted this camera to perform amazingly. I got it within the first week it was out. I went from a Fujifilm s700 to this finepix Z70. As soon as I started using it, I did not like it. But the s700 is a bigger camera and thought \"maybe I just need to adjust to it, learn its tricks\". But alas NO. If you live in a house or apartment with medium lighting, you're still out of luck. I will say that in direct sunlight, it works pretty well. But if you're indoors, with average lighting, you can expect, blurry and grainy photos. For dim light shooting, don't even bother. So unless you spend all your time outside and that's your primary use, do not waste your time.The one feature that grabbed me was the HD video option. But like I said before, your typical lighting will do nothing for the HD feature. And if it doesn't focus right when the video starts, you will have a blurry, unfocused video. I gave this camera 2 stars because in bright lighting, it works well. Also within 2 months, the battery hatch gave out and I have to rig it to keep the battery in. Sad fact that I sold my s700 just to buy this thing. If i could go back, i'd keep my giant s700, the quality was better, I just wanted something I could throw in my purse.But now, giant purses are in season, so take your money, skip this camera and go buy an s700!

The body feels pretty sturdy. It seems to contain more metal than plastic, which is a good thing in my opinion.It's pretty easy to use. Just slide down the cover, and it turns on pretty fast. The 5x zoom lens is nice, and the 720p HD video recording also works great. Audio is clear, and video has a minimal amount of blocking and other artifacts. You can even zoom while recording, although it takes a second to refocus, and there's a soft humming noise from the lens motor. Nothing overly annoying, though.If you're outside during the daytime, this camera takes some pretty good photos. It focuses fast, and there's not too much noise in the photos.Although it has a flash, the camera tends to have has a very hard time focusing while indoors, at night, or in any other kind of low-light situation. Plus it doesn't have any kind of focus assist light to help it \"see\" better. While your eyes might adjust to the low light, this camera doesn't.You're trading some low-light image quality for a super compact form factor and good build quality.This downside wouldn't be that big of a deal if it wasn't for the faulty LCD screen. I had this camera for about 4 months, and all of a sudden a patch of dead pixels appeared on the LCD screen. I ended up shipping it back to Fuji and having it repaired under warranty. The $4 to ship it to the repair center wasn't too bad, and I got the camera back in about a week and a half, if I remember correctly. They even threw in a sheet that had a discount code for an online order of prints. Unfortunately, it seems the LCD panels they are using are faulty, as the camera's screen has yet another blotch of dead pixels on it, and it's now out of warranty.From the reviews, it seems I'm not the only one with LCD quality issues.

This was my first camera I have ever purchased and I am disappointed I choose the finepix Z70. One week after I bought the camera, it malfunctioned. A 'zoom error' appeared on my camera and I was unable to take pictures. I contacted fujifilm and it took them one month for them to fix my camera. First, I got an email from them 3 weeks after I shipped them the camera explaining that they have received the product. Second, they told me it would be about around week to figure out the problem. Third, around another week  to ship it back to me. I was also very upset that Fujifilm did not reimburse the money I payed for shipping them the camera because I was only able to use it for one week before it broke. Poor quality for a camera, poor service from fijifilm, and overall poor rating for my purchase.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Electronics Expo as a Vendor", "Author": "Charlie Maus", "ReviewID": "RDJJ79DO5ZD4Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Electronics Expo - I recently purchased a Fuji camera from this company.I would warn you that the decription on the item I purchased was in error.It listed the following:\"Fujifilm FinePix 12.0MP Digital Camera with 4GB SDHC Card and Camera Case - Black Z70\"What I received was the camera only.

So it might not be a fair comparison to write a review for a $70 camera. But this thing truly IS garbage. I am yet to see 3 photos in a row that are sharp. Noise is unbearable. Focus is a joke. The \"12 megapixels\" is also a joke. I'm seriously considering returning this garbage. It's by far the worst camera I've ever seen. Nice to have a tiny little camera for when I don't want to take the 5D out, but what's the point when 80% of your shots will be unusable?", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fugi Finepix Z70", "Author": "Akira", "ReviewID": "R2US7U4W0BDAOI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I do not care for this camera.

I had to turn the audio to full blast on my laptop just to hear it at a normal level. What's really bad about this, is that you get a LOT of feedback, and that's basically all you hear.
