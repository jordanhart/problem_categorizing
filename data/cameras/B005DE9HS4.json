{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some Good, Some bad.", "Author": "DSmithSC", "ReviewID": "R22GMB6H2D36L2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this monitor because of a friend referral.  I also bought the Summer 3.5 Touch, and the Motorola MBP35 (3.5 screen).  I originally bought the Summer Touch but wasn't 100% sold on it.  That is why i purchased the other two.First off, the good:- Screen Clarity - Seemed better than the Summer and about the same as the Motorola.- Night Vision - This monitor had the best vision at night of all of the monitors.  Everything was much brighter and easier to see. (also listed in the Negatives later).- Battery life - It seemed to get around 5 hours on a charge.  About the same or a tad less than the Summer, but about 2 hours better than the Motorola.- Ability to record and save. - I only played with this feature, but I thought it would be great to have if a nanny or babysitter was over and you could keep track of the actual happenings with your baby. - Neither of the other two monitors had this feature.- Lullaby function - I'm not sure how much this would actually be used, but I thought it was a nice feature to have.  The Motorola also had this.- Night Light - Again, not sure how much it would be used, but another nice feature.  Neither of the other two monitors had this.- VIDEO STAYS ON when off of the charger. - I thought this was a great feature because on the other monitors you have to keep pressing the video button after it automatically times out after about 2 minutes to be able to see the screen and what is going on.  They do this as a power saving feature but it is more aggravating than anything.  The Lorex stays on and makes it easy.- The ability to add other cameras and be able to view them all simultaneously.  The other two monitors allow you to add cameras, but have to view one at a time.  Again, not sure if most parents would ever need this, but it is a nice feature.Now, with the BAD.- No Zoom feature on the Lorex.  Both the Summer and Motorola have this ability.  It has a pretty clear picture, but there are times where I want to zoom in on my child and could not.- No Panning feature on the Lorex.  Both the Summer and Motorola have this.  While this may be ok with some who just want to see a certain area of the crib, or don't mind leaving the camera in a fixed place, it could be an issue for others.  I thought I could easily get past this, but I couldn't.- Audio - When compared to the Summer, you practically had to lay your ear on the back of the monitor (where the speaker is) to be able to hear the child.  The Summer picks up the swing going back and forth, and allows you to adjust the volume to hear much more than the Lorex.- The Talk function. - If you put your mouth right on the microphone, it works ok.  However, testing it with my wife and the Summer, she continuously said the Summer's sound quality on the other end was much better.- Audio Alerts. - a great idea for a feature, but it randomly worked and was more irritating than anything.- The Auto Mute, and Scan features. - While these are great features to have, they did not seem to work.  They randomly chose when to turn on and it usually had to come from a loud noise, but sometimes chose not to even come on then. - And YES, I did adjust the sensitivity on the side.- Skype - while this is a GREAT selling point, it has its flaws.  First, you cannot plug the monitor into a Mac computer to use this feature.  Second, even when plugged into a PC, the video is so far behind and lacking once on Skype, it takes away the usefulness of the feature all together.  Sometimes it would not even show movements that clearly happened.- Inability to connect the monitor to a TV or other video source.  The Summer allows you to connect the monitor to a TV through RCA/mini usb so that you can view it on a larger screen if desired.  The Lorex and Motorola do not.- The Night Vision. - While stated as a positive earlier (which it is), it also has a slight negative.  The LED's on the camera are red and clearly visible at night, whereas the ones for the other monitors are not.  This may bother or alert some children/etc., and may not for others.  It is just a point I thought I should mention.After wanting to love this monitor and replace the Summer with it (already sent the Motorola back due to lack of technical support and inability to plug into another video source), I am afraid I am going to have to send the Lorex back as well.  I wish someone would take the good parts of each of these monitors and combine them, but as of now, they have not.  For now, we are sticking with the Summer monitor because it had the least negatives of all 3.  I think the main reason I wanted something instead of the Summer monitor is because they specialize in baby clothes, products, etc.  Motorola and Lorex specialize in communications and surveillance, therefore I figured there products would be better.  I was mistaken.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Must Have!", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R2WZRTY4FMJJRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have been on an aggressive search for the perfect Baby Video Monitor that suits the needs of our growing family.  After reading countless product reviews, purchasing and returning 4 other systems, we started to think that what we wanted did not exist - and then we tried the Lorex LW 2401 Live Video Monitor System - it seems to have everything we want!Pros:* Expandable - Supports up to 4 cameras* VOX (Voice Activation) - Lorex calls this feature \"Scan\".  The video AND sound go into a power saving mode, the cameras scan  the rooms for noises and if there is a noise detected, the video and audio is activated. This is a huge feature for my family  and was the reason why we returned all of the other systems we tried. In all other systems we tried the VOX feature could only  work on one camera / baby at a time.  Which was just silly to us - we wanted to hear either baby if one of them made a noise,  not just one!* Mute! This is a huge plus for me. I am such a light sleeper that on other systems the lowest setting is still too loud for me* Noise Indicator light (on the left side) - key for when the unit is on mute* Low battery indicator flashes on the screen! Not an annoying beep* Monitor has a stand (this model has a stand AND a docking station for charging - an extra bonus)Bonuses:* Multiple options for viewing your little ones:  -Single camera, sequence (rotates between cameras every 6 seconds), Quad mode (views all cameras at the same time)  -Video and sound on at all times  -Video screen off, but sound on  -Video screen on and sounds off (Auto mute)* Auto Mute - after a period with no noise, auto mute is activated to eliminate white noise* Sleek design* Large screen (3.5\")* Volume buttons are on the front of the monitor unit (not in a menu)* Two way talk feature* Temperature gauge* Date and time on screenCons:* \"Video\" button turns on / off once pressed, but doesn't seem to work in Scan mode.  Not sure why that would be* Doesn't tilt, pan, zoom like some other units in the price range but not a deal breaker for me because it has so much of  everything else we needFeatures I have not tried and probably won't use:* Capture, store & share with microSD recording* Remotely view from anywhere through Skype* Alerts* Alarms", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very useful and quality looking", "Author": "Muhammed", "ReviewID": "R18PIEHPE3LIJU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's not one of those Chinese fakes (though it was made in China too). Lorex is known for it's cameras and this one is not an exception. One bad thing for me is about servicing and spare parts as there's no such support available in my country.The 4 stars are awarded for it's rugged and quality design (we dropped the monitor for several times, yet no errors) and for the night vision. However, the colour contrast is not too good and the camera doesn't zoom or tilt and the one that does costs expensive.One word, good equipment to have and you can attach more cameras.

After using our other one for two years it no longer held a charge. We just had a second kid and wanted a second camera to plug into our existing system so we could watch both kids in two separate rooms. We ended up buying a whole new camera/monitor package since the other one was having issues. We love the night view clarity, the noise sensitivity, the ability to talk to the kids through the monitor, having two cameras hooked up to one monitor, and we love the price! My only suggestion is to let the monitor battery fully drain before plugging back in so you don't burn the battery out like we did on our first one. Oh and the monitor is really sturdy - other than the dying battery (still worked fine plugged in though) the first set we bought of this has held up well - our two year old is not gentle on it and it doesn't even show any wear, unlike the multiple phones and iPad screens he has broken. ;)", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Won't Last", "Author": "Nicolo", "ReviewID": "RC3LQN0FHZJOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never reviewed this when we got it, so here's a review after 12 months of use...Battery doesn't last, the stand is broken, have to wiggle the plug just right to get it to charge, and the sensitivity is gone.

We ordered this and the Samsung. Both are going back due to horrible audio quality. Both have the speaker on the back of the monitor, and the ridiculously flimsy kickstands on both units are useless. The sound has to be turned all the way up to have any hope of hearing the baby before they become so upset they are screaming, but with the volume up that high, there is an annoying hissing noise instead. With our old Summer monitor, we can easily hear or child's every breath, if we choose to.

Baby's room is upstairs we're downstairs.  No problem with reception in the house.  Pairing was automatic and without issue.  The handheld is nice design and allows you to plug in directly for charging or charge through a plugin base.  The talk back feature takes a bit of getting used to- but works and can be understood.  Didn't use the lullaby feature.  Night vision works great as does the daylight video.  Scan is interesting - when you're awake, it's great cause the screen flashes on when it hears a sound - but at night - the screen flashes on when you hear a sound - so we just leave it on as a monitor and turn off the screen.  Problems- 1) the handheld is quiet even at it's highest volume.  I've missed noises and calls because even though i was listening, I couldn't hear it due to volume.  2) Battery life - it's not so good.  The thing is that the handheld is so handy that you forget to put it back in it's cradle or plug it in.  So, even after sitting in the \"off\" position - the battery will die.  We've had several situations where the battery has gone on us- requiring us to get the plug.  However, overall - i'm pleased with it - but not sure if I would buy it again due to the volume issue (what's the point of getting a monitor that you can't hear?).", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great monitor", "Author": "Alexandra C.

The microphone is not great at picking up soft sounds, like a baby's breathing.  Exasperating the issue it auto mutes to avoid ambient noise when there aren't loud sounds.  There is a setting that supposedly controls this auto muting, but no matter what value we set it to it still auto muted.  For a young infant often what you want a monitor to do is to allow you to hear that the baby is breathing which this monitor doesn't allow for.  It would be a great monitor for an older infant or younger toddler because it has a lot of great features, the picture quality is pretty good, and the form factor and battery life are both great.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best purchase ever", "Author": "Queenofhergarden", "ReviewID": "R3ELEABIA2L1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best purchases I have ever made is this Lorex Video Monitor System.

We bought the monitor with one camera to use in my Uncles room so we could be sure he was safe in getting out of bed when we weren't with him.  It worked so well we bought one to monitor the living room when they are both awake and sitting up in their chairs.
