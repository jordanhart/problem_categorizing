Snell", "ReviewID": "R3GOW3F0HZVJE7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently received this camera and I am very disappointed with the quality of photos that is coming out of a 10mp camera. I had an 8mp sony previously and the photo quality was much better. The camera often takes fuzzy pictures and for the price and the features that it boasts this should not be happening. I take a lot of photos and have used many brands of cameras, this is my first experience with Nikon and I will not be purchasing a Nikon again. By far my favorite cameras have been Sony's and that is what I will be going back to after this huge disappointment. The touchscreen is ok but many other camera brands have those. When you take the battery out to charge this camera you have to reset the date/time and all of your settings (ie if you turned the sound off, photo quality, etc) EVERY TIME YOU TAKE THE BATTERY OUT TO CHARGE IT! This to me is ridiculous for the money and definitely not something I am satisfied with.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S60", "Author": "Deana Johnson", "ReviewID": "R156LQ1Y209NZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product!

I'm not fond of the look or feel of it physically, but that's just my tastes.
