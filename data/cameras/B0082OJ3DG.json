It was a low light wedding with soft backlighting and candlelight and I shot most of the images without the flash as the bride and groom wanted to capture the ambiance of the low light. It performed perfectly and when I did use the flash it did not wash out the soft lighting and the bride's dress was a brilliant white. I took over 400 pictures and only had to delete a handful of them. Amazingly fast focus. I am very pleased with my new camera.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R14QVE5HX9S1H1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first impression of the camera is great! I just started using it, but for the first steps you can use automatic settings. It works nice! I baught with two different lenses 18-55 mm and 50-200 mm, but if I would buy it again, I would prefer 18-135 mm! If you want to make photos f.I.in sport, you don't really have time to change lenses.But the Camrea itself - I love it! It's perfect!", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great mid-price camera", "Author": "Joe Thompson", "ReviewID": "R1UOYF31OOTEV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR camera. I've had a difficult time giving up my Mamiya DSX1000, which still works great and although I'm still an amateur, I wanted a suitable replacement for the old Mamiya, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. I decided after a fair amount of research to go with the Pentax K30 due to the weather sealing, although the kit lenses are not weather sealed, which is a bit ridiculous. The fact that you can use any k-mount lens with the K30 was also a factor in my decision. It was easy for me to start taking great pictures right off the bat and the Silkypics Developer, which came with it is also easy to use and allows you to custom develop your RAW photos.The camera is a lot lighter than the Mamiya and feels just as good in your hands. It is also a good deal right now, because it has been replaced by the K50, which isn't much of an upgrade. I think I'll be using the K30 for a long time.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just as ordered!", "Author": "kevin kamp", "ReviewID": "R3GR85V1C2J14R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Camera is exactly as per my order, with 100% satisfaction.
