It's Leica quality! I've had mine since 1999. It has recorded my family members  lives and deaths and our trips.Cast metal body. Ball bearings. You can snap on almost any Nikon lens ever made and it will still work. Uses LR44 cells [2] for it's meter. It's happy without batteries as it is strictly mechanical. One of the most compact metal body SLR Nikon  ever made. Proper exposure depends on many factors. You gradually  learn this over time. I use a meter app on my iPhone sometimes. Sunny 16 rule works too.I have  a dozen lenses that I use. 24mm to 210mm. You CAN dial in intermediate F stops. It stops down exactly where you tell it. Yummy images.Fourteen years old and still going strong. If someone takes care of it will be taking pictures in 2113!  Hope they still have film...", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "For Film Lovers Only...", "Author": "P.

Lockwood", "ReviewID": "RQ9G9XKQ13GWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in 1982 and I still have it and love it! It is a manual slr film camera. I bought it with a macro lens. It gets heavy after carrying it around your neck for a while..In recent years I purchased a digital camera (Fuji Film)hoping for quality images in a more convenient body and freedom from film. But the quality just doesn't compare.If you are a serious photographer who wants quality and control, this is a fine choice for you. If you can get someone to sell theirs. I'll never sell mine.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "There are no training wheels here.", "Author": "Christopher J. Hayden", "ReviewID": "R12ANTZ8K0FTSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a serious, spectacular camera.  It hearkens back to a time when Photographers had to know their stuff.  It is 100% mechanical, which is why it's the preferred camera of certain National Geographic photographers.  there are no electronic shutters to jam, or batteries to die in freezing weather.  It is heavy, you will know if you have to carry it around all day.  It adjusts in full stops only.Make sure you get the FM2/n version.  The only difference on the exterior is that the flash sync is 1/250, marked in red on the shutter dial.  My FM2n is older than me, and the shutter is still perfectly accurate.The meter seems like it was thrown in as an afterthought, and generally tends to want to over or under expose by 1/3 to 1 stop.  Why?  because the 60/40 meter split reads too much of the frame for most subjects, and it compensates by telling you that it's over or under exposed, when it's probably not.  The easy fix is to know your exposures.  A separate incident light meter is highly recommended.  My little Sekonic L308S fits in my pocket and is way more accurate than the meter on the camera.It also has some interchangeable parts.  The film door from the FM3a will fit on the FM2n, the only difference being that the FM3a's door has that little window for reading the film type & speed from the roll.  There's also removable focusing screens.  Most come with the split-prism style.  There's also different versions by nikon, & some aftermarket companies make them for upwards of $90, if that's your thing.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The FM2/n has a long-standing reputation for reliability and durability\nIt has an extremely strong body of copper silumin aluminum\nhe FM2's film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings", "Name": "Nikon FM 2 Black Camera Body", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zXEOC6jOL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001N9IXM4"}}
