{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good but could be better", "Author": "Maxtov", "ReviewID": "R1FIQD0R2EJ874", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera about 6mo ago. After ~2GB of pictures:1. Decent quality - you gotta understand that it is not SLR so for a compact it is OK. Viewing 100% size shows no visible defects.2. Really small - important since what good is your camera if it stays at home most of the time. That one fits in the pocket, but you'll feel it there.3. Takes AA batteries - good thing just in case4. Has multiple modes and settings - not too useful, but it doesn't hurt either.---------------Now for what could be better:1. Slow as you would not believe shooting @5MP and best resolution. When this red light is blinking (writing to card) you can't do anything and it lasts forever.2. Slow in general - takes too long between you push the button and the picture being actually taken. Pple turn around, move out of frame and so on.3. Buttons are tiny - well, the camera is tiny too, but still...If you plan to use gloves or just have large hands - forget about it.4. Battery usage - I use rechargable 2400mAh ones and they don't last too long. Indoor shots almost always use a flash so battery indicator goes yellow after about 20-30 shots no matter how you recharge your batteries (there are different ways to do it)Conclusion: It is worth the price if you need really small camera to take anywhere and want to stick with the combination of SD storage and regular AA batteries", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Could be better, but ok if you don't have kids", "Author": "technologyfan", "ReviewID": "R2P22E0A5H2S2J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after looking at several other cameras.  I liked the size of the camera, Pentax name and claimed battery life.  I think the color reproduction is ok, but not great, and the picture clarity is ok, but not great.  Using 2400 mAh recharageble batteries made this camera almost useless.  Since almost every shot requires a flash, I only would get 30 or so pictures before needing to switch batteries.  And since NiMH batteries loose charge when not in use, I would find the batteried dead if I left the camera a few day.  I have since purchased some 1400 mAh, Li-ion CRV3 rechargeble batteries.  These are a must for anyone with this camera.  I can't tell you how many pictures it gets per charge, because after 2 weeks it is still on the first charge, and has not even dropped from the full charge indicator!  This is several hundred pictures, viewing and deleting pictures on the camera and transfering the picutes to a computer.  As a bonus, since the CRV3 battery supplies a full 3V, the flash charges about twice as fast.  (NiNM AA batteries are only 1.3 V each)The main problem with the camera is how incredibly slow it is.  This camera is mostly used to take pictures of our kids, and kids do not sit still enough for this camera.  Every aspect of shooting a picture is very slow.  The other draw back is that this camera needs a lot of light, and the flash doesn't help for anything more than a few feet (about 10 or so) away.  Outside shots are usually fine if the sun is at least partially out.I am currenly looking for a faster digital camera, with a bigger lens to help in low light situations.", "Date": "May 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Whoa", "Author": "J.

I already own a Nikon 5700 but I was looking for a camera that I could:a) take anywhere, andb) take scuba divingWith its compact size and available underwater housing (and even supported \"marine\" modes) the Pentax seemed to fit the bill. I was actually undecided between the S50 and the Casio Exilim, so I actually ran a side-by-side comparison of the two. The S50 lost out in almost every discipline, the most important being picture quality (even though I was comparing to a 3MP Z30!), which I actually found to be quite poor on the S50. Apart from this, I was disappointed by the LCD screen, which was smaller and far less sharp than the Casio's, the larger size (although not by much) and the general build quality - the buttons, flaps and doors just felt cheap compared to other cameras.On the positive side, I did like the idea of being able to use standard AA's, but when you consider the amazing battery life of today's ultracompacts, it's really not an advantage. I was also impressed by the incredible array of features and options that the S50 packs in - unfortunately, these don't make up for the poor picture quality. My advice would be to choose a Casio Exilim. If price is an issue, get the Z30 or Z40 - you will still get better pictures.", "Date": "February 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "low battery life", "Author": "ND \"http://livingoffdividends.com\"", "ReviewID": "R2KFJP4GXRFHY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a great little camera. i bought it because of its size. it has some great features like being able to reduce the file size photos stored on it. panoramic assist is good and its very easy to use. it has some drawbacks too. red eye reduction always has to be used. the pictures are quite dark in low light settings and my biggest problem, low battery life. it uses 2 AA batteries. the rechargable batteries that came with it were charged for 12 hrs as recommended. i only got about 90 pictures out of them (16 were withflash). it also takes a while to write the images to the disk( even with the enhanced SD II card)but i still think its a great camera.", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "I don't understand the lack of reviews on this camera", "Author": "Alan M. Gutkin \"algutkin\"", "ReviewID": "RH20CL5ZHE0LE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It all started at the Chrismas boat parade party in Huntington Harbor, CA. I noticed this guy with a small camera taking pictures across the room. I could see the viewfinder screen from across the room, and it was clear. I just had to see that camera up close. The user was from Hong Kong, where everything is knocked off and relatively less expensive than the US. That impressed me, because, not only was the user very knowledgeable about cameras, he owned a fairly large company and could afford any camera. Why did he pick Pentax? I looked the camera over, he let me take some shots. I made a quick decision, I had to have one. The camera just felt good in my hand. That night I found a new one for $219.00 on the inet and bought it from a new camera discounter. (Buy Digital)OK, now I have it, what do I think? I think 5 stars. 5 MP, operates on 2 AA batteries, huge LCD RGB quality viewfinder, quality metal construction, no flimsy doors like the Canon SD300, no red eye, easy to understand and operate controls, fantastic pictures, flash works for more than 6 feet away, pictbrige photo transfer. The only negative is it does not come with a memory card, you have to buy one. The camera comes with 11MB, built in. I might mention that I also have a Nikon D70, I tend to grab the Pentax first, it's much easier. I'd love to see a comparison between this camera and the highly reviewed Canon SD300.Reviews are important before buying a camera, but if an educated camera enthusiast from Hong Kong says good things about a camera, especially, if a bargain price is not an issue, it meant more to me than 15 Canon reviews. My observation proved to be accurate. If you don't believe me, buy on, if you don't think it's excellent, keep the box and resell it on Ebay.", "Date": "January 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "It has some drawbacks!", "Author": "Rox", "ReviewID": "R76ZCSHM6OQWL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's an ok camera if you don't compare it with pther camera's but when you do you realize you could get as good for cheaper and better for the same priceHere's why I don't like this camera:The pictures can look a little pixelated at times I'd prefer if it was a bit smootherIt uses alkline batteries which can get expensive since the battery life it not great.It takes too long to warm up to take the shotThe indoor setting gives you alot of light streaks and its really useless and that's no exageration, I almost never use itMy roomate has a 5megapixel canon for  less $20 more I always take the photos from her camera to put on facebook instead of from mines cause it would be the same shot but hers just looked better, smoother, cleaner.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "What a deal!!!", "Author": "Addis Ababa \"Addis\"", "ReviewID": "R3IRHX52WKFY8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really good Camera.

However, this camera definitely comes with hidden charges. The most expensive and most fragile part in the camera - the LCD screen - is not covered by warranty. In my case, the LCD cracked without being bumped or dropped, (and the clear plastic protective cover didn't crack). This has led to THREE MONTHS of dealing with service centers, paying an additional approximately $150 for parts and labor, and I still haven't received the camera back fixed.

But after about a month or so it broke, and customer service was not at all helpful in having it repaired, and wound up costing an additional $100, so the low price no longer seemed so wonderful. Once it was returned (months later!) it worked very well for a while. My biggest complaint was the noise! It makes noise every time it turns on or off, which makes getting candid shots impossible! Adding to the problem with candid shots is the fact that it is INCREDIBLY slow! And asking people to hold a pose again and again because your camera is so darn slow doesnt make you the most popular photographer. It also doesnt take pictures of people moving, which I have recently learned is very uncommon. Most decent cameras come with a sport mode, which this lacks. It also apparently comes with all these features, but after having it over a year I'm still trying to figure out how to work them!what is great though, is the large memory size, and the amazing color features. You can choose to go in black and white, but highlight one color (blue, pink, and green), which is great, and takes some really cool shots (captures pink cheeks of a new baby!).", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good, stable, reliable camera with excellent picture quality", "Author": "Hypno Walrus \"normiepeterson\"", "ReviewID": "R17NVRGFUW8231", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used this digital camera on a trip to Miami and was very pleased with its performance.  What I liked most was the ability to customize my photograph according to light condition, object, etc...if I wanted to, or just use the auto setting feature of the camera.  If you want a certain shot to come out a certain way and you are confident that you can do that, then this camera will allow you to do that.  If you don't want to mess with that, then just use the auto setting that will balance everything out.  The pictures are clear, crisp, and well lit.  The flash is great.  Just keep in mind that there is a small delay between picture taking.  The SD card slot is easily located, battery life is excellent.  Another good point is the small size:  small enough to fit in your pocket, and use only one hand to take pictures if you want, but still large enough so that even large hands like mine (size XXL gloves)can access the buttons clearly, evenly, and without mistakes.  Although the complete instructions manual is more of a tome than a manual, the quick reference card helps out quite a bit.  Skimming the manual, if not reading it entirely, is strongly suggested to get the most out of this camera.  After that, it's a snap.  I definitely recommend this camera for everyday and some higher end applications, although I wouldn't use it for photo-critical situations and circumstances.
