I own a Nikon P90 (great zoom, great picture) which I thought was a step up from my old Olympus Tough, I had previously owned a Kodak and a Casio which I dreaded. (picture quality was really poor on both of them). The last camera I bought was a Panasonic ZS6 which is a phenomenal camera due to it's Lecia lens. After buying this camera I told myself that my next camera will either be a DSLR or a Lecia. (Both costs a lot of money)I first saw the camera at Costco which is selling it for less than $280 with an 4gb SD card and a Sony bag. I picked up the camera and spent about 20 minutes going over everything. It was awesome...* 10 shots in burst mode at the full 16.2 Megapixels due to it's \"Exmor R\" CMOS Image Sensor (not the slow CCD sensor/ processor that Kodak invented that everyone else uses.) It also takes awesome pictures at night like an DSLR without the flash.* 3 different Sweep Panorama modes, 1 standard , 1 wide, 1 high resolution. (up, down, left, and right)* GPS and Compass works great and syncs up with google maps and tells you where you are. (remember to turn it off before you turn the camera off or it may drain your battery)* Smile mode~~ three different setting for different types of smiles, depending how big your smile is.* Face Detection has 3 different modes one mode gives you priority over who you are taking a picture of, either child over adult or adult over child.(up to 8 people)* HD Video~~AVCHD  at (1920 x 1080 @ 60i)24Mbs, (1920 x 1080 @ 60i)17Mbs, (1440 x 1080 @ 60i)9Mbs (face detection and zoom works while taking a movie). The movie mode also has 2 different stabilizer usually only found in camcorders making this camera dual purpose.* Zoom 10x Optical plus digital multiplies this up to 1000mm or 40x zoom.* 3D Still Image and 3D Sweep untested needed a 3D camera and HDMI cable.* Advanced Manual and Priority setting where you can select the Aperture and the shutter speed. Within the camera you can also select the ISO which is needed in order to get the right exposure.* works with mac and pcsome of the other features it has are background defocus, 25mm wide lens, Shutter Speeds : iAuto (2\" - 1/1,600) / Program Auto (1\" - 1/1,600) / Manual (30\"-1/1600), Scene Mode(s) : High Sensitivity / Soft snap / Landscape / Twilight Portrait / Twilight / Gourmet / Beach / Snow / Fireworks/ Pet / Soft Skin / Handheld Twilight / Anti Motion Blur, ISO : Auto / 125 / 200 / 400 / 800 / 1600 / 3200I personally LOVE this camera. It is small and easy to put into a pocket or a purse, it has the shutter speed of a DSLR and the zoom of a lens that works while taking HD 1080 @60i videos. The biggest debate is what is better 1920 x 1080 @ 60i or 30P which is better? (they are the same?) It can zoom in as close as 1000mm and can take Sweep Panorama which is awesome!!!I went to Orlando 2 years and took over 1000 pictures 5 of them using panorama assistto take a picture of the Lake at Epcot. I to this day have not used the software in my computer to stitch them together. who has time to do this? This is why I love Sweep Panorama, it does all the work for you..I can't believe it takes 16mp shots at 10 shots per second, It's smaller than a Micro 4/3's and and as fast as a Professional grade DSLR for a tiny fraction of the price.Don't believe me try it yourself, Costco has a 90 day return policy with no restocking fee, ever!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow---I am really impressed!!!!", "Author": "LoveMyToys", "ReviewID": "R6Q0O7CE62UF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera from Costco for $275, bundled with a sony case and a class 4 4gb SDHC card. I have been playing with it for the past three or four days--which really isn't enough time to give a full review, but I would like to give my initial thoughts. By way of background, I am a \"junior\" shutterbug. I enjoy taking quality pictures. but I am more of a videographer--I have a Canon HG10, with a JVC Everio GZ-HM300 as a backup. My wife and I have been shooting with Panasonic TZ5 that we bought a few years ago and I also shoot with a Nikon D60 and a 1984 model year Minolta X-700 (I learned how to take pictures with this baby).I wanted a compact megazoom for my wife that takes excellent photographs in all conditions and could sub in for a full fledged HD camcorder in a pinch--and one that my wife could use to take pictures of our new baby (soon to be born). This camera seems to do the trick--with some caveats. First, the camera takes excellent photographs. Put the camera in superior autofocus mode and you can take perfect pictures 90 percent of the time.  In bright, direct sunlight, the sun will cause glare across the picture--the camera does a decent job of adjusting for this, but it can screw up your shot.  I don't dock the camera points for this though since I have yet to see compact camera do any better.  In my opinion the pictures are very sharp, with accurate colors--although reds can appear slightly oversaturated.  Most cameras have a bias---the panasonic zs10 blows out greens.  You aren't going to get $2,000.00 DSLR type performance out of a $275 compact camera, but this does a great job.  Now, I have read some reviews, both consumer and professional, that found the pictures to be on the soft side. I just don't see it.  Perhaps if you're blowing prints up to 16x20 or 20x40 or something like that there's \"softness\", but consumers don't usually make anything bigger than 8x10.  The consumers that are complaining of softness are probably just reflecting what they read in  the professional reviews--because even with my discriminating eye I just don't see what they are talking about.On top of taking great photos, this is a fast camera----very very fast for a compact. Using the intelligent focus feature, I was able to fire off 8 shots in about 2.5 seconds (shooting at 10mp, not the max 16mp)--with 7 of the shots coming out very good and one blurry. The camera is also capable of taking a burst of ten pictures in 1 second--although quality is effected in the burst.  I was shooting inside using incandescent lighting, at night, with the flash off and I got some of the best indoor low light pictures of any camera--the camera will take 6 pictures of the same scene in one shot and then stitch the images together to form a composite image that is shockingly good.  Say hello to low light pictures that aren't blown out by a over flash on a compact!!!!  Unbelievable!!!The camera handles low light well and the flash only washes out the image.As for video quality, this camera is capable of producing very solid video (and above average audio for a compact camera).  Honest, the video quality is on par with my jvc everio GZ-HM300--which is a dedicated midrange HD camera!  Now, I did have some issues with the video quality when shooting in low light--there is quite a bit of noise, particularly indoors with halogen lighting.  Shooting the same scene with my jvc, I noticed the JVC also struggled with the lighting and the final product was only marginally better than the Sony.  Considering that this is a P&S; camera  first that also happens to shoot HD video, that's pretty outstanding stuff.  With some tweaking of the EV levels, I was able to get good video quality even in poor light, but the colors were a bit washed out looking--still very watchable.  In day time, the same scenes looked as good or better than  the video taken on the JVC (aided by Sony's excellent image stabilization) and not far off from my $1000 canon HG10.  Sound quality was also very good for a compact camera, with good stereo separation.  I did have some problems playing back the hightest profile video taken at 17mbps and 24mbps.  I am using a Dell Studio running a Core 2 Duo P8600 processor with ATI HD 4600 discrete graphics card, and the 17mb and 24mb per second AVCHD video's wrecked havoc with my computer and were not watchable--way too choppy. I am able to play 17mbps video in the same AVCHD format from the JVC and Canon camcorders, so I am not quite sure what the prolbem is.  Still, using the lower profile 9mbps AVCHD or 1080p MP4 format (30fps) at 12mbps yielded more than sufficient video quality for my needs.  I don't blame the camera for the choppiness of the higher profile AVCHD files--those files  a challenge for most computers (unless you have a top of the line gaming rig).  Please note, I would recommend using a class 6 or higher SDHC card with this camera (even thought Sony says you can use a class 4). I did notice that the video quality was noticeably smoother on faster cards (I am using a Transcend 16gb Class 10 SDHC card).As far as build quality goes, it seems pretty decent to me--I'll reserve judgment though. The camera is comfortable to hold and Sony was kind enough to use soft rubber grips on the camera to reduce slippage and make it more comfortable.  Anyway, that's my preliminary thoughts and I will add to and update this review as I play with the camera more in the coming weeks.Update 6/28/11:  This camera keeps getting better and better the more I get comfortable using it.  Our baby girl was born on 6/2. Since then I have taken roughly 3,000 pictures and 5 hours of video (which will obviously be heavily edited when I find the time).  The picture quality is very good to excellent. I do recommend using the Intelligent Auto mode most of the time and only using the Superior Auto for shooting static images in low light.  The Superior Auto will default to HDR in what the camera determines to be a low light condition (takes multiple images of same scene and merges them to form a composite).  If the subject is moving  you're left with a mess.  Using Intelligent zoom will cause the camera to default to a higher ISO instead, unless your have flash set to auto.  After a while you'll get a feel for when Superior or Intelligent will yield the better picture.  Alternatively, you can switch to program mode or full manual mode.  I find the full manual implementation to be a bit clumsy on this camera--not a huge fan of job wheels.  The program mode allows you to make most of the choices you would make in manual, but the camera controls focus and shutter speed--and will usually make better choices than I would make when left to my own devices.  These modes, if you take the time to master them, will allow you to take some really awesome pictures.  Sticking to the auto modes is fine too.  I do now see what some people are complaining about when they claim that the pictures are on the soft side.  This can be easily fixed using any of a number of photo shop software selections or using the Sony PMB software that is included with the camera (which isn't bad at all for a freebie).  I am still very pleased with the video quality and have been shooting video almost exclusively with the Sony--it's just so much easier to carry this around and use it as an all in one rather than lugging either of my camcorders.  The video when set to the higher bit rates in AVCHD is good enough that I don't feel the extra inconvenience of carrying the Canon is worth the trade off.I have posted a video review of youtube.  I tried to post a link, but it was edited out by Amazon from some reason.  If you're interested, go to youtube and search for \"set2374 hx7v review\" and it will pop right up.  At the end of the review, I posted a couple of sample pictures and video.  Hope they help you with your decision.Update (7/27/11):  Well folks, my HX7v had an unfortunate meeting with the sidewalk.  Needless to say, this is not a ruggedized camera.  Fortunately, I was able to return it to costco for a full refund.  As I have used the camera, I continued to enjoy the IQ and video quality, but the red push and oversaturation became more irksome. The pictures looked sharp and clear, but the colors were a little too vivid for my taste.  I would photoshop the pictures and make them look great by tweaking the color and saturation levels and I was ok with that, but it was a tad annoying to have to do it all the time.  Any actual red in the photos would look over saturated--just too red.  A cranberry red would come out cherry red.  With indoor photos, the  hue of the pictures were a bit too warm for me as if there was a red filter on the camera.  The flash would cancel this out, but all flash photos have their own issues with color.  The video quality also had this same coloration quality.  I think some people would like the vividness and oversaturation (TV's are always set with a bluish tint to the white balance and color saturation dialed up out of the box)--so why would we expect sony to handle camera color differently.I opted not to replace the RIP HX7 with an HX7 and, instead, tried the Panasonic ZS10.  The picture and video quality was simply awful.  I kept that camera for less than 24 hours.  I then decided to step up to the HX9V because it allows the user to control color, saturation, contrast and hue all in camera.  I have to say, what a huge difference.  Even without adjustments the HX9 is an improvement over the HX7.  With tweaks to the settings (all of which can be programmed into customized settings) the still pictures are spectacular.  The video also allow for manual color correction and, when set to 1080p at 60fps (not available on the HX7) with tweaks, the video quality is as good as my $1200 Canon HG10.  I think cameras like this will kill off dedicated camcorders over time.  The sound quality is also quite good--slightly better than the HX7 (not a huge difference though).  In short, I love the HX7 and have no qualms with recommending it, but if you can swallow spending an extra $50 on the HX9V--you will be getting a noticeably better camera.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost ready for prime time", "Author": "Meir Kryger", "ReviewID": "R31AYKP2BVP6UV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a fairly experienced film and digital hotographer and based on the specs and some reviews took it as my main camera for a three week Scandinavian and Baltic trip. I did not want to lug around an SLR. That was a big mistake. I took many great shots, but had to discard many and missed many.  You have read about the pros and cons, but I will just give you the cons, the reasons why I am returning this camera. The list is in order of importance of problems. FYI I was using a  class 10 high speed memory card.It was really slow in starting up and switching modes or accessing photos. Often you would lose 4-6 seconds. You often missed the shot. Often it would indicate \"processing\" after a shot for 3 to 5 seconds after the shot was done. Again, as a result you missed shots.The battery after a full charge could barely handle a day of shooting. I had to turn off all sources of energy loss: screen brightness down to 1 or 2; GPS off (it often didn't work, anyways), minimize changes in zoom, shoot \"simple modes\" that don't require much processing.It had hardware problems. Sometimes when switching modes to the intelligent superior mode it would actually start recording video. Had to reboot the camera (turn it off or remove battery). It would not stop recording on it's own. Some of the controls (screen brightness, date/time adjustment and others) stopped working. I had to initialize it (return to factory settings) several times.Programming was a problem. On some settings you could not force a flash (eg intelligent superior). On the manual mode the controls to change settings (ISO, shutter, etc) did not work. Even the menu system stopped working not allowing me to change display brightness. The design of the menu system involves many steps  and is not intuitive.The auto settings were sometimes a very pleasant surprise but sometimes resulted in a very unpleasant surprise. It had a lot of variability in quality in low light with sometimes great shots but frequently a flash would not go off when it should have.Sweep panorama was inconsistent. Usually it failed or gave a small image. For example from a mountain top taking a photo of a fjord failed if there was anything that moved in the water a mile away. Zoom did not work in this mode. If the sweep was from a light to a darker image, the same exposure was used for all, resulting in an often unacceptable image.Lens flare was a common problem. More common than I had experienced before.Background defocus only worked when the subject was about 30 cm away from the camera.Although the specs on the camera were terrific, the programming and hardware problems force me to return this. Maybe I had an unusual lemon. I suspect that the next iteration of this camera will be great.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, Great FULL HD Videos, Easy to use, great Macro,", "Author": "Ricardo Benitez Bathen", "ReviewID": "R2JE9I8DY5NRWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera like 2 weeks ago. This is one of the best camera I've bought.

It takes great background defocus pictures (they are so cool). The camera isn't big, it has a great Zoom (10x), low light pictures (high quality pictures in the dark), the screen looks awesome. The compass is not a big feature. One thing I love of this camera is the 10 pics per second burst feature, they look great and you take them really fast. The menu is really easy to understand, it's better than other Sony's menu.The manual mode is great, you can set the exposure time, ISO, etc.The macro is great, to take pictures in a very low distance you have to use Zoom (I'll attatch some pictures later).So, the camera is veary easy to use, it takes very nice pictures, High Quality videos and excelent Zoom.I recommend you to buy this camera.If you think this is the same as a Sony Wx9, it is almost the same, this camera has Compass, 10x Zoom and it takes longer exposures.Regards.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "amazing camera", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1VCZTHDIDQAU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this to replace our Sony DSC W70 - a trusty camera from day 1.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1HX2NPWASBNX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a little background, I received a different Sony Cybershot as a gift after a succession of Canon point-and-shoots over the past 15 or so years, all of which I loved. The Sony was disclaimed as an experiment, since Canon hasn't produced a camera I loved as much as the SD750 since that model. The chosen Sony didn't have quite my hoped-for configuration of upgrades from the 750, so I was encouraged to exchange it and after pretty exhaustive research, I traded up to the HX7V. I LOVE this camera.I've only taken a few minutes of video, and while it's really good, it's not why I wanted this camera or why I like it so much. It just takes great pictures, with enough megapixels and a broad enough focal range to be extremely versatile, as it very accurately claims. I couldn't take pictures of anything large with my SD750 that was less than 10 feet from me, but with the Sony, I can take a full-length picture of somebody standing just a couple steps away. Frankly, the Canon beats it on macro quality, but not by much, and it's much easier to use effectively on the Sony.A few things about other modes... The continuous panoramic mode on the Sony is very cool but not the main draw for me. What's really amazing is the burst mode, so fast it's practically frame-by-frame video. Sure, it takes a few seconds to process the series, but if you want to just sit with the shutter button pressed down, get a DSLR or just shoot video, for crying out loud. I have NO complaints about a series of pictures that CLEARLY capture a hummingbird feeding and flying away (on Action setting, in burst mode), everything sharp but the wings, for which you need A LOT more camera for A LOT more money. It's also amazing in low light, apparently largely because of the CMOS sensor it shares with good Canons. Hand-held twilight mode gives me pictures I never thought I'd get from a compact. With no tripod and the camera on full zoom, I took pictures of the moon that show the craters on the soft edge, that you can only see when it's not full, with at least decent binoculars. I repeat, nice moon pictures WITH NO TRIPOD. That just doesn't happen, so it's the best example I can think of. For kicks (i.e. because I didn't believe it could do it), I've taken pictures in a completely dark room with no flash, and it actually finds the object and with minimal light, as from a streetlight outside or a nightlight in an adjacent room, it takes a recognizable picture. The fact that it can even find something to focus on is amazing, let alone that it will take its picture.  All that to say that this is a serious light sensor. Clearly, pictures taken in a dark room are not Pulitzer prize winners, but my point is that this camera has this kind of capability, and if you just bother to play with the settings and learn how to use it right, it will meet just about any challenge you can give it. Another setting that's really great blurs the background, simulating a low aperture as on a SLR, for a really shallow depth of field. It's not always flawless, but without studying it, you'd swear you took those pictures with a different camera. And also worth noting is the backlight correction. I don't remember ever taking a picture against a bright background (sky, sunset, etc) that didn't show the foreground as completely black, unless I \"tricked\" the camera by focusing on the foreground and holding the shutter button halfway until I went back up to get the sky in it. Then of course, the sky's completely white, so that wasn't exactly a win either. The HX7V actually corrects for that somehow and balances it out, without any \"tricking.\" Again, I'm sure it's not going to be \"perfect\" to a professional/studio photographer, but I take an awful lot of pictures, and I like to take good pictures, and it's better than I'd expected or even hoped for in a less than a thousand-dollar camera.That said, I've taken most of my pictures on the intelligent auto setting, because after leaving it there and paying attention to the settings it chose, I saw that it was usually going with the settings I would have chosen anyway, or using ones that made for better pictures than I would have taken if left to my own impulses. The very few times it hasn't, I've changed it, pretty simple. There's an enormous range of automatic and manual options for a camera of this size and price range, and anything it doesn't have, I definitely haven't missed, if I've noticed it at all. Color is true, both on the card and on the LCD screen, and everything is incredibly easy to use, and bear in mind that this is coming from somebody who had used only the Canon interface on all previous digital cameras. Battery life is also great, and it will use generics if you want to pick up a spare for few bucks.I still think Canon makes a great camera, although they seem to be stuck in some feature/design/size/price area for the past couple years that doesn't meet my needs or wants. Even at 3 years old (and with no IS), the SD750 took many beautiful pictures for me and was only seriously limited by low megapixels, minimal zoom, and sort of weird indoor color and light usage. We still have a couple of Canons in the house, and the Rebel can't be beaten, in my opinion, for a full-size DSLR. We recently got a used Panasonic Lumix FS-22 for one of the kids, and it's a great camera, too, my preference for my own replacement until I got ahold of this Sony HX7V. The Sony was brought in on a trial run and not staying if it did not outperform every other point-and-shoot in the house, and it's still here, so that sums it up as well as anything could.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best overall cameras out there", "Author": "Jason Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1D5YLG0KJ5X98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must admit I LOVE cameras.

The response time for the auto-focus is very good (something that always bugged me about my several previous Canon cameras).  The zoom is crystal clear.  Most importantly, the images look beautifully rich and sharp, even using the intelligent auto mode.  The interface is intuitive and easy to use.Cons:There is a delay between pressing the record video button, and the recording actually starting (a couple of seconds).  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.  Also the PC interface is a bit clunky.  I had to install the Sony software that came with the camera to even be able to pull video recordings off the camera.

I am not a Sony employee, nor have any other relationship with them beyond that of a consumer.I love this camera! I, too, bought this camera at Costco and I think it was a great deal! I have been an Olympus fan for years, but I decided that this year I was going to do a little reseach and try to be more open minded. I have not regretted my purchase yet.For a compact camera, I think it does incredible photos and the low light shots are impressive. It, of course, will not be the same quality as a DSLR but this camera already blows away the quality of my poor old Olympus (which is five years old to be fair). I have already taken some great photos of birds and landscapes. The panoramic images are not HD, unfortunately, but I still think they look good, considering that Sweep Panorama function compiles it together for you.I haven't had too many problems with fuzzy or blurry images yet. I generally encounter that more when I am on the wrong setting for a particular shot, but have easily remedied it. I haven't tried the 3D function yet since I don't have a high definition TV to view them on.Perhaps the only real complaint I have with the camera at this point is that the flash is incredibly powerful! Even in situations where the flash is mandatory (i.e. only one light on in the house at night), things can get a little washed out. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but it does satisfy the requirements I had when I went looking for a camera? Very much so!

Other aspects of the camera are also slow (startup, shutdown, etc..)Also, the flash is in a bad place relative to holding the right side. Just 1 cm to towards the middle would've made such a difference. Finally, some of the buttons are really hard to \"press\". Specifically viewing pictures, I've had to press it multiple times and you have to do it JUST right. Lastly, not having a viewfinder (yes, I knew it going in) for the first time, was a struggle in certain lighting situations.I could deal with those last 3 items and write them off, but the speed just kills. Very difficult to recommend because of that.

Donnelly", "ReviewID": "R2QEWFTQTUGZVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Accepting the obvious limitations that one gets in a point an shoot camera, the Sony HX7V is really an excellent example.  I own a couple of Nikon DSLR cameras (D700 and D300), but they are large and bulky for every day carrying around, traveling on my motorcycle, etc. So I like having  a point and shoot model as a 3rd option. I have always had a point and shoot of some sort, my last being a Canon SD890 IS, which I purchased after returning a Sony and Nikon model. NO, I am NOT a Sony employee (as another reviewing  wrongly accused everyone who leaves a positive review of being).  I have actually had very mixed results with Sony products over the years, some big disappointments, and was very tentative about this purchase.I originally purchased a Nikon S9100. The pictures from the Nikon model seemed soft, whites and highlights in backlit photos easily blew out leaving no detail in some areas. Focus when zoomed out was painfully slow and often locked when focus wasn't optimal, resulting in a blurry photo. Image Stabilization was very noisy, a constant buzzy/whine.  I took me about half a day of shooting to decide I *really* didn't like the S9100. I was really disappointed, obviously I like Nikon and was really hoping they had stepped up their game in the point an shoot camera genre, they haven't.Next, I traded for a Panasonic Lumix ZS-10. I found the Panasonic to be very blocky (water color), even at low ISO and unacceptable at higher ISO. Lots of noise at ISO 400 and higher.I returned that and swapped it for the HX7V.  I was kind of frustrated and disappointed at that point. I was on camera number 3 (again), when trying to find a decent point and shoot, and the Sony only had a 10X optical zoom, while both the S9100 and ZS-10 both had farther reaching 16X.  It didn't take long for me to get past that shortcoming. The HX7V takes some really nice photos for a point and shoot camera, far surpassing the S9100, the ZS-10 and my previous SD890 IS.  Are they on the level with my D700 or D300? Of course not, but we are talking about a sub-$300 point and shoot, not a DSLR. The SB-700 flash for my DSLR's cost more than this camera, so who could expect it to be on par?For a point and shoot camera the HX7V is well designed. The menus are well laid out, the controls easy to find and use. The modes give a decent explanation of what each will do. The two auto modes, Intelligent and Superior, will take a good quality photo in most situations, but Sony did include a number of scene modes to allow you to over-ride the auto settings, as well as Program Auto and Manual for some more advanced user selected settings.  The camera seems to hold highlights well, color rendition and contrast is good. I find as with most point and shoot cameras, the images tend to be a little soft and can benefit from some sharpening, but that seems to be typical for the genre.  They really tend to be aimed at the consumer market where people generally want to do minimal, if any, post processing on the photos. Most simply want to be able to snap the photos and print, email or post the photos. The HX7V is well geared toward that. If folks wanted more, they would purchase a DSLR.  Build quality seems decent, on par, if not better than most in the price range. The rubberized grip on the right hand side is a nice touch, and makes holding on to the camera easier than many I have had. It lacks the titanium body and weather proof aspects of one of my previous point and shoots, and no doubt won't survive a \"drop test\" as well as that one did, but it takes far better images. There are always trade-offs in trying to maintain a price point. The biggest knock I have with the HX7V is probably the GPS feature.  While a nice idea, it is very slow and tends to eat up battery power.  I have to admit, I am likely spoiled by the GPS unit I have for my D700, but again that unit was half the price of this camera, so I am likely over reaching expectations.Long story short, for a point and shoot camera, the HX7V is an excellent example and I think most folks who are in the market for a compact, light weight, sub-$300 travel camera, that will take a good quality photo, will be pleased with it.  I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Favorite camera so far!", "Author": "kristen m. bernhardt", "ReviewID": "R2MWJZEFFSYA75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I'm not a photographer...I just love to document all the fun stuff I do and the places I go and take pictures or videos of my friends being silly.  I've owned quite a few different point and shoot digital cameras over the years...the last one was a Canon 780 something and it was decent...but not super intuitive to use and the controls were really hard to see as I got the black model (black on black in a darkish room or outside at night and I may as well be blind.)  It was also so small I was always afraid i was going to lose it, and that's exactly what happened.My roommate has a sony cybershot touch-screen model and she always gets really great shots, even in low light.  And that's been my problem with all of my previous digital cameras - I can't get a clear shot in low light without using the flash, and with the flash everyone looks ghostly white and washed out.  And it's impossible to capture anything with cool outdoor lighting (like pics at night at Burning Man.)  So I decided to go with the Sony this time around, and I chose this model after reading a bunch of reviews that said it was a really good camera for someone like me who doesn't need a lot of manual control (although this does have that too) and just wants to be able to take great shots all the time without trying too hard.  It really does work!  What I see is what I get - I've never had a camera that took the photo exactly as I was seeing the scene with my eyes, even in low light.  Video is great quality too!  I don't know if it's just because the technology has finally progressed to a point where this is possible or if it really is a superior product, but I don't care...I love the camera!  The only thing that is slightly annoying is the way it uploads from my memory card...i formatted it in the camera and the pics and especially videos are buried beneath several layers of folders containing seemingly nonsensical files.

Switching between modes can be quick (about 1 second), even with a class 4 card, if you press the center of the control wheel after shifting the mode dial. And switching from reviewing your pictures to taking another picture (or the other way around) takes ~2 seconds.  I think it takes quality pictures with several dark or blurry pictures here and there. The low-light ones it takes continually amaze me. It has taken some non-blurry close-ups of people running around playing soccer; and, of course, with good light, it takes great pictures. But I'm not a professional photographer; so good for me might not be good for others. =)  It does take pictures very quickly, and recovery time is ~2 seconds (potentially 1 second if you're fine shooting blind).  The only thing I'm not sure about it that the screen does show the pictures' color to be more vivid than they appear on the computer (though it is true that, as a different review said, the ones appearing on the computer are closer to reality...).

Burst photo is good for getting the right moment of a smile. That is, tell someone to smile, and using the burst feature, you raise the chances of capturing the smile at its peak. Many programming options, but one I don't see is setting the time a photo remains on the display. It's always gone by the time you turn it around to show someone the picture.The very high HD resolution is a blessing and a curse. These are the highest resolutions ever available to consumers, however, chances are your laptop/PC won't be capable of playing, let alone editing, these videos. Only the most recent, powerful, processers will be able to play these videos, and accompanying audio. Otherwise, playback is a black screen, or at best, choppy and full of dropouts.

I saved an appreciable amount of money, and am convinced the camera was never used (see wrist strap comment below). I was concerned when the camera had not shipped after about five days.

They offered to upgrade me to overnight shipping, and the camera arrived the next day. Good customer service response.A small but frustrating element of the design is the hole for the wrist band.

Autofocus, image stabilization work smoothly on panning, zooming in video. You can choose either AVCHD or MP4 file format. Photo quality is also very good under good lighting condition.

Indoor shot is better than average P&S; with fairly usable ISO 800. But there is some color bias toward orange or yellow if flash is not used.

I may have to look at the pics on someone else's 3D tv sometime, but at the moment the pics I've taken have just been messing around. One feature I really like is the burst shooting. You can choose between two speeds (10 pics in one second, or 10 pics over about a 4-or-so second period), but viewing the burst shots is what gets me. The burst shots are kept under one picture preview and when you select it you can tilt the camera back and forth and it will go through the pics like a video kinda.

Also, if you are using the camera during sunny days, there is a lot of glare from the glossy black glass.Overall, the camera is a fun camera, and can take pictures and photo's with some practice.

I picked up the Cybershot from Costco and decided to test it out. I am particularly impressed with the pictures it takes in low light and at nighttime. It can capture city lights at night on auto. Sweep panorama is kind of cool and I also really like the background defocus mode - makes it look like I took the picture with a SLR. Small detail but I also like that the battery charges with the same cord that I use to transfer photos so that I don't have to remember to bring an extra battery charger when I travel. Though might not be ideal for people who like to keep multiple batteries.My only concern is the lag when I'm trying to navigate within the camera. Takes a little time turning the camera on/off, switching between viewing pictures and going back to shooting mode, and switching between various shooting modes. I really have to push the buttons like I mean it or multiple times. Luckily there is no lag when taking the pictures.From other reviews I read, other cons seem to be that the camera doesn't take raw pictures and doesn't have aperture priority or shutter priority modes. Personally I'm not that savvy of a photographer so the lack of these features didn't bother me that much.

The only thing that is bothersome, as far as we can tell, you can only download the movies to your computer with the provided Sony software.

We need a nicer camera as we're expecting our first child this fall, and wanted something to catch great photos that was easy to carry (this was key - I have a nicer, bulkier camera but I know I'm not going to want to lug that around with the baby and all his stuff).  A tall order, I know.To be fair, I've only taken less than 20 photos with this camera as a test.  So far, the pictures are okay... but not awesome.  On the camera's screen the lighting is great!  Pretty much exactly like I expect it to be.  But then, after uploading the photos onto my computer, I'd have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the lighting is so much duller (adjusted color settings in a fruitless effort to try to improve things to no avail).  If the photos looked like they did on the camera's preview screen I'd be elated!  They look sharp and the lighting is exactly right on the camera itself.  However... sadly, as I've said, once uploaded my happiness disappears quickly.I will continue to experiment for a few days (and will update the review if possible if I find contrary results to the above) but so far, if it doesn't improve I may return it.Other than that issue (a fairly important issue), the camera itself has a satisfying weight to it and it seems fairly straight forward to operate.  I do like that the same cord can be used to connect to the camera as to connect to the charging plug.Also - to the person who was complaining about the software not including support on a Mac: I haven't tried video yet, so that may be what you're referring to, but for just still shots - you just plug it in and the computer does the rest.  No need to install anything to upload the still shots (I've always found this to be the case with my Mac, very convenient - though my Canon has given me troubles with the computer not recognizing it sometimes.

It is Slooooooooooooooow to acquire a signal, and to do that you really do have to be out in the open.  Say you are in a Piazza in Venice.  3-4-5 minutes after turning on the camera you _finally_ get a signal so that you can tag the pictures you take and remember 10 years from now which duomo you were visiting.

We'll have to agree to disagree. I picked up the HX7V at Costco for $279 after playing with it in the store for a while.  Unfortunately, there's only so much you can test in the store and, without a computer and card reader on hand in the store, you must depend upon the accuracy of the viewfinder when making the decision.  That's one of the problems. The image on the back screen shows a different picture than what you'll get on the computer. It looks brighter with vivid colors.  In real life (on different calibrated computer monitors) images looked bland with poor white balance.  Pretty and lush greens from bushes and trees that look brilliant on the back of the camera look blah in real life. I'd shoot a photo, check it out on the display, make adjustments with exposure based on an image (that was not representative of the photo taken) then shoot it again.  Both shots ended up being way off with respect to white balance and exposure. Another problem is that in auto mode, it seems that the default is to shoot without the flash (unless it's really dark).  Instead of a nice shot assisted by the flash, you get an underexposed and blurry shot (because of the long shutter speeds).  And again, with poor white balance.  Sure, you can switch to program mode and force the flash, but then it's in that mode when you don't need the flash.  I'd just like a smart auto flash mode.  Lastly, the operation seemed a little sluggish.  Start up and stopping movies seemed delayed.  The positives? Noise seemed to be under control.  The panoramic feature is easy to use and nice (but again, with bland colors).  Images seemed sharp (when not blurry). The wide angle is nice, although most cameras have that now.

I missed out on many good pictures.Luckily I bought it from Costco and will be returning it today with no monetary loss.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed", "Author": "Rami Alnajjar \"Rami Allen\"", "ReviewID": "R25Z6SLEIEJZB4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THe following review is copied from a review i did for canon SX230 that included Sony DSC7, one more thing to add, the video quality on Sony  DSC-HX7v is superior to the canon.-----This review compared to my Noby experience with camerasI Owned before this canon the followingPanasonic TZ3Sony DSC7I had this canon for 3 days now, took 300 pictures, I'm not a professional nor hobbyist, just a father trying to find a good indoor camera for kids.Panasonic TZ3 owned for 3 years had a great stabilizer system which can prevent the had movement very well but had very very bad indoor photos and low light picturesthe Sony DSC7, pictures looked very well and nice on the Camera's 3.0 LCD, bright and crisp, but viewing these photos on computer looked bad, pictures look kinda washed out or cant put on word, may be had noise or looked like paint. even applying some editing to them didn't add anything. so I returned the sony and got the canon SX230HSCanon 230HS PROyou need or must have a good understanding of basic photography, Understand ISO and other simple settings.the camera took very well indoor shots, very nice a crisp without a flash, afternoon indoor photos without a flash looked way better than the same photos with a flash, the flash will bright the subject and darken the background. taking photos without a flash beats any point and shoot camera I used above.AUTO MODE, AUTO MODE, AUTO Mode, sucks, didnt do anything special, photos looked kinda grany with good noise.I used P mode, Scn mode, and Kids/pets mode and all did very well, I used Mostly P and kids/pets modes on most of my shots.Stabilizer system could have been better, some images came out blurry, my old Panasonic TZ3 had a better stabilizer than canon SX230HS. which make taking zoomed images harder, way harder.Some people recommended Panasonic LX5, I never tried it before and seems its almost $100 more and has more manual control.I'm still learning on this camera, I'm a big Canon Fan and buy anything Canon, as my experience with sony, Sony like to put Bling Bling on their cameras which make photos and images looks nice when you view them from the 3.0 LCD.I would Love to have the new Canon DSLR next to Canon SX230HS.as I said, i'm still learning on taking pictures, i will be taking more this week and post some them.If you are welling to pay more for point and shoot, take a feel and a look at Panasonic LX5 and Canon S95. these three camera I believe are the best in the market, buy one for a week use and return then get the another, view the pictures on your computer and have them printed out to compare image quality, dont just go by only viewing them on the camera's lcd or only your computer.this Camera and S95 as well as LX5 are all over priced, SX230HS should not be more than $250, same as any brand point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Flash problem", "Author": "P.

After set the \"flash\" mode on auto, the flash does not pop up no mater what setting I use. Since there is neither printed nor online manual, user would not even know where to begin to fix the problem. I tried the in-camera self trouble shooting explanation, but it only tells you how to switch between \"auto\" or \"off\" for the flash. It never addresses the issue why the flash would not pop up - totally worthless in-camera self guide. So, I have to try to take out the battery, re-initializing the unit, press the flash while taking pics - nothing works.I am taking it back to the store hopefully to exchange or return (but will incurr a 15% resocking fees if return) Terrible QC!!
