When downloaded and on a computer monitor, they were in focus. Click away!The other \"issue\" is that you are buying a camera from Japan and the enclosed warranty states it is only good for Japan.  In the US, you are not covered.  This is not as bad as it seems. The digital cameras I have had have a high degree of reliability.  The one that I had that suffered water damage was not economical to repair (Nikon D 70), so it this one goes out, I will probably use the money I saved to defray the cost of a replacement. the way things evolve in this area, it will be obsolete in a year or so anyway...", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like it =)", "Author": "noyb", "ReviewID": "R4FAVMQDLMND2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some other reviews I decided to get this product through Asuka. Asuka ROCKS! My product arrived in 5 days! It arrived quicker than my other products that were shipped from California! I was really iffy about buying something from another country, but just like many of the other reviewers, I was completely satisfied.I too got the chop sticks and the hand written letter! Chopsticks are pretty cool! If anyone goes through the trouble of doing all that, they are standing by their product.The camera is great! Is it a 999.000 camera? No, but I didn't spend $999.00 If your looking at needs of a 1k camera and up, your obviously not looking in the right department.About this camera. It takes great pics. Great Videos. Cool rapid fire shots which turn into a gif. pic is best way I can surmise it.High speed is cool. I got it for this porpuse. Just too fool around and have fun with it. Got some great video out of it. Is it as good as the 10,000.00-100,000 cameras? No, but I Paid 200 bucks for mine, and love it.If, you can't find Asuka like I couldn't. Look under buy from these seller and search for Asuka. Click on there store front link and look for the camera. They have really great prices.The focus movement is noisy. It is very light weight. Think has a plastic body.
