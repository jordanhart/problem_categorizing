Osborne", "ReviewID": "R3V608MP1QLNN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife who needs no more than a point and shoot. I wanted something she could throw in her purse and take everywhere so she would take more pics of our boys. I own a Nikon D70 (which is an awesome camera) but it is too big to for my wife and even for me sometimes.I figured if I was going to spend $500 (by the time I bought a memory card, case, etc...) on another camera I wanted to make sure it was as good as I could get in an ultra compact camera. So I actually bought 3 cameras, took about 75 pics apiece (half indoors and half outdoors). I took the best 20 pics (10 indoor and 10 outdoor) and got them developed. The three cameras were the Casio EX-S500, Nikon S1 and the Canon SD400 - I had no preference but since I already owned a Nikon I was pulling for that one a little.Out of the three the Nikon and Casio were easily the best. The Canon SD400 did not really compare in my opinion. The pics were soft and not very sharp. The exterior case of the Canon also seemed cheaper than the other two. It was a very hard decision between the Nikon and Casio.  Both had sharp pics but the Casio did seem to be a tad sharper...it was honestly hard to tell. The Casio was also a little easier to use...especially the menus on the back. We ultimately kept the Casio (took the other two back) because the pics were very good for a small camera and my wife liked the feel, look and size and felt it was easier to use.P.S. I would have been happy with either camera.P.S.S. All three cameras's had problem with red-eye but I think all cameras will at this size.P.S.S ***If you buy this camera I would definitely recommend you click on the menu button on the back and increase the contrast, sharpness and saturation to +1. The range is -2 to +2. That made a big difference in the colors jumping out and once it is changed it stays that way until you change it again.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Tips for Better Photos from Casio Exilim EX-S500", "Author": "M. Terretta", "ReviewID": "R2F18GMNZW3U6O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're a pro or pro-amateur photographer, you're likely tired of carrying bulky camera gear, but wish you could have a \"back pocket\" slim camera with you always.  That's the point of this gem: at 1/2\" thick, it's about the highest quality in the slimmest design available.Naturally, the \"out of the box\" configuration sets images up for mass market consumers printing on cheap home inkjets: too much contrast, with overbright highlights.  But this camera simplifies getting the perfect exposure if you make three simple tweaks:1. Turn on the real-time histogram function.  This allows you to see the image exposure plotted on a graph, with dark shades at the left and bright colors at the right.  If the graph hits the right, some part of the image will be overexposed.  If it hits the left, something will be underexposed.2. [optional] Change the default contrast value to -1.  This will give you more exposure latitude -- brights will be a little less bright, and darks a little less dark, so more shades will fit in your exposure.  It's easy to boost contrast after the fact, even free Picasa software will do it.  But you can't get back over/under exposed pixels.3. Assign EV (exposure value) compensation to the L/R (left and right) thumbpad keys.  With this change, you can fiddle with the exposure on-the-fly as you're looking at the image and histogram.  Typically, a -0.7 to -1.0 value will give you the brightest image without over exposing highlights.With these three (or optionally, two) quick image quality changes, the results will satisfy even a pro photographer enough to warrant keeping this wallet-thin camera glued to the hip.PROS:- Slimmest (1/2\" thin!) quality for the money- Burnt orange color welcome after blacks and silvers- Fantastic image quality for its size after above tweaks- High quality MPEG4 (use free MSFT MovieMaker, PSP9, etc., to downsize for sharing)- Photo-album slideshow mode when docked- Calendar layout of thumbnails to quickly locate recent pics- 30+ \"best shot\" groups of presets for almost any picture situation- Make your own additional image presets or groups of presets to add to the \"best shot\" menu- Whiteboard/scanner/business card mode that makes paper or whiteboards white and fixes perspective to appear straight- Excellent battery lifeCONS:- Camera needs the base to sync w/ computer or recharge (-1 star for this, sorry)- \"Full flash\" recycle time is long (because the flash is remarkably powerful)- Some bodies seem to have a soft-focus problem (but I've only seen this with bodies purchased at retail warehouses, not ones purchased from camera stores)", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great snapshot taker", "Author": "M. Lin", "ReviewID": "R3AU89VQESUAFK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro:- Very compact: the face of the camera is about the size of a playing card, and it's a bit less thick than a deck. Compared to the Canon SD400, it is slightly longer and somewhat less thick.- The stainless-steel body is very solidly built- Competent image quality; good sharpness and color- Nice big LCD screen- You're ready to take a picture within a second of when you press the power button- The docking cradle is really convenient- The menu system is very responsive and easy to use- Easily accessed \"Best Shot\" menu gives you a large selection of preconfigured scene modes, and you can define your own modes as well.- The camera has a number of small, thoughtful features that aren't advertised (the \"unexpected extra\", if you will). For example, the \"quick shutter\" function allows you to emergency skip the auto-focus and take a picture instantly, possibly saving you from missing a precious moment. On a similar note, the movie recorder can be configured to include the 5 seconds *before* you press the record button. \"Business shot\" can automatically straighten out pictures of business cards, whiteboards, etc. taken at an angle. You can turn on a live histogram while composing a shot.- Casio's accessories, such as batteries and carrying cases, are not *as* overpriced as they are from most digicam manufacturers.Con:- Merely competent image quality; higher ISOs and image stabilization can result in very noticeable noise- It's small and solid enough to carry around in your pocket, but for $400, do you really want to?- The docking cradle is an extra thing that you have to bring when you travel. (As far as I can tell there's no way to charge the battery without the cradle using the equipment in the box; I'm sure they'll sell you something, though) That stated the cradle is pretty small and light.- I am a little worried about the LCD screen, which actually juts out slightly from the camera body. You will want a carrying case.- The image stabilization is a mysterious function; we know it's digital, but it's not clear if there is an accelerometer in the camera detecting and correcting camera shake, or if it's purely a gimmicky after-effect, like digital zoom, or somewhere in between.- You can't change the optical zoom level while recording a movie. Also, the image stabilization does not apply to movies.- No viewfinder: it would be nice to have the option of saving battery power by not using the LCD screen.- The power button is too easily pressed by accident when putting the camera in a case, etc.- Some of the \"Best Shot\" modes have given me worse results than the default metering; particularly indoors without flash.- The manual for the camera is in PDF form only, on the included CD. There is only a bizarre and totally worthless \"Basic Reference\" printed booklet.In summary: this is a fantastic little snapshot camera. You probably won't want to rely on it for artsy-fartsy photos because of its fine, but not outstanding image quality. But it has a lot of thoughtful touches for the user, and you should strongly consider it if you're looking for an ultra-compact camera.", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Broekn and warranty not honored by Casio", "Author": "Matt in Oakland", "ReviewID": "R19D1KA4R7B95", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We've had this camera for 6 months. We loved it. Then the ring around the lens popped off after simply turning it on; it could not be reattached. The machinery inside was exposed. Casio took it back since it was under warranty, but, after we sent it to them, we were told that the lens ring was not covered. Even with their warranty in hand that stated everything (excluding the battery and power cord I believe) is covered, Casio insisted we pay nearly $200. In addition, we have been waiting 2 months to get the camera back (we still don't have it). We're so very frustrated. I would pursue them legally if I could justify the expense and effort.

The first time I used it was at my parent's anniversary party, which was in a restaurant at night.  I was having to take pictures where the setting was so dark, I could not see the image in the viewfinder, I am a photographer and brought my Nikon D-50 along just in case.  So not to lose any moments, I used both cameras for each picture I took (getting a sore neck from the D-50!) I plugged both cards into the photo kiosk at a local retailer, and am absolutely unable to tell of any difference in quality.  Now folks, I paid $1,000 for the D-50 and Nikkor lense.  This little casio has been with me at bars for birthday parties, concerts with crazy lights, even high school sporting events.  I can honestly say it is the best camera I have ever owned.  I have dropped it a few times, and it has held up very well.  I would recommend getting a clear screen cover for the display screen on back as to avoid scratching it.  I ended up paying $8.00 for a PSP screen protector kit, and cut down to fit.  I have 3 more screens in storage now.  The best feature is that when you turn the unit on, in under a second, you can snap a picture, and it will turn out great (came in really handy at a recent rock concert).  It is no bigger than a wallet so I am able to carry it everywhere.  I did much research on this purchase and am extremely satisfied by my decision.  I would highly recommend.  I also have several technical Casio watches, and I have always been very impressed by Casio's superior customer service.  If you have windows XP, you won't need to load the software on your CPU, I have found it easier to use windows media.  I would recommend saving the manual on your desktop (250+ pages) in a pdf file.  I actually printed it out, and learned the things this camera can do are limitless.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Broke after 53 days.

It was nice and small and took decent pictures, although everything was white-washed when I used the flash.After using the camera a total of 4 times in under 2 months, the belt that operates the extension of the lens slipped off track while I was zooming in for a shot.  I assumed that since the camera came with a one year warranty, I would be ok.  Not so.Casio wanted to charge me $220.85 in order to put the belt back on track.  They said that since the problem had to do with the lens, it wasn't covered under warranty.  The lens wasn't cracked, I never dropped the camera, and it was in otherwise perfect condition.  I tried explaining this multiple times whenever I could actually reach someone in customer service, but they insisted that they didn't have to honor the warranty.  Not only that, but they wouldn't send the camera back to me unless I paid $8 for the return shipping!I strongly suggest buying a different brand of camera.  I now use a Nikon that was half the price of the Casio, and it takes great pictures.  Not only that, but I had my Nikon in my flak jacket for two months while in Iraq and it still works perfectly fine.In my experience, Casio makes a low quality camera and doesn't honor their own warranty.", "Date": "March 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "K.

It is so small and slim that it will slide right into your back pocket and you forget that it's there (but not the best place to carry it!) I keep it in my purse at all times, and I've used it almost daily.  I am definitely a point and shoot kind of girl, and this camera makes that so easy.  No waiting for warm-up, no lag between pics.  It has so many settings to choose from (and they're easy to understand!) that one of them is bound to be perfect.  I usually just leave mine on the automatic setting, but you should probably put it on anti-shake if you're not using a flash indoors or your picture might not turn out as sharp as you would like.The camera is very easy to operate -- even a caveman could do it :)  It takes decent videos too.  I don't know how long you can video, I guess until your memory card is full.  I don't think the camera limits your time.If there are ANY problems with your pictures, it is really simple to correct them, including red eye, color, etc. by downloading the free program from [...].  Flash distance seems to be just fine, and it also takes good pictures when it's dark.Charging the camera on its little dock and getting the pictures onto your computer is so easy that even I can do it, which is saying something!

You would think that the videos are being taken with a handheld cam...but no...its just this tina camera.  :)  Also, the audio quality is excellent with the camera.One final note...it is true what they say about taking pictures of paper with this camera.  If you take a picture of a page in the phone book, you can read the numbers on the page using the cameras LCD.  The quality is awesome...it looks like the page was scanned.

Easy to use.", "Author": "A. Langston", "ReviewID": "RAOUW1OAF4KLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a perfectly good Canon Powershot 3MP that worked fine.  I purchased this camera for three specific features.  I wanted to be able to use the zoom without a tri-pod.  The anti-shake function allows me to use the optical zoom and the digital zoom without a tri-pod without having the shot come out blurry.  I secondly wanted to be able to capture action shots without using movie mode.  The quick shutter function on this camera is terrific.  If it is a series of shots you wish to capture this camera has a feature that will allow you to take a short movie and then make turn it into stills automatically.  The third thing I wanted to be able to do was to switch between shooting environments using pre-sets.  This camera has 15 pre-sets and I find them VERY useful. But let me say here that a couple of them are not as useful as they could be.The candlelight portrait preset is for use with a tripod or for when someone is sitting perfectly still.  The sample photo is of someone blowing out candles on a birthday cake.  I've tried very similar shots and they came out totally blurry. The shutter speed is too slow for the motion of the person bending over and blowing out the candles.  If your taking some sort of still life photos by candlelight, this is a great setting.The \"Sensitive\" setting is suppose to allow you to take photos in low light indoor situations.  It doesn't work when you are holding the camera by hand.The Party setting works but without blur  only if you have the anti-shake on and even then sometimes shots come out blurry depending on where you are relation to the light source.The ease of use is incredible.  I read the manual through once and starting shooting good shots right away.The screen is bright and large.  You can really see whether or not your shots came out blurry.  This was an issue with my last camera.While the camera is compact, it is not compact and portable.  If your intention is to take photos which you intend to share on someone's television or computer other than your own, you will need to take the charger stand with you along with the USB cord for the charger stand. This thing has no way to directly connect via USB.  That means that you can not plug the camera into just anyone's computer and download photos nor can you just jack the camera into any AV IN lines and share photos on the TV screen.  Not only that but the USB cord that goes into the stand is not standard.  When on trips I used to take my Canon to any drugstore and use the digital photo kiosk which has cords that you plug into the USB port of your camera to download photos onto the kiosk for printing.  None of the cords that typically come with these kiosks is going to fit the charger stand of this camera.  You have to manually take the storage chip out in order to do kiosk printing.  This is not that big of a deal but the door to the storage chip insert is kind of flimsy.  I would greatly suggest that on trips you take the charger stand and the USB cord with you (they are pretty small and light).  I honestly believe that if you open and close the storage chip door on this camera repeatedly, it will break.You don't need to install any of the software that comes with the camera if you have XP.  XP recognizes the camera and will download the photos through the photo wizard.  The download speed with this fatter USB cord is very fast, which is nice.The photo imaging software that comes with the camera is totally primative.  Don't even bother installing it.  The Ulead light movie editing software is nice enough to make me consider upgrading to the full Ulead software.  It allows you to edit your movies, add effects and then burn a dvd.I did a lot of research before choosing this camera and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Many features in an Ultra small unit", "Author": "David Carlin", "ReviewID": "RDA9A8B6WKIWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought EX-S500 and although I didn't get such a good deal on the price, I held on to it because it is extreemly versatile.

This is when I whip out my Casio Exilim!  Not only is it great with friends, but with family as well.  It captures the moment so well, you can take a picture of a moving fan and it comes out crystal clear.  With all the different settings, whether your in a bar, on the lake, making a short video, or just goofing around, Casio is the way to go.  I myself love the fact that I can take it in my purse everywhere I travel without it being an inconvenience.  The small size is one of its many features. In addition to its petite size, there aren't many buttons so operating it is no extra hassle.  My friends are always snatching my camera to see how the picture came out.  One thing I would change though, would be the fact that the last picture taken should be displayed on the screen for a longer period of time.  Yet, getting the picture to pop back up is no bother.  Like I was saying, it's easy to operate. At one point, I had a significant project due for school, which included making a video.  I had to interview many different people and instead of carrying around a huge camera, I was able to complete the assignment with my Casio Exilim!  Even the people I interviewed that mumbled were still heard.  It picked up the sound great and came out focused as well. Another great feature is the fact that it takes an SD card to store the pictures.  SD cards are very popular and can be used for many different things.  I am able to take pictures with my camera, slide the card into my cell phone, and store the pictures there.  This comes in handy when I want a great picture to be the screen saver on my cell phone.  With this feature, everyone is able to enjoy the moment. There was a time I ended up breaking the screen and Casio did replace it for free.  For this to happen, I had to be a good talker.  But, it can be done.  Also, the price is very comparable and reasonable.  Since having my camera with me at all times, my friends and I are able to look back on many great memories.  We know they were great because we have the pictures to prove it! When deciding on a camera, choose Casio.  It's small, light weight, great quality, very versatile, and the smart way to go.

It's very thin and looks great in the white color. I get comments from people all the time telling me that they love the look. 2 people have even told me that they are seriously thinking about getting one of their own. I totally recommend it to everyone.I have done a ton of looking around at different available cameras and I found this to be the best in terms of screen size, ease of use and price.It also offers an amazing bonus with a free memory card. It doesn't come with one so you will need to buy it separately. I opted for the price break on the 512mb and have found it to be perfectly fine and haven't filled it up yet. Deciding what amount of memory to get would depend on how much you plan on using it. I'd say I use it about twice a week and on a medium picture quality and it works out great. I wouldn't get the 256mb that might be too little.Downloading pictures is super fast. The process is a bit weird to me but it doesn't have anything to do with the camera. I think it's more with my computer. I can download, transfer, copy to the computer, burn on CD or just view so there's a lot of options for you to decide to do.It takes amazing pictures. I have taken over a hundred pictures and only one has been out of focus. The shots are very clear and crisp. You can focus very close in the play mode and crop the picture right on the camera. The 5 megapixes is a large amount. Really I would never need it, but it's great to have the quality there. The anti-shake is a good option if you or the subject is moving. It basically shows little snap shots instead of a steady stream of the action and you can take a picture.The screen is huge and beautiful, very bright and clear. I was very nervous about scratching or cracking it but it has stood up to my not so careful use. I keep it in my bag with other junk like keys and loose change and it still shines like the first day out of the package. I heard that there's a plastic cover for the screen so I might look into getting that, or there's the little case you can get too.It has amazing battery life. I have gone a couple of days without charging it with some light use and the battery was still almost full. It charges very fast too, it takes only about an hour or so.I love the menu buttons. Other cameras seem not to care about their ease of use and organization. This one was very simple. On top of the back you choose to view your picture or take them or take a video, then down by the screen you get into the menu or your shot options, and then you can navigate around your options or pictures very easily around. There are a ton of features to play around with, from different picture sizes, different shooting options, shooting video, and I haven't got around to using everything yet.The dock is fine. Not cute but light and when you want to download or see the pictures you just push the button on the front. I don't think it charges while you're downloading but it's easy to switch back when you're done.It takes cute little videos. You can adjust the quality and therefore the amount of space it takes up on the memory card. The sound was not great but as long as you're not too far away, I'd say 6ft, you can hear everything fine. I haven't played it back on a TV, which you can do with cables that are included, but it looks like it would be easy and come out fine.Overall I am very happy with my purchase (can't you tell!) and would highly recommend it. Other cameras just didn't have the large screen size, picture quality, or simple controller that I was looking for.

I like the way it can be programmed to remember all (that I could find) of its many settings. This is really important: it means that you can whip out the camera and begin shooting immediately, with your preferred settings. The delay for autofocus/autoexposure is among the best of the tiny cameras. The flash is reasonably strong for such a tiny camera. You can choose how the camera focuses: automatic, manual, macro/automatic, pan, and infinity. There are many clever features, such as the capability to remove the \"keystone effect\" distortion when photographing a business card or other rectangular document. The user interface is excellent, and this is important in a product that offers so many features and options. Another advantage of the Exilim is that Casio sells some pretty good cases for this camera. I chose to buy an especially form-fitting case from Semson; I don't think that Amazon.com carries it. For a camera this small, you really want to carry it with you all of the time. A small but protective case is an advantage. Oddly enough, many competing cameras cannot be matched with one.Now here is the bad news, and there is no getting around it. The picture quality borders on \"bad.\" I compared pictures from the Exilim with my old Canon SD10, which is similar in size. The Canon gave me much sharper images, better colors, and more detail. The fuzziness of the Exilim pictures was quite striking when I photographed some book covers. The letters printed on the books were razor sharp in the Canon images, but not so in the Exilim images. Since the Canon has less resolution than the Exilim, I postprocessed the Exilim pictures to reduce the resolution to that of the Canon (5 Mpixel -> 4 Mpixel). The Canon images still looked sharper. The Exilim produces skin colors that are often quite unattractive. I have been experimenting with postprocessing software; this is promising.The autofocus will fail if pointed at a dark colored object, or a flat object that is at an angle to the camera. In such cases, you can use the pan focus setting though. My experience here is with the autofocus area set to \"spot.\" It can also be set to \"multi,\" but I haven't experimented with this yet.The macro capability of the Exilim is not great. You cannot get very close to your subject, even at the wide angle zoom setting. Switching to manual focus and crossing your fingers might help, I am still experimenting with this.The flash sometimes washes out detail in pictures due to excessive power. This occurs very frequently in close-up shots. This problem can be addressed by reducing the flash intensity, but this is an extra chore for the photographer; it is not automatic.Amazon.com shows that the Canon SD30 will be available October 10. My advice is to wait for that model to appear before committing to the Exilim. In fact, if you want to save some money, the Canon SD20 might be for you. If it is like the SD10, it will be slower than the Exilim, and it will have a weaker flash. It will also lack optical zoom. But you will get solidly better pictures with the Canon.

Excellent battery life. 200+ images per charge.4. VERY small.  I wanted a camera that would easily fit in a fanny pack on vacation.5. Build quality is top notch.6. Video quality is fairly good.  Most cameras in this genre have video capability.  This is an awesome feature that allows you to leave the camcorder at home when you don't want to lug it around.CONS:1. Terrible image quality. I bought this camera to replace a Canon S30 3MP camera.  At 5MP the Casio SHOULD have a much better quality image...NOT.  I was amazed at how marginal the image quality was.  I compared several images taken with each camera and the 3MP images were better in each case. I tried the Casio at all ISO's and all image quality settings and nothing helped.  If this was my first camera and I didn't know any better maybe I'd have been happy with this but it's not and I'm not.2. This camera has a real problem with focusing in all but the brightest light.  I found that only about 3 out of every 10 photos taken indoors under normal interior illumination were in focus.  This was really getting me down.  I did everything I could to help the thing focus.  I kicked up the ISO to try to increase the shutter speed.  I braced the camera on a knee or against a piece of furniture to steady it.  I recomposed each image and payed close attention to the focus point(the camera shows you where it's focusing via two green brackets on the LCD display).  Nothing seemed to help.3. Phony \"Anti Shake\" technology.  Don't be fooled by this marketing claim.  There is NO image stabilization on this camera.  I knew this going in but it still gets me that Casio makes this claim.  Their \"Anti Shake\" technology consists of raising the ISO setting under low light conditions in order to get higher shutter speed settings.  This is supposed to minimize camera shake but due to the exceptionally poor image quality at higher ISO's and the focusing issues mentioned above there is no gain here.I really wanted to like this camera but, when it comes down to it, image quality is the most important issue in buying a camera.  I am a professional photographer so maybe I'm a bit more critical of things like this, however, I'm comparing this camera to my previous point-and-shoot and not my pro gear.  If you want a really attractive camera and don't mind inferior image quality then this camera is for you.  If you want a high quality image I would recommend you look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera!", "Author": "J.

I am not a professional photographer but I do take a lot of pictures especially when I travel around. Xiao Bai takes great pictures most of the time, but I am not quite satisfied with pictures taken at night. When I was trying to take some pictures of a parade at night, the pictures turned out to be dark and blur. Xiao Bai is also slow at start up if flash is on. The anti-shake function doesn't impress me very much either. Because it is too thin, it is not stable if I try to stand it on random surfaces when I use the self-timer function.On the other hand, Xiao Bai does have some good quality. It is pretty-looking and have lots of interesting best-shot modes (potrait, scenery, party, natural green, pet, fireworks, food, twilight etc). It also has a slide show function for the pictures  taken. Another excellent point is its video quality and duration. I can take up to 1 hour high quality video with my 1GB memory card. I once took a video while biking around my campus and it turned out great.

The Exilim is the smallest, the best-looking (though the S1 looks great in black), and by far the easiest to use. This is perfect as a point-and-shoot camera, and will certainly produce better images than the Nikon. I found the Nikon S1's photos to be grainy in low-light. The Powershot models have problems with the LCD cracking, and my friend experienced this first-hand with an SD300. This problem may have been fixed by now though.I do have a couple nitpicks... First, the white version of the camera is not that white. It's certainly not iPod white as depicted in the Amazon photos. Second, the camera does not allow for a lot of manual functions compared to the other models I tried (especially the Canon Powershot).When buying this camera, I would recommend also buying a few other things. First, make sure you get an SD card. I bought the RiDATA 1GB 66X SD card for under $40 on Newegg.com. Second, I would recommend getting a small case for it. I bought a tiny Quantaray case at Ritz Camera in my local mall. And finally, I would recommend finding a clear film to place over the LCD.

When I got it, I quickly found that the software in it was defective. Although I had a 1G memory card in it, the camera deleted the settings (i.e. date, time, flash on/off, etc) every time I turned it off. I called Casio tech support, and they advised that I just return it for a new one, which I did. Amazon was very good about it, and paid to have the defective camera shipped back to them, and sent me a new one immediately via 2nd day air. Probably this technical problem was just a fluke; I realize that with technology, stuff just happens sometimes.When I received the new camera, my initial excitement quickly evaporated as I discovered that the camera was incapable of taking clear photographs. I did everything I could (adjusted light setings, flash on and off, held the camera as still as possible, etc), but unfortunately, none of the pictures I took were as clear as I would have liked for them to be. The worst was trying to take a photograph in a low light/indoor setting with the flash off. I personally dislike using flashes unless I absolutely have to, as they tend to wash out the subject matter. In low light settings without a flash, this camera took pictures that were honestly comparable to cell phone cameras. The dark areas are especially noisy, with lots of purple pixels instead of deep clear blacks.All in all, if smallness is the most important thing to you, then I guess this camera is a good bet.

If you want to read about image quality I suggest a site like [...].I wanted a small camera that could take high quality pictures and this was a good choice.  One thing I would  suggest is to checking the price on the 3MP exilim before buying... if it is still a $50+ difference I suggest considering the 3MP version. The limitation in quality is at the lens, not the digital resolution.  The small aperture means added noise and slower shutter speeds... for most shots, anything above 3 megapixels will be indistinguishable. To put it another way, for most shots you won't be able to print above 5\"x7\", if even that, using this camera.I think the exilim picture quality is equal to or better than peer small cameras, but there are some things that bug me:1. By default pushing the shudder button will turn the camera on and make the lens come out.  This does not save any time (it is just as easy to push the Power button) and as a result the camera can not be stored in a pocket since the button will get pushed and the lens gears will grind and break as the lens tries to pop out (I spent $60 getting this fixed and a friend of mine had to do the same, those his was still under warranty). On the positive side, this can be disabled in the settings.2. The Lithium-ion battery is proprietary... and it is possible to put in backwards (another design flaw). I hope the battery never dies cause they are probably expensive to replace (granted on a small camera like this, AAA batteries may not be practical, but I still think it is worth mentioning as a downside).3. The cradle is annoying. I don't know if this was done to help reduce the camera size or what, but I would much rather have cords then a cradle and cords. It is a piece of light plastic that is a hassle to take with on trips where I will need to recharge.4. The digital display screen protrudes out and gets scratched easily. I have 2 friends who have Exilim's and they both have scratches on the screen as well.  It does not get in the way of taking pictures too much, but is another indicator of sophomoric design.If you are not completely sure you want a small camera then I would not suggest this one.

It is not the quality of a camcorder, but the thing is so small that I use it constantly for video. I can take 30 minutes of video at the highest quality setting on an empty SD card. The video looks fine on my TV, somewhere between a VHS and MiniDV in quality.I don't do much printing, so I can't make any comments on print quality.This camera would get 4 stars if you could connect to the TV without the dock.Get this and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "February 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!", "Author": "Brian Metzger \"Go Blue Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RHBIURJEAFHTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent choice if you want a point and shoot, quick shot camera.

We use Sony camera's now, but she needed to replace hers. I was drawn to the Sony T7. Loved the razor sharp LCD, but the pictures seemed soft. I used a pals to compare. It was about $100 more than the Casio. Not a deal breaker, but a consideration. The Casio had a great feel to it, and we liked the look of it better than the Sony. My wife loves the proportions and balance of the camera. She loves the orange color! The pictures are very sharp, and detailed. I have used only a few of the best shot modes, but there are a lot of choices. The movie feature is only of secondary interest, but most of the ones we have tried have been dark. The LCD is less detailed than the Sony. It is a nice big 2.2 screen. It still looks great. The controls are very easy to use.  I like the external zoom, but this can be more problematic, than internal. The camera has a quick start up and times betweem pictures are faster than my older 5mp Sony. We use a high speed SD card which makes a big difference. The macro pictures showed a real detail differance. There was a strong color push to the Sony models, but the Casio was more accurate, and color correct.It was a close toss up, and required us buying a new memory card, but the pictures are just better than the Sony's. I just tried the T-5, and the T-33, and like the T-7, I loved the LCD, but the pictures were softer. The lack of a manual is a real oversight. The basic operations were rudimentaly explained in the 100 page manual. 20 langauges times 5 pages each! You must use the pdf manual on the disc.

Not only are different picture settings difficult and time consuming to adjust (almost completely through navigating numerous menus on-screen), they don't even help with the outcome.  Low-light settings produce completely blurry or dark pictures, and indoor flash makes most pictures over-exposed.  Image stabilization is a joke, and given the negligible weight of this camera, the pictures really need a good one, unfortunately.  The Best Shot scene selections also do not help produce a clear photo, or one with accurate overall color.  I'm not a camera expert but am skilled enough to play around with the settings and experiment, but still have not found any settings to be helpful, so I am really concluding that this camera is just of poor quality.

I sent the camera back for service and it was taken care of under warranty, but it was a little inconvenient to be without my brand new camera for a while.The second camera worked great for a while, but eventually it tried to turn on in a pocket and I had the lens/gear grinding issue again.  After turning it on and off a few times, the camera seemed to sort itself out.  I bought a small case for it, mainly to keep it from turning on when not in use and damaging the extending lens.  One day I thinking about what a poor design it was and decided to poke around the menus.  I found the option that allows you to 'deactivate' the power on button on the back that accidentally gets pushed and causes everyone problems!  It allows you to designate the tiny, recessed power button on the top as the only way to turn it on.  This button has never been accidentally pressed and I had no issues with the camera after that adjustment.  It would have been nice to come with that as the default setting from the factory.  It sounds like it would have saved many people from breaking their lenses.I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the photos and virtually any dificult lighting situation has been overcome with some minor adjustments on the menu or the simple use of the flash.  This camera's tiny size has made it the perfect party companion and I have countless pictures from bars and clubs that would not have been taken if I had to carry a bulkier camera around.  The convenience and tiny size alone has made this camera worth every penny.  It starts up quickly and is ready to take a picture as soon as you are.  The focus doesn't hunt around and the time between shots is short enough that I don't notice it.Sadly, my girlfriend dropped the camera on the floor in Vegas and I got the lens error message again.  It won't focus now and makes funny clicking noises.  I don't abuse my things, but I didn't treat this camera as carefully as an egg either.  I'm not sure how its durability measures up against other cameras, but I'm disappointed with the durability of the extending lens mechanism.

I love the pictures it takes, and I love the light weight and slim size.I did, however, have one major frustration in the beginning.  The camera comes with 8.5 Mb of memory built in.  In other words, you sneeze and you run out of memory.  So I looked through the manual to find specifications for adding memory.  It said nothing -- nothing about upgrading the internal memory or purchasing an external excessory.  I searched the web, including the product web site, and still found nothing useful.The camera's only visible port was a \"connector\" (as ambiguously described in the manual) that connected to the camera's cradle and nothing else.I thought it was incredible that a 5MP camera would only come with enough memory to take 4 pictures at a time, so I knew there must be some way to add memory.  Finally, my brother found it.  There's an extra sliver of space submerged inside the battery compartment for inserting a memory card.  The trouble is, it's not identified in the manual, or even on the camera itself.  The only hint you have is a row of trademark logos on the manual's cover that includes an \"SD\" logo.  And that's only useful if you notice it AND you happen to know what it means.We still had no idea how much memory we could safely add, so we guessed.
