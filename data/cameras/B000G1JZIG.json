Morrison", "ReviewID": "R2EWGM91XJ0NR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did what I always said I'd do when deciding on a DSLR--buy the cheapest thing out there and never worry about new models trumping the old ones.  It made sense for me to consider Pentax, since I have several K-mount as well as older screw mount lenses, the latter of which can be used on this body with a $15 adapter.  It may come as a jolt to Nikon owners, but Pentax has FAR more reverse compatibility than Nikon.  I can meter a 50 year old screw mount lens on my entry-level body.  Try that with a D50.As for features, I can't attest to the accuracy of the multipoint autofocus or the multizone metering, because I don't trust \"multi\" anything.  For me it's single point AF and spot metering (knowing that my primary camera is an Olympus OM3 may help you understand).  As for the RAW vs jpeg war, let somebody who cares argue that one.  Everything I shoot is jpeg and it looks just fine to me--I never used the zone system, either.  And noise/grain?  If you've shot GAF 500 or 3M/Ferrania 640T slide film, you can talk to me about this issue.  This camera does spectacularly through ISO 800, and even looks impressive at 1600.  I've shot several images at 3200 and they look like TMAX 3200 to me.  Pentax wisely kept the lid on noise reduction, so things may look noisy or grainy, but they do not lack for detail.The fifth star?  For the bargain price?  No, that would be condescending.  I discovered, after the fact, that the camera provides some image-tweaking features, such as conversion to monochrome; or to sepia (it does look just a touch too yellow for me--but still quite acceptable).  But the fifth star goes to the \"soft\" setting, which produces a gorgeous Gaussian blur, which could not look better if I'd custom-designed it myself.  I know--it's jpeg, and I lose a little info when I use these things--that's my business.So there you are--400 bucks for a digital SLR body.  I skipped the \"kit\" lens, because at its longest focal length, 55mm, it's only f/5.6--I rarely stop DOWN that far.  Besides, I already have a pinhole camera.  The body feels tightly constructed, controls are as logical as any digital is likely to be, and it won't break the bank.  And if you're worried about \"only\" 6 Megapixels--please--with such low noise levels it provides anything you'd need short of producing murals.12-31-06:  Some added thoughts.  My guess is many of you have been reading about the Leica M8 digital and how sensitive it is to infrared.  Evidently this creates issues with color shots, but it opens up a whole other world of creative shooting.  I tried my Hoya R72 filter--which transmits NO visible light, only IR--on my K110,and while the optical viewfinder was like a coal mine, once I made a shot and reviewed it on the LCD, sure enough, I had a pretty decent infrared image...BUT...with a pronounced red cast to it.  So I went into the digital filter mode on the camera, converted it to monochrome (B&W;) and had my digital IR.  Shooting infrared film was always a dicey proposition, so don't expect shooting it digitally to be any different.  I found many images benefitted from exposure compensation ranging from +1 to +2.  I should also add that since exposure times are rather long, maybe this is where the stabilizer on the K100 would have been worth the extra $$$.  To a degree you can bump up the ISO; I know this brings on the noise, but if you ever shot Kodak's HIE infrared, you know that coarse grain is one of its characteristics.Bottom line--my experience with my bargain-basement D-SLR has been one of complete satisfaction.  The more I shoot the more I'm coming to believe that anything over 6MP on this size chip is just the horsepower race all over again--useful for bragging rights only.  I hope Pentax can continue to make a go of it, because a market dominated by only one or two players is not healthy in the long run.  Maybe Hoya's \"merger\" will keep them going a bit longer.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very nice value...is stabalizer worth $100?", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2ODRSOQL3D6VI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looking for your first digital SLR?  The K110D is a great beginning.  Solid construction, good image quality, and a very fine lens makes this your leader in the bargain SLR cameras.All your standard features are here, from automatic to complete manual controls for both focus and exposure.  The solid build, and the additional weight of 4 AA batteries makes this one feel a bit tougher than the competition, and has a very comfortable grip in spite of the fact its one of the smaller bodies on the market.The viewfinder is as good as any of it's competitor's, and the larger 2.5\" LCD makes using the menu or reviewing photos simple.The use of AA batteries is welcome by many, but the drawback is that they simply don't last as long as LithiumIon batteries on a charge.  Be sure to pick up some NiMh rechargable AA batteries to keep costs down.The 18-55 is a real winner, best in its class by far.  It has internal focusing, with on demand manual focusing.  Build is above average, and includes a metal lens mount.  The supplied lens hood is very useful.The only real consideration is whether or not to spend the extra $100 and get the K100D, which adds a built into body image stabalizer.  This is a great value for anyone interested in shooting available light photos.  With these two great value cameras, and the recently announced K10D (10 megapixels) and some serious \"glass\" (lenses), Pentax is truly a brand on the rise!", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great value for the money - feels great in my hands!", "Author": "Andrew Behm", "ReviewID": "R1MPN1PV4EWIQY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I put off buying a Digital SLR for 3 years - but couldn't resist this one now that the price is under $[...]. I handled a Pentax *ist DS at a Costco and was impressed with its handling - this one feels even better. I found the Canon Digital Rebel and even the Nikon D50 to be a little awkward - just a little large for me - and I'm over 6'2\" with pretty large hands. I had good experience with an old Pentax 35 mm camera, so feel pretty confident about it's operational ease and quality. But only time will tell that. The 2.5\" LCD panel is wonderful - much easier than the old 1.6\" I've used in my Nikon Coolpix 775 and 5400.

The camera strikes a nice balance between features and usability that both the amateur and professional photographer can appreciate.The big difference between this camera (K110D) and the K100D is that his camera doesn't have shake-reduction.The lens kit is very nice. Also, Pentax made this camera backward-compatible with it's old lenses, so you can take advantage of many of the high-quality lenses available on eBay at a fraction of the cost. This camera is especially good for the beginning/amateur photographer, and Pentax quality at this price is well worth it. In fact, this is the lowest-price digital SLR out there.Note: One thing you might want to know is that with virtually every digital SLR camera, you cannot use the LCD screen as a viewfinder like you can with the point-and-shoot cameras. Many people spend weeks trying to figure-out how to use their LCD screen as a viewfinder and its simply not done on SLR cameras because the internal mirror (that makes it a single lens reflex camera) is covering the image sensor (CCD chip) so the LCD can only show the picture once it has been taken. Also, because of this, you cannot shoot movies/mpegs like you can on point-and-shoot. The real advantages of a digital SLR is both the ability to see through the actual lens and the ability to use different lenses (neither of which you can do on a point-and-shoot). There are other advantages too (like shooting while zooming to create motion effects, etc.).", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "\"Entry Level\" DSLR?", "Author": "Steven V.

Gottfried", "ReviewID": "R1VT859FXWBLWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been a Pentax user since the 1980's and own several of these fine instruments and more important a small arsenal of K mount lenses. Got the K110D as a replacement under warranty from Pentax (broke down after only two months of use and had to wait 6 months for the unrepaired IstDL to be returned to me as repaired - sent it back and demanded the camera to be replaced. By then the IstDL was discontinued and got from Pentax USA a brand new K110D body instead) - Well, it has been a GREAT camera, takes all my K lenses and other accessories - Pentax and third party, without any trouble. Lenses with an A setting perform flawlessly. I do not have stabilization but I do not need it since I shoot mostly with a tripod. I love the results from this body. The only minus I can talk about is the 18-55mm DA kit lens since it is not a match for the older Pentax primes or even some Kiron zooms. The only advantage of this lens is the convenience. You may see a sample photo here [...] -Conclusion, great SLR Body - If you already own some good quality K lenses, this and other Pentax DSLR's are the way to go.

I have used higher dollar cameras before, and this Pentax branded camera can truly hold it's own against them.Most of us haven't heard of Pentax. It's always Canon this and Nikon that, well there are plenty of other SLR makers that can succeed the image quality of Canikon (Canon and Nikon) very easily.As many before have said, the noise control on this SLR is superb. Great detail with some noise, but it's nicely controlled for a good balanace of detail and noise. With a simple noise filter in post processing, the image noise is nearly absent. It's nearly non-existent in higher light shots.The focusing in high light is very quick and accurate. It searches.. and searches, and searches, then finally locks, in low light. The kit lens (18-55mm) is faster than the lens I use (Sigma 28-80 zoom macro) but I like the sigma more as it retains better detail and has a higher zoom- much better for casual photography. I have not tried a lower aperature lens (around f/2.8 to f/1.4) being a poor college student.The lens mount supports every lens made before this camera, and many of the newer lenses. It does not support SDM, but some SDM lenses have a legacy screwmount for this camera and older *istD cameras. You can get many solid, and very nice, lenses that are manual for $50 used, saving quite the bundle.The LCD is bright and clear, and has a nice wide viewing angle.The LCD on the top of the camera is useful, it is absent on the lower end SLRs from Canon, Sony, Nikon and others. It's not necassary, though.This camera is built like a tank. The battery bay and SD card bay seem sort of flimsy, but overall the camera has a very nice, solid feel to it. I thought the buttons for the menu were sort of annoying to press but that is more likely a personal matter.The flash is adequate for what we can expect from a built-in flash, however, an external flash is probably a better for low light.The 6.1mp CCD is a very nice sensor indeed. Dont let the megapixel gimmicks fool you, each pixel sensor in this camera is larger, and therefore collects more light- or more color. Anybody can crop a photo to become much larger even at 6.1mp, so it isn't an issue.With my Sigma lens, I noticed that green really pops out. When I use my telephoto, image quality loses the vivid colors. I haven't really used the kit lens in the feild yet.Customer support was very quick and helpful, they answered all of the inquiries the next business day.I would recommend Pentax to any shooter after my experience with this camera, I am no longer a 'Nikon guy'.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "SDHC Memory Card & Firmware Upgrade", "Author": "BonBon", "ReviewID": "REPUJEI8QCRGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm still learning how to use this camera, but I love it!

But, some of the capabilities are limited with the manual focus lenses, and I'm not fast enough on the focus, so I have ordered an auto focus lens (about $50 for a Tamron 28-80mm).I wanted to write this review because I initially had problems with my 8GB SDHC memory card.  My husband called Pentax and they said to go to the Pentax Imaging website (Support/Self Help) and download the firmware upgrade.

Previously I owned a nice Nikon Coolpix (convenient) and a Nikon standard 35mm SLR (better picture quality).The camera is easy to use.  The settings on it are pretty straight forward.  The instruction manual helps with some fine points and details, but it's not hard to learn.  The batteries last a long time and are bought rather inexpensively over the net.  I've not really used the software that came with it since my computer transfers images already so I can't really comment on that.The quality of the pictures is really very impressive - even when enlarged.  I photographed a friend's wedding recently and my pictures vs the \"real\" photographer's were hard to tell apart (except he usually had a better angle!).Even if this camera were the same price as it's competition I think it would win.

Then, you can go back to the parts that apply to you.There are many scenery and other photo set up selections on the dials that try to emulate using film (for us new to digital).  I found some more workable than others and will probably get to a point where I use only some of the selections more than others, but I did the same with film.In short, it's a good entry in the digital arena.

It should have five stars! This is a great camera!! (Why can't I edit the number of stars Amazon?????)I bought this camera because I have a couple Pentax K series SLR's and was looking for a camera that would use my K series lenses. The quality of this camera is exceptional considering it's price. Don't let the 6.1MP rating fool you. the picture quality I am able to produce relative to the more common point-n-shoot types is far better. Although my daughter has a Kodak rated at the same 6 mp, this camera blows that one away. Yes, her's has the ability to take small movies, but I didn't buy a digital SLR to take silly little movies to put on Youtube. The big advantage is the quality of the sensing unit and the lens system. The auto focus works quite well and the camera is very good at sensing light level and using the flash when needed. If you choose to use it in a low light situation via longer exposure times, the thing shoots excellent non flash pictures without the grainieness I get with non SLR type cameras. Even in the digital world, the lens is real important and only an SLR allows you to use larger aperture lenses. Although the 18-55mm lens that comes with this camera is nowhere near the quality of my original Pentax K series lenses, it is lightyears ahead of any of the non SLR type cameras at this price range. You need to pay quite a bit more to beat this camera's performance with the packaged auto focus 18-55mm lens. With my older K series lenses, the thing really shines since they have less edge aberations then the lens that comes with this camera.
