It lives in a small backpack w/ all my other daily items like wallet, keys, etc.IQ is nothing short of stunning. Out of camera images are better than the 20d. Really! With fairly good light this camera will not disappoint. I use the manual focus feature often, too. ISO 80 - 400 give perfectly acceptable prints. ISO 800 gets a tad noisy, but if it's exposed properly it's usable, especially when converted to B&W.;10mp allows for plenty of cropping!!I've made some really super large prints with A640 files and my Epson 2400 printer.A640 is an incredible value. If your an artistic-type, street shooter or world traveler you will love the myriad features: macro, manual focus, flip screen, etc.Build is really just great considering price point. A640 black trmped A630 silver for me.Finally, I just tested new Canon G7 today. Don't waste your money on that when you can get the A640 (same camera in many ways, better in some ways).", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "The only competition is the Canon A630!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R30ZH3BUNBW3W0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, something that shouldn't matter: it's a darn attractive camera.  Yes, it's plastic, but it really does set itself apart from the 8mp A630 in beauty.  Like that camera, it is too big to be a shirt-pocket camera, and while better than most compact cameras, the 4x zoom can be beat in length.Using the camera, it has a good weight and feel for average sized hands. The use of AA batteries helps keep the cost down, and has it's own advantages, although some may prefer the longer life charges of Lithium-Ion batteries (I do). General, controls are well thought out and easy to use. The zoom is nice and smooth.For those that prefer an optical viewfinder, Canon is probably the strongest supporter, and this is a better than average viewfinder, although it does not have a diopter adjustment. But you'll probably never use it with the tremendous 2.5\" rotary screen. Yes, there are 3\" screens on the market, but this dwarfs anything on a hinge! It is a great aid in composing photos at low, high, or other odd angles (photos you simply didn't take before).Another feature that gets high praise is the flex-focus system. Today's AF cameras do a decent job, but occassionally, they just don't hit on the right focus point. With the flex system, you can determine which point to use. This is simply great for crowded rooms or nature photos where the subject may not be the closest item within the focusing areas.Control for this price point is very good indeed. Multiple \"scene\" modes make it easy for the novice (ok, or sometimes lazy pro), while the semi-auto and manual modes give even experienced users all they need.Like the A630, this camera could have easily been priced $50 to $100 more. The only real competition is the A630, $100 less, 8 meg, and a bit less attractive, more plastic looking silver.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera for everyday users, not perfect", "Author": "P. M. Lewis \"Im-Not-Ted\"", "ReviewID": "R27P8ODB4AL8OD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Canon camera fan for years, my first SLR was a Canon, and so I was excited about 10 MP in a consumer-grade camera from Canon. After one week of average usage, here are the highs and lows. BTW, my frame of reference is my Canon G5.Highs-*- Incredible battery life. The camera comes with four alkaline (no name) batteries. I have taken more than 220 pictures and 30 minutes of video using the original batteries.*- 10 MP captures everything! At first, the pictures looked \"off\" somehow. Then I realized the level of detail in the pictures is just amazing.*- The screen is excellent. It is bright, and big, tilts to every angle, and frames the entire picture, and, and, and.... Very impressive.*- Video capture 640 x 480 @ 30 fps is phenomenal. The video clips are as good as any basic camcorder.*- The camera is light yet feels well built. The lens moves smoothly, the dial clicks into each position, etc. The compartment doors do concern me (see below).*- USB 2.x picture transfer is very fast @ about 2.5 min for 1 Gig of data.*- The camera supports 4GB SD cards, maybe larger.*- A610 and A 620 accessories work with the A640. I purchased a lens adapter and a few 52mm filters to refine my pictures. The lens adapter is not the plastic one from Canon it is a metal generic from Sakar. Everything works well and fits correctly.Lows-** This unit only, I hope, records a high pitch squeal in video mode. My replacement camera is on the way. The sound does not affect the quality of the images in the video clips.[Updated for replacement camera- There is a less noticeable noise in the background audio of movie clips taken with the new camera. The sound does not drown out the movie clip audio like it did with the first camera, but it is still there. I now suspect this has something to do with the camera's \"mono\" microphone.]** The camera stops recording video at 1 Gig. In 640 x 480 @ 30 fps mode, this is just over 9 minutes. So, there is a video limit though I could not find this data before I purchased the camera. I did read about a \"One hour\" limit somewhere but that would have to be in 320 x 240 @ 15 fps or \"Compact\" video mode to stay below the 1 gig limit. Also worth noting, 640 x 480 @ 15 fps video mode looks great and can record almost 20 minutes before reaching the 1 Gig limit.** When the camera stops video recording at 1 gig, you cannot transfer the file from the camera via the USB connection. Removing the SD card and putting it in a SD reader is the only way to get the video onto your PC. For the technically frumpy, my PC is running Win XP 2 (SP 2) so this is not a file size issue for the PC.** The battery and USB compartment doors feel like they might break at some point. Opening the battery door requires a dual action slide lock then slide door that is not intuitive.** The picture control functions and the camera operating menus require reading, or lots of experimentation. I had a good frame of reference since my last camera was a Canon, but I remember the learning curve and it applies to the A640 too.Overall-I am quite happy with this camera. For around 300 dollars, it would be hard to find a more versatile unit. Moreover, it has a Canon lens. Not to be obvious, but good pictures require good lenses, no matter the megapixels or other marketing goop. There are other good lenses, but when you buy a Canon, you do not have to ask who made the lens.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent photo quality", "Author": "R.

The A80 was a similar shape, size, and feature set but with only 4.0 megapixals, 3x lens, and a much smaller swivel viewing screen. Good Canon software has gotten better.What's better with the A640:It has similar features and body but a bigger screen and it is lighter.The screen is much bigger.The screen brightens nicely in dim and dark conditions.The flash works better and the flash assist lamp works MUCH better. (A relief from the worthless A80 lamp).It is a bit faster with less shutter lag.It has more manual settings, many of which can be very useful.It has a 4x lens (A80 had 3x)Disappointments:The screen is very grainy compared to the A80's sharp screen. So grainy that you have to trust the pictures are sharp and rich (which they usually are) because they look very grainy and muted on the screen.Would like even less shutter lag.Some of the huge number of settings are not intuitive or easy to find and use (though many are).They wasted a button (valuable real estate) as a dedicated \"print to printer\" button.Overall:Love the camera, am getting used to the grainy but bright screen, will use if for a few years and look forward to what Canon has done by then.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Luis Felipe Vidal Pena \"Luis F.

By now I have almost a month with it at it works flawessly, great picture quality and ease to use.Here are my pros & contras:PROS:- A lot of manual controls. You can even control the flash for less or more power and when to fire it, 1st or 2nd curtain.- AA battery powered. I'll never buy a camera that doesn't use this kind of batteries (unless it is a DSLR). I can get AA anywhere if my rechargeables go dead or if I forget them in the charger, as it happened to me a couple of weeks ago. Be powered by 4 AA lets you shoot a lot more than other cameras even with regular alkalines.- Excellent macro, 1cm (I think even less) excellent focus, clear images, great details.- The vari-angle screen its a great thing. You can get easy ground level shoots or over the head, or shoot yourself for the perfect self-portrait. And i love to close the screen when not in use.- Fast and accurate auto-focus.- Excellent white balance features.- The red eyes reduction works really great.- Remote control with your computer. You can control all the features with your computer with your camera in a tripod. Cool for a photo session.- Great body, it feels great in your hand. Heavy enough to keep it in control. Doesn't feel cheap at all.CONS:- The plastic tripod socket, i hate it. Are you kidding me Canon? Respect yourself! I feel this thing its going to brake or wear. Bad thing.- Memory and battery in the same compartment. Not practical at all. And you have to unmount from the tripod if you want to put a new memory card.- No cable or wireless control for remote shooting. I know that the cameras in this range doesn't have that option but I wish someday they have it 'cause it's an important accessory. You can deal with your self-timer if you need something similar.I DON'T CARE FOR:- IS (Image Stabilization). This camera doesn't have IS, maybe in the future it will but I really don't care about it.- No Wi-Fi connection.

The only reason I didn't give this camera 5 stars is it's less-than-stellar performance in low-light situations, and when the ISO was set 800. I knew about these problems before hand though so I can't complain too much. I love the pivoting lcd screen, it lets me shoot from all different angles, and also do self-portraits. If I could've found this exact camera with image-stablization, I would've paid extra, but in the end I had to make a trade-off, megapixels, and pivoting screen were more important to me.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best camera I ever owned", "Author": "Charles T.

Lum \"bargain hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R3OKIZPOZABT5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing little camera.  For the price, it's packed full of stuff!  Unbelievable.  10mp is huge.  The images come out sharp and clear.  Love looking at hair shafts, pimples, pores, eye lashes.  Make sure your subjects clean their nose and teeth because this camera will reveal EVERYTHING.  Lots of room to crop.  Very fast focusing.It takes tons of pictures on a set of nickel metal hydride batteries.  300-400 shots.  That's amazing.  That's more than any other camera on the market.  The camera has a real solid grip system.  Dropping your camera is a horrible thing to do.  With this camera's grip, you would be able to access every feature with just one hand.  And that swivel screen... amazing!  You can stand in a crowd, raise the camera above everybody, focus, using the swivel screen, and take your shot.  You wouldn't be able to do that without the swivel screen.  You can take perfectly framed pictures of yourself.  You can jump in and actually tell if you are in the picture frame when you set the camera up for auto shutter release.As with all point and shoot cameras, I would recommend getting a external flash for anything beyond 12' in low light.  The Phoenix D91-BZS 4-Stop Digital Slave is very good, powerful and inexpensive, but big.  Canon makes the Canon HF-DC1 High Power Flash for about $100.  It's tiny and can easily fit in your pocket.Wish they had a provision for installing a lens filter.  Almost no manufacturer makes this feature.  All cameras should have a lens filter to protect the camera's lens.  Avoid cleaning the camera's lens to prevent lens scratches.  Guess they rather have you replace the camera rather than a cheap filter.Point and shoot digital cameras have come a long way and this camera leads the way!

I was either going to buy this camera, or the A710 IS.  I tested both of them at a camera store, then decided to buy the A640 based on battery life, features, and flash.I have taken a digital photography class and am pretty artsy, so I wanted something that would last, would take amazing pictures, and I would be able to carry it around with me.  Both the cameras would have done the job, but when you take a picture with a flash (and sometimes even without a flash), it takes the A710 a decent amount of time before you can take another picture (usually between 5-10 seconds).  Because the A640 has 4 batteries, you can take one picture after the other without ever having to wait for the camera to be ready.Also, I have taken several thousand pictures in 6 months and have only had to change the batteries once- and they were just regular energizer batteries, nothing special.The one downfall I have with the camera is the weight.  Because of the four batteries, it does weigh a little bit more (obviously), and if you want a pocket camera, this is not the one.  However, I have no problem fitting it in my purse.I was also nervous that it had a flip screen.  However, it surprised me how much I use it!  (It makes those shots where you hold out the camera in front of you a whole lot better and easier)  And, I have never had any problems, and it seems very sturdy.  I do not even notice that it is a flip screen until I use it- in other words, it does not get in the way or cause problems.  It is also nice to flip the screen around to protect it if I will not be using the camera for a while.10 mega pixels seems excessive- the average person does not ever need this many probably.  I have found the \"program\" function useful, in which everything is set to auto, and my file size is set to Medium (about 7 MP) instead of the full 10 MP (Large).  It serves as my Auto when I am just taking everyday shots.  But, I love that 10 MP is very crop-able, meaning that if I am zoomed in all the way optically, I can still crop in even further to get a good picture of that far away object.  (However, if you have only a small amount of space on your computer, 10 MP pictures will fill that space fast.  I can easily take a couple of gigs worth of pictures on a vacation using the 10MP file size.  I also have a 2GB SD memory card for the camera and have never filled it, but a 1 GB wouldn't be quite enough space for me.)All in all, a good choice for me!

I have not had any luck with the landscapefunction, as the pictures are quite blurry, but I may just need to readup more on what I might be doing wrong. Otherwise, it is very easy to useright out of the box. The fact that it takes regular AA batteries is aplus, as they are easily replaceable wherever I might be. I have takenover 600 pictures and have not had to change the batteries yet. Amazonhad the best price online at the time, and the camera came with an extra512MB SD card for free.

I am not an experienced photographer, but I like to take snapshots and sometimes edit and enlarge them.  This is my third digital camera in the past 10 years.  The first, at 1.2 MP, served me well for a long time.  The second was 5 MP, but it didn't have a viewfinder.  I quickly learned that I am incapable of taking blur-free snapshots without supporting the camera against my face - which I cannot do without a viewfinder.  Neither of these cameras could produce good close-ups.I decided to upgrade to 10 MP even though everywhere I looked recommended lower quality.  These recommendations were based on the fact that people like me do not need pictures that can be enlarged to sizes greater than 8x10 and 10 MP is not necessary for good 8x10 prints.  I decided to ignore the advice because I have learned that technological advancements come so rapidly that today's overkill is tomorrow's inadequate.For the last few weeks, I have been taking my camera everywhere.  I have been playing around with the settings and features, including video recording.  My video of my nephew being an awesome child Christmas Eve at church is better than the one his father took with his not-so-new camcorder, and the sound is great too.  I took a lot of fabulous pictures of my pets, two of which I posted in the gallery for this camera.  I used the software that came with the camera to crop these photos, but did not otherwise edit them.  Notice the detail of my yellow cat's whiskers and the sunlight on his fur.  At first I thought my pictures were fuzzy, but when I made them larger I found that it was because of the incredible detail.  These are the kind of photos I have always wanted to be able to produce.  My people photos do sometimes have red-eye, but I don't mind editing it out.  That's part of the beauty of a digital camera.As for battery life, I've taken hundreds of pictures and lots of videos and I'm still using the batteries that shipped with the camera.  I haven't done much with the flip screen, but it's very nice to be able to flip it around to protect the screen when the camera is not in use.  I haven't done much zooming yet either.

I use the A640 for eBay listings, and the macro shots have made all the difference in sales.  The 10 megapixel resolution allows for close cropping, which brings those superb macro pictures even closer.It's hard--but still very possible--to get good, sharp existing light images indoors, but only because I stubbornly keep the ISO set at 200 or lower.  Although I don't use it much, the flash is excellent--you can adjust it up or down in any mode except Auto, Scene and of course Movie.The swivel LCD (the reason I chose the A640 over the G7) has spoiled me.  I'm very short--only 5' tall--and with this feature, I can compose shots of subjects that are completely out of my field of vision.  Just today I stretched up on tiptoe, held the camera over a birds nest in a tall shrub, swiveled the screen and composed a beautiful macro shot of the eggs.  Without the screen, I wouldn't have even known whether the nest was in use, much less whether the eggs were centered or in focus!  The swivel screen is also great for taking pictures of subjects at or near ground level, shots that would completely elude me without this feature.FlexiZone is awesome, and I keep my camera on that setting almost exclusively.  It offers great control over exactly where in the frame the camera focuses.  Enabling grid lines is not only helpful for the rule of thirds but also for making sure horizontal and/or vertical lines in the composition are nice and straight.I've only run on a couple of situations, both times under fluorescent lighting, where I couldn't achieve accurate white balance.  I found that using the flash corrected the problem.Power-up time is speedy, and the camera focuses pretty nimbly.  I have noticed some focus lag time when shooting high contrast images, but not as much as with the little Nikon Coolpix P3 I used before I bought this camera.If there were any one change I could make to the camera, it would be the inclusion of image stabilization.  I've encountered some frustrating situations without it.  This is a very affordably priced camera, though, chock-full of features and controls, and for that reason I am not deducting a star.  I knew it didn't offer image stabilization when I bought it!There are too many features to cover in this review, but I've touched on most of the things I'm finding make me dread the day when this camera \"wears out\" or breaks down.

The best feature is the rotating LCD screen witch allows you to shoot in many interesting and different angles will still having access to the LCD screen to view your framing. It has made all my friends envious cause their cameras have fixed LCDs.However it is not without some major problems The flash can be very bright and you have to adjust it to the environment. The shutter lag is very slow sometimes 2 sec. so don't always expect to catch the moment...this can be very frustating at times...if you need something fast just get an SLR. Also the Autofocus can be slow in lowlight areas and take a few sec. to adjust and thus you can't take your pic and miss a great moment, just as equally frustrating.Perhaps My biggest gripe with the camera is that for a compact it's still a bit bulky it doesn't fit in a pants pocket so if you need something you can slip in your jeans this is not it.Otherwise is a solid camera that will produce expectional pics in the hands of good photographers just snap and enjoy.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Glad I waited for this camera", "Author": "Jim C. \"Jim C.\"", "ReviewID": "R1HF2S7CVTTRML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to use a 35mm Canon camera and a very early model Canon digital (1 MP). Taking photos was never much fun with those cameras, it always seemed like more of a chore, so I just didn't see the need to go out and grab a new camera - until this one came out. At 10 MP and with all of the amazing features it has I decided that when it went below $300 it would be a real bargain. Well at current prices it is a steal! The pictures I take are amazing, and I usually use \"auto\" mode. I have two small kids and it is so easy to grab this camera and just start shooting. I always get great shots. What really amazes me is the quality of the shots I get indoors, at night, with minimal lighting - and no flash! As a matter of fact, I usually turn off the flash unless I really need some extra light. One of the greatest things about this camera (and the single biggest reason I didn't buy many others that I tried-out) is that it focusses continually while you are moving around, then when you press the shutter button it does a quick fine focus and takes the shot very quickly with no noticable shutter lag. I have absolutely not missed a single shot in the several months that I have owned this now. So many of the other cameras that I tried had such noticable shutter lag that you could literally press the shutter button and wait a few seconds for the shutter to click.

The images are huge at 10 megapixels and there's little need for much zoom as you can crop the images way down with little quality loss.

Not to be too negative, overall I'm pleased with the picture quality of the camera, but here are a few things I found to be both good, and not so good, about the A640.  Good-to-great is the high quality outdoor pictures it takes.  But the not so good is its built-in flash capability.  I've found the A640 flash to be hit or miss (on indoor shots) and very unreliable.  I recently took pictures during my daughter's (indoor) graduation ceremony and was highly disappointed with the results.  Most of the shots over 20 feet were dark and unusable.  I've since stopped using Auto mode indoors entirely and discovered I get better, (but still not consistent) results in the Program-mode.  In Auto-mode I've taken numerous shots inside 10 feet that have come out horribly overexposed and unsalvageable even with good photo editing software.  As an old SLR photographer (Nikon F4 w/speed flash) I became spoiled with fill-flash photography and used it even on the sunniest of days to remove shadows.  I've yet to figure out how to manually manipulate the flash outdoors to allow fill-flash.  I realize the A640 is a relatively inexpensive point and shoot camera and not a pro-SLR, but given the other hi-tech features Cannon built into this little box, it seems only natural that someone at product development would have thought to add a fill-flash feature as well. The lack of shot stabilization is also a negative feature that you may want to consider, especially in low-light conditions.  I'll finish with a positive. I've really enjoyed the movie-mode capability and find myself using this camera instead of my DVD mini-cam.For the money, this is pretty good camera but I can't wait to compare it to the new Nikon 10MP that's coming out soon.

I originally bought (and returned) a 6MP Canon A540 but it made noisy movies (i.e. you could hear the aperture and/or focusing mechanisms making clicking sounds when playing back the movies on a computer.)Unfortunately, my A640 suffers from a different problem with the movie mode: the movies have a high-pitched whine during playback on a computer. Also the sound is muffled. In contrast, my older A40 has a wonderful microphone that records very clear sound (but the movies are low-resolution, and can only be about 15 seconds.) On the A640, the movies can be up to 1GB in length, which is around 7 or 8 minutes for 640x480 at 30 frames/sec. That's plenty of time to make little snippets that can be assembled later into a longer video.Overall, I like the A640 well enough to keep it in spite of the sound issues. The design is good, the flip-out screen is handy, and the pictures are detailed. However, because it has such a large number of pixels, it is easy to get slightly blurred images (though not all that noticeable) due to the lack of an image stabilizer.

I like the vari-angle LCD for stealth shots, however the very loud zoom motor makes you awfully conspicuous.  I'm not exaggerating either.In my opinion, the LCD is too low resolution also.  It makes it hard to tell what's in focus and what's out of focus.  2.5\" is a good size, but the resolution should really be twice what it is.  Also, the optical viewfinder is not located exactly where the picture will be taken, it's off to the side.  So when taking pictures close up make sure you don't look into the optical viewfinder.  This effect is mitigated the farther away the subject is.Just as long as you take these into account before buying, you'll be very happy with this.  I like the higher ISO performance, it's very clean when compared to other compact cameras.  The flash is powerful also.  Its looks and feel are nice of course also, however, it lacks a rubberized feel to the handle.  As it is it doesn't quite feel secure in my hands.So, to wrap up I think for the price this camera is as good as it gets.

The A640 was our first new camera purchase in quite some time, so we had expected a product advanced well beyond what we had.In many respects, our expectations were met. The A640 takes excellent pictures at distance and in less lighting than the Mavica required. At distance, the high resolution photos are quite crisp and well detailed. The light weight of the camera is also convenient.However, there are some areas in which Canon seems to have stumbled.For fans of taking close-ups, the major problem area is the focus mechanism. At very close distances, the A640 will frequently focus in crisply -- then zip back out to a completely unusable setting. The \"manual\" focus is no help, as it is a digital mecahnism that will not take the lens out to the point where the item of interest comes into focus. The only solution is to move the item further away and use the zoom mechanism to compensate. As the digital zoom jumps in very discrete steps once you go beyond the 4x lens capability, this can be quite challenging.Again, with close-ups, the focus area selected by the camera in auto mode is frequently baffling. Quite often I feel as if I am struggling against some odd sort of random number generator, as the camera selects spot after spot around the periphery of my item of interest without locking on to the center of the item itself. This can occur even when using the macro mode.Dealing with the volatile nature of camera settings is often painful as well. Unless one wishes to use the Custom mode, one's settings will only last so long as the camera does not go back from picture taking mode to play mode. If you take too long setting up a shot, the power save will take the camera out of its picture-ready state -- wiping out your flash and macro settings in the process. By contrast, the Mavica always remembered the last settings used as long as it had a good battery in it -- and even slightly beyond, as I could swap batteries on that and still retain our camera settings.Photo deletion also seems to be surprisingly primitive for the state of the art. On the A640, if you are using the camera only (i.e., not tied directly to a computer), the options are limited to deleting photos one at a time and confirm each one or to delete all photos at once. Again, the Mavica had an overview mode by which one could select photos for deletion and then remove the selected photos with a single confirmation. This is a surprising deficiency for a camera that has so much more image storage potential than the Mavica, though one may overcome it to a large extent by using a much higher capacity flash card than the 32Mb baseline one provided.Two other areas of concern are the computer interface door and the battery chamber door. The door protecting the computer interface slots feels like a soft plastic; flimsy and delicate and seemingly unlikely to remain for long on the camera. The battery chamber door is not much better, as the batteries have to be jiggled and gently worked into place before the battery door will close -- again in contrast to the Mavica's battery door, which was firm enough and secure enough to push the battery down into its proper place.Despite its shortcomings, the A640 remains an overall improvement over our original Mavica. But it is surprisingly cumbersome to use for close-up photography. It leaves one feeling that, aside from pixel resolution and its ability to focus at distance, the A640 has taken a few steps backwards from older cameras.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "A good camera for its price", "Author": "L.

There are a lot of auto settings for several background situations, but I recommend the manual mode to get the most out of this camera.The LCD is big at 2.5 inches, and the ability for it to swivel makes it easy to get the angle you want (Combine that ability with a Gorillapod to get some interesting perspectives).Another advantage the Canon A640 has is that it doesn't use proprietary batteries.  So if I ever run out of juice in a vacation spot that doesn't have any electrical outlets for charging nearby, I could just pop in 4 AA size batteries and keep on clicking.  How long does a set of batteries last me?  With one set of LiMH batteries at 2200 mAh, I took around 250 large, \"superfine\" pictures with the LCD on before having to change batteries.The A640 can also take video in AVI format, and it's actually very good. It's not going take the place of any high end camcorder, but it's perfect for recording little video shorts like drag races or air show performances.  I would recommend getting a separate memory card for video though as their files could take a lot of space especially at the highest resolution (640x480).For those who like customization, the A640 will not disappoint. One can change all the beeps and boops to any of the numerous sound samples included in the software. In addition, one can use the recording capability of the A640 to record ANY sound they want and program it to whatever sound prompt they choose.  So now you too can have a camera that says, \"Smile! Ya bastards!\" at the end of the auto-timer countdown.I only see a few disadvantages with the A640, and one of them is the absence of image stabilization.  While not a vital feature, those who make a switch from another camera might sorely miss it.  This ties in with another gripe from a friend who stated that it was way too big for her (she owns an Elph).  The battery compartment contributes a lot to the A640's ungainly size, but I actually like the size since it helps me keep a steady hand when taking a picture, so who needs image stabilization?  I would have liked to see a better optical zoom rating.  4.0x is nice, but I guess you can never have enough zoom.All in all the A640 is an excellent point and shoot camera for beginners and has enough options to keep a seasoned digital photographer happy.

I have not used any manual functions for the simple reason that every photograph I take is important and really didn't want to risk messing it up by having the wrong setting.  I have used a lot of the preset functions and they all work wonderfully.  I compared my pictures side by side with a Nikon digital SLR and you could not tell the difference in the photos.  Maybe blown up to a 3 ft. picture you could?  The features are easy to use and for the most part I was able to just navigate through the menus on the camera to figure out what I wanted.  I enjoy the flip screen and mainly because my old camera did not have one.  I can now take snapshots with my children that include me in the picture!  I must make comment on the battery life since that seems to be a big gripe on some cameras.  This uses 4AA batteries.  I have taken HUNDREDS of pictures and had the LCD screen on navigating the menus and I still have not replaced the batteries.  It's excellant and way beyond my expectations!  This a great point and shoot camera that you can't go wrong with.  The price is great too.  When I purchased it you got a Canon all-in-one photo printer ($165)with a $150 rebate, a free memory card, and the great low price of just over $300 for the camera!

While the A640 is fairly decent, it has some annoyances and flaws:1) Very, VERY noticeable vignetting.  E.g. pictures of the sky have awful dim black triangles in the corners.2) Too much barrel distortion.  The slightly wide angle of the lens can come in handy for squeezing in near subjects... but take a picture of the horizon, and it's curved like a rainbow.  Also, people will look about 20 pounds heavier thanks to this.  Additionally, if you stitch photos together, the curvature in each segment is too much for good results.3) Changing scene modes does an intensely annoying animation on the LCD screen, so that it slows you down if you need to take a picture in a hurry.  Each notch on the dial makes you wait 1+ seconds before you can take a picture, or even see which mode you're in.  Whoever decided to put this feature in a point-and-shoot camera needs to be fired, and then soundly boxed about the ears.  Then fired from his next job.4) The added megapixels are nice, but overall this camera produces much noisier photos than the old A80.  This camera has one of the larger sensors in this price range, but evidently it's not good enough for 10MP.5) The plastic doors/flaps on this camera are much flimsier than on the A80.  Ditto the folding LCD screen.6) The refresh rate on the LCD screen is slower than on the A80 -- distractingly so.  I.e. the LCD image lags way behind what it's pointed at.  This just adds to the A640's overall SLOW feeling.7) Only one Custom mode, compared to the A80's very handy two Custom modes.There are other flaws also, but they are more minor.  Some positive things:  I like the wide-screen mode; although it doesn't add horizontal resolution, it helps frame some types of shots, such as landscapes.Yes, you will be able to take some nice pictures with this camera (as with most digicams these days).  But I wanted to point out the very big cons to the A640, especially if you are thinking of upgrading from an A80 or comparable model.

Here ya go!First off, let me say that I LOVE taking photos but I am not educated on all features digital cameras have to offer.  This review is by someone who learns by trying hands on experience, not by reading a manual.  If you are looking for a stunning camera just for taking pictures of family and for taking landscape photos when traveling, it's perfect.  It also does great when needing inexpensive family photos without paying for a professional photographer.  It's also perfect if you're looking for a camera that can take beautiful pictures like a larger SLR camera but you need to keep it in your purse or a small camera bag.OUT OF BOX: Right when you get the camera, you feel proud to have it already.  It's a stunning camera, the screen is clear and bright and pretty near to perfect.  The LCD screen flips around smoothly with no hang ups and clicks into place.  If you need to take a picture of you and your friend(s), no problem.  You can easily flip the screen around so you can see yourselves and also set a time so you can position yourselves for the picture.  The flip screen has helped me a lot when I needed a shot at a bug on the ground and the sun is glaring at the screen or I needed a shot over a large rock.  I can see what I want to snap just by flipping the screen without having to be eye level with the camera.OPTIONS: It's fast when switching options with the dial and also switching from menu to live camera mode.  There are several options.  Along with everything on the dial, you get underwater, florescent, sepia, black and white, cloudy, day, night, and the list goes on.  Changing the ISO is also quite easy.  If you aren't knowledgeable about camera options, you'll soon find that when changing the flash strength, you can get better pictures depending on the lighting of the room or outdoors.  It's fun to play with.PHOTO QUALITY: Because the camera is a 10 megapixel camera, you will end up with stunning photos.  You will have the options of Postcard, stitched photos (gives the ability for panoramic photos), and 3-4 more options for high quality photos.  Even see the stitching on everyone's clothing when zooming in.  Up close photos are quite beautiful as well.  If you are a gardener and proud of your flowers, this camera is perfect.  Your flowers will look so vibrant.  Night photos are stunning as well.  Just be sure to get a tripod or everything will smear like with any camera with a night scene mode.VIDEO: The camera also has the ability to film your child playing sports.  The only issue is that when zooming in, it looses quality.  In order to keep the quality good, zoom in to the action before you record.  You will still have the ability to zoom out and zoom in even further than before.  It's not a camcorder but does take perfect videos.  Beware though that because it's not a camcorder, the files end up larger than normal and you will soon find that the videos take up a lot of room on your SanDisk drive.  I have a 2 gig drive and videos take up room quite fast.  I only record up to a minute to three and use the rest of the room for photos.  It holds a large amount of photos of any quality you set. It has the option of regular sized videos or email sized videos.  When recording in email mode, the video is quite smaller and you still have the ability to record as long as you want.  The only problem is that some email servers don't allow large files.  You will end up zipping the file or compressing it with some program or saving it to a thumb drive and giving that to someone instead.  This is not a problem with the camera, this is with any camcorder or camera.  I burned the videos recorded by this camera onto a DVD for a video of my son to play on our old 37\" tv.  The quality is perfect.  It's smooth and the sound is nice.  It recorded as if it was a camcorder.  While some of the videos were in email mode, the video was good, just pixelated.  The sound, however was not lagging. It matched up with the action just perfectly.  When zooming in and out, just make sure you get to the zoom position you want before you start filming.  If you zoom in first, the video will be fine but if you zoom out, hit record then zoom in, it starts filming like it's in digital zoom.  You might also hear the ticking and clicking you make with the knob once you play it back.PC CONNECTION:  Simply put, easy.  It has a USB connection and you can either use the Canon program which can be downloaded online to stitch photos and transfer files onto the computer or just use the computer to search through the camera and transfer the files.  I have had no issues as all with this.Recently I dropped the camera and the LCD screen started flickering and had lines through the screen but I can still see everything perfectly.  It hit the hard floor pretty hard and still works.  It is now sucking the life out of my rechargeable batteries.  I just need to see if it's because my batteries are over a year old or the camera is using it all because of the screen.I will update when I find out...TRAVELING:  The camera is somewhat bulky but makes up for it when you see the stunning photos. I travel around with it in my purse and have it in a camera case.  It gets hung on the case and uses a lot of room in my purse.  It would help more if you get a case with enough room to open it and pull it out.  Try several cases out before you buy one online.  If you are a woman, make sure your purse is big enough to carry your personal items along with the camera in a case.  My purse is not a large one but can carry the camera in its case.  It makes the purse bulge out and becomes quite annoying to me.  It's not a camera that you can slip into your pocket unless you have cargo pants with large pockets.All in all, this camera is worth the price and it's quite a good price for what you get.  If you are looking for GREAT photos with a large amount of megapixels, get this camera.  You won't regret it.  I've done my research and can't find any other camera with a large amount of MP with a low price.  Everyone is also stunned to see you can flip the screen around.  It's a conversation starter.========UPDATE========I recently sold this camera and it actually sold for $100 even with it's LCD screen showing lines.  It must be a better camera than I thought if it sold with the flaws.

RAW isn't necessary if you just want to snap some pictures to share with friends online, but if you want to do professional-level color and exposure correction in photoshop, RAW will allow give you much higher quality in the end result.so basically, this camera is great for amateur-level photography and decent for semi-profession stuff too, but don't get ripped off by this retailer.", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good, reliable  camera", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R2W9UCKQKLGJLT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Canon A640 for about a year and a half and taken over 2000 pictures and more gigs of VGA movies than I care to try to remember. Long story short, it's a terrific camera for fast and discrete urban(very!) street photography, and with always ready to go alkaline batteries it's fast enough for those family photos that pop up without warning and won't happen again. I carry it around in my cargo pants pockets in the summer and my jacket pocket in the winter even though it's a tad on the heavy side and not exactly mini in size.Carrying it around in pockets with my keys, change, and exposed to all the dust and grit should have totaled it long ago, but it just keeps on working.PROS - Takes nice pictures in reasonable light that any amateur photographer like me will enjoy. Color accuracy and vividness is more than good enough for amateur photography and quick snapshots of kids and pets that won't sit still for more than a few seconds before they're gone.The flip screen has ruined me. When I bought the A640 I thought the flip out screen was a gimmick. Now, I'd have to carefully consider whether I'd buy another camera without it. Really works good for discrete urban photography.Speed. The A640 starts up fast enough to capture those family moments that pop up without warning and only last for a few seconds.CONS - The LCD screen is low resolution and needs more brightness for accurate color presentation.The automatic lens covers sometimes jam up and won't open or close fully. The slot they slide in is too small so I have to use one of those dull, round pointed kitchen knives to carefully spread the slot in order to free the lens covers. Ah yes....that's consumer grade photography equipment for you. I've come to the point where I'd actually prefer a manual lens cap over automatic lens covers.SUMMARY - A well built camera that also feels well built when I hold and operate it (except for the automatic lens covers). Fast and takes nice pictures. Hard working and tough for every day use.

Powell", "ReviewID": "R3MA476OAFB5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say, I think this camera is wonderful, and offers everything I really need, for taking every day and travel pictures.The story of this Camera for me, and how I arrived at purchasing it follows:About 8 years ago I purchased an Olympus 1.3 megapixel, that I really enjoyed and got a few years of great use.  It had a flip up flash, that was sufficient for good pictures in dark lighting.  It worked off a smart media card, which never presented a problem.When I need a larger dimension format in photo size, I decided to look for a reasonably priced secondary camera that I could use.I figured most of the Olympus line was good, since I had read that they usually focus on the quality of their lenses.  Being tight with the budget, I ended up getting an Olympus Fe-110, figuring the 5MP would be better than the 1.3 megapixel.I was so wrong, and I was disappointed in several things with The Olympus Fe-110 camera.  I will write a separate review on the Olympus camera, but the core of it, was the photos were not as good, and it was impossible to get good night photos with it's very small flash. (also the XD proprietary media card is just a compatibility inconvenience)I always ended up going back to my Olympus 1.3MP camera, over the 5MP.When I dropped my original 1.3MP camera, and broke it, I was very sad to see it go.  I needed a reliable every day, every vacation camera, and it as not going to be the Olympus Fe-110.(I know this isn't a review of these Olympus camera's, I simply  wanted to provide some background on how I arrived at my selection of the Canon A640.I did a little better research this time, and found this Canon A640 received very high marks and, as I've come to find out, rightfully so.  From day one this camera has given me very high quality photos and video with sound.  Actually the video is probably better than my handheld Panasonic video camera, which I'm amazed at.  Good night photos with the flash, long battery life, and accepts standard SD media cards.  It's been great.I'm just now experimenting with some of the various settings, but for standard, everyday or vacation photos, this camera is GREAT.  It also seems to have some expandability options (larger zoon lens) that I like.  It is very convenient to hold and shoot with this camera. (I like that).  I will let the special camera features, be reviewed by other folk who experiment with that type of stuff.  For my needs, this camera is great, and also seems reasonably durable. (I dropped it once, with no problems)  (got lucky)In summary of price ranges for my digital camera:$250  - Olympus - with flip flash =  Approx $250  (great camera)$125  Olympus - Fe110 = Approx $125 (terrible camera)$300  Canon A640  (wonderful camera for both photos & short video w/ sound).I'm usually pretty \"brand loyal when it comes to purchases, since I don't like to upgrade or change very often, but this Canon sold me over Olympus.

The level of detail in the photos is fantastic.  I've posted pictures online from our trips and adventures and people are surprised to find out that it is a point and shoot and not a dslr. The videos come out great too and the sound is fantastic.  Other cameras out there have terrible sound with the video, but that's not the case with the Canon 640.I also love that this camera is versatile.  You can add a lens for various shots like telephoto or wide angle with the adapter.  Most cameras being sold now, Canon included, do not offer that feature.I have taken underwater video with the camera (and the underwater casing) - a pool party, lazy river ride, or water slides and they come out great.  Many people have come up to me on vacations asking me about the camera and cost explaining that they couldn't do the things I was able to do with this Canon. The dimensions on the pictures I take are 3648 x 2736 and the videos are 640 x 480 at 30 fps.  There is a 320 at 15 fps, but I never use that setting.I take it everywhere I go.  It's rugged and I even dropped it from almost 5 feet to a concrete floor and it still worked (whew!).I was surprised how many pictures and video you can take on one set of batteries.  I basically use 8GB and 16GB cards.Since I kept the camera in my pocket all the time with the LCD screen exposed, the screen did get scratched up with all the loose change and other items in my pocket.  I wound up getting the screen protector for this and my hd video camera.  The screen didn't crack on me like what happened to another reviewer and I've been pretty rough with the camera.Only negatives about the camera: 1. you can only take 9:30 minutes of video at a time before it approaches a stop point regardless of the memory card size you are using and how much space is left on the card. To be clear, you can shoot lots of clips, like 3 minutes at a time and have an hour total of video (or more) on your card.  I would prefer that it keep recording until you run out of memory or the battery dies. A regular video camera will record until it reaches the end of the tape or it runs out of battery life. A couple of weeks ago, I had 10GB of video on the card with another Gig of photos on the same card using the same set of batteries the whole day (10 am till 8 pm). I have been lucky and got over 11 minutes of video on one shot. 2. The camera does not have Image Stabilization.I was surprised to read any negative feedback on this camera until I saw further that the reviews were based on one person unable to put the batteries in the camera (please!, you can do it with one hand) transit time in shipping, and another person basing it on a fradulent seller.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "strictly ameture", "Author": "Simple Minded", "ReviewID": "RDS7ZTC1LLMMF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am strictly an ameture photo guy...OUr primary criteria was keep it simple but with flexibility if we need it.

So, I looked for a \"point and shoot\" and found the Canon A640. I like it.It's easier to use than the Lumix and, of course, smaller. I like the weight of it and the shape of it because it feels familiar in my hand, having used 35mm manual cameras for so long, but it doesn't have their size and bulk. Using AA batteries is an advantage since they can be bought anywhere.

It's easy enough for the general user, like me, but also has some nice features for an advanced user.  I bought it for the swivel LCD and because it runs on AA batteries, both extremely useful.  My old camera was frustrating and inconsistent, and even though the Canon A640 is a little bulkier than my old one it's been worth it.  I live in a country where taking pics in public can sometimes be taboo, so the swivel LCD is awesome for for capturing moments on the sly.  You can even take self-portraits in a pinch with up to three or four people.  The LCD screen is very well designed giving the user countless options.  I love it.Highlights -1) Well designed, well lit and extremely useful swivel LCD screen.  Hands down the best feature.2) Nice size - not too big and not too small.3) Takes AA batteries.4) Highly user friendly.5) The picture quality is very nice both inside and outside, day and evening.6)  Overall consistency!  I live outside the US and need nice quality pics all of the time to post on the net, to send back home, and to use as gifts for my national friends.7)  Nice zooming capabilities.8) Adequate video capturing feature.9)  It's an attractive camera (you forget it's plastic) and very fun to use.10) Nice file output size, making cropping a breeze.Downsides -1) No general \"sports/motion\" mode or IS feature, so if you really want IS at the touch of a button, you'll be disappointed with this camera.2) It's annoying to have to open the battery compartment to insert or eject the memory card - the batteries have fallen out on me when I haven't been paying enough attention.3) Automatic face focus feature can be squirrelly and not always accurate.  Sometimes the camera will focus on a branch ten feet away instead of the face right in front of it.4) Fits in your hand, but not in your palm, if that makes sense.  If you want something smaller with SI and don't need a swivel LCD screen I would recommend a digital Elph. (but seriously, consider a swivel LCD screen, they're just so darned handy!)5) The night mode is a great feature but the aperture has to stay open for so long that unless you are taking a photo on a tripod it will inevitably will be blurry.6) It's a little noisy, especially turning it on and off.7)  The flask works well though it'd be nice to have more flash features.Overall the A640 is extremely user friendly, takes great pics and is fun to use.

We loved the first one so much that we decided to buy another one for my son's graduation.  We bought the 2nd one from Electronics Club.  We discovered that the camera would get very hot when the batteries were inserted.  We contacted the Electronics Club and they suggested that they send us an invoice so we could get the camera repaired for free.  The invoice never came.  Every time we contacted them, we got one of two responses:  1) Oh, we thought we already sent that invoice and that everything is okay or (2) no response at all.  So after a year of trying to resolve this, we have not even been able to use it once.  Happy graduation, son.So what I'm saying is, we are very happy with our original camera, but not the 2nd one.  Don't buy from the Electronics Club.  Not only did they send us a defective camera which we're apparently stuck with, but the manual that came with it is all in Spanish.  No English manual.  Also a \"case\" came with the camera that is so small it won't even hold our cell phone, much less the camera.  The reason that I'm writing about the Electronics Club in this review is because I am unable to leave feedback anywhere else.

I bought this camera to take pictures on a faily trip to Disneyworld & was sad to see many \"could have been great\" pictures marred by blur & red-eye. Here are my thoughts on this camera:1) Blurry photos - Canon did not include image stabilization in this camera & it clearly shows. Many of my pictures are blurry, fuzzy & look out of focus. On my old Olympus this rarely happened, on the A640 it was commonplace.2) Red-Eye: Many pictures indoors were plaged by terrible red eye. Again Canon did not include red-eye reduction & it is evident in many of my pictures.Overall I got some good pictures with this camera, but far too many blurry & bad photos to give this camera a good rating.

I was very impressed with the older one so I decided to purchase the A640 (10 megapixels) thinking that it would have all the features of the previous one. Well, I was wrong. Two things that I was disappointed with are it's Photostitch feature and zooming in/out in movie mode. Both of these features worked like you'd expect them to in the older version, however...The Photostitch feature doesn't work that well and it is more difficult to create panoramic shots compared to the older version. I've tried the accompanied software and it doesn't work and have also tried adobe photoshop.The other feature is zooming in and out while capturing a movie. In order to zoom in or out you will have to stop the movie capture, zoom it in or out, and start the movie capture. Not so with the previous version, while  recording a movie you can zoom in our out.Overall, I am disappointed with this camera. The only good thing about it is the 10 megapixels and that is about it.

My in-laws got the 5 megapixels in the A model the same time i got mine few years back and my pics always came out 100 times better.  so i should have taken the hint with the A640. you'd think buying what kind of issues would be in a 10 megapixel camera or would not have much problems.  but the A640 is by far a lower end camera than my 5 megs canon SD.  I want to return the canon A640 to amazon, but after reading their return policy it would be a waste of my money to even exchange it for the canon SD900.  i should have spent another $60 or even $200 more for the G7 and not have to deal with this kind of fustration.  from now on, i will only buy the canon SD or G models.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon A640 Camera", "Author": "Ronald T.

This was my first digital camera and I read many very positive reviews and was confident in my purchase due to those reviews and the Canon name.  Not wanting to get ahead of myself, I perused the manuals first wanting to make sure I was familiar with the basic operation of the camera before using it for the first time.  At last, I was ready to use it for the first time so I opened up the batteries included with the unit and followed the instructions on how to insert the batteries.  This is where my relationship with Canon ends.The instructions require you to slide a latch sideways and hold it in order to open up the battery/memory card hatch which is apparently hinged.  This is about as far as I got.  It's awkward enough to have to hold a spring-loaded switch in one position while trying to open up the door in a different direction but the operation simply did not work.  I fiddled with the thing for over 15 minutes and never managed to get the door open.  I even attempted to use a small mini screwdriver to help but to no avail.  The plastic the hatch and unit are made of seems rather brittle and delicate so I decided not to continue with it and risk breakage.  After all, an operation such as inserting batteries and memory cards should be simple.  I proceeded to box the thing back up to ship it back and exchange it for another brand.Simply put, I attribute this issue not to a defect but to poor design which is a shame since I was really excited to use this camera.  Not only will I not exchange this for the same thing but not even for the same brand.  This Canon product boasts many features and high quality that I didn't even get a chance to test.I will never again purchase a Canon product and warn potential buyers that the physical structure and operation of this unit are of poor quality.Big thumbs down.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 18 x 24-inch prints\n4x optical zoom; 2.5-inch vari-angle LCD display\nISO range up to ISO 800 for less blur in low light while hand-holding\n3:2 guide masks LCD to display 4 x 6-inch print size; 16:9 format option for still images\nStores images on SD cards; powered by 4 AA-size batteries", "Name": "Canon PowerShot A640 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBS83V8TL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000HARTYI"}}
