It's not the products fault, but it won't stick to my dash. The surface of my dash wont allow it to stick properly. I decided to stick it to the glass outside the car and it worked great.

It held to the windshield, but after a week in place, the glue between the suction cup and the plastic on the mount melted and it fell apart.  The suction cup actually melted to the windshield.  It was possible to peel off, but it took a little effort.  At least it came off clean.  Even before it melted, I wasn't incredibly happy with it.  It held the camera okay for front and back movement, and swinging side-to-side, but it wouldn't tighten to rotation, just letting the camera swivel with no resistance.  This might be alright for temporary placement, but I was looking for a semi-permanent mount for a dashcam, and it fell apart.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice little tripod", "Author": "debaserphoto", "ReviewID": "R35UFENCKT17CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice little handy device and extremely useful for videographers or video-bloggers.

For less than 5 bucks this little thing is well worth the money.  It stuck to my windshield great, it did fall off once when I was trying to first attach it.  However I think it was more user error, I may not have had a good suction.  Since then, it has stayed on for weeks so far.I first bought it because I also bought a \"Timetec Road Hawk 1080P HD\" dash camera and did not want to use the existing sticky pads on my window.  Making it difficult to transfer the camera from car to car.  The Suction Mount is great in that I can reposition the camera as many times as I want.I gave it 4/5 stars because the little nob that you need to tighten is made out of plastic.  It has not broken, but I suspect that it might after repeated loosening and tightening.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little mount.", "Author": "Shadykennl", "ReviewID": "R3J9XEC1ECO1K5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it !!

It will therefor not mount a camera in an upright position inside a sloped windshield as is.

It came in the brown envelope and inside the plastic Ziploc.  It was dirty and scratch around the screw thread, and had a scuff mark at the suction cup.  Maybe the previous owner doesn't like it.... but it still is work well.  Try this product to mount the camera on the wind shield... no success.. but it might work when installed on the driver side window.
