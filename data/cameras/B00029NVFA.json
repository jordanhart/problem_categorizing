{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Lot of Cam for the Price!", "Author": "J Harp", "ReviewID": "R18YS7JKGQLC0C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Concord 4363Z, which appears to be the 4 mp version of the 5345Z. I bought it on sale for $140.00 at a major discount store. This is my first digital cam and I am extremely pleased with the features, construction quality, and the end results. The cam uses conviently available 2 AA batteries and will deliver 40-50 exposures per charge. The body is all metal and feels very solid, expecially the door that covers the battery/card slot. In reading other reviews on digital cams, this seems to often be a weak feature. I am also impressed with the rapid response to shutter release, about 1-2 seconds once the flash is charged(bout 3-4 sec). This can be a major problem with many digitals. The cam is easily configured for point and shoot and delivers great pictures under most conditions in this mode. For the more technically attuned, the cam allows for a number of manual adjustments. I have only tested the video with sound feature, but it seems to work just fine.A couple of negatives. Be very carefull when deleting pic files. It is too easy to delete the entire card. Certain flash shots of people, especially close ups, produce skin tones that are not real accurate. And it does not do a great job handling backlited, high contrast subjects.In summary, the 4363Z is a superb digital cam for the money, producing accurate, sharp images. I would imagine the 5345Z would be just as good or better, expecially if you need 8x10s.", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "quite pleased", "Author": "luckyrabbit525", "ReviewID": "R3N0NGVB29OUVY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just recently took advantage of my warranty and sent in my camera to be fixed--the pictures out of nowhere started getting distorted--and got it back in about a week.  Hopefully the random malfunction was a rare occurrence because I love this camera.  I've been using it since the summer and had no problems up until that point.  It is compact, takes good photos, and easy to use.  There are many nifty settings, some which are for dark settings and seems almost impossible to hold the camera still enough sometimes.Another problem is that when I'm trying to take a bunch of pictures successively, the camera gets confused and needs long breaks inbetween (not that welcomed when something exciting is going on).I personally can't hold as near as many pictures on this camera as I want without an extra memory stick (I got one for about $25, I think) and was probably only able to put around 8 high quality pictures on it without it.It also helps that I got mine for a great price:  about $100 at Fry's.  Overall, I feel like it's a great buy.", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Jeanette H.
