Don't expect good resolution at any distance. I did not catch my burglars because the license number could not be read. Also the feature that limits the area of the picture/scene that will trigger an exposure does not work well at all. Exposures will still be made from way outside the selected rectangle and give you way too many pictures to look through. That's very annoying and took hours to look through all the false positives.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$294.95", "Features": "Affordable day night color video CMOS security camera\nNTSC signal system.
