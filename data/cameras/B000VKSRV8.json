My guess is you'll love it too, at least if your needs are similar to mine:I cut my teeth on a Pentax Spotmatic in the 1970s, and appreciate the flexibility of manual controls.  Point-&-Shoot digital cameras are small and light, but (nearly) everything is automatic.  The P5100 allows you to manually adjust the shutter speed and aperture, just like with a DSLR; but unlike a DSLR, the P5100 is (while a bit heavier and bulkier than I might ideally like) pocketable.  It's a compromise between a DSLR and a P&S;, and in that sense works really well for me.The build is really solid, the controls are exceptionally easy to use, and image quality is superb.  My only real complaints are that it's a bit slow (shutter lag seeems longer than most, there's a lag while the image is being processed, and it grinds and struggles to focus in low light) and the on/off switch is located in the wrong place (the center of the grip, so I find myself turning the camera on & off when I don't mean to).  I consider these minor inconveniences.So if you're a photo enthusiast who wants more control than offered by most P&S; cameras, but you don't want to deal with the bulk of a DSLR, you may love the P5100 too.===============================================UPDATE: I've had the camera for nearly 3 months now, so a brief update.  I still rate it as an amazing little camera -- a lot of features and flexibility are squeezed into a small, solidly-constructed, pocketable box.  If pocketability is what you want, this camera is I still believe an excellent choice.  It's truly like having a DSLR in your pocket in many respects.And it's not perfect: I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars.  When there are so many features packed into a small box, I guess there are bound to be compromises.The P5100's compromises show up mainly in low light.  First, there's a lot of noise above 400 ISO (although it's rated up to 3200).  In that sense, this camera behaves more like a film camera -- which isn't so terrible, I've learned to work with it.  The bigger problem is AutoFocus: It's a bit slow in the best of circumstances, and in low light it can take up to ten seconds to fix a focus.  This doesn't lend itself to \"point-&-shoot\" captures.  Again, I've learned to live with this: In low-light situations, I frame a shot and pre-focus: I depress the shutter halfway well before I'm actually ready to shoot, and then just wait.  It works, but takes getting-used-to.  I've also learned that center focus is a lot faster than the other auto focus options, and that in landscape mode, AF is turned off, with focus set at infinity.  Most important: from a half-depressed position, the shutter release is very responsive.  Bottom line: Low light photography requires a bit of advance planning.When shopping for this camera, I preferred both the Canon G9 and A650 to the Nikon P5100, each for different reasons.  But neither Canon camera is IMO pocketable.  So if you want DSLR-like flexibility in a small box, I still think the P5100 is about the best you can do at this point.", "Date": "November 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "I like my P5000 very much,  thus I would recommend the P5100", "Author": "Gerald Siegel", "ReviewID": "R2RUBX1V7L9XOA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me tell you what to buy with the camera. 1) the UR- E20 adapter tube. You can leave it on all the time as protection and for extra finger grip, I do. It weighs next to nothing 2) the wide angle converter lens, also very small gizmo, another hundred dollars but gives you a wide view of 24mm equivalent and the menu option allows the camera to correct some barrel distortion inherent in this type optic.Works pretty darn good except at extreme edges 3)Nikon's SB400 flash,which is a marvel. Small,light,dedicated to the system and has a swivel flash tube up front for bounce,unusual in anything this small and two celled. Flash uses two AA size standard power and delivers a lot more than the built in body flash pintsize runt,rechargeables are better natch. And if you get the flash you prolong the camera batter,a nice bonus and less less redeye4) a spare Li-Ion battery by Nikon another mere 20 bucks or so.Fast 2 hour charge will do it. Now this whole kit and kaboodle will run the tab up a bit more than you expected,but you will get shots that are equal or better than a heavy SLR with a heavy zoom lens.I do not joke. The camera's Program mode is one of the better ones out there. Meaning I trust it a lot.Some professional reviewers tend to poke away at this camera's lack of zip to them, and forget it is powered by a minute size battery,about the size of a slice of cheddar on a buffet table:-). It can't do burst shots and start up in a microsecond, true. They are not accepting it for what it delivers at this price. What else is out there but heavier and pricier in this category I mean.The lens will not open as wide at tele end as an indoor shooter would want without flash, and is not the speediest performer out there overall. BUT FAST ENOUGH if you pre- focus, and why not prefocus I say...it tells you that the lens has found its target. Nikon has done a good job on this product and you just can't go wrong at the price. I am really falling for this little fellow as a grab and go item. The LCD is hard to see outdoors except for the histogram playback. Indoors it is a delight to see. You may also want to pick up a wrist lanyard vs the neck strap which comes with it. Your preference.Battery delivers plenty juice for a day of reasonable shooting even with LCD viewing. When I go next trip to the Serengeti ,well, I take a generator and power inverter (:-), or maybe just a car battery adapter.  I carry all this kit,if you are interested, in one half of a Mountainsmith Aurora II Camera Bum Bag/ Lumbar Pack with room for trail mix and cellphone..Why schlep heavy stuff on a vacation?

We decided it was time for a new camera so we went to the store and ended up with an Olympus 1000 (great sale price). We got home and after we used it a couple of times we realy didn't like the camera because many pictures were blurred and just not very clear. So we sold the Olympus and splurged and got this camera. This camera is worth every penny! The pictures are so clear and the camera is actually much easier to use than I thought it would be. We took a picture of our ceiling fan while it was on high just to see how it would turn out and in the picture it is as clear as if the fan was off. This is an amazing camera with awesome features and my husband and I are both blown away by the picture quality.

The main reason to choose this one over the rest is that it has a hotshoe and is compatible with my Nikon SB600. Here is a comparison with my D70 nikon SLR a bit unfir but the P5100 holds up surprisingly well. The P5100 has a Mg alloy body and is sturdy but light enough to hold steady on a skinny pocket tripod. it has video capability although the built-in mic is awful. It does better than the D70 in very low light. built in VR is excellent and can drop at least 2 f-stops without distortion. It has a face id for focusing and a Panoramic shot assist--( when you use this setting the screen displays the edge of the previous photograph so that you can align the next shot perfectly when you pan the camera.).You cannot get dust on your sensor even if you try. and twice the megapixels compared to the D70! The limitations (compared to the SLR) are cannot shoot multiple frames per sec. very slight shutter delay compared to SLR.

It literally fits in the palm of my hands.My last Nikon was the Coolpix 995 (950 before that) and I never used most of its advanced options because the menu system was too complex. The 5100 is crammed with buttons and dials so that choosing most options can be done without paging through multiple levels of menus. Plus it has 15-preset types of \"scenes\" (portrait, sunset, museum, etc., plus the super-cool panorama setting) which make all the necessary settings for you automatically for a particular type of picture. Another cool feature is its ability to make time-lapse movies, as well as 640x480 30fps movies and sound recordings.But the main attraction of the camera for me was its fast lens with Vibration Reduction. I've taken sharp pictures in very low light which I had been unable to take with the old Nikon.Another feature I was not aware of until I got the camera is its ability to do digital zooms without image degradation (if you are shooting at less than maximum size, which I usually do anyway). When I shoot at 1600x1200 size, I can use digital zoom to get the equivalent of about a 7x optical zoom lens.I was considering the Nikon S10 (too much noise in low-light and difficulty focusing in low light) and then the D40 (no auto-focus in-camera, no VR without buying very expensive lenses). It would be nice to have something like an 18x optical zoom on the 5100, but short of that, this camera is very, very good -- especially at such a low price.", "Date": "December 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "Jason Denson \"Jason\"", "ReviewID": "R2H3IUAS66CU9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have no complaints about this camera.

Scurbica", "ReviewID": "R1IUF9SBZ3PXSV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I usually own at least two digital cameras, one DSLR and a smaller one that I can carry around. Currently, I have a Nikon D200 and a little Casio 7 mp Exilim. I like the Exilim because it's small enough for a pocket, but the picture quality is only so-so.After reading the positive reviews of the Coolpix P5100 here, I decided to buy the P5100 to replace the Casio.Picking up the camera for the first time was a joy. The camera just feels right in my hands and doesn't feel cheap (the body is magnesium alloy, not plastic).The P5100's exposures were spot on, alhtough there tends to be some clipping of the highlights and shadows. The colors are very accurate.If you are a beginner who doesn't want to get involved with post-processing, this camera is probably not for you. Nikon has decided to do minimal in-camera adjustment to the images, which can be a good thing if you know your way around Photoshop and don't mind working on the images on your computer. Some other cameras boost sharpness in-camera. You can set the P5100 to increase the sharpness, but at the normal setting, you may find yourself increasing the sharpness with Adobe Bridge or Photoshop.I don't agree with the reviewer here who complained about the video. The video is as good as any digital SLR that I've used. It won't give you the same results as using a digital video camera, but no camera does. The only problem with the video is that the sound ends about a half-second before the image does, so you're left with a silent bit and the end. This isn't a big deal to me. If I want high quality video, I'll use my video camera. In 15 years, think I used a still camera to take video exactly once.Regarding reviews complaining about shutter lag and focus time; yes, there is some shutter lag, but not enough to make it a problem for me. Same thing with focus. This isn't a camera to use to take action shots at sporting events. If that's what you're looking for, spend the cash to get a good DSLR.Another great feature is the hot shoe. I don't think there are other point and shoot cameras that allow you to use an external dedicated flash. I can use my Nikon SB-600 flash on this little camera. How great is that? The built-in flash works really well, too.The menus are a little bit confusing and not as intuitive as I would have preferred.If the P5100 did RAW, I would have given it 5 stars, because some other cameras in its class allow you to shoot RAW. Still, for the price, this is a sweet little camera that should fit the bill as a grab and go for times when you don't want to lug around a DSLR and a host of lenses.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon P5100 12.1 MP Coolpix - An excellent all-around camera", "Author": "M. Luke", "ReviewID": "RO6KJWDF4Y3YV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "2011 update:  Since I have written this first review, I have bought two ther cameras, a Pentax SLR and a Panasonic Lumix.  I still use this Nikon as it remains highly functional, easily portable and is unique in that it is the smallest camera with a hot shoe that I have.  Lighting is essential for good photographs and having the hot shoe helps me with flexibility.Original review:Wow what a great little camera!  I bought this to photograph family members and to take with me on trips.  This was a replacement for a much older 5 MP Sony that I had.  I had traded my old Canon A-1 for the Sony after much careful shopping around.  For this current iteration of camera shopping, I checked out the local Best Buy and Ritz to compare features on all of the latest cameras and decided on the Nikon P5100.  The sales staff at both of these places did not know much about the Nikon as it had just come in.  The Canon Powershot G9 was nice, but I was worried about design-flaws and quality issues that were described in recent reviews on Amazon (including tilted LCD screens, and extraneous lines and pixels on the display.  After trying it out and comparing with some other cameras, I decided on the Nikon.The Nikon P5100 Coolpix offers a mix of being simple and convenient to use and features that allow flexibility and some experimentation.  It is a great looking camera and very light with its magnesium body.  I was very impressed with the design and functionality included in this camera.The placement of controls and the handle allows for easy one-handed operation while shooting.  The wheel for review of photos was new to me as the Sony did not have this feature.  Very nice.Accessories -I bought a Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras to go with this.  The SB-400 takes two AA batteries.  I put the Energizer e2 Lithium AAs, which are lighter than many of the other AA batteries.  Keeps it lightweight, but very functional.  Having had experience with Sony and Canon Digital cameras previously, the built-in flash, while useful for close-ups do not work well in settings like the school auditorium for my children's events or out at night in an outdoor setting where distance is a problem.  I can get about 80 to 90 feet range with the SB-400.I also bought a Nikon wideangle lens and the Nikon URE20 Converter Adapter Ring.  Putting these together, the camera looks, feels, and functions like something that cost twice as much to put together.I can also strip it down to the the base unit and still have a very functional digital pocket-sized camera.I did not like any of the cases available from Nikon.  The base unit fit perfectly into the pocket case that came with the camera bag set from Expedition Outfitters - which I purchased from Sam's Club.Trying it out -The camera is fast and does not get caught up between shots like some of the other digital cameras I have tried.  The camera is SD and SDHC compatible as far as memory cards go.  I have had no problems with 1 GB SD, 2 GB SD and 4 GB SDHC cards.  I have an 8 GB SDHC card on order.I am finding that I need the larger cards to shoot any practical length of video with this camera.  A 1 GB card will fit about 20 minutes of video using the 640 resolution or 333 still shots at 12.1 MB per shot.  I have been trying out the difference between Class 2, 4, and 6, with Class 6 being the faster read/write for the SD cards.  While technically, the speed may be faster, with day to day shooting of family shots and nature shots, it is not as important.  However, I do notice the difference when I am uploading the photos onto my MacBook.  The Class 4 and 6 really do reduce the down-load time.  Also, they are much faster than my old Sony Memory Sticks that I had been used to.The 12.1 MP resolution is great for blowing up the photos, or for cropping.  The 5 MP on my old camera was pushing the resolution when I tried to make a poster or when I tried to print an 8 x 10 of a cropped shot.The low-light function on the camera works well and I get some great photos in indoor situations when I would rather not use flash.  The macro feature is great on this camera for my close-ups of plants and to record signage to mark Events with my photo batches (iPhoto on the Mac).The videos are great and work well on this camera, even though it was not designed with that use primarily in mind.  The zoom/wide angle feature is smooth and allows for some basic video technique.The lithium powercell for the Nikon lasts a decent amount of time.  I bought 3 to rotate out as they get used when I am on a trip.  They are very light and compact.  They are also easy to swap.  The camera comes with an AC charger for the power unit, but not the AC adaptor for the camera, which you have to buy separately should you need one.Summary -Again, this is an all-around, great camera, light-weight, functional, and the best of the new 12.1 MP point & shoot cameras that is upgradeable as of late 2007.  I hope that I will be as happy with this camera for the next several years as I had been with my Sony.", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "beautiful build, amazing software", "Author": "ian waddell", "ReviewID": "R1UV8P47Z74PD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "just upgraded from a nikon 5400 because i wanted something more portable. this is a small, well-built, ergonomic little camera, that's feels great in your hand.i've been really pleased by the upgraded performance too, compared to the 5400. the 12 megapixels gives significantly more detailed pictures. the built in vibration reduction software is amazing. it makes it possible to take sharp handheld pics at 1/8 or 1/4 of a second. and the d-light software magically transforms underexposed elements of a pic  (like a backlit subject against a bright ground) without affecting the correctly exposed parts.wish it had the 28mm of the p50; but a very pleasing little camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with the Nikon Coolpix P5100.

The P5100 is very user friendly and it consistently delivers good static images. It's an excellent choice for casual photographers who want a camera that's compact enough to drop in a pocket and take along everywhere they go, tough enough to stand up to the rigors of modern life, and cheap enough to be competitive. The P5100's tough as nails magnesium alloy body, nifty rubber clad hand-grip, logical control array, optical viewfinder, hot shoe for i-TTL Nikon Speedlights, and superb ergonomics make this camera an outstanding camera choice for casual shooters, but it's slowness, tendency to clip highlights, and noisy high ISO shots/poor low light performance will hurt its reputation with photography enthusiasts.

This is only the second time I've written a review as I feel compelled to share my experience of this wonderful little camera.First of all, I own a Coolpix 4500, so I am familiar with Nikon. I had it for several years and despite the fun using it and excellent pictures when I used it right, it was ultimately a frustrating camera-too big, very slow, with complex menus too troublesome to access. Like a previous reviewer and his 99x series, I too, found myself hardly using a lot of the available settings on that camera.So when time came to switch cameras, I vowed to pick a different brand. I have used a Canon A-series from work, used and returned a Casio v7. I wanted something zippy, small. After using these cameras, I realized size was the most important to me, next was the manual controls. I didn't want a straight up point and shoot, I enjoy creative control with my camera. After returning the v7 I realized I wanted it durable.Canon's A-series cameras did not appeal to me, I do not enjoy AA batteries, I find it cumbersome and awkward. I've used one from work where the lens were starting to have problems and I didn't like the construction of it. The Casio's greatest strengths were its slim build, lens that did not retract, really speedy and great movie mode. Plus it had a 7x zoom and all manual (albeit limited) control. But it was far too fragile and pictures were often soft and blurry in low light.I went to a local store with these three things in mind:1. Small/pocketable2. Full Manual control3. Good IQ4. Reasonably pricedI wanted it speedy of course, but figured that I would be happy with somewhere between my old sloooow 4500 and the superfast v7.The camera guy at the show showed me only two models: the 5100 and the g9. These are the two with fully manual functions. I knew about the Canon-A series but AA batteries are out of the question for me. I had my mind set on venturing beyond Nikon but when I picked up the 5100 it had me hooked. There is nothing like holding this camera in real life and trying it out. Everyone is right when they say this. It is something special.The G9 I know is supposed to be a superb camera, but I was not paying 500 dollars for it and it was not quite pocketable. I hemmed and hawed about getting another Casio for its small size/manual functions.Here's my take on the 5100 after having it for nearly three weeks. It is a great little thing. The size is unbelievable for what it can do. The image quality is great-you will notice this immediately. It is consistently well-exposed and sharp. Easily tweaked to fit personal tastes. Its terribly fun to use because there are so many buttons on the outside to easily access settings. No fiddling in menus.The infamous autofocus lag-well its there, but only in low contrast/light situations. There are ways to go about it that's already been discuss: prefocus, or force centered focus. The latter really makes a difference.Shutter lag-none. When focused, there is NO apparent shutter lag. I own the camera. I do know what I'm saying.What the camera does well, it does very well. Size, ergonomics, handling is excellent. Image quality is really great. It is VERY reasonably priced. It has fully manual controls: p,a,s,m modes, this is no token-2-fstop-option. I do not know of any other pocketable camera with such a feature set.Go pick one up at the store. Try it in your hand.

Not because I drop them in the mud, but because I like to buy a lot of technology. This little guy has stuck with me and here's why:- I tried the G9 first. I always noticed the extra girth when trying to discreetly carry it in my jeans pocket. The p5100, even with a soft case, can be forgotten about while I'm carrying it in said pocket.- Have you seen the images that can be made when using the wide angle and sb400 bounce flash? HOLY **** I'm no pro, but the results are creative and dramatic, to a much higher degree than any other P&S; I've ever had. Without the attachments, the pictures are still just as good as any other P&S; I've ever tried as well, and I used to even have the \"legendary\" Fuji F30. Even if the latter has better dim light results, the former makes up for it hundreds of times over with the bounce flash option.- I won't beat the horse with the \"performance issues.\" I'll just say I don't notice them, even though I originally owned the G9 for a month. That said, when I had both cameras at the same time, the interface of the G9 was a lot more user-friendly and \"snappy.\"- I took hundreds of pictures with both of them in the same conditions with various camera options. Subjectively, the ones taken by the p5100 consistently looked better and more alive than the G9 (without attachments). However, I could get much better \"quasi-bokeh\" with the G9, esp with the lens zoomed in and macro mode on.- Finally, p5100 + attachments = much better pictures than G9 alone, and in that configuration it weighs about the same as the G9 without attachments.- Result?

For indoors and at night, the LDC screen and the vibration reduction work wonderfully well.I like the idea of 12 mega pixels so I can crop in the photos. It's almost like having a zoom lens with more power than the 3.5 that comes on this camera. Do be aware that a 12 mega pixel photo that is not cropped will result in a fairly large file size. So, if you plan to do a lot of work with your photos on the computer it is a good idea to have a fast computer with a fairly large hard drive.This camera is so small and lightweight that it's perfect to keep in my purse for when an unexpected photo opportunity occurs.UPDATE: This camera was wonderful when I first got--actually I bought two of them. And, then, after several months they both failed at the same time--unfortunately during our daughter's wedding rehearsal. One of them caused the Nikon battery to overheat after about two photos.

With such small optics that are optimized a bit more toward consumer expectations, you naturally get maximum focus and limited depth-of-field control, but knowing that, everything else works great.

And not only is this camera small but it LOOKS like a camera should (maybe not important to you) but this feels absolutely PERFECT in the hand and I have heard from many pros that the camera that is used is the one that feels the best when taking pictures and this one is perfect.The P5100 is always compared with the Canon G9 and the G9 DOES take marginally better pictures but the P5100 is A> $100-150 less, B> much smaller and lighter (important to me) and C: has a 30 fps movie mode- the G9 is only 15 fps. Again that is important to me. And to me the pictures it takes are fantastic.And for those who say this camera cant take good shots of moving objects I am not sure what they are referring to. Just yesterday we were drivng back from Houston and took pictures of car and truck wheels at 80 mph next to us and the camera froze the wheels perfect every time in both manual and sport modes.

Also I set the camera to 8 mpixel and I experience only a slight shot to shot lag like 1 second no big deal to me at all.I took the advice of another reviewer and bought the wide angle lens (very squat and fits the camera perfectly without sticking out too much. and the hot shoe flash- just takes great shots every time of everything.I Love Canon cameras and have bought many SD700, 850 and own a S3 (great camera) but the P5100 is the one I carry with me and gives me, as a mid ranged experienced user, the ability to shoot almost as a good as a pro, at a fraction of the price and a fraction of the weight and bulk.Yes having a RAW mode would be better and maybe a 5-7x zoom would be nicer ( a reason to upgrade to the 5200?).

For people who generally shoot using a more powerful DSLR, this camera will give the shooter the luxury of having a point and shoot camera as well as a manual/semi-manual camera in one very small package.With 12.1 megapixel, the images are highly detailed and the prints are good enough to have on the walls.  I like taking pictures wherever I go, but I'm not always able to carry my DSLR around. With this camera, I no longer have to choose between hauling a heavy DSLR or miss the opportunity of capturing something interesting.On the automatic side, the facial recognition and anitshake features are must haves when you only have seconds to take those pictures.  The high ISO numbers allows proper exposures in many low light as well as high shutter speed conditions.  On the manual side, the customizable \"function\" button lets me decide the kinds of setting I want at my finger tip under different situations.  For example,  I could put the ISO setting there so that I can change the ISO from picture to picture, or I could set the function button to call up the white balance setting when I'm trying to meet a ever-changing condition, i.e. from sunlight to shady skies.  The flexibility of this camera makes experimenting part of the fun as well.Some say this type of cameras are not serious, however, I think this camera is actually fun and yet serious enough to let photographers who enjoy taking pictures no matter what the situations and conditions are a good backup.  After all, it is the finding of interesting images and the creativity of picture composition that we enjoy and not necessarily the joy of just owning more expensive equipments.I'll take my DSLR AND this Coolpix !!!!", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but don't expect too much", "Author": "Richard Ignacio \"www.ignacio.tv\"", "ReviewID": "R1UHRA1A5NAL6O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Nikon Coolpix 5100 as a compact camera to bring when my DSLR would be too big and bulky.

Also, the ability to measure for white balance is nice.  I have been in lighting conditions that just didn't look right with auto or the other white balance settings, and having the ability to measure for white balance was fantastic.The one thing I did not like about this camera is that auto-focus tends to hunt a lot in low-light.

The two clear choices were the G9 and the Nikon P5100.  I read professional reviews one after the other and they all seem to indicate photo quality to be similar.  The G9 however packs more features and feels like a professional camera.  But when I went into a store to handled both cameras side by side, the choice was obvious.  The P5100 is a true point and shoot; the G9, although nicely weighted was to bulky to be considered a point and shoot.When I brought the P5100 home and test drove it, I knew I made the right choice.  The photo qualities are stunning (for a point and shoot).  Mind you, I don't print anything larger than 8x10.  From landscape scenery to portraits taken at social gatherings, my photos turned out a lot better than I expected.  Flash was rather balanced, even indoors.  The quality was good enough that I could fix through the computers.  As for RAW capabilities, I could care less.  As a digital amateur, I still can't yet figure how my prints can benefit significantly from RAW.As for video recording, I use my point and shoot mainly as a camera, so any video capaibility I consider extra.So if you have no pretensions of being a professional photog and you care more about ease-of-use and convenience over features and looking 'substantial,' than the P5100 is the clear choice.

What a fantastic camera! I recently also purchased a Pentax K10d (and it's a great camera but a bit too heavy to carry around on this old neck for any length of time) but this is the camera I use most and I carry it with me everywhere. The program modes are terrific and combined with the SB400 Speedlight this little jewel is just about impossible to beat. The price is great and the camera itself is very high quality construction. The all magnesium body feels great in your hands and the controls are all very handy and easily operated, even in very low lighting conditions. One added plus is the camera will allow you to record audio captions for each picture or you can also record audio alone.  The video capture works very well and it's quite handy if you don't happen to have a video camera with you at the time and still want to be able to provide that little 'extra'.  One very cool feature is the Panoramic Mode, which provides a 'ghost' image on 1/3 of the LCD screen that allows you to consistently match up with the previous image and makes it very easy to take images that stitch together flawlessly.  Nikon really did a great job with this camera!  Get one and you will absolutely be pleased with it. Don't forget to get the Nikon carrying case as well, which makes it very convenient to carry.

And that's with a year and a half of CONSTANT use.The optical viewfinder doesn't zoom like it used to, unfortunately...  but that's a product of several drops and mishaps.It does have its quirks, however.  ISO 800-2000 look HORRIBLE- Awful, awful, AWFUL grain!  But strangely enough, ISO 3200 looks better than those two.  I've used that to pull off some pictures at concerts that didn't allow cameras that actually look not half bad. I suspect that there's some in-camera trickery that accomplishes this.  It will drop your resolution down to 5mp, but who cares?  You are able to get pictures without a flash that you'd NEVER be able to get another small sensor camera to take.Be aware that this camera has crammed 12mp onto a tiny sensor, so noise is GOING to be an issue over anything but the lowest ISO settings.Also, something to think about:  The MASP settings are neat, but you will spend the majority of your time in P unless you want to get frustrated.  Do NOT expect the same control over DOF that you would have in a larger camera - That's simply a product of the tiny lens.  It's nice to have the control, but you are using a tiny lens on a tiny camera - The custom white balance is more useful.Optical VR - AWESOME.  This alone was a big selling point for me.Focus is slow, but accurate.  If you have time to pre-focus and compose your pictures, then you will not care, but it could be an issue for some.Flash is adequate, but easy to cover.Some say that the menu system is weird - I actually find it intuitive.  This is one of the easiest cameras to make do what I want, you have COMPLETE control over it.  Beware, as this can be a burden as well as a blessing.My recommendations: Keep it in P, set the FN button to handle white balance, and set to Fixed Auto ISO 64-200.This is a GREAT travel camera, and a good camera to sneak into concerts or other situations that normally won't allow cameras.

The auto lens cover still sticks a little, but no long term effects as of yet.)Two months ago, I was shopping for a camera for my first ever trip to Yellowstone Nat'l Park. I was torn between the Nikon P5100 and the Canon G9. I agonized over all the reviews and sample pictures. The Canon was great, but cost $200 more and weighed a lot more. The Nikon was lightweight, more pocket friendly and still 12 megapixels.Believe it or not, this is my first digital camera. I have a couple film cameras, a Nikon 35Ti point and shoot and a Canon T90 SLR. I used to be a professional, toting bags of heavy equipment with me everywhere, and I wanted to get as far away from that as possible, even if it meant sacrificing \"picture quality.\" And by that, I mean the difference between something you'd see in a scrapbook versus in a published book. This little camera does a great job; overall I was very happy with it. Most of my disappointments came from the rustiness of my own photography skills.However I did hit a enough snags to reduce the rating to 4 stars. The camera sometimes had a hard time metering, especially at the Paint Pots or waterfalls. I usually used either Aperture or Shutter priority, depending on whether I wanted depth of field or stop-action -- I love having that ability. But when the meter was fooled, I would have to switch to Manual. I never tried the preprogrammed settings (Portrait, Landscape, etc). The other problem was focusing -- the camera does great with people, but terrible on landscapes with no contrast (again, the paint pots or thermal features with lots of steam). I found that setting the focus from AF to landscape helped a lot, but I was frustrated enough to take away a star.So I'm sure I would have gotten much better pictures had I spent $1500 on a new SLR and lenses and a tripod and hauled 40 pounds of equipment with me instead of carrying a $300 camera (with the extra telephoto extender too) that fits in my pocket.

My main camera is currently a D40X SLR, but I like to have a pocket size also.  I bought the Coolpix P5100 to upgrade from a Coolpix 4200 which I had for 4 years.  It was highly recommended by sales people at 2 different camera stores over other models I was considering.  But it is a big disappointment.  Because I am primarily an SLR user, my expectations are high.  But even comparing it to my old 4200, this camera is a loser.  It is extremely slow to focus and take the picture (the worst I have ever used).  It does great on landscapes or posed pictures, but forget anything that is moving, such as kids at play or animals.  It seems not to be able to focus on moving objects at all.  Other features (or lack of them) that I dislike:- the mode dial does not have frequently used modes such as landscape or sports; you have to use scene and then cursor through a whole list of modes to get to them (very annoying)- I'm used to using the viewfinder (no other option with the SLRs), and monitors are difficult to see in sunlight.  This camera has a viewfinder, but there is no way to turn the monitor off (there is with my old 4200), so the battery drains much faster.I expected something better than what I had, but I didn't get it.

I used it all the time, and I even took photos which I sold in a gallery (printed 24 inches by 16 inches).Nikon then replaced the P1 with the P5000 and then that camera was replaced with the P5100.  I eagerly bought the P5100 in 2008 and used it for a couple months before sticking it in a drawer and going back to using the P1.The reason is VERY simple.  To impress people with how many megapixels they could squeeze into the camera, they made the actual pixels way too small.  The result is that the image is extremely noisy (that is, individual pixels, sitting right next to each other, often register completely different exposures or colors even if they are both 'pointed at' the same object).  You can apply heavy noise reduction (i.e. smoothing) to undo this, but then you have an image which has LESS resoultion than the 8MP P1.If you want my advice, you will be better off buying a P1 (you can still find new ones on ebay for between $100 and $200 or buy a used one for less) than buying the P5100.

I love the D80  but needed something small that I could easily carry and use when conditions make the D80 inconvenient. I found it in the P5100.The camera comes with a good wide angle-to-zoom lens, but with restricted zoom capability. However, for a few dollars more there are both wide angle and telephoto extension lenses that can satisfy those who want extended capability.Some have argued that the camera is very slow to focus in low light conditions. I have found this to be true as compared to my D80, but i have still managed to get good shots indoors and even got a clear photo of a roosting bat in Marengo cave under very low light, using the built in flash.The really good news is the flash hotshoe, which enables this pint sized camera to use the latest Nikon flashes and function with thru-the-lens flash capability.  This makes fill flash a breeze, and really allows you to capture low light action quickly and with accuracy.At first I was bugged by questionable image quality. But after reading an on-line review of the P5100, I followed their advice to leave the camera on the highest photo quality settings (fine/large), and do any necessary size reduction on my computer. Apparently, the on board compression software on the P5100 is not conducive to good photo quality. But when I shoot wide open and use my Macbook Pro's software to reduce size and quality, I get sharp and clear photos easily. This discovery has really \"made\" the camera for me.

I wanted something that took great pictures (obviously), had manual controls (i was just starting to get into photography at the time), and was very portable (if you can't take it everywhere, what good is it?).I spent months and months online reading reviews, shopping around, and decided on this camera. It has certainly delivered.Display: I've never really had a problem using the display in all but the brightest sun. The viewfinder's there if you need it, too, which is nice. I would love it if it was a through-the-lens viewfinder, but it's not; it shows what's in front on the viewfinder, rather than what's in front of the lens, and can't adjust for zoom. This is a really minor complaint though, as I've really never had much trouble with the display.Ease of use: The auto mode on this camera works great. The special scene modes are great. (That covers ease-of-use for amateurs-- you can easily take great pictures with this camera even if you never touch any of the manual controls.) If you're more knowledgeable, the camera has full manual, aperture, shutter, and program modes too. As someone who's shopped around, I can tell you this is really hard to find in a camera that's this size and price. All of the controls feel intuitive and I've always found it easy to find everything I need. If I could change one thing here, I wish the camera would remember settings that I'd changed after I've turned it off and on again. For instance, I almost never use the flash, but every time I turn it on, I have to turn the flash off again.Features: Features. Hmm. This camera has every shooting mode I could ever need, manual controls, a FLASH HOTSHOE, *and* can accommodate additional lenses? Ok, so it doesn't come with on-board GPS like the P6000, but other than that, I can't think of a feature I would ever want that this camera doesn't have. Oh, and the vibration reduction's great too. I've been able to take shake-free pictures with shutter speeds up to 1 or 2 seconds handheld if I steady myself on something. This is really nice for shooting in low-light or at night. Complaint: the flash. The flash on this camera is bad. It's not very powerful and most pictures taken with it come out looking unnatural. I think it also sometimes gets the shadow of the lens, which is odd. Then again, if this really mattered, I could always buy an external flash. It hasn't really bothered me, but it has turned me into a natural-light purist. Vibration reduction really helps with this.On the negative side, don't even try to take pictures of kids playing sports with this thing. It has a mode for it, but I wouldn't recommend it. The camera seems a little too slow to respond for this sort of thing. The high ISOs are really grainy, too. I like to set it at ISO 64-100 and take pictures of fairly stationary things. If this isn't for you, you might want to consider a slightly more nimble little camera.Picture quality: Picture quality is stellar. Really. Occasionally, I see pictures taken with a professional DSLR and say, \"Wow, I don't think I could do that with my camera,\" but short of being a DSLR, this thing can take really amazing pictures. The 12MP also make it easy to crop things way down and find a more impressive photo hidden within an otherwise dull one.Portability: It's not as small as some digital cameras made these days, but it's still easily purse/pocket-sized (bulgy pocket, but still). For all the features this thing holds, it seems downright miniscule.If you can't tell already, I highly recommend this camera. I took mine in for repair the other day (fell off a table and got a lens error. :( otherwise, has been very durable, though.) and, after quoting me the price for the repair, the woman in the camera store said that whether it was worth it or not depended on how much I paid for it and how much I love it.

I have generally always owned Canon PS cameras, so the move to this one was not a given. I previously owned the G9 and still would had it not been for some of its shortcomings. I always carry a PS camera as I travel a lot and cannot always carry the big, heavy stuff. The P5100 replaced both the DS-850IS and G9 Canons. So these are my comments and a direct comparison to the G9.If the P5100 were capable of producing raw files, had a better viewfinder (which is a fault of all of these - why can't we have a wider angle of view and some parallax lines so we can really use these?) and a more robust processing engine, it would be an ideal camera. The build is like a mini D300; solid as a rock. Compact. Amazingly compact for its features. G9 is made nice too, but it is a much larger camera. There are also known issues with the G9's lens and dust contamination. LCD is large and sharp, but harder to view in sunlight than the Canon's. I use it to shoot most of my images, but I would prefer to use a viewfinder if I could ever find one that was worth it. The jpegs I shoot with this are more neutral than the G9's, appear every bit as sharp and have about the same exposure latitude. The G9 was no screamer speed-wise either, but it beats the P5100. Focus on both of these cameras at the long end is rather ponderous and sometimes downright hit and miss. For a Nikon DSLR shooter, the flash system is compatible and one of my main reasons for purchasing. The biggest feature I like about the Nikon is configuring the Fn button (I use it to switch between the 2 personal user settings, where over a dozen settings can be retained by the camera; excellent). I also enjoy the (full resolution) square format mode; a new/old way to see things.Image-wise, I would rate both of these cameras as equal, and the choice of which one produces the best images comes down more to personal preference. I find the same thing with P5100 images that I do with those from the D70s and the D80. They are snappier from the camera, have a more film like response to light in the tonal curve and (to me) appear more natural than those from a Canon. If you compare P5100 jpegs to G9 raw files, well, the G9 would have the nod.I generally give the cameras I buy very fair and some would say high ratings. I defend my position from the standpoint that I have owned (literally) dozens of digital cameras and I do a lot of up front research before I buy, so I'm prone to be impressed once I get the things. I continue to find this to be an excellent carry along camera, and I intend to keep it until I can justify the price of an M8, or until someone comes along with a real viewfinder built into one of these.Negatives?No denying some dim light focus issues, although they are not impossible to work around once you figure it out. Not the fastest camera on the earth but not the slowest, either. I have yet to miss a shot. Additional images can be made during the writing process, so I have no issues. View finder is not the greatest, but here again, I've had much worse (like on the Nikon 5400 and the Canon G6 and G9). Screen resolution is excellent, but it is hard to see in harsh sun and not the equal of the G9. I gave a 5 for value, as i did not pay full price. When I bought the Canon new, these were selling for about the same. I bought mine as a Nikon refurb from Adoxxxx for under 200 usd near the end of last year. Amazing kit for that price.

Small Casio and Richo cameras have worked well in the past, but this Nikon beats them all hands down.

I've never had a digital camera that did NOT have trouble getting its focus in low light. The Canon XTi has the problem, my Minolta digital had the problem and, from what I've read the Olympus E510 and Nikon D60 also have that problem. But with the P5100 there are ways around it using the landscape setting.The other problem, much discussed, is the noise factor. If you are seriously thinking about this camera and like low light photography, as I do, then I would suggest you go to this Flickr link and have a look at how capable the P5100 truly is in low light situations. Noise is not a factor if the settings are correct.I bought this looking for a camera capable of doing film-like work (or as close as possible)with a very small body. That does not mean I am necessarily looking for razor-sharp resolution (though you do get that with this fine Nikkor lens). I wanted a certain \"look\" to the photographs that this camera can indeed produce. No RAW? Who cares! I don't do PS anyway and would rather have an excellent camera that takes great photographs in the first place and doesn't require the use of RAW and hours slaving away over Photo Shop rebuilding a flawed photograph piece by piece. No thank you. If that appeals to you then get the G9 or G10, but don't try to put it in your pocket! But if you want what is, IMHO, a better camera and lens to use on site and get it right the first time, on location, then this is a better choice. Have a look at this link to see the P5100's low light capability and film-like qualities: [...]or this:[...]Or here to see its beautiful bokeh: [...]And bear in mind that this camera does this with 12.1 pixels on a tiny little sensor. How? The secret is the custom application of the EXPEED digital image processing engine. Something the G9 and G10 don't have. You get the advantages of a huge pixel count (on a small sensor) but without the excessive noise found on cameras not possessing such a capable processing engine. And, regarding the G9 and G10, not only is this camera much smaller but the build is far better and it has a hard substantial feel, thanks in part to the magnesium body.If you want to reduce the pixel count on your sensor to increase the dynamic range this camera can do that. It can be reduced to 8M, 5M, 3M, 2M or 1M. Also, how many digital cameras these days offer ISO settings of 64 and 100? This one does.But, for me, all it boils down to is this: is this camera able to deliver the look you are searching for or not? If you like what you see when you brouse Flickr then give it a try. If you don't like what you see, give it a pass. The proof is in the pudding and you can read ten different reviews and everyone says something different. So just go by the results you can see on the net.This review is my opinion only and, as I said, you can certainly find people who do not agree with me about this.

My only quibble with this awesome camera is that it doesn't have a wide-angle lens... its zoom starts at 35mm equivalent which is a bit of a pain for taking panorama or quirky wide angle close-ups, which happen to be my favorite!  If you're OK with the lens, do not think twice and buy this baby.  You'll love the photos it takes.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Maria C.

I was so disappointed that my Coolpix P5100 yielded blurry and hazy pictures taken in broad daylight, even with its \"fine\" mode on. Its indoor performance was even more deplorable (even under well-lit conditions for shooting still-life objects). The major factor contributing to Coolpix P5100's poor picture quality is probably its slow-reactive auto focus, which takes a few seconds (and several seconds when shooting indoor or in a shaded area outdoor) to lock in a target. If you are looking for a digital point-and-shoot with high MP, you should definitely avoid Coolpix P5100. I do digitized photo repair as a hobby, and therefore am highly attentive (and sensitive) to image details.

I was upgrading from a 5 MP camera and read tons of reviews on this camera.... pretty much everything I read said this was an awesome camera and I loved the price tag, so I got it. I have never been so disappointed in a camera! The pictures are almost always out of focus, and unless you're in *really* good light, the pictures are very grainy! And probably the most annoying part is that you have to wait a long time for it to say it's ready to take the picture.... and then it still turns out blury! I messed with it for almost two weeks and finally gave up. I returned it and ended up with the Digital Elph - the MP's aren't as high, but it takes really nice pictures and a heck of a lot faster!

NOPE, it's still not there yet. I have had other Nikon Coolpix cameras prior to this one and the quality of the images on the older models seemed to be better then this one. I shoot professionally with my Nikon D70 SLR.  I was hoping the technology was becoming better in point and shoot (POS) cameras. Boy was I wrong. This cameras photos at 100% look MUDDY! or I should say like a watercolor photo instead of a real photo and there is artifact problems in the images as well. I think Nikon is trying to cover up the noise problem by having the camera process the images this way. Your pretty much stuck with muddy photos. You just can't win with this camera not even adjusting ISO speeds. You can't fix muddy photos but you can fix a little noise problems with computer softwares.NOTE: This camera was not purchase to replace my old pro camera it was purchased for my husband to carry around which is out dated now.

I will never ever again buy a camera from Amazon since unlike a bricks and mortar shop, they seem to have no responsibility for products like this once they sell them.An update - two things: (1) I agree with the reviewers who get blurry photos - I wanted to use this for underwater photos and many are blurry because of inadequate low light sensitivity and a very slow  autofocus that doesn't always focus. High iso photos are very noisy. (2) About 1 year after purchase (and repair of the lends problem above) the telephoto adjustment broke as well.
