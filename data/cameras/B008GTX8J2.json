We wanted one that would be durable but still be able to take better pictures and have more function than the typical kids cameras.  She loves taking pictures with this!  It is her favorite toy.  It has been very durable.  She is able to see the picture that she has taken, be able to delete photos, and enjoy it.  She has even dropped it once and it still has been fine.  We have not used the editing software yet.  I'm sure it works great.  A great camera for a kid!!  I highly recommend it!", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "cynthia ashby \"cynthia ashby\"", "ReviewID": "R1SAVXBD5TDEG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works really well easy handle to carry, granddaughter is three and loves it.
