I just opened and tried this camera today. For the price I paid, it is a steal deal.The color definition of the photographs is acceptable by ordinary eye. The features are great and standard compared to any $150+ camera from Sony or Nikon. For an everyday use it is a great product with acceptable quality. No issues I facedMy credentials:- have studied photography in school- have used over 5 point and shoot cameras from Nikon, Sony and Cannon- over last 7 years, clicked over 11,000 photographsYou would not be wrong in buying this camera if you get a steal deal like i got. Do read the manual (also available online) before you run into issues with the menu not displaying ways to set date. Use simple mode off on second screen, and all problems solved. enjoy!!!", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pics, easy enough to use, but SLOW", "Author": "Writer of Books - Mage - Mom to Two \"Writer, ...", "ReviewID": "R8QRS94ZNF0M7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I usually go with a Kodak Easyshare kind of camera, mostly because I trust the Kodak name and am used to their setup. Well, hubby got this for me for Christmas because my old Kodak was finally having issues opening up. As for the photos with this Insignia, they are beautiful! I write books and often use photos for my book covers. The quality of the photos with the Insignia is top notch. If that is your focus (ha ha! pun intended) then do not hesitate to get this camera. Also, it's pretty intuitive and easy to use. I never looked at the booklet for instructions, just popped in new batteries and got to taking photos of Christmas.  My only real issue is that it's so slooooow[...] I have brand new batteries in it, but between photos I have to wait for the ready light. Wait...wait..okay it's only a few seconds, but it's longer than with any digital camera I've used. I'm not taking actions shots here either, I'm just turning on the camera and want to capture a moment, but wait for the camera to be ready to take the photo.Personally I don't use face finder etc but I will mess around with it and see if my pictures improve. Ultimately though, the wait time makes me kind of dread this camera every time I want to take photos.  I certainly would not recommend giving this as a gift and for the same price you could easily get a Kodak or other brand name.Sheri Gill", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good simple shooter camera", "Author": "Marke R.

Pictures are sharp enough, and the best photos are the outside shots. It does a good job taking pictures in darker environments and outside with a good flash.Unfortunately you can't zoom out enough for my tastes, and there is a  big pause and wait in between taking pictures. This is inconvenient when you want to take a lot of pictures, or try to take several quickly to catch the right moment. The camera can sometimes freeze up, which can be fixed by opening the battery compartment. The worst thing is, when I turn the flash off, the picture is always blurry no matter how I mess with the settings. I'm forced to leave the flash setting on to get good pictures.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best basic camera I have ever owned", "Author": "Robert Crispien", "ReviewID": "R3QZ7ZP70QZILW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on Black Friday in 2010 for $50, figuring that if it lasted an entire year that I still got a good deal. It is now February 2013 and the camera is still going strong.  I use it almost everyday for my job and have taken over 16,000 pictures with it (I know, because it keeps track !)Yes, the camera is basic and offers few features, but it is dependable, sturdy, and relatively problem-free. I have dropped it in the snow, used it in 100 degree heat, and in thunderstorms -- despite all this, it keeps going. It takes clear pictures and the camera itself is extremely easy to operate.  Also, it doesn't drain batteries as fast as other cameras that I have owned in the past.If I had known in 2010, when I bought the camera, that I would still be using it almost 2 1/2 years later, I would have gladly bought two of them. I guess I couldn't recommend this any more than I just have.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Steven C", "ReviewID": "RBRT2979PXZQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted an inexpensive small camera that took good pictures. After being very unhappy with a Vivitar I had recently purchased I did some research and read many reviews. The Insignia seemed to get the best reports so I found mine used on Amazon.com for only about $20 and I have been very pleased with the quality pictures and it's features like 3x optical zoom.
