It took a few months to finish the construction and move in. After moving in I tried to use the DVR and it wasn't working properly. Q See said I had a bad hard drive so I purchased a new one. That did not fix the DVR. Upon several phone calls and emails to to Q see they determined the DVR was bad and out of warranty. They told me \"it would be more cost effective and time saving if you were to purchase a new unit\" This unit was new out of the box. I would not buy another product from Q See.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See QT 428", "Author": "lou", "ReviewID": "R1C1AVU2B8X7IV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "2 months after the waranty finished 4 cameras ports on 8 stop to work. I did contact Q_See for support, i did check every things as their suggestions. But the problem was still there. They tell me it need to be repaired ??????? at my own expense even with two months over the waranty :( . Now this model is not even three years old and it a piece of  junk half of it is not working only 4 camera on eight still working, almost all camera show cyan and magenta insted of real colors, this product did not respond the minimal of what it was supposed to do. Will never ever buy Q-SEE product again..", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See lasts just beyond warranty - then dies (TWICE!)", "Author": "S.

They replaced it.Now the second one failed just outside the warranty (little over a year) & they won't replace it.So... if you buy a Q-See - expect to buy a new one every year ($300-400 each year).I recommend just buying a more expensive brand in the first place.  There is literally nothing to these on the inside - just a hard drive and a circuit board from China....  Probably only costs them $50 to produce.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not user friendly.", "Author": "O.

I did finally set to remote view but it stopped working. Figured out I need it to update the firmware. I followed everything to the letter. DVR froze on initializing screen. Currently looking for a compatible DVR to the q-see cameras. I don't recommend to any DIY person.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003YGME5Q"}}
