I'm just so thrilled with this camera. It's so easy to use, I didn't once have to break out the instructions to get this thing up and going. It's super sleek looking and the color is a nice touch. Most importantly - the quality of photos is just amazing. Even under low light conditions, the quality doesn't suffer. You can shoot photos pretty quickly and there isnt a long pause time, for those wanting to take quick shots and not miss the moment. Battery life is excellent; I've easily taken 150+ pictures and several videos and the batteries are still going strong. Videos are okay, definitely not HD quality, but I didn't purchase this camera for that feature, and it's nice having video capability if nothing else is available.Anyway, my video should speak for itself. There are several different modes to choose from for those who are control freaks. As far as the \"share\" feature, I'm not quite sold on it yet. It's easier for me to just put the SD card into my computer rather than go through the hassle of going through each photo, selecting it, choosing the share option, plugging it into the computer...etc., etc. Overall, a great camera for such a low price and I recommend it.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and Great Price", "Author": "Booklover", "ReviewID": "R1JWCZTYIMXA1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love It.

With that in mind, I also always have a point-and-shoot camera on hand for day trips where I don't feel like lugging around my huge camera.  I had a Kodak easy share in 2007, then bought a fujifilm and a canon.  The fujifilm and canon never had the same quality that I got from the kodaks, so I stumbled upon this camera and decided to try it out as a gift for my 4 year old son's 5th birthday.Right out of the box, I put in the batteries and took a few test shots.  Amazing, beautiful pictures, just on the screen.  I liked them so much that I bought another for my Mother for her anniversary.  She just took the camera to Baltimore for their anniversary date.  Keep in mind, I had taken my DSLR to Baltimore just a few weeks ago.  The photos were beautiful!  The colors are vibrant, the quality is GREAT, and I am VERY happy with this camera.One thing to keep in mind: make sure you hold the shutter button down half way and wait for the little \"beep\" for it to focus.  It will focus perfect every time.  The flash isn't too washed out, and as long as you use rechargeable batteries you'll be just fine.

The description said camera was \"red\"; box said camera was \"red\"  But camera was actually silver.  I offered to return it, but my daughter wanted to keep the silver one.  I personally was disappointed given the false indicators that it was a red camera.  As for quality, the camera is pretty basic and is a good \"first\" camera for a child. The picture quality is left wanting, though.  You must buy a separate SD card, but that is pretty common.  If you are buying for yourself and can afford it, I recommend Canon cameras.  I have always had good luck and great pictures with that brand of cameras.

However, I wouldn't say the photos are stunning. They're decent, better than some, but a far cry from cameras even just twice the price. The Easyshare function is quite nice, but I will be traveling over the summer and probably buying a better camera for my trip. If you're buying your teenager a first camera - this is a good one, as it looks pretty cool, and is easy to use with any computer, without having to buy other devices to upload your photos, etc. But it does freeze occasionally, turn off suddenly, and uses up batteries way too quickly. (Also, photos often come out a bit blurry - unless you have arms of steel or a tripod/something sturdy to put the camera on.)", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "cindy", "ReviewID": "R2WFZ19WUN3DP8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I WAS IMPRESSED BY HOW SMALL YET EASY TO USE THIS CAMERA WAS,WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT NEEDS A SIMPLE TO USE CAMERA THAT WORKS GREAT", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Quality!

Fits well in her hands, solid build quality, VERY easy to operate, and takes standard AA batteries... great in case they die while away from a charger (just buy standard rechargeable AA's for under $10).  (Her)Only complaint is that when recording video clips, sound will not playback on the camera.  It will playback once you download to a computer, but if you want to show a clip to someone on the camera, you're out of luck.

She's a pretty responsible kid (as 5 year olds go), but I didn't want to spend a fortune on her first camera.  I also didn't want to buy her a \"kids camera\".  The ones I found were really nothing more than toys.  I landed on this camera as a good balance between price and features, and I'm very pleased with the purchase.  The camera was easy to setup, has a big, bright LCD screen, and takes a great picture.  Most importantly, it's easy enough for a 5 year old to pick it up pretty quickly.  It does a lot more than she'll need at this point, but it's a camera she'll be able to grow into.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sams 8th Birthday Present", "Author": "Judy", "ReviewID": "R1OC9MRALXKRC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sam loves his camera.
