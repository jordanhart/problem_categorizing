Harris", "ReviewID": "R3IOGYMSZ6ZDZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These are great drop in replacements for the Sony ActionCam line.  They look the same as the Sony battery.  I can't say how they perform because I haven't really used them much yet, so I can't say if it has the same capacity as the Sony, but it did work out of the box and both batteries were fairly full upon arriaval (per the meter on the camera).  Charger works well with these and the original Sony Battery, which is a plus as you can't use the camera and charge with the stock/factory setup.  The external charge is a nice bonus.I'll update when I've had a chance to fully use these and see if they preform as hoped.  So far, so good.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "very satisfied.", "Author": "Gregory D.
