Lower noise can be clearly seen if comparing regular and superior mode.Wide angle lens great if your subjects are not too close to the corners.Choice of 2 movie modes (AVCHD and MP4).  I prefer MP4 because it is more compatible with editing applications.3D looks great when you can capture it correctly, but it is very tricky and difficult to master.Smile detection works really well.  It never misses.  But the result sometimes looks strange because the subject's mouth is still moving when the picture is taken.CONS:Compression artifacts even in photos taken in broad daylight.  Makes the photos look noisy even at lowest ISO.Does not auto focus when Movie button is pressed.  If focus is set too close and you need to quickly record a movie by pressing the Movie button, the entire movie will be out of focus. It focuses just fine when in Movie Mode. This comment was just about the Movie button frequently not working well with movie auto focus.No movie pause button.  You have to start/stop recording, no way to pause while you change positions and then resume. Forced to waste time editing later.NO settings for compression ratio (Fine, SuperFine, etc).  No setting for Saturation (Vivid, Natural, Black and White).  Compression and saturation are basic settings that all other cameras possess but somehow this one misses it.Extreme distortion at 24mm wide angle.Panoramic mode forces you to do 180+ degrees. No way to make a lesser degree panoramaTerrible (really) automatic white balance.  *** This camera takes awesome photos in dim lighting. That is great. But the white balance will be WAY OFF. NO RAW mode to help correct this***I guess they focused too much on the sensor and forgot include a decent flash.  Everything looks washed out.Movies shot in dim to modest lighting are too dark.Why couldn't they do 1920x1080 for MP4 mode?Very short battery life.  I get 50-100 photos with a bit of video.Cannot see exposure details unless screen brightness is also increased?  Who at sony thought of that setting?", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera!", "Author": "eeyorekjs7", "ReviewID": "R44PXZ7BHZP6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been searching for a new camera for a couple of months and was considering the TX1, W350 and T99. As soon as I read the specifications I knew this was the camera for me. I went to my local Sony store and one picture was all it took! It's amazing. At first when you look at the pictures, they kind of look different and then you realize it's because of the natural light. I've never had a camera that takes such true to life pictures. The panoramic feature is fun, but the pictures I took were a bit blurry. It's neat though to be able to take one picture of a whole room. The 3D is neat, but not the reason I bought the camera. The background defocus is great and makes for shots that look like they were taken with a DSLR. The video is simply fantastic! I highly doubt I'll use my flip video much now that I have this camera. In the first video I took, my kids were playing with a flashlight in low light and the video is perfect and you can see the light of the flashlight just like you would in person. It has a burst feature and is great for catching kids who change their expression quickly. The only con I have found so far is that there is sometimes a bit of shutter lag and it doesn't write to the stick as fast as I would like, but I couldn't find another camera in this price range that was any quicker. There is a red eye reduction feature that can be turned off (my son always looks away after the first flash and then you miss the picture) and it retains that selection even after you turn the camera off. I took some pictures of a piece of jewelry without flash and the quality of the shot was amazing and not blurry at all. The quality of this camera is fantastic! I have only had it for a few days, but at this point I highly recommend it.

Feinberg \"techboy\"", "ReviewID": "R27ONCIAP5K2EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last month I purchased the Sony DSC-TX7. Before I opened the box I did a little research. I found out that within three weeks Sony was coming out with a replacement...the TX9.The newer features included a 3D mode, a better touchscreen, and improved panoramic mode. So when it arrived at the Sony Style store, I made my way over there to buy it. I returned home with the new Sony DSC-WX5.I immediately fell I. Love with the WX5. It did everything that the TX9 did, sans the 3.5 touchscreen...something that I really didn't care about. First of all, the WX5 is smaller than the TX9...but a bit thicker. It's built like a tank. It also sports a much faster lens, the G-Series F2.4 with a 5x zoom.You simply can't believe the low light shots that this camera produces...without noise. The 2.8\" screen is brilliant, with about 460,000 pixels. You also don't have to drill down into many menus to change settings, like on the touchscreen.I understand that the sensor is small, but this is a camera that fits in my pocket and will be with me all day. A d the low light capabilities are si ply amazing. This is the best ultra-compact on the market. I'm just tired of cRying aroung a big DSLR. Sure they take great pics, but you just hate lugging them around.For $299, this a great camera...and an absolute ball to use.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A smarter and smaller brother of my Hx5v with 3D", "Author": "S. Sze", "ReviewID": "R2W13ZDDGPBUIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought an Hx5v in May (see my other review) and has been happy with it after almost 6 months of usage. My folks were impressed by the pictures and videos I could capture with the camera and I've decide to get the WX5 for them. Since they have been using a SD870 I've also tried to look into the SD 4000 ( with f2.0 lens) and SD4500 (10x zoom but no wide-angle) but the combo of 1sweep panorama, f/2.4 with 24mm wide angle 5x zoom lens plus backlit CMOS and my experience with the Hx5v kind of steer my decision.Out of the box I found the camera somewhat smaller than even the SD870. The buttons are on the smaller size which we have to get used to but compare to my hx5v Sony has moved the microphone closer to the top center of the camera so unlike the Hx5v it's less easy to be blocked by the fingers. I've also noticed they have moved the Burst mode button away from the on/off switch - which was easily confused in the Hx5v since they were so close together.Picture and video quality seems to be on Par with my hx5v. I found it delightful to have a \"defocus\" mode that i can use with the \"Focus Track\" function which helps me to take pictures with different levels of field of depth. The f2.4 lens helps but the mode just make me more confident in getting the pictures the way I want.3D features as mentioned by other reviewers is a \" wow\" factor but until I have another way to view them on bigger screen it's still just a fun trick I use to show off my camera. Just a note, the 3D, as well as some other features in this camera still takes some practices and determination to use before you can get good result. (1 sweep panorama, iAuto+, etc)One thing that i wish this camera would have besides GPS geotagging is to give me some way to manually adjust aperture and shutter speed. Without that I have to totally rely on the \"smartness\" of the camera but my experience with the hx5v auto mode has not met my expectation at times.  I'm hoping to pose a few pictures later this week before my folks get it in their hands for good. I think this would be a nice upgrade for them from their 3 years old SD870", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb Low Light Performer", "Author": "intellectually_stupid \"iisgenius\"", "ReviewID": "R1CCKXO3K3WZ0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I bought this camera to shoot in low light situations and I tell ya, it delivers! I have a Canon EOS 60D and I hate lugging it around with me when taking indoor or low light shoots. I have been looking for a P&S; camera with excellent lowlight images and this happens to be the best one. I have not used the movie mode or other shooting modes. My main concern is only the low light shooting. I also bought the Panasonic DMZ-ZR3 due to its glowing review including its low light shooting capabilities but it did not deliver. It had very poor IQ under low light shooting.. very poor.This is the P&S; I have been looking for. EXCELLENT CAMERA! Note: I don't care about the zoom (5x). What I care about is the Image Quality.UPDATE - 1/13/11 - I went to Disneyland on New Year's Eve and took a video of the Parade. The video quality is excellent! It is as good as a high end camcorder.. it is simply amazing in 1080p or even 720p. The only draw back is the battery life. I brought an extra battery to make sure.. and I am glad I did.

Pictures turn out sharp and clear and vibrant..find the Superior Auto Adjustment is suitable for about 50 of the pictures I take. Have read about where some people will complain about lack of manual adjustments...well heck I am 64 and this is far from my first digital camera (1999 Kodak) and if I have to take the time to adjust this and that I probably missed the moment. Night time shots and very low light are spectacular..much better than some I have taken with my DSLR. Fits in a shirt or inside jacket pocket with no problem. The background defocus is a great feature and have captured some interesting pictures..the panoramic mode is fantastic as you can capture from left to right and right to left and vertical and horizontal also. Then this little gem takes really great video..you will get a slight motor noise when zooming..but not objectionable in my opinion and the results in 1080i are remarkable for a sub $300 camera..not as good as my Panasonic HDC-TM700K..but it did not cost $999 either and the Panny will not fit in my shirt pocket.

It's quick, loaded with features, and the picture quality is some of the best I've ever seen out of a point and shoot. It performs admirably in low light. Especially using the Superior Auto mode. Only thing I would say is that the color saturation is a little lacking in some instances and some of the pictures look a little \"cold\". I would even venture to say that at its best, the photo quality is slightly better than the Canon Powershot S90, although the Canon has a definite edge when it comes to color saturation in photos. The battery life is mediocre. I also wish it had a longer zoom range. The camera is also quite compact in size so no problems there.It's not perfect (no point and shoot is).

Let me tell you the picture quality of the little Casio camera is excellent. It is only 5MP but for our needs (we don't print posters or crop a lot) it was just fine. I just wanted to add a good HD video capability into a small and compact point and shot camera like the Casio. The first camera that I tested was the Canon SD-1400. What a disappointment. The camera is small and sexy but the number of blurred pictures was so big and the overall picture quality was not really good. The HD video was just fine but you could not use the zoom. Returned the camera for a refund.Then I tested the Panasonic DMC-ZR3. The Panasonic was just a bit bigger than the Canon but with 8X zoom that can be used on the HD video. Picture quality was good overall and pictures were always on focus, but the main problem was the horrible low light performance of this camera. The flash seems not powerful enough. Also, not so important, but a factor, the camera is compact indeed, but not-ultra compact and it looks a bit awkward and boxy. Went back to Amazon too as there was no way i could keep it, although I tried hard.Finally after more research, I found the Sony Cybershot DSC-WX5. I found the answer to all my needs. It is small and very compact that was an important need and will always take clear pictures. Indoors and specially in low lights situations, the Sony will perform really good. Although I got it on sale, the Sony was about $80 more than the Panasonic and Canon I tested. My rational was that I'm buying a camera that i hope o use for some years and paying the extra money will not bother me if I really can meet my needs. Picture quality is outstanding both indoors and outdoors. The camera shoots HD video in 1080i and stereo, something that is not really common for an ultra compact camera. HD video quality is really good. The camera uses a Cmos sensor instead of the regular CCD sensor that uses most compact cameras. For the video is really important as with CCD if you have a strong light in your shooting area, it will make a vertical white line in your video. With Cmos you don't have that Although the 5X zooms is enabled during video shooting, the motor is noticeable during zooming in a quiet environment. Not a huge negative but it is indeed a negative. Another negative is the battery life. The battery is very small and if you shoot a lot of video, expect it not to last long. I was in a party and took about 60 pictures plus around 10 HD videos of 3 min average and the battery was almost empty already. I will certainly get a backup one. You can get a generic replacement on Amazon for around $11 and an extended life one with double the capacity for around $18. It looks like a must for this camera if you plan to shoot a lot of video.The camera has also other capabilities as the 3D which I didn't test yet (you need a 3D TV) and the sweep panorama mode that will automatically stitch frames for you creating a panoramic picture in your camera without the need of an external software.All in all, this camera is a great buy and exactly what i was looking for.

I recommend leaving the dial in a photo mode and just use the dedicated video button.-no option to view photo details without maxing out the lcd backlight, increasing battery drain-on cloudy days the pictures look very under-saturated (compared to panasonic ZS3)-the sweep panorama feature does a decent job of stitching but by design will never be able to make excellent pictures. No camera can take good full resolution pictures while you are swinging the camera around. So the camera basically is taking a bunch of reduced resolution pictures at high speed to stitch together. Which brings me to my next point....-There is no way to lock exposure for multiple still shots so you can make your own really nice full resolution panoramas with a free stitching program like \"Hugin\" Otherwise this is a really great snapshot camera. The hand held twilight mode is very nice and effective. Superior auto works very well and is my go-to mode for a quick snap. The multi-angle 3d pics look very cool The high dynamic range mode does not seem very effective at all. It only uses 2 pictures to stack. The video is super sharp but the image stabilizer struggles a bit especially when you zoom or are videoing a moving object like a train. The battery life seemed terrible at first but after cycling the battery a couple times it seems much more reasonable. Plus you can pick up a spare battery for a few bucks from a popular auction website, you know the one I mean.

Here are my thoughts:Photo Quality: Excellent!  Very clear photos with minimal noise and coloring that is pleasing but not overly saturated.  Low light performance is as advertised!!  The Exmor CMOS sensor combined with the multiple low light scene modes produce near flawless natural light photos.  The flash also performs well with no red eye and proper exposure level.  I bought this camera primarily to improve upon the poor low light performance and flash overexposure in my Lumix ZS3.  The WX5 did not disappoint!Video Quality: Again, excellent.  Sound and video quality is on par with most full fledged camcorders and superior to ultra compact camcorders.  The Sony TX9 is perhaps slightly better for video due to the frontal mic placement (rather than on top, as with the WX5) and the TX9's completely silent zoom mechanism.  However, the WX5 still does an admirable job in the video department.Features: At the moment, I don't think there is a more fully featured camera for this price.  The \"hand held twilight\" and \"iSweep panorama\" are incredibly useful and fun!!  Other essentials include HDMI out, better resolution screen than previous models, and adoption of multiple memory formats.Ease of Use: Super simple.  I prefer the hardware controls on this model over similar touchscreen models (TX9).  Needs more manual controls, but the numerous scene modes largely make up for this.Hardware: The body and overall design is very nice with an upscale feel from the metallic finish.  This camera is extremely small, lightweight, and eminently pocketable!Final Thoughts: I think Sony has produced an ideal point and shoot camera.  It has that perfect combination of ease of use with superb image and video quality in almost any situation.

Each Sony camera we tried did the same thing but we just wanted to keep trying it with different models to see if it would change! Unfortunately it didn't and we exchanged it once again for a Canon sd3500 which doesn't take great low light pictures at all but every other time of day the pictures are comparable to the Sony quality minus the fishbowl! The Canon also has a pretty great touch screen! If you don't notice the fishbowl in your pictures with the Sony then this is sure to be a great camera.

I SPOKE TO SOON. STOP BUYING THE SONY DSC-WX5. The lens already is broken after only 24 days. I tried brought back to Camera Wholesalers in Stamford, CT and they \"fixed\" it and got the Sony DSC-WX5 camera and was going like a cuckoo clock with the lens until it got stuck. There is a design flaw in the Sony DSC-WX5, specifically the Sony G Lens and the motor which causes it to stop functioning properly. #FAILSTRONGLY SAY YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. Didn't even last 24 days until it broke. Unless you want to waste your money, DO NOT BUY this camera.#FAIL #FAIL #FAILThis camera is everything I want. The WOW factor is the 3-D images. People are constantly amazed by the fact that a camera is able to take 3-D pictures and then display a preview of them right there. Second, is the CMOS sensor that allows the camera to take clearer pictures. This picture of my cat h[...] was taken at ISO 2000 in low-light. It still looks great. Finally, the WX5 is able to use \"Superior Mode\" by taking up to 6 pictures and then stitching them together. The result is a HDR image right there in your camera without post-processing. It could be considered the \"Holy Grail\" of point-n-shoot. See the example of this image [...]. A sunflower taken at sunset. Macro sunset photography is possibly the trickiest thing out there but notice how the photo came out.This is definitely a buy for anyone interested in getting an OUTSTANDING camera.
