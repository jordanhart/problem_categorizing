Amazon did a great job at getting the product to me extremely quickly. The setup for this system is really simple based on the fact of siamese cable (BNC & power) being bundled with the package. In other words you have everything you need to get going. However after everything was setup was where I started to see issues. The main problems I experienced were:1) Cam resolution is very low2) DVR kept shutting down without warning or reason3) DVR resolution is low (352x which is then interpolated to full screen)4) 2 cameras died after a day or twoNeedless to say you unfortunately seem to get what you pay for. To put it in perspective a full D1 (720x resolution) DVR would set you back at least $500 by itself with individual cameras (decent quality like CNB etc) being $200 each plus cables etc. So with that said as long as you don't expect high quality capture, great night vision then you may be okay with this. Similarly you can always by this as a starter set then switch out the cams however my major concerns were with the quality of the product after some of the issues seen which is what forced me to return this (bad DVR and 2 cams).Would recommend looking elsewhere unless your needs are very basic.Also of note finally is the Mobile Phone view and remote view. You can watch the cams remotely via iPhone as long as you use a 3rd party Apple Store App and have remote access to your DVR (use Dynamic DNS to set this up). For remote view (using an Internet browser) you must have one that supports ActiveX so anyone using a MAC you will either need you use Parallels or Fusion with Windows and IE or move to a PC to accomplish this.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy setup Security System", "Author": "David F.

I hooked up a $300 camera from work and the DVR did show and record much better picture, but again for a price.  Over the Internet work very well. All in all, I'm happy for the price/performance of the system!

Harty", "ReviewID": "R6X1KH1TWKK7J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this security system for my store that I'm opening and needed a system that fit the rest of my budget. I'm not one that has super high expectations for a $400 security system, but you truly get what you pay for.It seems that I got the only system in the bunch that has some defects. For instance, one of the cameras keeps flickering out and the night vision doesn't work after 10 or so minutes, resulting in the DVR resetting/freezing. Speaking of which, the DVR randomly restarts and takes a few minutes to boot back up. I'm not sure if I just got a lemon, or the quality of the product is poor, but the DVR definitely doesn't feel very durable.Also, the manual and BIOS seem to be written by a kid who just learned to speak English, and after applying some of the limited options, you are greeted with just one button to select --> which says \"Sure\" instead of \"OK\" or \"Exit\". <-- That might be a little trivial, but it just feels unprofessional on top of navigating the clunky BIOS.I've tried looking for the contact details for the manufacturer regarding warranty information, but the best I could find was an email address.Some of the things that I DO like, however, are that the cameras themselves feel heavy enough to throw through a window and still be okay (Even though one of my cameras is defective).The night vision is indeed more than I expected and the video resolution seems to be good too.All in all, I would probably not recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable solution, especially since you have to buy some extra parts (flash drive, monitor) if you ever need to put an incident onto a computer to be burned to disk. The DVR keeps resetting and freezing at random intervals, and you just never know if when it decides to do that you're risking the loss of any video evidence you might of otherwise obtained from a different unit.It gets the job done, but don't expect something that will last forever.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "security camera", "Author": "Keven in FLA", "ReviewID": "R3ULEDVD8TB8XD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Okay system, running the wires can be a big hassle (this is not the systems fault).

The DVR has a very small hdd at 320G, but was adequate for one camera. Later when I hooked up all four, it was too small. The unit is supposed to handle up to 1T but it would not work on anything larger than 500G. I tried both 750G and 1T Seagate drives, neither would work. The drive is also too hard to remove, it should be plug-in so that you can remove it and put another in.The software is a joke with a very poor user interface. Backup is to the USB port (it supposedly will write to a CD, but that is worthless - too small) and at 6 files at a time, followed by 'Next' etc as many times as you need, it will do as many as there is available for the day selected. However, if something goes wrong, the selections are deleted so you have to reselect every one of them again. The selections for search and settings is very strange, but you get used to it. If you have a LAN (hardwired), the live feed is remotely available as is backup, but inexplicably the remote backup is limited to one file at a time - how ridiculous is that?The ActiveX control needed for remote access of the feed does not work on Windows 7 64 bit. The fix is to disable uac - how ridiculous is that? It turns out that you can use a program from Q-See called MultiClient. I was able to get it to work and it does well except that it still allows only one backup file at a time!You should hide the DVR so that it cannot be easily molested by anyone breaking into your place. The wires for the cameras should be in the walls if possible. There are heavy-duty lockable boxes available to put the DVR into. Using the LAN to interact with the DVR makes more sense for my installation. If you want the DVR to not have problems, put the system on a battery backup (425 watts is big enough) to keep it from losing power and restarting all of the time. It also should be surge protected. Such a battery backup is about $40. A thief can't just turn off your power to stop recording.Other odd things, the IR remote control is absurd, totally unintuitive. Also, if the mouse is plugged in, the unit refuses to allow use by remote access. The settings are not all available using remote access - you have to connect to some kind of display such as a TV or VGA monitor in order to setup or modify much of the settable items. How ridiculous is that?The video cameras are relatively weak. They aged fairly rapidly in that they worked pretty well at 30' in zero light but went to as little as 10' after just a few months of use. However, they are clear in good light. You can tell who you are looking at.The power supply for the 12 vdc cameras is too weak and needs to be replaced by a more powerful regulated power supply. Of course, all of the cameras need to be connected to the same battery backup to allow them to continue to operate when the power quits.The unit uses a proprietary H.264 which is readable only by certain playback software. It can be converted to avi, but the resulting conversion is very pixellated. There needs to be some way to copy the drive information directly to a computer or to a DVD so that storage backup can be faster.I also had trouble with the date getting changed to some default. I never discovered why it did that, but suddenly all of the files were not available. I noticed that the recent recording was being done to a date sometime before the current date. All I had to do was restart with the date right and reformat the drive.For my use, this device is a reasonably inexpensive, reliable and useful piece of equipment that does everything that I needed to have done.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T", "Author": "K.

It took a while before I had time to install the cameras and DVR. I ran one little problem during the installation. The package content specified in the Quick Start Guide did not match the content in the box. I thought that I was missing the 12V camera power adapter. Little did I know that the DVR configuration had changed and that power to the cameras was directly provided from a 12V outlet at the back of the DVR.Note that the box does not include any cables to connect the DVR to a TV or Computer monitor. I had to order a BNC to RCA cable to connect the DVR to my TV monitor.The DVR user guide is not very clear on how to setup remote web access to the DVR. It took quite some time and internet research to figure this out. The DDNS option programmed via the GUI did not manage to provide the updated dynamic WAN IP address to DynDNS. At the end I had to set up DynDNS through my Belkin wireless router.The camera and DVR video quality is very average. You can watch a human being captured on video via the LTS cameras, however it is not possible to distinguish details of the person (e.g. the face) captured on video.The LTS DVR requires Windows ActiveX control to be installed for the remote internet access. This add-on is automatically downloaded and installed once this is granted by the user. However the LTS ActiveX controle used is not designed to run on Windows Vista (installed on my desktop) and Windows 7 (installed on my notebook). This limits the remote playback of record videos. I was constantly receiving the cryptic message prompt \"Create File Failed\". This issue was reported via email to the LTS Support. LTS Support (which does report prompt on support requests) informed me via e-mail that this was a known issue on Windows Vista and Windows 7 could be circumvented by downgrading the security level on the PC by turning off the User Account Control (UAC) in Windows. This option did not appeal very much to me because of implication of the lower security settings on my PC. LTS Support mentioned not having any intent in supporting Windows Vista or Windows 7.I setup both user and admin security on my LTS DVR Security System. Indeed onsite login attempts failed when using incorrect passwords to login. However, remote internet access still allows login without password. And even allows for modification of the DVR settings. This issue was reported to LTS Support. Information provided by LTS Support (again very fast response) was that the remote internet access security needed to be setup via the IE web browser. The setup via direct (usb mouse) access to the DVR only limited the onsite direct access to the DVR. This was not mentioned in the documentation.I did setup e-mail notification on the DVR which worked fine for a while, but suddenly for unknown reason now is no longer working. This however suited me fine as I felted bothered by the number of e-mails being sent by the very sensitive system.A down side of the LTS DVR is that it only allows remote access via mobile phone if your mobile is based on the Windows Mobile OS or Symbian OS (Nokia). Iphone remote access is only offered via a third party app. No remote access is offered for Android or Blackberry smart phones.Before making my choice to buy the LTS DVR I had contemplated the $100 more expensive Defender SN502-4CH-002. Both DVR systems seemed to have similar features at the time, so I choose for the lower priced LTS DVR.My recommendation: do not buy the LTS LTD04HTSK 4-Camera H.264 Realtime DVR Security System, for 100 buck extra you can buy the Defender SN502-4CH-002, which has better reviews and includes the required TV/Monitor cables (don't have to order that separately) and also seems to provide better support for remote viewing using your IPhone, Blackberry, Nokia or Windows Mobile Phone. The manuals of the Defender (downloadable from the Defender web site) seem to provide better information than the crappie manual provided by LTS. I could find whether the Defender provides remote viewing of the recorded videos without having to downgrade the security on the PC.Update (April 4, 2011):Have been using the system more than a year now. Made several attempts to make e-mail notification work. However, no luck. Called LTS support and followed their support instructions to the letter. Called again. LTS blamed the e-mail issues on my firewall. However my firewall is setup to block inbound traffic, not outbound traffic.Have signed up for service with DynDNS.org and can see my updated IP address remotely. However have to reboot the DVR every day in order to obtain access via internet.Have purchased a new DVR from iCatch (will receive this soon). Have purchased a power adapter for the LTS cameras as I plan to re-use these with the iCatch system (the LTS cameras were powered via an 12V output from the LTS DVR). The iCatch DVR had good customer reviews on Amazon; hopefully I will have more success with this DVR.
