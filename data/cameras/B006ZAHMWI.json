My first attempts at re-sizing produced fuzzy photos but I finally figured out  how to re-size easily - open the photo with Paint, and resize down to 1200 x 800.  Once I figured that out, the photos I put on Facebook were much sharper.  I experimented a lot taking pictures in every type of light and found that using the Automatic settings seems to work best in 95% of situations.  However, for taking photos of flowers close up, I use Program, Super Macro and they are truly superb.  I have no complaints.  Now, I paid less than $80 for this camera, and I'm sure a better camera would take better photos.  BUT, I have to say that it is really perfectly adequate for my needs.  Just be sure and read the manual because there are settings you can use for the beach, snow, night time, moving objects, low light, etc. and you'll get more out of the camera if you are familiar with the different settings.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value & Easy to Use, But Very Bad Nighttime Photos", "Author": "C. Clay \"drakkar91\"", "ReviewID": "RMHFRVTEXRYZE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was replacing an old Kodak Easyshare, so at $80, this camera seemed like a steal. It's easy to setup, offers 720HD video with sound (and it's good quality), but it can't take a night picture (such as a cityscape) to save it's life. I've tried every setting in both manual and automatic modes, and you have to take 5 or 6 photo's to possibly get 1 good one that is clear. For photo's in light, no problem! The image in your nice size LCD for night photo's is the one I desire, but never the one I get. Battery life is very good, including when you use video. The video feature is easy to use, BUT, you must zoom in or out BEFORE you start the video recording. Once recording, you cannot zoom. It is a great deal, but if I had to do it all over again I would make sure the camera could take night pictures, and that the video featured zoom while recording. Again, great deal, easy to use, but 1 or 2 major flaws.  Simply because of the inability to take a good night shot, I would not recommend to a friend to get one.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a cheap supercompact", "Author": "varnav", "ReviewID": "R3SYFMFN5JCOTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I lost my DSLR on vacation and needed a fast cheap replacement.

The MAIN reason I picked this camera over many other possibles was this camera's ability for Macro photography using a point and shoot.  It also has a great wide angle capable lens, a fast deployment when the power button is pushed, great colors on photos, and easty to use controls!  The rechargable battery is saving me a ton of money on the throw away lithium batteries in my old pt. and shoot camera (at $12 per 4 batts.).  This new Olympus camera uses 4gig memory chips and I typically have set the picture size lower end of the scale for most of my work.

I've just started to set it up and use it so can't really evaluate it fully.This camera is similar to others in it's class. It seems a bit flimsy, but that is probably because I'm used to the old type of camera. If you read the manual it will seem like this camera is complicated to use, but it really isn't. You can set it to just work automatically if you want. If you like to fiddle with settings you can do this too.What made me get this camera over another similar one is that you can charge the battery, using an AC adapter supplied) with a supplied USB cable, without having to remove the battery from the camera. With the other camera you had to remove the battery to recharge it this way. You can also recharge the battery by connecting it to your computer with the USB cable, but this takes much longer.A few suggestions:1.  Before  purchasing or receiving the camera I would download the manual from the Olympus Website. It gives you an idea of what it is like. Also, the camera comes with a \"quick start\" guide which is a bit hard to read.2.  This camera needs a media card which is not supplied. When you buy the camera from Amazon it suggests you purchase a media card at the same time and this I would urge you to do. It needs a certain type so you can check that with manual you downloaded. Amazon does show the correct card. I purchased one that is a 16GB SDHC Transcend Flash Memory Card.3.  Amazon also suggests that you buy a case and this is also listed with the camera. I bought the case that was listed. The case is good because it will protect the viewing screen on back of the camera. By buying all three at once you save the shipping charge on the less expensive items.4.  The camera comes with a CD-Rom. You don't need it for the drivers as your computer will get the drivers when you plug into it with the USB cable. It does supply two programs to manage your pictures. I did install these, but they are not needed if you have other image editing software. The camera shows as a disc on your computer and you can just drop and drag the images to your own custom folder and go from there. I did install the programs mentioned, but have not used them yet. You can always install them and remove them later.5.  The most useful feature of the CD-Rom is that you can use it to register your camera online.6.  The CD also will download a full manual which is the same as the one downloaded from the Olympus website.7.  The camera is about the size of a playing card and not very thick so it is easy to carry around. The buttons are small, but it is no problem to use them.8.  In summary I'm pretty sure I will like this camera as I get used to it. I will help if you have a dog who likes her picture taken when taking pictures of her. Mine doesn't, but the camera also works as a video camera, so you might be able to catch them that way. No problem if your dog or cat will stay still.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "C. D.

So this time I looked for a small camera that was very easy to use.  I took a chance with the VG-160 because of the good reviews on Amazon.  I added an eye-fi card so that the photos could be transferred to her computer automatically.  Thus far the camera is meeting my wife's needs.  We like its small size, sleek appearance, quick operation and simple easy-to-use controls.  Image quality is very good, especially outdoors.  The only thing we don't care for is its flash - it's underpowered - but so is the flash of most small cameras.  To counter this I set the camera to flash off and the resulting pictures are better than when the flash was used.My wife and I recently visited our daughter and, after my wife took a several pictures, my daughter announced that she'd like one too as a Christmas present.A good camera and a great bargain at $79.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yes!", "Author": "Spittix", "ReviewID": "R3NC9QVH4L1EX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome point and shoot camera and a good price.

I do have a list of pro's and con's I can offer. I also must suggest to purchase a warranty and will explain why below.Pros:1.) High quality for the price! I expected plastic with a lens and was proven wrong.2.) Videos - I film reviews for beauty products and shots are always clean, crisp and smooth. Volume picks up great.3.) Pictures - Like the video, the images are crisp, with a vast variety of options/settings such as flash and filters.4.) Lightweight - I hate bulky things and this camera fits well in my hands. It's sturdy but not heavy.5.) It turns on and off so quickly. It's quicker than the camera on my cell phone which is useful for spur of the moment shots.6.) You can rewind and fast forward videos while they are still on the camera. I was stunned by this.7.) You can zoom in and out of images already taken while they are still on the camera.8.) It's very easy to use! The screen is large and the interface is simple to learn.9.) Customer Service/Technical Support was helpful, friendly and functioning. I had to call them for an issue, which can be found in the cons below, but it should be known that Olympus has good customer service.Cons:1.) THE CAMERA FROZE. I had the camera a week and was taking pictures. Once I was finished I hit the off button and the screen went black but did not turn off. It stayed illuminated, with the lens extended and it clicked every so often. I had to call technical support to resolve the issue, which was a simple \"remove the battery for a moment.\" While it was a simple fix, it did happen, and I think it should be known. This is why I suggest purchasing a warranty.2.) The camera gets hot while filming videos. I filmed a 22 minute video straight and the camera was significantly heated. I suggest not filming for too long without giving the little thing a break. It's a minor flaw but it is there and should be known.3.) Battery life isn't all that great. If you want to use this camera to film a day trip, don't expect much from it. I filmed about 40 minutes in low quality and it sucked the battery dry and died unexpectedly on me. For 720P filming, I get even less from the battery.4.) While you can zoom in and out, you cannot zoom in and out during videos and it diminishes the quality of the images taken. If you want a close-up shot in a video, you will have to zoom in before starting the video. This is a bummer because you will have to stop filming and start again if you want to show something up close. Also, if you zoom in to take a picture, the quality of the picture significantly worsens. It looks cloudy and doesn't focus.5.) Depending on the quality you film in, you can only get a certain amount of minutes total you can film. I don't like having a limited about of time to film but it does count down how much time you have left, so this isn't a deal breaker for me. (I have learned that the time limit might be longer if your SD card has more memory.)6.) You need to purchase an SD card (the large type, not the micro SD) for memory or you cannot use the camera. Perhaps this is obvious to other digital camera owners, but it wasn't to me as a first time buyer. You need to make a separate purchase in addition to the camera in order to store your videos/images. I have a 2GB SD card in my camera and it has been enough for me. If you want to take longer videos (my 2GB SD card can do a maximum of 47 minute low quality filming, 9 minute 720P filming) I suggest buying a larger SD card. Videos take up a great deal of memory.Overall - 4/5Is this a good camera? It's a great camera. Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes. It has its quirks, which mainly depend on what you will use the camera for. The quality you receive for the price is fantastic, but the battery life is a little scarce, the camera gets hot if used for a long period of time (20 minutes) and it froze on me (once) while trying to turn it off. If you need a low price camera, this is a great buy, just invest in the warranty in case it has any problems that can't be fixed by removing the battery.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "simply to uses", "Author": "Disciple1", "ReviewID": "R1QL68P4YIA4ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good camera very lite easy to carry easy to down load pic, great zoon up 5 times.  good for e-bay pic", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent 'point and shoot' camera; the videos from this camera are easy to take and outstanding!", "Author": "Ruella Yates", "ReviewID": "RKNNV7OSXZC0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Olympus digital camera does both still photos and videos with clarity and ease!

I had the previous olympus pocket digital camera, and it was so much better than this.  Every time you take a picture with this camera it has to \"think\" for a much longer time than any other digital camera I've ever used, before it will allow you to take another picture.  The zoom doesn't seem to work properly with the video feature.  And incredibly annoying - there's a two minute limit on video.  After 2 minutes, it stops videoing, and you can't just merely press the button for it to start again, because it has to think for a very long time before it is done processing.  It stinks.  My phone, which wasn't an expensive one, takes much better pictures and video without any of the excruciating processing time to wait through.  The camera was a total waste of my money and I'm pretty annoyed about it.Update: Now that I've taken pics OFF my phone, I see that it wasn't accurate to say those photos are better than the camera.

My only remaining choice is to have the camera packed and returned to them by a UPS store (their requirement).  The nearest UPS store is 30 miles away.

I was replacing a similar ( I thought) Olympus that had worked great for me.  I'm actually on here now only because I was checking amazon's return policy.  Unfortunately I'm past 30 days before I really used it enough to discover the problems.  First, the picture quality doesn't look very good --  the flash doesn't always light up the subject, even in the same room and at the same distance.  I've had to delete so many pictures.  The operation of the camera is not intuitive to me.  At first, I was accidentally shooting video when I just wanted a photo.  Still don't really know what I was doing wrong.  And you absolutely need to add a memory card, it only holds about 10 pictures without it.  I do like the big viewing window and the orange color, but that's about it.  I don't think I'll order a camera again without first physically checking it out in a store.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work with Apple Macintosh computers, only PCs!", "Author": "Mary Holtman \"editor extraordinaire\"", "ReviewID": "R2U1EMKTXCUCDV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very excited about this camera when I received it, only to discover that its software only works on PCs, not on Apple Macintosh (Mac) computers!

It never stops, not even when we're shooting video and the noise is being recorded. It is really annoying and detracts from what we'd actually like to record.I contacted Amazon who immediately sent out a replacement which is doing the very same thing right out of the box.Am I just getting cameras from a faulty batch, or is this normal for cameras today or is this a setting issue that I need to adjust?If I'm able to remedy this problem, I'll update my rating to 4 stars.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "BONITA Y FUNCIONAL", "Author": "YADIMAR", "ReviewID": "R2UKM97SF9BSJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MUY CONTENTA CON MI CAMARA ES PERFECTA PARA LO QUE LA NECESITO ES BELLA PEQUE\u00d1A COMPACTA Y EL PRECIO MUY RAZONABLE ME LLEGO A TIEMPO LA RECOMIENDO A Y ES OLYMPUS", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nothing worked and they wouldnt replace only refunded.", "Author": "Ruth Ann Marie Purvee", "ReviewID": "R1XKTMEI7BTNVO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered camera on my Prime because I was going out of town.
