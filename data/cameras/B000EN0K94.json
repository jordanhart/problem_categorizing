Wilson \"wilson99\"", "ReviewID": "R13MW6EPXKWOSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon SD700-IS Compact PowerShot Digital Elph Serial No. 2628105xxx: One of the reasons that Canon as an enterprise excels in this new world of Digital Compact Cameras, is that they have the ability to move the technology that has been refined in their flagship professional equipment, to the semi-pro or consumer gear, and on down to their \"pocket cameras.\" This camera is an excellent example of Canon bringing over several very important Pro features. The most obvious is the large, clear, high resolution LCD display; a similar display used in Canon's $4000 pro equipment. The other important feature is the use of their effective Image Stabilization, IS. Many of the reviews I have read recently do not give full credit or understanding of this very important \"candid\" photographic tool. When using this camera with IS switched on, one has the ability of taking good shots at 1/15 sec or even lower, assuming that your subject is not moving. Many shots can be taken with out the Flash. Read the manual packed with the camera and experiment with this feature; you will be surprised at how powerful and easy to use this feature is.For those wanting to know detailed features go to Phil Askey's site:[...]For those wanting a quick & dirty review plus see some unedited images:[...]This camera has a WOW factor for any class of user. I have used and/or own the best Canon digitals and this camera adds to a great line-up of cameras. As a teaching Pro, I for one like the strong flash, and the IS feature. Another feature I like is the Auto ISO feature. This is like committing heresy for a supposed Pro, wanting any AUTO features. Well too bad; sometimes, yes infrequently, I want to spend ALL my attention on the subject, and do not want any distractions with all these settings. I am a technology person, and read all the documentation two or three times. No matter, many sometimes I look for the Green Dot, telling me the camera is ready to AUTO expose and the Focus is spot-on ready... and I'll go full auto... It works well too. Some other notable features is the ability to turn on a GRID, superimposed on the LDC screen; this is very helpful if you are taking shots and desire to have the camera in synch with the horizon or an edge of a building. Another surprise feature, is when you are viewing shots, if you took a variety of portrait and landscape modes, when viewing shots, if you rotate the camera the image rotates automatically. What this means if you take a portrait shot, instead of seeing a much smaller thumbnail, just rotate the camera body and the portrait shot auto rotates to fill the LCD screen; very cool feature. The images shown are not fancy hand picked ones. They are straight from the camera with no editing whatsoever.In comparing the Canon SD700-IS (N) Compact PowerShot Digital Elph with SONY's DSC-T30, which are similarly sized, priced and featured, both cameras take great videos and snap-shots in a variety of circumstances. I would rate this as a tie-vote overall. Feature wise, the T30 does have their bright 3\" screen, and 7.2 million pixels, however, the SD700 (90 x 57 x 26 mm / 3.5 x 2.2 x 1 in) is 5mm shorter in overall size than the T30 at (95 x 57 x 23 mm /3.7 x 2.2 x 0.9 in); however, Canon's SD700 has a 4x zoom lens giving the equivalent of 35-140mm focal range. In shooting modes; the T30 is a bit more sensitive for low light images, having an ISO capability of Auto, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000 with the Canon having ISO capabilities of Auto, 80 ,100, 200, 400, 800. If you are into Macro modes, the T30 is a clear winner here in that it has two macro ranges letting you shoot to as close as 1cm. Also the focusing is superior at these close ranges, I had difficulty getting the Canon camera to focus at the point where I wanted it to focus, when taking the \"bug shots.\"  As I have stated before, picking a point-and-shoot camera is like buying sandals, a very personal choice. If you stick to the most popular brands (Canon, Sony, Nikon, Pentax, Panasonic, Casio) and buy a current new model, US$400/500; they all will take great shots once you are familiar with the controls, etc. Do not buy prior years' sale models. Too much is happening with digital, and 24 months (ago) is a whole generation in dog-years for cameras.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Powerful Punch in a Tiny Package", "Author": "Cameron Scholtz", "ReviewID": "R1MM367H3S9JUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quiet Operation Yields Top Quality Photos and Nice Videos.I've used my SD700 IS for several days now.  Before receiving it I was concerned about the reviews on Amazon that talked about the noisy video problem.  However, the first reviews were written before the camera was released in the US.  So I crossed my fingers.  I got my camera from Crutchfield.  (By the way, their custom service was excellent!)I have been unable to reproduce the noisy video problem.  My videos are *not* noisy and sound good (for a camera of this size).  I will say that if I turn up my computer's volume as loud as it will go...THEN there is some ambient background noise.  But the volume is extremely loud at that point and I expect a tiny microphone to have some noise when played back at such a high level.  For normal video shooting and playback, my SD700 sounds just great.  I've tested it with an without the image stabilization activated and the videos do not have any excess noise.  Also, my zoom is quiet!  Anyway, my experience with the camera obviously differs from others'.  Not sure if that helps you or not.As far as the picture quality, I am also happy.  Most of my shots so far have been indoors in the evening using the flash.  Color saturation is fine and flash coverage is really good.  (I'll upload some examples if I get a chance.)Hindsight being 20/20, I'm not sure the image stabilization is something I needed.  With a flash, it really isn't necessary and I've been an amateur photographer for many years so I know how to hold a camera.  I'm sure the IS will be handy if I'm ever in a situation when I'm taking photos from a moving car, or letting someone else use the camera.  But if I had to make the purchase all over again I'd probably get the SD600 or SD630 and save a few bucks.It has a slew of settings including ISO 800, focus lock, flash lock, custom exposure and slow shutter setting.  So although it lacks aperture and shutter priority there are still plenty of adjustments I can make in order to get a good shot (though this hasn't bee necessary so far).PLUSES:1. Looks beautiful and feels very solidly made when holding2. Fast startup, fast refresh (I'm using a SanDisk 1GB Ultra II SD card)3. Image Stabilization.4. Quiet operation.MINUSES:1. Does not come with a case.2. Does not have aperture or shutter priority modes.3. Does not record MPEG format (video) or RAW (photo).4.

Since deciding that my old S40 wasn't up to pair with the versatility and compact size that I needed, I looked on Canon's website to see what new cameras were on the market. I compared three basically similarly built cameras: Canon's SD600, SD630 and SD700. Wow! I thought. List price of $499 for a camera? With the only difference being an added viewfinder, the color variations on the body and image stabilization?Is this camera really worth it?Being a VERY touchy / feeling / must test something out in person kind of gal, I went to Costco and Ritz Camera before finding a floor model at Best Buy. There, I was able to compare the SD 700 with Sony's 8.1 megapixel contenders and Nikon's family of digital cameras. I poked. I prodded. I made movies. I rationalized. I bought it.I haven't looked back in regret since.This camera is a powerhouse: It's small, quick to start, and you can use digital zoom while recording in video mode.  The internal color filters while in SCN mode are a big plus: the less time I have to spend in Adobe Photoshop, the better.Plus, the SD700 can even fit into my smallest bag WITH my keys and my wallet. This feature alone makes me want to take it everywhere with me. You never know when opportunities to take photographs may arise. And yes, I actually DO like the fact that like the SD600, this camera has a viewfinder. Personally, I thought the size of the LCD screen in the SD630 was too large. The black contrast matting surrounding the preview LCD screen in the SD 700 is perfect and just right.Like Cameron below me, my zoom is quiet and I do not have a noisy video problem. You can change the exposure settings and shutter settings in limited variables. So far, this has not been a problem for me.This camera works great while synching with my iMac and iPhoto. If I had to do it all over again (including my week of internet research and in store questions) I'd choose this camera in a second. It has everything I wanted in my upgrade and I'm very satisfied with it.

Even setting the EV to 2 stops into darkness does't stop the camera from overexposing**No manual focus or ability to override focusing - which can be a real pain as sometimes it focuses on the wrong thing and there is no way to nudge the focus over to the right object** If you set the camera in macro/infinity mode, it goes back to automatic mode after taking one picture - most of the time (there seems to be a few seconds delay so if taking a number of shots in  quick succession, it will stay in macro/infinity, but the moment you pause to reacess the picture composition, it will slip back into automatic). This can be annoying, particularly in macro mode as I am frequently reassessing the image composition and suddenly find it can no longer focus 2cm from the flower and have to pull back and reapply the macro setting.**Problematic if wanting to take night images. I found the best way was to set the camera in fireworks mode, but there is no other real way to do a 'long' exposure to capture (say) a night skyline.I admit, I'm being picky because I have been using a digital camera which has manual override (Pentax Optio 750Z), but I wanted something that was even more compact and I guess somethings got sacrificed as a result. For the most part, this camera is an excellent little digital, will produce stunning results for people whether on automatic or 'manual' mode. The image stabiliser is superbe, particularly for those who are hesitant about always having 'shakey' hands.

These cameras just keep getting better and this was a significant upgrade over my last model. For me the killer new features that warranted an upgrade were image stabilization, a big, bright 2.5 inch screen, 6 mega pixel sensor, improved user interface and a 4X optical zoom. The zoom has made a big difference over the 3X of my old PowerShot. The extra zoom length makes candid portraits much easier and is perfect for shooting faces from a distance. The image stabalization is fantastic and I've got some great shots in low light without a flash. The screen is great, although it could use a higher resolution to match the bigger screen size - the resolution is the same as older models, only the physical size is larger.Two other big pluses I've found have been the battery life and card access times. I've still not had to recharge the battery after using the camera for 2 weeks and shooting over 300 shots - including a week on vacation with intensive shooting and reviewing. The access time for writing and reading from the SD card is excellent. I paired the camera with a Lexar Professional 1GB card and reviewing photos is instant. Shooting onto the card also seems instantaneous and the continuous shoot mode takes shots as quickly as a digital SLR. You can shoot a dozen portraits or action shots in a few seconds and then pick the best. Startup is also very quick, a complaint I had with older models. This camera has sub-second startup.The rounded design is also a nice break from the boxy build of its predicessors. Overall, I can't recommend this camera enough. It's pricey but I think worth the money. The best all-round camera I have owned and the closest to DSLR features in a compact that I have found.- An extra word about Mac compatibility, since it appears in some  other reviews. I've had no problems at all using the camera with my Apple Mac or .mac accounts. I don't use any of the Canon software - just a card reader plugged straight into my Mac. This work perfectly and iPhoto manages the photos just as you'd expect. I wouldn't bother with the Canon software, which will never compete with Apple. Let Canon build the camera and Apple take care of the software - and get the best of both worlds.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great for an Ultra-Compact Digital", "Author": "Alan \"awaldrop@cfl.rr.com\"", "ReviewID": "R1JAFYZ4WU8U6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all the reviews of the Canon SD-700IS and decided I better write my own.  This is an ultracompact camera and it does have a ton of excellent special features packed in it including IS (image stabilization) that really work!  Canon's version of vibration reduction as it is called on Nikon cameras and differt things on other cameras, is IS and it works very well.  The IS works especially well on a camera this small. You can mess up the picture if you try (have you ever gotton blurred digital pictures as in low light situations?) but in most cases the Canon image stabilization works great.It always amazes me that a few people expect a point and shoot compact camera to do things that only top end (i.e. very expensive) SLR Digital Cameras are made to do like shoot in RAW or automatically adjust the ISO rating (actually it's the sensitivity of the sensor that replaces film in a digital) up to ISO 800 mode but most people who choose a point and shoot and especially an ultra compact point and shoot digital will never even try the plethora of features available on this camera. However, if you are one of those people like me who will USE the manual mode and special modes; you won't be disappointed unless you are expecting the the same results you would get from the Canon EOS SLR professional Digital cameras.  Even then you have the same computer that is used on those cameras controlling the image intepreted (DIGICII) and the pictures I took under varying circunstances were excellent except where I goofed up.The 700IS will do everything 99% of everything the people who buy a compact digital for better than most cameras in it's price range.  Its 4X optical zoom, excellentlens quality, great image stabilization, the DIGIC II image processor, it's 2.5\" LCD, excellent and easy to use menu system, and one thing many people forget until they need it--- it still has a basic (if tiny) viewfinder to compose pictures in very low light which I really miss on my Sony W7 compact digital!It is a great buy, has very good battery life in it's proprietary rechargeable battery, a very decent flash built for an ultra compact, AUTO mode, manual mode, a nice macro mode, and if you want them special modes: Portrait, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Underwater, Indoor, Kids & Pets, Night Snapshot, Color Accent, and Color Swap.

I purchased this camera because I wanted a camera that supported photo sizes 8 X 10 or more, it had to be small and compact, have good optical zoom, and have excellent picture quality. After comparing with other brands, I found this camera had all my requirements and a whole lot more.It's just the right size to take with you anywhere. The camera starts up quickly and is very responsive. The image stabilization works beautifully and is useful on a camera so small. Canons optical technology is superb as photos are accurately rendered and developed prints are vibrant and detailed. I love having a 4x optical zoom on a compact camera.Along with the camera I purchased a large capacity secure digital memory card and an additional Canon NB-5L battery. I purchased the SanDisk 2 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card and at the highest image quality setting it holds 720 photos. I've always liked having an extra battery to extend my camera use.I've been very satisfied with Canon products in general and this camera is no exception.", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Top-end Elph camera is solid but introduces quirks at high price", "Author": "Omar Siddique", "ReviewID": "R15I44X75PPDDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've happily used Canon Elph digital cameras for years; my SD700 is the fifth model I've owned in the series.Other people have reviewed this camera in general, so I'll only compare it to the Canon SD600 which I also own (see my glowing review of that model w/comparisons to previous models).The newest Powershot Elph camera, the SD700 adds several welcome enhancements to the Elph family, notably the optical image stabilization and the 4x zoom. Otherwise, this camera is functionally very similar to the SD600, although with rearranged physical controls.  The control and menu changes take a few uses to become familiar, but make sense.The SD700 has a tasteful two-tone casing with a new ergonomic curve for the right-hand grip like the SD630.  Unlike the SD630, it does have an optical viewfinder.  While it's physically almost the exact same size as the SD600/630, it weighs notably more.There's something about the photos the SD700 takes that I don't like.  I find hard to quantify what makes them not as good as the ones taken by the SD600, but they seem almost over-processed, a little less crisp, a little less sharp, kind of like images smoothed out in Photoshop.  Since the Digic engine is the same as the SD600, I can only theorize I'm seeing the results of the image stabilization and/or the new lens.  I didn't like the effect and switched back to the SD600.  The SD700 does take slightly better indoor photos that are cleared and less prone to shake, but the difference isn't that great vs the SD600.  The SD700 also has a new CCD (the device that actually captures the image) which may be the culprit.The increase from 3x to 4x zoom didn't seem to make much of a difference in my mixed usage (I took the camera on 3 very different trips to try it out), and may be a contributing factor to the problem I describe above.  Generally speaking, the \"longer\" a zoom lens is in a small package, the less sharp/clear it tends to be.The SD700 still ships with the same measly 16MB SD card as the SD600 -- it's way too small for any real usage and Canon should upgrade the entry level card up to at least 64MB since SD cards are so cheap these days.This is the first Elph model I've ever had any qualms about, and I've since reverted to using my SD600 instead of this new model.  While it's still an excellent camera, and hence the four star rating, at its higher price, I can't recommend it over the SD600/SD630.  Buy one of those instead, unless you really need the extra bit of zoom and plan to primarily take indoor/flash photos.  I'll wait to try the new technologies again when the next generation of Elph cameras comes out...", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very good image quality, and quality build", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2IIMH76TXN2I3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In many ways, the SD700 is very much like it's predecessor \"Digital Elphs\".  It's compact, and has a sleek, stylish metal design, but lacks some of the features of it's competition.  But what makes this camera special is that it does what it does extremely well.Canon has always had a flair for style with the Elph series, and this camera won't disappoint.  Even pumping the lens up to 4x, it's still a compact camera (noticably smaller than, say, the Nikon Coolpix P4 that's 3.5x).  It was interesting on this top-of-the-line camera that they opted for a 2.5\" LCD so that they could retain the optical viewfinder (a rarity today).  They could have put a 3\" LCD there for more \"wow\" factor (like the SD630), but they realize the limitaion of LCD on bright days outside.Controls are easy to reach, and I do like the zoom around the shutter release, but I can see others preferring a different location.  Some markings take a bit getting used to, such as the difference between \"menu\" and \"functions\".  Canon offers a few things, such as bird chirping sounds, that are worthless, and possibly could offer a few more scene modes.When it comes down to why we buy a camera, the SD700 really shines.  The image quality if very good, and exposures are accurate a very, very high percentage of the time.  The 4x zoom performs well, and the IS (image stabalizer) truly helps in poorer lighting conditions.  Don't underweight this feature.  Even with a flash, the IS can be used to help bring out more background detail, making the photo seem more \"real\".On thing I've always liked about the recent Elphs is the battery charger.  It's smaller than the camera, with a flip-out plug, making it much easier to pack for travel than those chargers with the 3 foot cords.Simply put, for snapshot and traveling, they just don't get any better than the SD700.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "A.

I was looking for a replacement to my previous compact camera & was debating between a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7, Canon PowerShot S3 IS & the Casio Exilim EX-Z850. I know what you're thinking... The Lumix & the S3 are NOT compact... It was extremely difficult to find a compact camera that had features of the aforementioned products & I didn't want to go DSLR (though the entry level Canon Digital Rebel XT had me drooling). The S3 IS blows the SD700 IS out of the water, but was too big to fit in my pocket or my wife's purse. The Panasonic Lumix took decent pictures but felt as if it weighed less than a bag of chips. Construction felt cheap, it looked cheap, the IS didn't work as well as advertised, so back to the store it went. The Canon blew away the Casio in every way imaginable. Side by side photo comparisons between the two proved the inferiority of the Casio's image quality. (Purple fringing, objects out of focus, etc... - Check out dpreview & dcresource for sample images) Video quality is awesome though the microphone is in a very illogical location. (Regardless, you're not paying for a camcorder) I needed something that can take amazing, on the spot pictures (mainly indoors ) w/ little or no user interaction (due to my wife's fear of bleeding edge technology) for our newborn. I've been in situations where the perfect, once in a lifetime picture opportunity arises & the slightest of movement causes the camera to blur images beyond recognition. Breaks your heart... Not with this guy though... The IS works so well, I've purposely tried to take bad pictures by shaking the camera up & down, side to side, in circles, etc... 9 times out of 10, the picture comes out perfect. Blown up in Photoshop & focusing on background objects, they still look great. I could go on & on with this review but I'd rather stick to something short & sweet...All in all, if you want SOME of the functionality of an entry level DSLR, more optical zoom than a typical compact & spectacular Image Stabilization, then this camera is for you... This is the closest I've seen to a compact point & shoot that can effortlessly take amazing pictures that can hang w/ the big boys. The price is a bit steeper than most but so well worth it...

I know the Casio is supposed to be the better camera, but the bottom line is that the 4x optical zoom is more valuable than the white balance settings or the best shot settings. The ISO seemed to work better than the Casio's anti-shake feature as well (I got less blurry photos with the Canon than the Casio), and the Canon was definitely faster. I used the same memory card in both (Lexar Platinum II 60x), which I know doesn't mean a whole lot, but thought I'd add that all the same. I tested these cameras on my cats outdoors, flash off, underneath a tree in the middle of a sunny day. The Casio's white balance settings did shine through, but when it came time to decide, I went with the Canon because of the optical zoom, despite all the Casio's perks ($100 cheaper pricetag included). The SD700's 4x optical zoom gives me quality photos at a greater range, and that's really all there is to it. Megapixels are not even an issue (wow, they really aren't an issue, unbelievable!). I took 5 shots on this camera and realized I could get better quality photos than an 8 or 10 megapixel camera that only has a 3x optical zoom.

I had been looking at numerous brands and models but eventually decided on this PowerShot SD700 IS.The big deal with this camera is the IMAGE STABILIZATION. What this does is compensates for say, a shaky hand, and makes images sharper and clearer in the process. Now, other brands have things such as an \"Anti-Shake DSP\". These do serve the same basic purpose, but do so DIGITALLY, by (among other things) messing with your ISO and shutter speed! NOT COOL! Canon's method is OPTICAL, which actually adjusts the lens to achieve this, so the images are sharp and clear without any additional noise.How well does this work in real life? I don't know about the rest of you but I'm a caffeine junkie, and my hands can be a little shaky at times. This camera helps me keep stable shots. It even improves your image quality when using a slower shutter speed. I was amazed at the images I was getting with a 1/8 shutter and no tripod!Now, a word on megapixels: you might say that 6MP is a bit low when compared to the 10MP cameras that are out today. I'll tell you this: Any camera 5MP and up is going to be way more than enough for pretty much any type of photo printer. As the adage goes, \"quality over quantity\", and images will look better with a great 6MP camera than a mediocre 10MP camera.Image quality aside, I LOVE the aesthetics of this camera. It's a *little* big for an ultracompact, but it has a solid and tactile feel, you can tell its put together well. Either way, it fits very easily into my jeans pockets (and I buy my jeans on the slim-fitting side) and I can use it one handed. The buttons are a little small, as is the dial, but such is the price to pay for a small camera. The menus are RAPID and very easy to navigate, powers on quickly, shutter lag is nearly nonexistent (though shot-to-shot times could be better).My gripes?- MANUAL FEATURES. I know, nobody buys an ultracompact point-and-shoot for manual features, but I would gladly pay an extra $100 just to be able to set my own aperture and shutter speed. However, none of their competitors are really doing this either.- Thickness; no, 1.04 inch is not huge, but competitors' cameras are clocking in at 0.8 or 0.6 (Casio Exilim), and Canon should be keeping up with the likes of the ultra-ultra-compacts and giving us a truly slim camera-- even if it means trading in that nice 4x zoom for 3x.- Buttons are small. Optical viewfinder is too small for anyone to use, they should have just done away with it and given us a larger screen.- Shot-to-shot time could be improved.Sure, the SD700 IS is not perfect, but it's the closest thing there is to \"perfect\" when it comes to a midrange ultra-compact.

Quartararo \"Q\"", "ReviewID": "RHJOJWV20IQEL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With all those digital camera models that are out on the market today, how does one choose? I've currently been a fan of Nikon in the past, previously with my Coolpix 7900 and I'm happy to say that I'm glad I switched to the SD700. I've been reading tons of reviews on it and I finally took the plunge and got it. At first I was skeptical, but after a few days of shooting, I was glad to have purchased it! The look and feel of the camera is solid. The battery charger is compact, no cords, it just plugs right into the wall. Battery life is pretty decent. The camera starts right up instantaneously. I highly recommend purchasing a high speed SD Memory Card such as a SanDisk 1GB Extreme. When taking a picture with this card with the camera, it automatically writes the image to the card without any delay. Picture quality is excellent! The images are sharp (very important to me). The image stabilization is a nice feature too when shooting indoors with flash but be aware that the pictures may come out \"grainy\" because the camera is shooting at a higher ISO to compensate for low light conditions. This is to be expected with any camera and should be a given. The flash recharges quickly. The LCD screen is great; 2.5\" LCD. Be careful, screen is easy to scratch. Perhaps purchasing a screen protector might be useful if you are concerned about the upkeep of the screen. Also be aware that there is no shutter or aperture priority modes although there are lots of \"preset\" scene modes that will compensate for this as well. This camera is meant to be a compact camera and with that, you paying more money for a great point and shoot camera with little or no manual control. You can manually adjust some of the exposure settings and white balance. You can also adjust saturation, sharpness, and choose to shoot in black and white and sepia. Another neat feature is that when viewing pictures in playback mode on the camera, the picture tilts depending on how you hold the camera! For example, if I shoot a portrait rather than a landscape and view it back, the picture rotates according to how you hold the camera! No more rotating the camera based on the image, the image rotates on how you hold the camera!User interface with the camera is excellent. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to navigate through the camera settings via the menus. There is an optical viewfinder but you'll probably won't use it. In fact, it really doesn't serve any purpose. Definintely use the LCD screen when shooting. Taking pictures in macro mode was amazing. I was surprised at the results given how close up you can focus on small objects.As for video mode, when I buy a digital camera, I buy it for taking pictures, not taking videos! Although it's nice to have, it's something that you may or may not get use out of. There has been some feedback that playback and recording of video mode for the SD700 has been somewhat questionable. However to be honest, please ignore it. If you're serious about taking videos, please buy a nice digicam for the best results.Drawbacks? The only one I have is I wish Canon would have put in the time and effort to make the dial on the camera something other than plastic. It's going to get a lot of use when switching to different modes of the camera and I wish they would have made it more \"solid\". It's like sewing on a cheap button on an armani suit. They should have made the dial better quality, perhaps metal?Overall, definitely keep this camera on your list for when reviewing and comparing. It's probably one of the best point and shoots ultracompacts with image stabilization out there on the market. Canon has been in the business for many years and its a brand you can trust.

As much as I've enjoyed those, this camera has gone to the next level for me with the Canon Image Stabilization technology. Have been taking a lot of pix over the month that I've owned it, and am very impressed by the overall quality of the shots.For small handhelds, camera shake is an issue in some lighting situations. Certainly the other Powershots attested to that. Not a big problem, but given that the camera is not going to give you much control over shutter speed and aperature, you may find that some lighting situations give you shots that are a little less than satisfactory. Not a lot of shots are affected, but enough that you may find yourself dorking around in Photoshop to try and \"save/improve\" the shot.Now, with the Image Stabilization, two things appear to be happening. First, as Canon says, for most lighting situations, the camera will bias the shot at an average of 3 stops faster. Which to me tends to produce \"better lit\" shots. I know that's a bit subjective, but that's what I'm seeing.Second though, which is probably of more interest, is that the pictures are much sharper in general. As in less blurry as one measure, and sharper as another.Not really a scientific test, mind you, but in my month of shooting I've been very pleased with the pictures and doing the A/B with the SD-450, definitely favor the SD-700 picture quality.Single downside is that this camera is a little bigger than the SD-300 and SD-450 size. When I travel around, I often keep this camera in my pocket. I can tell that the SD-700 is a small bit bigger and heavier. Not a big deal at all for me, just an FYI.Although, should also mention that the camera is a bit bigger because the LCD screen is bigger.

Only Amazon reviews.Well, the camera arrived today and I was very excited by the size and feel. The first thing I did was take a video to see if the complaints were valid or not. I played the video on my laptop and I was shocked at how bad the sound was. It sounds like constant static. It's not real loud, but its very obvious that there is noise throughout the entire video. I turned IS off thinking that this might get rid of the buzzing noise. But no luck.On a side note, some people have complained that the video files are not compressed and take up a lot of space. I agree with this as well. The videos are AVI files and they require 2MB per second of video.I hate to say this (REALLY hate to say this), but I have to go back to studying more cameras and find another choice. The pics are wonderful and IS really works magic. But the noise is a deal breaker. If you plan on doing any videos at all, the sound quality on this camera is unacceptable.------  UPDATE  --------I went back to the camera store to research the noise issue some more. I thought that maybe they would have a SD700 without the noise problem. So I took in a memory card to the store and literally did \"silent movies\" of different SD700s as well as different styles of cameras altogether. When I got home I analyzed the video and they ALL have the background noise that I'm complaining about. It's not just a SD700 problem. So my theory is that since the microphones on these cameras are just microscopic dots, then you really can't get a decent quality audio out of them.

While it offers something no other Elph has ever offered with Image Stabilization it lacks in many areas. As an S400 owner I recommended my family to purchase the SD700 as a good P&S; compact as it got very good reviews. While it may work for my mom and dad with its easy controls and good enough picture quality for them (they know nothing about phtography and wanted an easy camera), I find it quite dissapointing actually. The nice things are: Good continous shooting, OK battery life, 4x zoom and the presence of an optical viewfinder. The bad points however all have to do with image quality unfortunately. Firstly, this camera suffers too much from corner softness. The images are just not as consistent as my camera or some of the other Elphs and the softness is quite noticeable at larger print sizes (not at the small sizes however). The blurry effect I do not like at all. Also, the images are a little too soft for a P&S.; If it was a DSLR it would be OK as with post-processing sharpness can be gained but for a pure P&S; I dont like soft images out of the box at all. The ISO range has gone up now to 800. But this is actually a trick. What Canon used to do was understate their ISO's by almost 2/3rd of a stop. Thus ISO400 on the older Cam's was almost as senstive as ISO800 on other companies Cam's. Now Canon have fixed that issue and state their ratings more correctly so ISO800 is just correctly labeled now. And well, the ISO800 image is very very grainy and looks terrible even as a 4 x 6 print, ISO400 is also very grainy but definetely better. ISO200 is fine and is pretty decent. So the camera is quite bad for low-light shooting and if you do any of that be prepared to be dissapointed. Also the AiAf system may well be the worst metering system ever produced. It was the same with my S400. Etiher way it really does not meter accurately and fails too often to expose an image correctly. Also, the images are a little oversatured too with the reds being the worst (too bright and neon like) and the greens having a yellowish tint. On a side note I found out about the Fuji F30 too late unfortunately, I actually had a chance to use it recently as a friend bought one and it got excellent reviews online and it is indeed a very nice instrument. Of course, that camera is not perfect either (no P&S; is for that matter) and has some of its issues as-well but if I had known, I would have made my parents get the F30 over this anyday. In fact, I am heavily considering getting one for myself as its time to update for me and I am very put-off by Canon's latest Elph efforts. Like I said the F30 has my very serious consideration and I will probably get that camera if I decide to stick with compact cam's - though I havent decided fully yet - as I may move the DSLR route instead (probably a Canon or Nikon) - but If I dont go that way, I know Canon aren't getting the rather hefty price they ask of me for this cam - that's for sure. Overall the SD700 is a decent-to-OK camera but let down big-time by the issues I mentioned above - especially considering it is also overpriced for what it is - which made it an even greater let-down.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great for my man hands!", "Author": "Just a Guy", "ReviewID": "R3W47MZTJE9BVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The SD700 IS is a very nice size and weight small camera for those not interested in the smallest ultra compact on the market.

I decided to try this camera because of reviews saying that it is small but bigger than the other Elph's.Having 35-140 lens along with Image Stabilizer for the going price is terrific! Really love the LCD, it's bright and readable. Used without glasses and could see what I was doing, mostly. Being old school, having an optical viewfinder, is a requirement. Comes in handy to save battery life, use when it's too bright or when in a place that it would be impolite to have the LCD on.IS is a nice feature that is helpful in low light. You will see a difference with less camera shake which cause blurry pics. If you are not going to fiddle faddle around with the camera the IS will help, not always, but in certain situations. Just keep it on all the time in shoot only mode. Many professional reviews are all positive about this model.Great battery life! I have taken 650+ shots using the LCD mostly, some flash, playing with the menus and the battery still has a charge! I have charged the battery a couple of times and it seems to go on forever, surprised about how long this small battery maintains the charge.Nice built in feature that is helpful; My colors- can review shots and compare your pic with all the built in color options like Vivid, Neutral, Sepia, etc. If another one looks better than choose instead.The wrist strap is adjustable, able to tighten on my wrist. Not using a wrist or neck strap is asking for trouble. Purchased the Canon accessory pack with extra battery, carrying case and neck strap. I like the fact that the straps are easy to take off.

I was not disappointed the second time around.The camera takes fantastic photos and the indoor shots that were grainy on the Pentax came out clean on the Casio. I much prefer a lower mega pixel camera that can take clean photos at the highest resolution than a higher mega pixel camera that has noise at its highest setting.I took the camera to the Tulip festival and took lots of terrific photos. The camera did a great job on close ups and distance shots and this camera is really good at taking quick photos that are not blurry.I only wished I had this camera for use earlier.Although not part of this review, I thought I would like to mention that Amazon went out of their way to get this camera to me in time for the Tulip festival including getting a last minute change to their shipping department to change the address and delivery method. I ordered 2-day shipping Wednesday night but changed the method and address Thursday morning, after Amazon started the fulfillment process. The Amazon representative was able to cancel the fulfillment at the last moment and re-order it with the updated information. Amazon got me the camera Friday at the correct address.

Indoors and night are a little less impressive but much better than some other cameras I have tested.  Compared to the SD550, this camera is much easier to use, has better battery life, far quicker on startup and taking pics, better LCD screen & much less noise. I also tried the Panasonic LX2 and returned it right away b/c of the noise.

Even the RAW images were unusable. JPEG compression and noise is much better with the SD700. Fits in my jeans pocket and my purse, so I can always have a camera on me.Disadvantages...not many.  I wish the MP were maybe a bit higher, but you would get more noise with that.  The compression in the JPEGs could be a little better. Sometimes the perfect photo is not so perfect if you are a \"pixel peeper\" and are looking to sell your digital images (they still print wonderfully though.)

It also takes much higher-res movies than I've seen in this type of camera, which was a very pleasant surprise.On the negative side, many pictures, especially in low-light situations, come out fuzzy; I find that I must discard quite a few for this reason. The camera is certainly capable of taking sharp pictures, but the lighting needs to be better than what is needed for my Olympus. Auto-focusing is fussy and a little hard to optimize. The flash seems limited in range to 6-8 ft. Finally, I have yet to see significant help from the image stabilization feature.The books (basic and advanced) are quite helpful in decoding the somewhat-complex user interface, though the camera can be immediately used to take basic photos with little reading if desired.

Han \"Elphman\"", "ReviewID": "R1EWYWXGNNEIVC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I, like a lot of people, have been anxiously waiting to get my hands on the Canon SD700 IS.  Well, I've owned it for about two weeks and my conclusion is that I am pretty disappointed with the SD700.  It was more hype than anything concerning the IS and the higher ISO settings.  Whilst most of the outdoor pictures came out okay, it still failed to produce sharp and detailed pictures. The SD700 just lacks the \"crispness\" I was expecting; my old SD500 (SD550 is the same camera, btw) blows it away.  Biggest drawback of the SD700: weak flash.  This is very important because without a strong flash, your outdoor pictures will come out on the dull side with evidence of graininess (e.g. skies, buildings, people, trees, leaves).  When there is ample lighting, however, such as at the beach, pictures are decent but still inferior to the SD500; again, due to weak flash.  Another drawback of the SD700 is its smaller sensor size.  Why did Canon opt to go with a smaller size?  IMO, they should've stuck with the same sensor size found on the SD500.  The smaller senosr size, in essence, gives you dark corners (very true when the sky is present in the background - you'll definitely notice slight vignetting on the upper left and right hand corners; it is very annoying to say the least).  Then there is the issue of blurriness (you'll tend to see this on either the left or right corner of your pictures).  I can't believe people who gave this camera a very high mark didn't mention the aforementioned problems, as they are common complaints addressed by SD700 owners at various online camera forums. Again, when comparing to my SD500, the SD500 produces superior images - pictures are sharper and more \"alive\" out of the box, has more details, better contrast of colors.  Indoor pictures is  a mixed bag.  In certain situations, pictures do come out nice (e.g. inside a department store); in darker conditions such as your room, museum or restaurant, you find yourself raising the ISO level, up to 400 (ISO 800 is worthless; it's nothing more than a marketing ploy).  I had to use a noise remover program to get rid of the noises, which I must say, did a very decent job.  If you are doing a lot of indoor shooting, I highly recommend the Fuji F30.  I love Canon cameras but I have to concede the F30 is a superior camera in the low-light department.  Reason I didn't purchase this camera was because it uses the XDcard.  But main reason for not purchasing the F30 was because outdoors pictures come out inconsistent (strong purple fringing, blown out shots, lacks details when compared to Canon pictures).  The SD700, respectively, wins in the outdoor department.Biggest pluses of the camera are obviously the IS feature and macro shot capability.  But these two positive atrributes of the camera don't justify the hefty price tag of the camera; even when the camera is on sale, the SD700 is overpriced.Bottom line: If you can deal with having to post-process a lot of your pictures, not to mention the issues I addressed, then the SD700 might be the camera for you.I'm going to be sending the camera back and wait for the release of the next generation model of the SD700 that will hopefully make drastic improvements on the said issues.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Compact", "Author": "M.

The viewing screen is nice and large.  The quality of the pictures is unbelievable for such a small camera.  Using the manual mode, you can zoom  in very close and still get a remarkable picture.  There are adjustments for every kind of lighting situation imaginable and a stabalizing feature that adjusts for most movement.  I've gotten great action pictures of my cats and super ones of birds at the feeders.My only complaint is the users manual.  It's a little hard to figure out.

This is really a superior product.However, I just returned from a 3 week family trip, and upon downloading my videos I'm experiencing the \"noisy video\" problem for the first time.  This did not occur for the first few months of ownership - when I purchased the product there was indeed a tiny amount of noise when recording video (or audio notes), but it was reasonable considering the size of the microphone, and it was comparable (although a tiny bit louder) than the noise I experienced on my previous camera, the Canon PowerShot S400. But now, however, the noise is loud enough to completely obscure any detail of the sound that's being recorded.  This was very disappointing on some of the quiet, tender, family videos I recorded on my trip. It appears to be an intermittent problem, but it is very discouraging when it happens.

Several years ago, I bought a Sony Cybershot(old school generation), entering the digital era, but found that I missed so many shots that I quit taking pictures for a time because the SLR was just too much camera to travel with and the digital was too slow.I bought this camera to take on a recent trip to Greece, knowing I couldn't miss the photo opps of a lifetime! I LOVE IT! The digital zoom worked great to get details I couldn't even see with the naked eye. I took moving shots from our vehicle and with the image stabilizer got consistent, clear shots I thought I'd missed. The combinations of manual mode, auto mode, and sceen selection mode gave me lots of options to get everything from macros on cool plants to stitching together a fabulous sunset horizon over the Aegean Sea.Six megapixels and the large viewing screen made reviewing details easy and while I haven't used the editing software yet, I feel certain that I'll get great cropped images, too.I experienced only one challenge with this camera that I'd say is a negative attribute.  It's small size makes it a little difficult to hold securely.  It's sleek metal design is attractive, but it slipped out of my hands several times, and I've got relatively small hands.  I learned to slip the wrist strap on immediately after it hitting the ground twice, thankfully with nothing more than a small dent on a corner.

Small and nicely engineered with a very fast startup time, this is definitely a camera that you can carry around anywhere. I've even been able to put it in the back pocket of my jeans without any problem.Before buying it I read extensive reviews and found that the quality of the images on this camera are exceptional. I've used it to take high resolution macro shots and long distance photos and it always works well.The layout of the controls is very slightly different to older Canon cameras, but you should be able to adjust quickly.The camera doesn't come with a carrying case, but I was able to purchase a  silicone skin in blue (Canon PowerShot SD700 Silicone Skin Case - (Frosty Blue)). This has worked wonderfully to protect the camera and make it easier to get a firm grip on it.With a 2 Gb memory card, we were able to take this camera for a week's tour of Washington DC without filling it up. The viewing mode for existing photos worked well here, because it can display the photos the right way up whether you took them in landscape or portrait mode. The battery also held up well to a lot of use, and only needed recharging about every third day. We mostly used the display to focus and shoot, though there is a useable viewfinder.While this camera doesn't allow you to take RAW mode photos, I think that it's an ideal camera for any photo enthusiast who wants something that's portable and takes really great shots.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "I don't go anywhere without this camera!", "Author": "K.

In short, much has been discussed about this camera, well since its a Canon, and as long as you put the Canon name on it, everyone will let you to believe its the best cam out there. Unfortunately, I tend to agree a little more with the more critical reviews, given that this is a $500 list price cam, thankfully I didnt pay for it :-) Also since I previously owned an Elph that gave me the famous E18 error - I was already very skeptical. Do a search in Google and you will see what it is. I had lost faith in the Canon compacts since this issue and I wasnt the only person in my neighborhood that this error happened to out of nowhere. So I made a promise to myself to never buy a compact Canon camera again - DSLR's are the only Canon's I will consider from now on.

Heres a summary of my thoughts: the good points are there - fast operations, good continous shooting, nice video mode, good zoom range (though I would have much preffered wide angle to telephoto) and decent OIS and several other well deserved points. But, the problem is the camera offers little flexibilty when it comes to manual shooting and the camera suffers from several issues for the top-end Elph its supposed to be. Firstly, the images are a little soft. 2. I see major corner softness so if you print big be prepared to see it in the larger sizes. Also, theres some mild vignetting, though this isnt terrible. 3. Major red eye, and its just not oh theres some red eye, its full-on demon eyes that are glowing fire hot red. Thus, if you post-process and want to clean it theres no detail. Not a good cam for flash shots and portraits for sure. Speaking of flash, its weak and doesnt have a very long effective range. The points about Noise are all true, its terrible at ISO800 even in the smallest print sizes and ISO400 is OK for the smallest print sizes but not for large prints. ISO200 is pretty good though and you can happily make a larger print from it. Also, the Image Stabilization system is definetely much better in the Panasonic range of cameras. More effective, but more importantly more consistent. I come back to the manual settings now, well there are none, save for Manual White Balance. It would be nice to be able to control aperture and shutter speed for a cam costing this much if you ask me. Overall, its still a nice cam and good for regular printing and holiday shooting in the bright sun and so on, but its definetely not an enthusiasts compact cam of choice unlike say a Fuji F30 - which another friend bought online and Im very impressed with, it offers more in line of flexiblity. I do not find it a coincendence that many Canon DSLR owners I know - do not use Canon Elph series cams as their second compact cam but prefer a more capable and flexible cam such as the F30 or antther camera. Especially if you are shooting low-light - this camera will dissapoint. There are several good competitors to this cam if you ask me that are worth a look - one being the Fuji F30, the others are the Panasonic compact cams that offer Image Stabilization but also lack manual control. They are a more competitive price and justify what they cost much more than this camera in my honest opinion. Still, its a nice/decent camera, if youre the type that likes to feel good about how the camera looks in your hand and only shoot in vacations, etc. and dont care so much about flexibility and control. But in this case, I would personally recommend a camera like the Panasonic FX01 or the new one that is coming out, which have almost identical features to this but at a better price and a wide-angle Leica lens! Or the F30, if youre more than a holiday shooter and want a good capable ultra-compact cam that is maybe the only camera less a DSLR that is usable in low-light.", "Date": "August 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "what happened to the video sound quality?", "Author": "P.

The question was how far up the chain to go. We settled on the 700 based mostly on it's improved movie capability and the image stabilization. Six MP is more than ample for casual use and prints up to 8x10.If we have any complaint, it's not from my wife, but from me. The camera is just too small for my hands (holding, shooting, changing modes, etc. are all a nuisance for me). I'm 6-3 and my hands are not large, fingers are probably average length for my size. Nonetheless, I find I need to use mostly fingertips when handling the camera. Maybe this is in part because I usually use a Canon 30D SLR. My wife (5-5 and average hands) thinks the SD700 is perfect, large enough for convenient use and fits in her purse easily. It's a bit better than the SD300 in that the body is slightly thicker.As for other features, all are great. Like any very powerful camera, there is a lot to learn if you want to move off of the fully automatic mode into the many creative options allowed by the manual controls or even the scene modes. Even if you are experienced digital photographer, you will want to practice for some hours before heading for a kid's birthday party as the official photographer. The camera has all the quality for such an outing, but needs considerable expertise if you go beyond the automatic mode. With my SLR I like to drop back to automatic to take a backup picture in case I've screwed up the manual setting (left some adjustment on the wrong setting ... such as ISO which can cause noise that is not visible in a quick check of the image on the LCD). This is a simple one click turn of a knob on the SLR but on the SD700 you need to open up the menu and do a couple of clicks. This takes time you may not have, so you want to be an expert with the camera or you want to leave it on auto or just choose a scene mode (portrait, landscape, moving object, etc.).

A bit bigger than an sd450 but still really small. The body seems metal, not as plasticky as most small cameras are.

The only drawbacks are that the camera won't tell you how many pictures you have left to shoot (my Kodak tells me how many more photos my memory card will hold) only the amount of space left on card, and there is no external AC adapter that pugs directly into the camera, so you have to take to battery out and put it in its charger to charge it.

It takes amazing outdoor photos with wonderful color and sharpness, not to mention the ease of changing the exposure if it's too dark or light where you're at.

The camera has the potential to take photos at night and in low light, HOWEVER, you MUST use a tripod for it to work!! I went for 2 weeks in Japan, and I have a pretty steady hand, and could NOT get a decent indoor photo using the low light setting. The colors came out beautifully, however, everything was out of focus due to having such a long shutter exposure (2 or 3 seconds  at least). It didn't matter if I leaned up against something or put the camera on a ledge, they still came out unfocused. This will only take great night photos only if you use a tripod!The other negative is the bottom of the camera is rounded and with the lens out, the camera tumps forward. You cannot set this on a table without it falling over, even when the camera is off. My camera has fallen over more times than I can count. And just today, I put the camera on a table and 10 seconds later, it fell over and off the table. It landed on its lens, and now the focusing lens is broken and the side dial is loose.

Unfortunately, the camera stopped working halfway through the visit (one month after purchase). I sent it by overnight mail to Canon Repair and then had to wait 5 days before they could even acknowledge receipt and another whole week before it was returned by two-day express after speaking to a supervisor who promised to expedite the repair and return.  Along the way I had to make several calls to Canon to determine its status since the email notifications never came as promised despite my confirming my email address with them. My granddaughters had returned home by then so I lost lots of opportunities for more photos and videos and had to squeak by with my oldest Canon. Ironically, my Apple PowerBook also went in for repairs during the same time and they sent an overnight box for packing and returning it and returned it by overnight within 24 hrs of their receiving it without any cost to me.

To add to the other review about Macs I will share the solution of extreme hours of furstration, trouble shooting and the store calling the best and highest at Epson and Mac. No one had the anwer  but slowly reports were coming out that the Canon 10 D printed dark and this problem was for people with macs. People with Macs use the product. They are the downloaders, the croppers and want the pictures to look right. So the truth, Ta Da Ta Da, (how I felt) . There is no problem with a Canon and a Mac nut always confirm combatibility.  Canon has never been a problem with Mac, Canon is the only large camera producer who utilizes a system within  their digital cameras called Print Image Matching. Why did some one not tell me this! Not evern Canon or Epson had the answer and Mac listed compatible with the camera and the R800 printer. But the pictures dark and when the LCD of both the computer and the camera looked the same and with good exposure, (Enough but not to much light) my pictures were dark and I was nuts, My husbands Dimage Minolta pictures printed true to color and beautifully. Must be the Mac the world cried out. Wrong.  This is the truth no one knew until the week after I figured it out and then on the Canon Website.  The problem is that Canon, separate from most others uses a system in their cameras, that enables the information on the memory disk to talk if you will to the printer, called Print Image Matching. Most all of the other biggies, Nikon, the old Minolta, Olympus (I think) utilitze a system called Photo Matching something or other. In other words, Mac is fine, but any Canon Camera on any computer needs a Print Image Matching Printer. This is so the the camera or disk can share information with the computer who then talks to the printer about the information on the disk. Canon is the only one at the time not joining the pack and developing their own Print Image Matching. So my Epson printer is comaptible with Mac, the camera as well but due to not being a Print Image Matching Printer they were not speaking resulting in dark pictures and on the mac no way to correct it seemed. The most knowledgable at Canon knew nothing, nor at Epson so the world of course cried out it was the mac, I must of checked and rechecked compatibility over 100  times. I stopped printing. . Thanks Canon.  You must own a Print Image Matching Printer. Could of told us. . I confirmed it with intense research and denial from all of a problem,  when buying the Epson Picturemate four by six portable printer.  I had  finally after reading and reading and callng, read the reviews on Amazon of the Camera. Same complaint for more than Mac users, Hmmmm.  Then in a very obscure photo magazine I saw it, Canon was the only one to use a system within the camera called Print Image Matching. Everyone else, the other. In buying the epson Picturemate for fun with the kids that has the PIM I confirmed it. My picures were priinting beautifully.  My camera or disk was talking to the Mac, but the printer was not Print Image Matching so the computer could not talk to my Epson Printer re information on the disk re everything,  Then the Epson Picturemate four by sic portable , bought for fun with the kids, with  Print Image Matching combined in the printer with the Photo Matching what ever of  EVERYONE elso.  The next week of it was on Canon's website.  So now, more than Canon Printers have the PIM you need,  Since I bought my Canon i9900 upper end printer the shots are fabulous and they are looking good!  I am however very disappointed in the lack of selection of Canon Paper both in quality and size and universally it is said that you must use, in order for them to last, the same type of paper as the printer.  To add, no one can know how long digital prints will last and the claims of 100 years or 30 are unfounded. Why. Digital has not been around that long. If you scrap book ie with Digital Shots now of your baby, with a less expensive paper and printer by the time they are in their thirties and wanting to show it to  their kids the pictures will probably  be gone. Faded. Done. A solution is to back up the scrapbooked pictures together in a group or what is called an album and mark it for reproduction later. This is put on a CD or DVD for saving.  Or be wise and do photo slide shows and put them on DVD with music and  text and for me, I take out the old film camera, a Canon EOS IIE four times a year on certain memorable dates and take black and whites for longevity. Proven to last for hundreds of years. The camera (the one I am supposed to be discussing is  great) I have used it and bought it as the fun one but so impressive instead of lugging the much more epensive and larger professional 20 D and flash and lenses etc.  Sometime times for a pro who spent a ton on other Canon equipment and more than the camera on a rolling case to carry that equipment it has I will be honest, made me mad at times. Upsetting to check the information on the greatest Photo and see it was not taken on all that epensive stuff.  Also do you know what a picoleter is, Epson reps don't and it is important. A picoleter is the size of the droplet of ink that comes from the printer so a larger picoleter make the pictures more grainy. You want millions of small ink dots, not millions of larger, but half the amount. Important, never on the box, the old Epson 2200 had a 4 picoleter and this was considered at the time the best or the range to not go above.  My Canon Printer is a 2 picoleter. Ask and people will think you are crazy but is important, Unfortunately I have discovered for myself even if I feel Ok  about not bringing the big guns and throwing this in my purse, It has raised to many comments of those who are used to the professional and it, I believe, harms me but I sell my photos.  You can not charge money and bring an elph. But in the secret of you house you can be jealous of some of the features and the desire to have them in your finer equipment and the man who said look for the green dot is right, I stand for minutes sometimes with my victum unknowing and wait for that shot. I move and dance around. Also please, I beg you do not use a processor of your pictures such as Costco, Walgreens etc to save money, You must crop first and just turning over a disk and say print it is crazy. Play, learn it and love it and keep that film camera for those black and whites and many times you will be infuritated as the camera you by today will be outdated and cheaper tomorrow.  I wonder how many pictures, so dear to me, I would not have if I waited until the price dropped. I hear to many times the craziness of the statement \"the price will drop so I am going  to wait\". There is no time to wait. What did you not get as you can take 400 shots for free? Let me just lecture you some more, do not be tempted by the powershot 7,1 megapixel for that great price and you want all the megapixels you can have so you can crop the picture and have a good photo still. The 4 times optical, faster processor and image stabilization makes it for those who have spent years of joy and frustration learning a no brainer. Spend the extra or you will be back to upgrade and if switching from film especially the S series is mandatory as you might repeat the mistake I see so often. By a digital, not good enough, get discouraged and not go out and just take hundreds of pictures to practice so you reach back to the film camera and it's security.  Of  course the Canon 2o D  with the L series lenses is much finer and brilliant. But depending on the shot, it is for some, a very close call not noticed. Thanks Canon. Remember, Print Image Matching. Small picoleter of 2. Mac. Good to go. Also the other Rumor is that the Canon Photo Image Program does not work with Mac. 1) It does it is only a disclaimer of no mac disks if upgraded and 2) if you own a mac you will never use the Canon Image Program. Any computer user should have something elso. Does not need to cost gillions. The movie that was made in 9 months and had to be to make Sundance Film Festival, sweeping all awards was made on a $50 mac program.  Also get used to the joy of Steve Jobs if a mac person, you will love him and hate him for the same thing, cutting edge, new things, price reductions. Stagnate or be glad there is a new Iphoto.
