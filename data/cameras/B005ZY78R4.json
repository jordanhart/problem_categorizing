{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cool / Expensive", "Author": "R. Guzman \"Technology Director\"", "ReviewID": "R3P3XVE1U5E283", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Prompt delivery, so props to seller for that.This screen works as advertised and it's a fair companion to Fuji's 3D camera. If the price was half as much, I'd say it's a great companion to the camera. Interestingly, the resolution and lenticular effect is NOT as impressive as the camera's 3D screen. The camera's 3D screen seems to have more pixels per inch, and the lenticular prisms appear to be more tightly packed than on this standalone viewer.That being said, glasses-free 3D at an 800x600 resolution is nothing to sniff at. 3D pictures look good on this screen when viewed between 2-3 feet, and at the correct angle. Leaving it on all the time in 3D mode doesn't quite make sense, since you can't really glance at the screen to enjoy a 3D image from any odd angle. It almost makes more sense to leave it in 2D mode and switch to 3D when you feel like picking it up and holding it in the correct position.All limitations accounted for, I'm still glad I bought this. (But I'm a nerd who places outsized value on new tech.) One BIG unexpected surprise is that this thing has a full-size HDMI input on it, and it can display 3D games and blu-ray from my PS3!! I just played some Uncharted 3 and lost an hour in the blink of an eye. It's completely playable as long as you perch this screen at eye level. If the PS3 was only smaller, this would make a killer portable gaming setup.If you have the cash to spare and you're the right kind of enthusiast, this is a fun piece of kit.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good 3D viewer, ASUKA in Japan shipped immediately!", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R30UWXL5X8JJPU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the Fuji W3 3D camera and the 3D screen on the back of the camera is great, but too small for a true display.  This viewer (V3) is larger and is also 3D without glasses.  The result is quite good and the pictures are sharp.  it can play video in 3D with sound, too.  It is expensive, but the shipper (ASUKA) in Japan was quick--it arrived in within a week, was well packed, and they included a pair of Japanese chop sticks!", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fuji Finepix Real 3d V3 Viewer for 3d W3", "Author": "Smedes", "ReviewID": "R22ML6UZXMGI78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Positive: Colorfull, bright, good contrast, no shadowing, perfect 3d effect, easy to use.Negative: Connection to AC/DC necessary, only one viewer can see the 3d effect perfectly because you have to align exactly with the screen, expensive,", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible 3D viewer!", "Author": "jmh", "ReviewID": "R1BXHGHOMV0VE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great resolution - almost as good as the 3D camera's screen.
