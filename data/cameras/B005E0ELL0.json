This one did not let me down.  The kit was less than suggested retail to my door.  The most important thing I was looking for was a 32gb class 10 card to accompany my new camera and this package was it.  Everything is in working order except I cant figure out how to get the remote to work.  This is by no means top quality accessories however you really get a lot for less then the retail price of the camera.  Do yourself a favor and look no further than this kit here!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon Rebel T3i", "Author": "New Rebel", "ReviewID": "R3JSBWL8BT7ZDU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the camera and the pricing was fare. The after market lenses and the tripod seem to be JUNK. The tripod is all light weight cheap plastic but I guess it will have to work for now. The Camera itself is great and I am still learning the features that are most important to me at the moment. The battery life seems to be shorter than expected but they included a spare. I guess they where thinking ahead?", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great package for Canon T3i", "Author": "sanjay", "ReviewID": "R2W5OBHGD5RM4D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens with 32GB Card + .45x Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto Lenses + Battery + Remote + Filter + Tripod + Accessory KitThis kit is a great buy for the price it is offered. I would have easily spent over $100 for these accessories which are a must for any DSLRs.You can check on internet, this is the best DSLR camera under $1000.I did not use all accessories supplied with this kit but some of them were very useful. 32GB class 10 Memory card was  the reason to choose this Kit. Along with that I got a great tripod, remote, additional battery and camera bag for the same price. I am fully enjoying these accessories.I paid $18 more on this to buy from Amazon than buying it directly from the seller as it gave me lot more comfort to buy and rely on the policies of Amazon.Accessories may not be great, but they serve the purpose. Telephoto lens did not look very useful (Anything that was a free accessory is not a bad deal at all).I would highly recommend this kit for anyone looking to buy Canon T3i camera.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK", "Author": "BradButter", "ReviewID": "R1YZRVJ5OS528R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was looking for a Canon T3i online and came to my favorite website. There are other good Kits depends on what you need. I dont even plan on using the tripod and bag it came with but its good if you need it I just dont. The 32 GB card is a big plus for me it saved me alot of money. and the wide angle adapter and  zoom adapter work great as well ...there pretty heavy duty and look like they will last me a while. camera is great of course! also bought a 50mm 1.8 lens thats just fantastic. i can go on all day but i just want to say BUY THIS!!!!", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "kit maravilloso", "Author": "Cesar", "ReviewID": "R2WCKSQLOOGYD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "q buen kit, una muy buena memoria, unos lentes excelentes y una camara impecable, es una gran compra con todo lo necesario para trabajar", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The camera is perfect! The accessories are so-so.", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R2ZQELSWXNX35M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera! It came with a selection of low cost accessories, but overall it was a great value. Buying the camera and card alone would cost about the same as this whole kit. The camera bag is of good quality and holds everything nicely. The extra lens attachments are very useful and take up much less space in the bag than buying an extra lens would.  The tripod works, but is of low quality. The legs are stable and it does have two bubble levels, but it tends to drop a little under the weight of the camera. It doesn't rotate smoothly, but you can't expect much from a plactic tripod.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Item I've ever brought on AMAZON!", "Author": "YoshiCWest", "ReviewID": "R260T2KVF8P7IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my item promptly. I absolutely love it!!! I have yet to find anything wrong with my camera. Everything was received as promised and brand new might I add. Also, I was missing my UV Filter, but didn't realize it until it was sent to me separately with a apology note. I thought that was the greatest thing that I did not have to even contact the seller and they realized I was missing this one piece and sent it. Just awesome.

The bag is very durable, but the tripod is cheap and plastic. The wide angle and the telephoto lenses work nicely but when not zoomed you can see a black ring around your pic's. The remote, extra battery,and sd card, are probably the only \"good\" accessories in this kit but overall this kit is very good.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best bang for your buck!", "Author": "Ly.", "ReviewID": "R3PQ45X87FRN5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package deal is incredible. The thing that sold me the most on it was the 32GB memory card as other package deals either off 8GB or no card at all for the exact same price. The package arrived very quickly (4 days after ordered) and everything was packaged safe and sound.The camera itself is great for those just starting out and veterans as well. It has many different options and settings that are clearly explained and easy to see the difference with which makes learning this camera easy and fast.The only thing in this package deal that i wasn't impressed with was the self-remote.

The kit I bought it with, and the price...EXCELLENT! Purchased this about 3 months ago and everything is working in top condition as expected.
