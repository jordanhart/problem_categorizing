What I missed was that not all Whistler inspection cameras that look the same in the ads have the ability to record to an SD card. No wonder the seller had the lowest price. This one has no SD slot. Be sure to check this feature before ordering. Also, the focus depth of field is very narrow. No way to focus this camera on the subject in \"view\". Still, for the low cost it's a good entry level, non-pro camera for the average user.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Whistler Inspection Device", "Author": "RC", "ReviewID": "R912BP4OL5HTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product works exceptionally well.  With Blue-Tooth transmission of the image captured by the probe, your assistant can view what is being photographed by the probe or, alternatively, you can leave the Monitor attached to the probe's handle and view the picture yourself.With variable control of light intensity, the camera can be controlled to provide the best view of the environment in which it is being employed.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good unit for price.", "Author": "Keith Jones", "ReviewID": "R3V5YJ0ZX8S2FL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has a color screen.  You must charge the screen overnight before first use.  4 AAs go in the handle.  I used the Whistler WIC2409C all day.  The screen has contrast, brightness and orientation buttons.  The orientation button is very useful because as you twist around with the camera your image may turn upside down.  This button sets the image back right side up.  The color screen is also detachable and works wirelessly.  This screen is very convenient because you can lay it anywhere while you shove the WIC2409C inspection cable into an inaccessible area.  Also, this screen has a video-out port, which I connected to a 19\" computer screen.  But all I needed was the detachable screen with wireless connection.  Finally, this inspection camera has four small LEDs on the tip.  But for behind walls these small LEDs are like a small flashlight in an underground cave.  Therefore, I taped a mini LED flashlight on the camera end with electrical tape.  Then I turned the mini flashlight on and fed the camera into my cieling.  I had more than enough light and could see around 10 feet between the joists of my cieling.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Whistler WHIWIC2409C Wireless Inspection Device Whistler", "Author": "Dennis W.
