I wanted to discuss the Focus Kit. Everything arrived without damage but packaging was poor, when I picked it up from UPS I couldn't believe I had a $1000 purchase in this crappy box. The camera and lenses were as advertised, although the 55-250 didn't come in factory packaging. The Focus bag and tripod are cheap. The extra lenses seem okay I'm not a skilled enough photographer to judge them. The extra battery and Sony 32GB class 10 SD card a nice.

Other reviews explain the contents, the bundle. I was quite pleased. The only suggestion I have is that there should be an itemized shipping list, an invoice. There were 17 separate items in the package. It was a complicated order. I could not believe that there was no shipping checklist for the customer to use upon opening the box. Turns out Focus did a nice job packing and all the contents were included; but I was quite worried for a couple hours until I figured out that all was in order. I actually made my own Excel checklist. I cut and pasted text from the Amazon description, parsed the text, numbered the list to come come up with 17 items, and then compared to actual box contents.1 Canon EOS Rebel T5i 18.0 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touchscreen and Full HD Movie Mode (Body) -2 Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Zoom Lens -3 Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens -4 Telephoto Lens Set -5 Wide Angle Lens Set -6 3 pc Filter Kit: UV/ Polarizing filter/Fluorescent correction & Case7 32 Gigabyte SDHC Secure Digital Memory Card -8 Focus Secure Digital USB Card Reader -9 Focus Universal Memory Card Wallet -10 Focus Pack of LCD Screen Protectors11 Additional LP-E8 Rechargeable Lithium-ion Replacement Battery Pack -12 Focus Well Protective SLR Camera Gadget Bag w/Pockets & Strap13 Focus Full Size 59\" Tripod W/Case -14 Focus DVD Guide to Digital SLR Cameras -15 Focus Digital Grey Card Set for color correction - Focus Digital Grey Card Set for color correction -16 Focus 5pc Dlx Lens Care & Cleaning Kit -17 HDMI cable for HDTV", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "T5I CAMERA AND LENSES", "Author": "Aaron J Coleman", "ReviewID": "R2Q02KS71FJ339", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am new to this whole camera thing so i did as much research as possible and the bundles that are on sale at Amazon were the way to go. However you still get a bunch of stuff that you don't really need or can't use. for exam the two usb cables one is a general cable the other is this high speed gold hd cable. Second the bag is way to small for the stuff it comes will to pack in there.  and the real shocker was this 2ft x 1ft x 1ft box that came all damage to my front door. I took a bunch of picture of it before i opened the box thats openings were probably had 6-8 strips of packing tape on it. Then as I opened the box  but what should appear the entire bundle with NO packing peanuts paper nothing for protect. I think its pretty poor for a company to go cheap when your paying this much money for a product that they will not get an appropriate size box and no bubble wrap or anything to put in there for protection. The smaller boxes where all damaged and items had fallen out of them. I opened the camera box and there was a attest bubble wrap on it but the lens cap for the bod was of and the sd card was tossed in there. I was able to locate everything to test it all and it worked but the shear carelessness is disgusting.  All in I would spend the extra money to go with a different company who actually cared about packaging their products so they don't get damaged on there way to you. I give the product 4 stars and the service 2 over all they get a 3", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "the camera is very good", "Author": "Oscar W.

It is completely silent and extremely fast when using auto focus with video and is one of few lenses that actually have a functioning stability control. All the goodies and 55-250 lens are great too.

The other items really make this a bargain. The camera bag is good quality and holds everything but the tripod. The tripod is a nice, lightweight one with a carrying case -so much easier to transport to locations than my heavy one! The inclusion of a 32GB sd card and an extra backup battery is great. I shot all morning yesterday and didn't even fill a third of it. The larger lens is an excellent compromise between zoom capability and more close-up work - you don't have to be 9 feet away if something closer catches your eye.
