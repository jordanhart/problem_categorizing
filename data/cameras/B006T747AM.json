{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Flip-Screen Point-And-Shoot In Its Class", "Author": "Holly", "ReviewID": "R3S61FXTV17BFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a mother of two young children, and my husband does not take pictures.  Therefore, my primary method of documenting my presence in their young lives is to take self portraits, and for that reason, I have always considered a flip/swivel screen to be a mandatory feature on all my digital cameras.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a bit of a niche feature, largely phased out of point-and-shoot cameras.  Many of the bulky SLR cameras have a flip/swivel screen, but unless you're setting it up on a tripod, you can forget about one-handed self-portraits.  Even most of the \"point and shoot\" varieties are still too bulky to fit comfortably in a pocket.  But Samsung seems to have finally hit my sweet spot with this small, sleek, fully-featured, highly capable, flip-screen camera.  Here are some of the features that stand out:Controls:  Very clean and simple.  You can see from the pictures that there aren't many buttons.  That is because most of the features are accessed from the touch screen.  The touch screen is very responsive to touches and swipes, comparable in my experience to iPhone touch screens.  However, as with other touch screens, you will not be able to operate the touch screen while wearing gloves, so if you plan on taking lots of outdoor photos in the winter, you might want to invest in some gloves with conductive fingertips, or make your own using metallic thread (I saw a DIY article on it somewhere).  The main menu has no less than five screens of options, including various photo and video shooting modes, scene selections, novelty modes, etc, but Samsung thoughtfully made this customizable so that you can put the options you use most on the first screen.  While you're in shooting/viewfinder/review mode, icons for any available options will pop up with a simple touch of the screen, but are otherwise hidden for a clean, uncluttered screen.Flip Screen: LOVE it.  Although the screen only flips upward 180 degrees (it is not fully articulating like some of the other flip-screen cameras I've had), the camera itself is small and handy enough to rotate the body of it to achieve any viewing angle you want.  I am a short woman and like to be able to take pictures above the heads of people in a crowd.  By holding the camera upside down and angling the screen down towards me, I have an excellent high view and can still easily press the shutter button with my left thumb.  Even better, the camera has an internal accelerometer that senses its position, and automatically rotates pictures taken from an upside-down position.  And the fact that the flip screen is also a touch screen means that the menu is handy even when the camera is pointed toward you, making it easy to set your options for your self-portrait.Picture/Video Quality: I'm only an amateur photographer, but I am very happy with the picture quality.  The light balance and color are great, and the focus is sharp.  I have read on professional reviews that indoor pictures without flash tend to be a bit \"noisy\", but I never noticed this until I read about it.  I think the light balance is just fine indoors, but you will want to use the fill-in flash for best color and quality.  I love the 5X optical zoom.  The camera focuses well and is nicely stabilized even when zoomed out fully, and with the 16.1 MP resolution, you can capture great detail even far away.  The video quality is terrific and outputs nicely even to our 50-inch HDTV.  And with a recording resolution of 1280 x 720, you can even get display-quality still photos (1MP) from individual video frames.Panoramic Photos: Easily the best panoramic mode I've had on a camera.  Rather than stitching together overlapping still photos, it allows you to pan from one side to another for a seamless panoramic photo, capturing up to 180 degrees of vista, although you will get a bit of a \"bubble\" effect when capturing such a large panorama.  It can also take vertical panoramas.3D picture capability:  I was underwhelmed with this.  The fact is, in order to see your 3D photo, you need to output to a 3D TV.  We have a Samsung 7000-series plasma TV, which itself has the ability to up-convert 2D content into 3D.  In comparing a 3D photo taken with the MV800 and a 2D photo taken the MV800 and rendered as a 3D picture on our TV, I could see no appreciable difference.  I suspect that the camera and the TV use the same technique for calculating depth in a 2D field.  Of course, I did not buy this camera for that feature, so this didn't put me out at all.On-the-fly photo/video switching: With young kids, you never know whether the next moment will be best captured with a still photo or a video.  For that reason, I've always resented cameras that make you flip a switch in order to switch between still photo and video mode, which would frequently result in me accidentally taking a video when I wanted a photo, or vice verse.  My favorite cameras have had a dedicated \"record\" button separate from the shutter button, but this seems to be a somewhat rare feature as well.  Samsung partially addresses this by adding a touch-screen \"record\" button to the \"Smart Auto\" camera mode.  That is, in \"Smart Auto\" camera mode, I can take a photo by pressing the shutter button, or take a video by touching the \"record\" button on the touch screen.  Otherwise, to switch between photo and video modes, you have to access the main menu.Battery life: I haven't really gotten a feel yet for how well the battery holds up.  One review I read said it only takes 100 to 120 shots on a charge, but it seems like I've been able to take more than this on a full charge, depending on how often I use the flash, and importantly, how much time I spend fiddling with the menus in between shots (the LCD uses battery power too).  When I've been disappointed with the battery, it's usually because I didn't charge it fully before using it, or I've been taking a lot of flash photographs.  I will say that the battery life indicator, which has three bars, seems to go from full to nothing very quickly.  I've heard from other owners of Samsung cameras that this is a common problem.  My guess is that each bar represents approximately 33.3% charge, so three bars could indicate as little as a 67% charge.  My advice is not to rely on the indicator as to whether your battery is fully charged or not.  The best way to know if it is fully charged is to charge it fully right before using.  It's also not a bad idea to have a charged backup battery on hand for those long events.  You can get compatible batteries for as little as $15, they are well worth the investment.In summary, I believe this is a sweet, intelligent little camera that is just crammed features.  It's almost as if Samsung had consulted me personally in designing this thing, they have paid such close attention to the details that are most important to me.  I think it would be hard to find a camera with a better balance of size, picture quality, and features.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great shoot and point by Samsung but...", "Author": "ecrz1992", "ReviewID": "RY5S364SEFT7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera a lot! It's very stylish and I love how the LCD screen flips to take self pictures. It is built pretty sturdy so I wouldn't worry about it breaking at all...just be careful not to drop it of course. It has great HD quality videos and it looks better than what I expected. Picture quality is great and clear but since it has 5x zoom you really can't take pictures of objects that are pretty far, but that's not a big deal. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because this camera is not the best when it comes to indoor low light areas. I set it to Smart Auto picture mode and that didn't help to make pictures look too clear. Maybe by playing with the other settings I might find out how to take low light pictures and I might just try that. But since I really don't take pictures indoors, it's really not a big concern for me.Bottom Line: If you like to take outdoor pictures, want to have a good HD quality video, and like to take pictures of yourself and/or with another person then go ahead and get this camera!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "mamie", "ReviewID": "R1SFE1WVDSSHHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "3d pics and panaroma features are awesome. pics are superb! i like the flip out part too, u never cut ur own head off!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my camera", "Author": "Mrs Latti", "ReviewID": "R3UNITBMPM5WLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my camera it takes very sharp  pictures.

So far I haven't seen anything that indicates that I can force the camera to take a picture with a flash. So, trying to take pictures of my new kitchen and my new hanging lights, if those lights are on the camera will automatically turn the flash off and you just get a picture of something glowing.The features of this camera are pretty neat. You can edit your pictures and take pictures with different effect automatically and taking 2D and 3D panoramic photos is convenient. The fact that the screen adjusts to any angle is pretty neat too.Another down side is the zoom. This wouldn't even be a good camera for taking to the zoo. The camera on my phone would work just as well.If I hadn't bought this on amazon for $80 less than in stores, this would be returned.Personally, I think I  should have stuck with Nikon.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung MV800", "Author": "E Rodriguez \"Beat\"", "ReviewID": "R1OZE83LGD4KGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "buen producto, compacto y simple de usarllego por el servicio postal, tardo 30 dias en llegar, en buenas condicionesen general bastante bien", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera was everything and more", "Author": "Randi Nicole", "ReviewID": "R15LS7CTNFURTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera cause I have been in search of an affordable camera that had a flip out screen.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R1ENVUXPKTP640", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small camera with a flip screen for low level photography of children and cats. I've had this camera for several months now and people ask where can they get one like this. What I like about this camera is you can hold it steady like a waist level viewfinder as on a twin lens reflex. I idea of holding a camera out at arms length just rubs me the wrong way. It takes excellent  close-up shots. Also it takes MP4 movies so I can edit on my PC without buying the extra software.  Remember to keep an eye on the battery level for at first it didn't seem to last to long, but now it seems to last a long time. Low light ability is very good, it doesn't flash when I think it should but the pictures come out excellent. Some times I put it on fill-flash if I feel the situation demands it, because it doesn't have a flash always on button. The touch screen is great, so you have a minimum of external buttons to fuss with, just leave it on smart auto and you can't go wrong.Great pictures without the bulk of a super zoom. From my experience wide angle lens is more important than super telephoto ( which seems like a marketing gimmick anyway). So a 5x zoom is more than enough, and to take great pictures you need to take your camera with you. And with this camera, you definitely want to take it with you.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!!", "Author": "BAM", "ReviewID": "R2BWW13K6MGT1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera SUCKS!!!

It's really annoying because the message doesn't disappear unless you hit the OK button which seems easy, but the screen is calibrated so horribly that you have to figure out where to actually touch. I also checked, there is no option to re-calibrate the screen. With the panoramic option, it tells me every time that the direction of the picture has changed so it can't take the picture and this also pops up in a message with the phantom OK button. The 3D option is crap, it's just a zoomed in warped version of the regular pictures.  Oh and you can't take pictures too fast, even when not using the flash, you have to wait until the little red flashing symbol for the flash disappears before you can take your next picture.

It is SO USEFUL when you want to take a self picture of yourself or you and your friends. With the price, the quality of the pictures can't be beat. I am upgrading from an old Sony camera that is only 3 years old and I must say this is way BETTER. The only problem I have with this camera is even though my battery is charged, once in awhile it will say something like 'Battery is not fully inserted' Even sometimes when I just turn it on..It will SHUT OFF after that automatically. I checked everything and I don't see why it would say that. I saw only one reviewer on here that have a similar problem like mine. I am not sure if this happens to many people.Anyways, other than that simple problem - I love this camera(:", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Nanou", "ReviewID": "REG2NEMI9GXFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my camera within the delivery time.

I've owned 4 cameras prior to this and before purchasing this product, I did extensive research. I read dozens of product reviews and many articles on the various functions of digital cameras. This seemed like the the right camera for me. I couldn't have been more wrong! Oh where do I begin.I have a fashion blog, so I do many self portraits, so one feature that appealed to me was the multi-view. This particular camera is just AWFUL! Because of it's slim design, if it's not stationed on a very level surface, it topples over. This remains a constant problem, as sometimes I need to prop up the camera from a certain angle and it just falls right over. I've never had this problem with my last 4 cameras. It's just poorly designed.The touch screen is ultra sensitive. HATE IT!I recently came back from vacation and 80% of my photos were ruined! Forget about nighttime photos, they are ruined. I had to use my sister's iPhone to take most of my pics because this crappy camera failed time and time and time again. Despite changing the settings multiple times in multiple lights. I have changed it to every setting available, yet when the flash is activated the photos are dark and often blurry. When it's on automatic settings, the flash comes on anyway and ruins the quality. I've missed or ruined many great shots. Needless the mention the quality is not at all as crisp as I'd expected. It's just GOD AWFUL. Sure it has many cool functions, that quite frankly I don't care about. What I care for are clear, crisp photos, at night and daytime. And to be able to take decent self-portraits. What a waste of money this was. I am currently looking to buy a Nikon or Canon. This is my second Samsung camera and NEVER again will I buy another Samsung. The first one malfunctioned after less than 4 months of usage. The lens just stuck and I never dropped it or damaged it in any way, and it's not worth paying to get fixed.Just about the only good thing I can say is that the battery doesn't die quickly. Otherwise I HATE IT! Too bad it's too late to return. I am extremely disappointed!!!
