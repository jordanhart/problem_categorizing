I have had nothing but trouble with the new camera and there is NO SUPPORT from the manufacturer.  I have written their support team and have received 0 response.  The camera will not accept the brand new memory card I purchased as they recommended.  It will not format it and there are no directions to format it on their website.  I feel like I just took the seventy dollars I spent on this camera and threw them out the window.  I will not give this product even a single good comment.  Very unhappy that I have to go out and buy another camera.  In the meantime, I have lost precious time since my new grandson will not be this age (two months) ever again.  I will never purchase another Cobra product, EVER.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Was this a Joke?", "Author": "Sarah Pollard \"review all the items!\"", "ReviewID": "R1PTEJW7WUSF3X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, this camera is red, so if you were looking for the one pictured please look elsewhere.Secondly, I feel foolish for buying this product. The camera is a plastic piece of junk. When it says 16 MEGApixels that is what you get. The overly sharp images taken by the camera are hilarious. Like a video-game from the 1980s. I have been attacked by worthless cameras as of late and this was the final straw.You were probably drawn in by the low price. Don't waste your money. I bought a better quality camera at a certain blue and white store for the same price. This was more convenient as I am currently home for the holidays. If you find the pixel-ey images hilarious enough to give the camera a chance it won't even allow a memory card so you can store more pictures. I tried a 256mb Sandisk SD Card and a 8 gb Sandisk SDHC Card. Maybe I should have tried a different brand but I didn't count on having another expense so soon.If not for the memory problem the camera might have been worth it as I wasn't expecting the highest quality. I didn't bother to test any of the additional software. It comes with a disc (likely for the drivers), an HDMI cable, LI battery, wrist strap, small bag case-thing, and usb charger (I hope you have an adapter), and the handy-dandy User's Manual (which is useless).If I could rate this lower I would.Pros: It is very polite when you shut it off, \"Goodbye\".Cons: You probably won't turn it back on.This may be a good deal if you want spare parts.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.95", "Features": "2.7-inch LCD display\n16.0 Megapixel\n720P High-Definition Video With Sound\n8X Digital Zoom\nCompatible With Secure Digital Cards to 16 Gb", "Name": "Cobra Digital DCA1650 16 MP Digital Camera with 8 x Digital Zoom (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gr2F3XKOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000I00OEY"}}
