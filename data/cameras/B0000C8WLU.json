Cernese", "ReviewID": "RTBLIHSS6ZO1D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been holding off buying another digital camera until the price tradeoff and quality was right.  This was a good deal for the image quality and ease of use.  The 8x optical zoom is a pleasure.  With or without the Digital Flash feature, this camera does an amazing job figuring out appropriate lighting situations and adjusting accordingly.  The macro mode delivers beautiful crisp close-ups.I compared many shots at 5MP between the top two compression settings and it's very hard to tell the difference, both are excellent.  It does not provide a \"raw\" format, however, but it does not seem necessary.I'm disappointed is the slow reaction times after pressing the shutter.  I knew this ahead of time, but you have to get used to it.  This seems typical of affordable digital cameras. The autofocus speed is less than stellar.  Also, the \"burst\" mode seems almost useless.  It's a good idea, but because of variable focus time and SD-card write times between shots, you have no idea what's in frame or whether or not it's in focus.  Again, only big-bucks gets past these issues.I took several hundred photos on the first day, at least half of which were action shots outdoors in fading light.  Most of them were surprisingly impressive quality and focus, only a few had out-of-frame or out-of-focus subject due to the shutter lag.Overall, I'm very pleased.  This camera will hold me long into the next generation of affordable digital cameras (I'm still drooling to replace my Nikon SLR, this camera does _not_ do that!).", "Date": "December 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "wonderful camera", "Author": "James Locke", "ReviewID": "RTNKEK58DH2JA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second digital and my best.

I haven't bought this camera at Amazon, I bought it at Business Depot. To be short, I would agree with almost all negative reviews about lacking some features in this camera but it does the job.About a negative review given by Steven Kozuch. Steven, you probably got a camera with a manufacture defect. I had something like this with the first Kodak DX6490, everything was wrong and it was freezing every few minutes. The second one was okay. Steven, I tried to reproduce you problems and I couldn't. I had reviewed more than 300 pictures/images (from the internet, my friends and myself) taken by all three cameras and the HP 945 was the best. Indeed, non of the digital cameras can give you the same quality as a film camera in the same class, so you can really compare them when you have a chance to put one next to another under the same conditions.The HP 945 was the fastest in getting focus and it was the best in white balance and it was the best in image quality and it was the best in taking pictures in low light and without any light at all (only flash).Sure, there are better cameras, but as many people are excited about Kodak DX6490 I can say, take the pictures and compare them, be very picky about image quality, the rest you can live with.", "Date": "January 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Love The HP-945", "Author": "Terry Myers", "ReviewID": "R2F2W4PX5NWROT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had mine for about 3 weeks.I am still using the batteries that came with it.I have taken about 300 pictures.It takes very Sharp pictures.The 8x Zoom is outstanding.The Auto-Eye start EVF and large LCD are very good in Low light or Sunlight.LCD Gains Up so it can be used in Very Low Light.Even the digital zoom seems to be sharper than usual.Very low red-eye,uses 4AA Batteries,Aperture Priority,Shutter Priority,Low light Focus Assist Lamp.Lots of Advanced settings Video with Sound,and just Plain Fully Automatic.I also bought one for my Wife.I think it is a Very Outstanding 5.3mp Ultra-Zoom Digital Camera.Lots of Very Nice Features.Other Family Members also own HP-945 and They Love it too.It is Very Easy for beginners.Advanced settings for Advanced users.Help is built into Camera Menus.I Highly Recommend the HP-945.", "Date": "December 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great value, very good image quality.", "Author": "\"cahsolo\"", "ReviewID": "R1RXPD84NRQK6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm customer from south east asia (sorry about my english).I bougth this camera last week (not from Amazon) and have taken about 200 photos.

New camera worked nice but battery charging seemed to go on and on even after just couple of pictures. Started me to wonder.  Pictures were fine and the learning curve was easy. AS I needed a bigger card I went ahead and purchased a 256 MG SD card after checking with HP Support.Now the strange problems start -- the camera would lock up and only unlock if batteries were removed. Pictures taken seem OK but sometimes it would say it couldn't read the 256 Mg Secure Digital Card. Then once it was rebooted it would record pictures and upload to the computer. Finally today it locked up again so I called and they want it returned for repair - as usual good service they even pay the courier.  The HP rep however told me that loading pictures from a 256 MG card to a Win 2000 Operating System may not work and that I might need to get a card reader. Whoa this is getting really off base - camera goes down within two weeks and a 256 MG card may not work with my Win 2000. This is starting to get me a little upset. No mention by anyone in reviews or on the HP Support site about Win 2000 issues with this camera and 256 MG card.

I upgraded because the 730 was a little feature-limited -- but it's also much cheaper.  I contrast this one with my nice Minolta film SLR, and quite frankly the HP is superior in every situation except action.First: ease of use.  I find that I can \"set it and forget it\" if I want to, though I'm the kind of photographer that fiddles around.  It works for fiddling too -- the only thing you CAN'T do is run a fully manual mode.  (You can set either aperture or shutter speed to manual but not both.)  There is an impressive range of options for flash, white compensation, focus, mode and more.  The zoom button is well-positioned and fits right under my thumb with my index finger on on the shutter release.  The flash release can also be operated by touch without moving your hand.  Buttons to adjust flash mode and focus (macro, infinity, etc.) are on the back of the camera and work very quickly.Second: zoom and lens.  I cannot say enough good things about this zoom.  When I change from, say, 2x to 6.5x, it takes the camera about half a second to refocus.  It works smoothly except for a deliberately designed hesitation between optical and digital zoom.  (I don't use digital zoom.)  One good thing is that the lens does *not* move based on the focal length.  As far as the lens, I get pictures of quality comparable to my SLR which has a Quantaray lens.  The lens sometimes gets a little cranky in super-humid or high-wind conditions, but I'm referring to near-gale and tropical level here, conditions that get to a lot of lenses.Third: size.  Yes, size, as well as shape.  It is very easy to hold this camera steady because it's big enough to wrap your hands around instead of needing to use a finger or two with a super-small camera.  In addition, the handgrip is perfectly positioned.  At the same time, the camera is small enough to go practically anywhere.  I take it everywhere I took the 730 without any difficulty at all, and it's actually a little easier to handle.Early reviews have indicated a problem with horizontal lines in the pictures.  I've never experienced this, nor has the camera ever locked on me.  I have heard that these were design flaws in early production models that have been corrected in later ones.Okay, now, here's the bad stuff.  No camera is perfect, including this one.First, if you want to take a lot of action shots: SKIP THIS CAMERA.  Processing time is waaaaaaay too slow for that.  I can planespot with this camera but only by predicting the location of the plane 2-3 seconds in advance.  Most of my work involves stills or low-speed action so I don't have a problem, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who does a lot of sports.Second, mine is a bit of a battery hog.  I do well to get 1-1/2 hours out of a single set of 2000 mAh NiMH rechargeables.  This is partly because of my tendency to leave the camera on (it has a 6 minute shutdown but that can be reduced; mine's on 3), but I usually end up changing batteries at least twice in a typical 2-3 hour shoot.  That being said, the fact that this camera uses standard AA batteries which you can get ANYWHERE -- same can't be said for lithium batteries -- means that power isn't all that much of an issue.Third, at 8x maximum optical zoom, this camera's not very forgiving about hand shake.  Get out your tripod unless you're in bright light.  That being said, zooms in general are less forgiving.  Many people get blurry pictures with this camera because they do not realize that you must hold your hands still for about a second and a half thanks to the longer-than-average processing time (see above about action).  I'm contrasting with an SLR so I'm used to holding still, but someone who isn't used to that will probably have problems.In closing I should emphasize that the 945 is NOT a digital SLR.  It does not have a TTL viewfinder and it does not have a hot shoe.  But it's got practically everything else -- including compatibility with a nice selection of add-on lenses -- and should fit the needs of everyone except sports fans, hardcore enthusiasts and trick/specialty photographers.  You'll only take mine from \"my cold, dead hands.\"", "Date": "May 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "A good but not great camera", "Author": "S. Peterson", "ReviewID": "R200YCSBC6VXVY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my Photosmart 945 about 8 months ago, having previously owned and liked an HP 912c.  If you're wanting to get something better than a point-n-click camera but not go all out to a prosumer/professional camera, this would be an ideal choice.  I recently got a Minolta A200 for my regular shooting, but still keep this one as a secondary camera.The 945 looks like a real camera, and fits your hand like a \"real\" 35mm.  If you've got big hands or used real film cameras, it'll feel just right.  (Note to manufacturers: quit making new cameras so small, and no more funky looking boxes with a lens stuck on.)  Even though it's made of plastic the camera has a solid quality feel to it, and that does make a difference in how you feel toting it around.The biggest advtantage for newer users is the menu system is very easy to use, linear and simple to figure out.  The menus are accessed by a simple four button ring switch with a cental button, plus: the menus have instructions!  That's right, HP put in little guides so if you don't know what white balance is you can find out right then and there.The pictures are very good, but are held back from greatness by being a little on the soft side.  You can set the sharpening up a little in the camera or fix it by editing in Photoshop.  FYI it's always better to start out a little soft than be too sharp.  For shots at low shutter speeds you have to hold it very steady. (or just put it on a tripod and use the timer switch.)It does have a generous 15 second maximum exposure for night shots, and I found out recently that this camera can pick up infrared, although I think most cameras can just people don't know it.  If you don't believe me, make a movie clip and point your TV remote control at the lens and start pressing buttons.Another advantage is this camera uses readily available AA batteries and dime-a-dozen SD cards.  However, as with nearly all AA cameras you're best to get NIMH rechargeables and use regular AA's only in an emergency.There are some faults, however.  The camera, or at least mine, is very slow writing to the memory card no matter how fast a card you have.  I think the hardware is simply limited.  It's happened a few too many times I take 2-3 shots, wait a second, then can't take another for 4-8 seconds until the buffer clears out.  Also, the movie mode is at the very small resolution of 288X208 and clips are limited to 60 seconds.  I was distinctly not impressed with the movies it made.Probably one of the unique features is the adaptive lighting, which I think they're calling digital flash now.  Basically it takes dark parts of images and lightens them, which can help if you're taking a picture of a strongly backlit subject.  It works, but you can also do the same thing in Photoshop.  However, a feature is a feature and if you're Photoshopless it can fix some otherwise bad shots.Overall I was satisfed with the camera, but felt limited by the softness (most people don't notice it) and the very slow memory writing.  I also didn't like the always-exposed LCD display, but so far I've kept from scratching it.  The lens cap comes with an attaching string to the camera.  (Thank you!)  It works on either a Mac or PC, and as a \"professional\" looking camera that can take AA's and SD cards it's a plus.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Awesome image quality, a little slow but manageable.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"buddyroo\"", "ReviewID": "R6AWGARXJF6V9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 3 months now, and while I agree with other reviewers that it can be a bit slow and you sometimes have to have a steady hand, I've gotten fairly used to using it and love it now.

Although there is a battery indicator, I have found it only somewhat reliable when it is \"close\" to being completed used and some times it will freeze within a few photos, other times I can take 30-40 more pictures.  I always have a spare set of batteries on hand and unless I am concerned about missing a photograph, I will use the batteries until the camera freezes.(b) Very infrequently the image will be unable to focus and captures a blurred photograph -- the camera cannot seem to focus on a clear picture regardless of proximity.  Sometimes just refocusing with the zoom or changing the mode may help.  Sometimes I need to turn it off and back on and the problem is solved.  But as always ... what I see is what I get.  (Not a manual focusing problem ... it is the internal mechanism \"in\" the camera).  Again it is rare -- but can be annoying if you do not get another photo opportunity.Now the positivesI own both the HP PS 850 and the HP PS 945.  I even bought the HP PS 945 for my mother -- I like the HP camera(a) the quality of the photographs are exceptional -- both cameras allow (clearly focused) photos to be enlarged to poster size and retain the clear/clean quality i.e. 4.1 MP (in the 850) and 5.3 MP (in the 945).(b) The ability to use the eyepiece to focus (without having to wear your prescription eyeglasses) have allowed me more flexibility.  And of course the option to use the large viewing area of the screen as an alternative allows me to see an enlarged view of the picture (better perspective of color, depth etc).(c) the optical zoom allows for a sharp picture of far away shots that typically would have been enlarged but not clear using only a digital zoom.  And by the way, even photos using the optical and digital zoom come in clear when I use a tripod ... I have been able to take photos of the pelicans in flight or fishing on the bay from my home -- typically I would have to try to get close and I would miss a picture as they would fly away seeing my approach.(d) The ability to take movie clips has been extended -- there is a longer time frame captured than with the 850 ... sound quality is average  (not great if the sound is abrupt or too loud ... example fireworks or car races or the noise from a lot of wind).(e)  As compared to the 850 - - The addition of the controls located on the top of the camera (action, auto, landscape, tv, portrait) together wih the on/off, timer and movie selections has been helpful for my mother as it is easier to access than going through the steps with the other options in the capture menu.  Personally if I am not careful, I sometimes accidently nudge the switch and may find myself using tv instead of auto or landscape ... so I am now more attentive.  The on/off switch is more sensitive in the 945 than in the 850 ... this may be a plus or a minus dependent on the user.(f) the options in the capture menu are easy to access and very well explained allowing a novice and an experienced photographer get great use out of the camera features.(g) New from the 850 to the 945 is the feature of adding a sound clip to an image ... interesting.(h) Although this is more as an aside, the Secure Digital cards whether it be an \"extreme\" or an \"ultra II\" or the original san disk (compairing the 512 MB) do not seem to differ in how quickly you can take pictures ... I am not sure the higher price for the extreme or ultra is worth the costs.(i) Oh yes, the 945 uses the higher MB cards, where as it was recommended only using the 128 for the 850.  That is nice as I can capture more images at one time without changing cards.So, best of luck ... I look forward to continued improvements by HP ... this is still the camera I would recommend.", "Date": "October 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great picture with a Very very good quality.", "Author": "Julio", "ReviewID": "R2443WCDWI8LFZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Unfortunately once I got used to that the lens motor stopped working and is stuck in the out position. and they cannot fix that problem because the HP/Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart 945 5.3-MegaPixel Digital Camera has been discontinued.don't buy it, you'll love me!", "Date": "September 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R206HFKW7X6A15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas.

It was at this point that I realized there are no options. At 5MP your files are huge 2.25 to 3MB which is fine sometimes when you want large files but if you don't you then have to go down to 1MP. That's quite a drop, who shoots in 1MP if they don't have to anymore. As for other options, you can change the compression but then your picture quality suffers because the original resolution stays the same.

I have used 3MP cameras that take better pictures then the HP 945.  I rated the camera a 1 because there are no negative values or zero to assign to this rating.To understand a little about myself, I use and have used 35 mm cameras both SLR and the disposable ones.  I have also used a couple digital cameras.  I enjoy using the disposable camera more that I do the HP 945.  I hate using disposable cameras.When I found this camera I was enthused based on the 8X Optical Zoom and the price!!  I ordered the camera and as usual shipped promptly by Amazon.  When I received the camera, I was happy with the shape and the way it fit my hand, very nicely designed.  The buttons are easy to use.  Below is a quick list of what I liked and did not like about this camera.ProsGreat Price,8 x zoom 300mm for camera buffsdesign fits hand near perfectly.Light weight,can use AA batteries non-proprietary camera sounds cam be easily shut off suing the menu. (this does not include of course mechanical noises)Cons ( a much bigger list)* Auto focus very slow.* Auto Focus will not always work, the only way I can get it to work was to power off and remove the batter is, similar to rebooting your PC.* Manual Focus very slow.* During focusing the LCD screen will periodically go blank for no reason.* 4 AA batteries went from brand new fully charged to dead within 25 pictures at the best settings.*  My 1 MP web cam has sharper images as well as my 3mp Casio.*  This is the worst feature.  The following is true when the flash is on and light is sufficient.  When you press the shutter button it may take 2-5 seconds before the shutter will release.  This occurs even when I try pressing the shutter 1/2 way for a pre-meter reading.  We all know that this time period is way too long.  By then the people or subject can be long gone.  This problem is like the auto focus problem it is unpredictable and occurs way too many times.  Out of the 25 pictures I snapped, this problem occurred on 20 of them.(I AM NOT DISCUSSING THE WRITE TIME!  THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TIme FROM WHEN YOU PRESS THE SHUTTER UNTIL IT DECIDES TO TRIP THE SHUTTER curtain.)In closing, I have to recommend that you stay away from this camera.

It was the right thing to do, because I haven't got many of the problems that people comment about on this site; my camera seems to work just fine, and although the rechargeable batteries dont work quite as well as the ones specifically designed for digital cameras, their performance is still acceptable.Now, I have to say it is true that, given a specific set of values, it takes the camera a while to take the picture, as the screen goes blank it is hard not to move and ruin the shot. However, it is also true that the same thing happens with the slow speeds on a Reflex, and its just a matter of practice until you get the precision you need in order not to ruin a shot, and if it never happens, you can always use a tripod! haha What can I say, if you are either a starter, or a professional amateur, stay away from this camera and go for a Sony or Canon instead, which have similar features and near same quality. If you are like me, a student who requires the best PC-friendly camera, stay with HP. I'm sure you will love it.", "Date": "March 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Don't make a mistake and purchase this camera.", "Author": "heidi", "ReviewID": "RY06SJWZL1FL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera took good pictures, but after 21 months of use the camera has a hardware malfunction (lens sticks and camera will not fully turn on).

The replacement was no better.You had best avoid this camera and I will never again buy any HP camera product.", "Date": "January 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great digital SLR", "Author": "Tom G", "ReviewID": "R1GE423CJW0334", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great value.  It has the best battery life of any that ive used that took normal batteries.  It does a great job at taking detail shots, and it was very easy to figure out the controls.  The veiwfinder is really cool too. Turns on when you bring your eye close, again saving battery life.

I found out through the camera guy at Costco that they stopped selling them because \" THEY R JUNK \" IM NOT KIDDING THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.Now I don't agree but you get so much more from the 707 because it has biult in MEMORY ! as well as plenty of zoom, it is so much more durrable to( hard metal! not plastic shell) I picked one up in the box and I am verry happy w/ the results I get from the H.P. 707............BOTTOM LINE the 945 looks so much more like an s.l.r. but it's too bulky and cumbersome.........the 707 fits in your pocket too and so you don't have to lugg it around your neck lookin like a TOURIST !!!", "Date": "November 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "peice of junk", "Author": "Macie Adams", "ReviewID": "R158PNN9FEUW3P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I too got took on this one. Looked great, had lots of features. Got it for my birthday what a waste of money. I bet I didn't take 50 pictures with it before it died. I also bought all the extras that went along with it. Got a lot of money tied up in this camera and can't get hp to fix it or anything. All they wanted me to do was buy another hp camera and waste more money. HP can't make cameras they better stick to computers. If you buy one of these cameras it will work fine for a while then (bam) it's dead without warning. There may be a few out there still working. If so you are one of the lucky ones to have a working one.
