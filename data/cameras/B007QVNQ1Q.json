Murray", "ReviewID": "R37ZDRTHKYMLEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The  Cannon PowerShot Elph 110 is the best little point-and-shoot camera I have seen or used. It takes excellent pictures and very good video. I love using a DSLR camera and making adjustments, but they are bigger and harder to carry around. The Elph 110 is an amazing replacement and can do quite a bit more than I would expect from a point and shoot. This is my second one of these and I am giving my older one to a friend. I carry this camera everywhere and I find battery life is excellent. That said, I keep 3 or 4 extra batteries handy, as well as SD cards. I use the fastest cards they make because I like to shoot in burst mode.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon never lets you down", "Author": "Jeffrey E.
