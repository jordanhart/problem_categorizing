I am generally a very picky shooter, I have had to lower my expectations with this camera but I feel it is a certainly capable camera if you aren't expecting it to be perfect.  Sounds like a back-handed compliment but it really isn't, this really is the only camera of its kind when you consider the size, features, and capabilities.PROS- good photo quality, in most situations- very quick and responsive from the shutterlag to the touchscreen- great features from the very good video mode(with zoom and good audio) to the panorama and hand-held twilight mode- stylish, I wouldn't buy the camera because of this but when you compare it to any other waterproof camera it makes them look toyish- memory stick pro duo AND SDHC support!- and of course its waterproof and durable, the biggest selling point.CONS- battery life is short, about average for todays small cameras but I'd recommend a spare battery for most anyone just in case.  The battery does charge fast though.- limited control, I'd love for it to have some control over saturation, contrast, and sharpness.  Aperature/Shutterspeed control would be great as well...- very saturated and 'poppy' image quality, to me it is just fine but it is not subtle and you cant really control it in camera.- awkward media cable port.  I generally do not use these and mainly just use a card reader but if I were to use the cable I wouldn't like it.Overall, if you are getting this camera for the purpose of being waterproof(and more durable than normal) then you will be pleased with everything else it offers.  There are as good or better cameras out there for specific functions but if you are looking for a camera that takes good photos, is snappy, has a bunch of fun and usable features, and is waterproof then this should be very high if not at the top of your list!", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Small, Nice Features, super fast, but variable Image quality", "Author": "Carson Lawall \"C. L.\"", "ReviewID": "R17I0PXMKLZVBD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (Sony Cyber-shot Tx5) to replace a 2 year old olympus stylus tough that had leaked and to supplement a Fuji Finepix F200 EXR with waterproof case.  This will be a little comparison for waterproof cameras and cased cameras.  Skip to the bottom if you just want to read about the cyber-shot.The olympus was a pretty good camera, mediocre to good image quality, slow as far as shutter lag, and unfortunately it eventually leaked after 2 years.  I used it for surfing pictures, which is pretty rough on a camera.  As advice for people using cameras in salt water, always rinse after and make sure the 0-rings are clean.  From reviews it appears that eventually these cameras are going to fail (cannon, olympus), so take care as best you can because it looks like the service life is about 1-3 years.  The olympus is a very good camera, but the slow shutter makes action shots a little hard to catch at times.The Fuji Finepix f200EXR is probably the best point and shoot I have ever had.  I did buy the hype about the new sensor technology and decided to try it out.  I have not been disappointed.  Very good image quality, easy to set up, automatic settings are very good.  The waterproof case is another $159 to an already expensive camera (about $350), but it has fast a shutter (very little shutter lag after you try to shoot), very fast burst, great low light image quality and it is easy to use.  The automatic technology is good, but can be variable even shooting the same subject based on the light and camera position. The drawback is that when in it's waterproof case it is very bulky and will not fit in a wetsuit sleeve.  Surfing picutures have been really good with this camera, but you essentially have to leave your board on the beach and get in the water specifically to photograph the action.  (not a very spontaneous camera).Fuji also makes an inexpensive WP camera (about $120) but the shutter lag is REALLY long (very slow to take the picture once you press press the shutter button).I also compared this with the digital elph on dry land (the elph also has a waterproof case), and the elph also takes very good pictures and might also be an option in this price range (or a little cheaper-probably the same price with the case).  The elph actually was a little better in tough backlighting situations.  Canon also makes a waterproof camera but there appears to be a lot of failures of waterproofing in the reviews, and it looked a little big so I did not try it.  The Canon waterproof camera reviews are pretty good as far as image quality so it may be worth checking out.For the Cyber-shot TX5, I found the picture quality to be very variable when set with the automatic settings (there are limited choices).  Some pictures are great, some pretty bad.  It actually can vary even when you are shooting the  same subject as repositioning the camera can change the setting and change the picture.  (If your picture turns out bad, try repositioning the camera).  Some pictures look a little too bright and colors look almost unreal...although this can be variable so rarely the pictures turn out better than even the Finepix, but most of the time the Finepix wins.  Sometimes it may have nicer looking images because they appear bright/sharp and almost unreal, but in most cases you probably won't be looking for that appearance.The burst speed is very fast (fastest of those I tested) and great for action shots.Shutter lag is minmal (comparatively for WP cameras and point and shoots).No problems with water yet.  The camera has a lower rating for depth and drop height than the olympus, and feels less sturdy.The battery life is a little shortDoesn't give very much control over the settings, but this is a point and shoot so, that's really what it is made for.The sweep panorama mode is really neat, although not something I use a lot.The biggest plus for this camera is it is very small.  It fits anywhere.  I think if you need a small camera (say one that fits in a wetsuit sleeve), that is waterproof, this is probably your best bet for a fast small camera with good image quality.Overall:for a small camerathe cybershot is a very good small camera with a lot of easy to use features.  Very fast, good for action, and portable enough to be in the action.  variable photo quality, but usually good to very good.  I'm still playing with the cybershot so there may be more good things or more bad things about it, but so far I'm fairly happy with it.  Too new to really comment on durability.The olympus, very tough, good photo quality, also small, but a little slow for action (that said I took action pictures with it for 2 years).  might be a better camera if you are going to abuse it.for image quality (using a point and shoot):may be best to get a regular point and shoot with a waterproof case. FujiFinepix f200EXR would be my vote, Very good amateur surf photography camera in the water (but can't really surf if you have the camera with you).  Tough case, rated deep enough for scuba diving.UPDATEStill working great with very nice surfing shots.  The Burst feature is excellent.UPDATEStill very tough, no leaking, good for surfing shots.  Still love the burst feature.  Little annoyances: Lens is very close to the edge of the camera, sometimes catches my finger...my fault, but very annoying.  Finding with more use that comparatively the picture quality is not that great (just variable, still sometimes is great).  Comparing a far less expensive elph, the photo-quality is consistently better with the elph.  It still takes very good pictures, and I think for a portable camera that you can take surfing, there is no equal, but outside of that niche there are cameras with consistently better photo quality. (every once in a while it still captures something amazing and different than my other cameras, but consistency is important).UPDATEdowngraded to 3 stars.  The paint on the front cover suddenly peeled off.  very odd.  Starting to get stiff with the sliding cover no matter how much you rinse it.  It is still fast, still has a great burst feature, but photoquality still variable (now I only use it in the water, other small cameras are better), inconsistent.  One new problem is that the lens cover doesn't repel water very well anymore, so sometimes it does not focus or there is a drop on the lens and you can't take a good picture until it clears.  Still is small and handy, just maybe showing it's age.

The photo quality was a toss up between the TS2 and the TX5 most of the time with the exception of tricky lighting situations.  I am typically a DSLR photographer so using a point and shoot camera is a bit like going back in time.  However, with the Sony TX5 it did not completely feel this way.  Having a CMOS sensor instead of a CCD (like most other point and shoot cameras) gives this camera better low light shooting performance.  If you are more into shooting video than stillshots, the TS2 might be a better choice as they have a better video capture encoding than Sony (not that Sony's is bad by any means) but Panasonic's is better.Things I love most about the TX5:-It feels good in your hand and looks good too!  It doesn't look like it is trying to convince you with its rivets and armor look that it is tough... it just is and remains stylish and sexy at the same time.  Kudos to that!-The TX5 has a a great \"Intelligent Auto\" shooting mode that picks the best settings for you based on your composition and light meter readings.  Whether your subject is backlight (where the camera will take an underexposed image and an overexposed image and blend them together to make a high dynamic range photo (handheld) which is quite impressive, or you are shooting in low light handheld and the camera will shoot many shots in rapid succession and make the best photo it can from the group, to the specialized scene modes for underwater, snow, beach, fireworks, high speed shutter for sports/action shots, etc... they all do what they claim.-This camera has one of the fastest start up times and also will shoot at 10 frames / second which is amazing for a point and shoot camera!-Sony finally got smart and allowed the owners to use SD cards in Sony cameras... its about time!Things I don't really love about the TX5:-This camera has only one spot on the whole body to attach any kind of tether.  I know many p&s; cameras are this way with their little wrist lanyards but it would be great if they could put a matching one on the other side so I could use a neckstrap or something to hold the camera hands free while shooting video, etc.-While the images generally look good, there are some photos that do come out less than stunning.  Sometimes \"Intelligent Auto\" mode selects the wrong preset and the results are not pretty.-The touchscreen is a bit oversensitive and often I find myself accidentally pushing buttons when I didn't mean to.-The camera is so thin and with almost the entire rear being a touchscreen, there is not much to hold on to.  Sometimes it can be slippery in the hands and hard to hang on to.-The lens is fairly wide but if Sony really wants to compete with adventure/sports cameras like the GoPRO HD, it needs a wider angle lens (or attachment).While the photos generally look good and the in-camera editing much more useful than most other cameras, any prints bigger than 5x7 (depending on the light conditions the photo was shot in) and you may start seeing the noise reduction and/or sharpening artifacts that Sony uses in the their cameras to make better straight out of camera photos.Bottom line : After testing the top 3 contenders in the waterproof/freezeproof/and tough cameras, I know I made the right decision to go with the Sony TX5.  It is fun to use, versatile, captures some great photos with minimal effort (regardless of being on a beach mid-day or en la discotecta at night)... This camera ROCKS!  I woudl recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to have to baby and worry about their camera getting wet, dropped, etc.  Even outside the waterproof camera realm, I don't think there are many point an shoot cameras (especially in this price range) that take as nice of photos as this camera.

My wife primarily wanted a compact camera to fit in our pockets, and I wanted a waterproof/rugged camera that took good quality indoor and outdoor pictures and HD video (with the ability to zoom during video).

It was great to be able to use our good quality camera on water rides and at the pool where many other cameras couldn't go!  The underwater picture mode takes amazing high quality color pictures, and the video mode works very well underwater even at night!  My only minor complaints are that the flash is a little weak (understandable given the compact size) and that the finish gets marred with finger prints very easily (but it also wipes clean easily).

I mostly use my cameras for hiking/camping/backpacking, and when the T9 died I thought it would be really nice to have a camera that was waterproof, freezeproof, shockproof, etc.  So I bucked up and paid a premium for the Sony DSC-TX5.  At first glance out of the box, I was really impressed...nice looking camera, seems well built, all told it seemed to be a nice replacement for the T9.  Upon first use, I realized that the image quality was similar to the T9, which is to be expected from a compact point and shoot camera.The problem with this camera comes when you don't have a power outlet handy...on a full charge, taking maybe 10 or 12 pictures, the battery on the camera will last about two days.  Not particularly handy when you're out backpacking or staying places where there isn't a readily available wall outlet...the primary reason I bought this camera.  I could make the T9 last for an entire week on a hike...this TX5 will barely get me to the trailhead before the battery dies.

Our old camera is an old Nikon Coolpix 5000 (about 7yrs old) and a cheap Fuji (age unknown).  Needed a durable waterproof camera that was more modern.  Compared with other durables as Olympus and Panasonic.  Went with the Sony because of others' reviews and wife wanted the touch screen NEATO feature.Well, is this one camera for us!  Superfast shots, love the shot bursts, and awesome panorama shots of our senic views.  Family friend had an Olympus; couldn't keep up with shooting, especially on the whale watching excursion and changing camera settings.Software: Just offloaded the pics to the computer via the provided software...wow, the software is great.  Welcome me to the modern age of photo albuming I guess.  The software cataloged ALL my pics that was scattered on my computer and central albumed the pics.  Also the software has an facial analyzing tool, cool (haven't tested it yet though).Beware:  DO NOT BUY the off-brand replacement batteries at this time even though they classified to fit this camera because they do NOT.  I bought 2 of them, 1 each from different suppliers and none fit.  They're too large.  Arghhh, oh well, they're cheap, tossed them out for recycle at HOMEDEPOT.  Went and got 2 originals from a big box store, was in hurry for trip.Battery: I guess for their tiny size, their longevity is okay; most days on the vacation, only consumed 1 battery life, but the more video shots you make, the faster the battery consumption.  Only 1 day on our vacation did I actually had to utilized the 3rd battery.Bought a 16gig SD card w/ camera, wasn't sure how much I really needed for the vacation trip so I overdid it with capacity.  I roughly figured that 16gig/10meg=1,600 shots.  Well, it actually came out to about some 3,000 available shots when I installed the card at max resolution.  The camera was so fun to shot, we nearly filled up the card at about 2,700 shots taken during the 1 week trip.  Never did we take so many pictures before.... owe it to the camera, it was a plearsure to use.Touch screen: finger prints wasn't a problem.  After we got used to the location of the icons, the touch screen us super fast vs the old buttons and toggle method.  You end up using both index fingers on your hand to make setting changes.With this camera, we really came into the modern age in our picture taking (didn't use the word photography because I don't consider myself one).

One of the first things I noticed was how slim and nice it looked. Compared to the other waterproof cameras I saw, this one definitly stood out because of its styling, and being waterproof. I was looking for a \"durable\" camera because I take mine everywhere. This one seemed like an ideal camera because I do take more-then-the-average person \"artsy\" shots, but also it was waterproof. I am really pleased with the image quality of this camera. Comapared to other waterproof cameras I tested, this one's image quality seemed much better, and I am telling you, it is! I especially like the low-light settings, which seem to work really well. Another part of the camera that i like and appreciate taking closer shots, is the function where you can tap the touchscreen to tell the camera where to focus. this is really useful in close-ups where the camera will not focus where you want it to. Another thing i like is the panorama shot, which contrary to popular belif (in reviews that I read) you can use it with just your hands and it works perfectly fine.Now for the [few] cons. One of the first things I noticed after getting the camera wet that was a little tiresome was the sliding cover smearing water on the lens. If water gets under the cover, it stays under for awhile, and puts dots on the lense if you don't wipe it off every time you open it. The only other thing that i disliked about the camera was its usb port. It is located right next to the battery compartment, and has a single flimsy door that opens to let you plug it in. It seems that this door could easily be snapped off, and thus comprimise the water-proofing of the camera.All in all, though, this camera is definitly worth investing in, if you have the cash. Higher then normal picture quality with the ability to take some really good shots, good low light photographs, and waterproofing...This camera brings it all to the table with one compact package.Update: I've had this camera for over a year now, and still love it! I noticed that they came out with a new model now, and maybe they fixed some of the cons listed above. For now, the only other cons I would add is that the paint on the front slide cover chips off, down to the metal underneath, not that big of an issue. Also, the touch screen can be a little tedious to use at first, and water seems to have gotten under the protective layer of the screen, not compromising anything but the viewing experience. Lastly, the flash is fairly weak, but that is expected from such a small camera.

This lens captures a very wide angle so the zoom can be used to narrow the field of view a bit.I originally purchased the camera to use while kayaking, so the waterproofing was a priority. I tested this in a glass of water and a sink. Video and picture functioned fine underwater and the camera is still functional afterward.

Just this weekend, I took it to the pool, had it in the water (no more than 2 ft deep) and the camera stopped working.  I took it home and removed battery with memory card and noticed that the battery and memory card were a little wet.  Obviously the water seal for the battery compartment did not do its job.  Anyway, I've left the battery compartment open to see if it would dry out and maybe work again, but it hasn't happened.

I'm not sure I will ever purchase a \"waterproof\" camera again.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I am probably a bit more experienced than a complete novice photographer, but still consider myself a casual shooter.  I have only had the TX5 for a few days now, but have had time to develop a few first impressions. Here is the breakdown of my impressions on a few features:Ruggedness -  I have not tested the ruggedness of the camera as of yet.  I have not dunked it in water, put it in the freezer, or dropped it on the ground.  The camera does seem to be well built though.  If anything, I question the ruggedness of the touch screen.  It just seems like such a sensitive feature to have on a \"rugged\" camera.  Even though its a rugged camera, I am not really experiencing a carefree mentality with it because I'm worried about breaking or scratching the touch screen.Touchscreen - The screen has an ok resolution, but is not on par with other cameras at this price range.  Just a bit disappointing.  As far as the touch operation, it seems to be pretty effective.  The TX5 responds more effectively to a \"touch\" vs. a \"tap\"  such as on other touch screen products like the iPhones. But with a \"touch\", it works nicely.Interface:  It is quite intuitive.  I have learned how to operate the camera and did not need to open the manual.  Its very nice that you can customize a quick access sidebar menu that allows you to make certain camera adjustments.  It allows you to customize this sidebar menu for each camera mode and scene selection.  Very helpful.Camera Modes: Intelligent Auto Adjust seems to work pretty well.  Its not 100% accurate for a casual shot, but no camera is.  iSweep has worked well too and is fun to use.  I think I will get good use out of Hand-held Twilight and Backlight Correction HDR modes because they do seem to help in those challenging conditions.  The high speed 10 pics per second may be a bit disappointing.  I shot at a high burst speed in lower light conditions and I got 10 blurry pictures.  Maybe it works better in brighter conditions.Photo Quality:  Overall, the camera seems to have good quality pics. Not great, but good.  This is based on how pics look on camera and computer.

First off the camera is just hard to hold.  I have small hands and still manage to get my fingers of my left hand into several of the shots.  The only way to avoid taking pictures of my fingers is the hold it tea cup style with only my index fingers and thumbs with the rest of my fingers fanned in the air, a perfect way to drop your camera.  With my last Sony, I would slide the shield down with my middle finger, and take a picture with my ring finger, all in a matter of seconds using only my right hand; no kidding!  This camera's shield is quite difficult to manage without two hands.  The shield doesn't slide easily, and I usually have to hook my fingernails in to get it open.  What's more, now that all the features are accessible only by the way of touch screen, you have to memorize where every thing is or you will be missing lots of shots.  And because the touch screen is so sensitive, if you accidentally touch the screen in between shots, you will have turned on or off a feature that you didn't mean to and you will have to figure out what you did before your next shot.  Also because the sensitivity of the playback screen, when you are reviewing your pictures, they will fly by faster than you can see them.  Forget trying to edit right on the camera, the screen is just too sensitive.  Then there is the lack of picture quality. And this is where there is just no excuse!  Many of my pictures are blurry and dark.  I have owned several digital cameras (most Sony) over the years and I've never seen so many out of focus shots.  If you don't hold the camera absolutely still, you can count on getting a glowing, double-exposure type of shadow around your subject.  The only good pictures are the ones I have taken outside.

Always cons!* Battery life is mediocre. you'll get through a day's worth  of shooting, barely (about 250 pix+some short vids for me in one day, dead battery)* The slider will open in your pocket sometimes, but that's much easier to deal with than a lens extruding* I've had the camera for about a month, and the battery indicator is burning into the lcd. tisk tisk sony.* touch screen is hard to see in bright areas.With those cons mentioned, i wouldn't recommend buying this camera until it drops below it's msrp by a bit, otherwise, this is the waterproof camera to go with.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera", "Author": "K.

The auto option is extremely versatile, it can go from close ups (less than an inch from the subject) to face recognition portraits in a flash. It is rugged as well; I put the camera through the paces, one to four feet underwater in 50-60 degree rivers for up to 45 seconds.  It lived in the pocket of my fishing vest and and the bottom of the river for the entire time (save for nightly sessions reviewing the days catch and scenery).I cannot speak to any use other than my own, but if you are looking for a small, rough & tumble, waterproof camera this exceeded my expectations in both quality of the pictures as well as durability.

Great decision on my part.  The picture quality is so much better.  While the Olympus looks more rugged, I feel that the Sony will be a lasting product as well.

The drop proof portion I would not be willing to test on purpose, but I don't really like \"drop testing\" things.  If it lives up to that, I would be that much happier.  Photo quality, both in water and out are great, in my opinion.  Video underwater is amazing too.  I couldn't believe how crisp the video was.  No regrets with this camera.

The camera shell is not the most durable, though it is strong and performs as advertised.  A fumbled handoff chipped a small amount off the corner and it appears to scratch easily, but it created zero issues with the camera or it's functionality.  The underwater filming is amazingly clear, i was very, very impressed.  This is not like a disposable waterproof clunker at all.The camera itself may not be as slim as some on the market, it is definitely the slimmest waterproof camera, and it fits comfortably in both my and my gf's hands.  Note:  The camera does not turn itself off automatically.  We learned this on a camping trip where we left the lens cover open and it drained the battery from full to empty.  It was our fault, but it would be a handy feature.So though I have pointed out a couple of flaws with the camera, it truly is remarkable how clear the images are, and how well fast images come out.  The screen is a touch screen, but it smudges very, very easily.  This was frustrating at first, but the screen is bright and it can be lived with.  It is incredibly easy to use but with some fine tuning a more advanced photographer will have an opportunity to play with some settings.

It would be great if you could adjust the auto flash exposure down a stop or so...but you can't. You can adjust the camera's exposure, but that doesn't help the flash issue.But even more strange is that once you download the photos, the flash photos...aren't so bad. In fact, there's enough difference that I don't think the display is doing an accurate job of showing what you shot with the flash, which is silly. Show me what you took, camera!But there is good news: the camera's non-flash photos are pretty spiffy. So long as you aren't shooting action, the SteadyShot makes it handholdable on wide angle down to a quarter second or so. And you can boost the ISO to 3200 if you need to (you'll get grain, but it's still better than using the flash)Some of the other features seem gimmicky (10 frames a second at full res?), but function well enough that they don't seem tacked on.If Sony would release a firmware that would give you at least some way to dampen the flash output, this camera would be near-perfect (other than the too-small battery, but you can't really have everything)", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "A pleasure to own and use.", "Author": "richard", "ReviewID": "R16OX5CXDF7GUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for several months and have nothing but praise for it.  I'd go so far as to say that it is more than what I hoped to get when I bought it in virtually all respects (OK, except for maybe battery life).  I remember how startled I was when I took it out of the box; it seemed such a little, delicate thing, almost jewel-like fresh from the wrapper.  I have owned three other \"Elements and Fools proof\" cameras and they were armored bricks; none produced very sharp images--they were designed to work anywhere first and well second.  The Sony is slim, light, and elegant, and works great.I admit that I have not put it through a torture test.  Frankly, I cannot imagine spending serious money for anything and then pushing it to see if it fails.  It is, after all, a camera, not a hammer, an anvil, or a frozen pizza. So I cannot attest to its maximal toughness.  But I often carry it in the same poocket as my keys or throw it into my \"manny purse\" in the same pocket as a Benchmark sailing knife and sundry spare change, fifteen round magazines and other potential scratching paraphenalia. I took it to Italy for two weeks and took hunderds of images, about half of which were indoors, with excellent results.  So far, no nicks or any major scratches (I don't get why so many reviewers seem to have this problem).I have not dealt with Sony. Yet.

The last time I dealt with a camera manufacturer over a failed camera was over another brand's waterproof camera that leaked the first time I used it, on my honeymoon in Costa Rica no less. It was a miserable experience; they gave zero satisfaction, accusing me of improperly closing one of the little doors.  I was able to get a refund only by happening to be friends with folks at the shop I bought it from.  I suspect that buying a camera is really like buying a firearm, you bought it, you used it, it's yours.  Period.  You get anything more from them and that is gravy.So my TX5 is my new daily \"go to\" camera; the one I take fishing, to the beach house and to parties.

Unit seems pretty solid, and thus far has done fine banging around in pockets/car/etc.The picture quality is very good for a P&S;, and the feature set is basic, which is as it should be.The touch screen is not very responsive, and is rather slow, but no big deal, since it's used so infrequently. (Pretty much only to turn flash on and off, couldn't there have been a button for this?)My main complaint so far is battery life.  It seems like this thing goes through the battery in just 3 or 4 times using it, and that's generally without any flash usage.I would have gladly had a slightly larger form factor if I didn't have to feel like it was going to need charging every other time I picked it up.  Carrying a spare battery defeats the purpose, since the idea is the self-contained unit.  (Plus, for some bizarre reason this tiny battery takes HOURS to charge.)So, overall, I like the thing so far, just wish I didn't have to charge it nearly every time I use it to take 10 pictures.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, so so battery life", "Author": "Matthew Hengst", "ReviewID": "R2WSJTOZS232GG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this after my last point and shoot met its untimely end on the top of a half frozen sand dune in the middle of a windstorm if that tells you how I treat my electronics.  I was interested in the lack of a moving lens (the failure point of my Canon) and the fact it was supposedly toughened for outdoor use.I travel each week for work and every weekend I'm out hiking, climbing, or peakbagging somewhere and I always have my camera with me.  So far this has been everywhere from the desert to the snow and performed quite well despite freezing temperatures and a few solid impacts.I like sliding the front shield down to turn the camera on and back off as this makes it possible to work with bulky gloves in the snow though you might want to apply a rubber sticker to make it a bit easier to grip.  It does require some explaining when you have someone else take your picture though as it's different from how most cameras work.  The lens behind the shield is flat and easy to clean off if you say get the camera wet or covered in snow.I've been consistently impressed by the low light shots I've been able to capture and have a number of campfire shots that i never thought would have come out.  Also the sweep panorama mode is fun to play with though I found I like the shots better if I switch the direction to up or down and sweep the camera on its side.The biggest drawback is the battery.  I now have two spares for longer trips as I can get about 2.5 days of fairly heavy use out of each battery.  For obvious reasons HDR, panorama, and the low light settings that require processing drain the battery much faster.Also I can't say I'm a big fan of the touchscreen.  I have a number of one second videos that came about because I somehow managed to get the camera mode switched over to the movie mode when I was trying to take a picture.  Also when you do want to switch modes it's cumbersome to go through the touchscreen as opposed to a hardware switch.The cable to plug it in to the computer is non standard which is slightly annoying but you can always just pop the card out and use that.  And each time I open the small flap that covers the cable port I'm convinced I'm going to break the thing off.Oh, and the black covering is a thin foil like layer that came off after a few months of heavy use.  I'd left the sticker on the front and that patch lasted the longest but now the front slide panel is completely silver.As always with cameras the best way to get a feeling for their capabilities is to search a site like Flickr that will show you all the pictures taken by a particular model.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Boomedoc", "ReviewID": "RO7ELZ508XPQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A very good product for a very reasonable price.

Of course this is not a Divers Camera, or one to attach to the front of your ATV while diving into mud pits. Trying to get a few shots, I dropped my camera into a bubbling jacuzzi. Took me a minute to find it, pulled it out, wiped some water off the lens a bit, snap a few shots and all was fine. It is in fact a pretty sturdy point and shoot cam with some excellent results for such a cam. I got me a nice \"Shield\" screen protector and smudge problems were none existent and touch screen works great. It has a pretty intensive menu with many options, so make sure you experiment. I did, and it resulted in some awesome results. I went all out and got a 16gig add in card. You'll have plenty of play room to shoot thousands of pics and sort them out later. I had the camera now for about a year and it has came through on every occasion. Even allowed me to get some quick action shots with excellent results.

I can take it anywhere: snowboarding, biking, kayaking, snorkeling...etc. No worries. Durability is invaluable after I just drowned my poor Olympus in a river.Do your homework: read and understand the specifications before you buy it because they do not lie. You must know what the camera is capable of and find a good match for your needs or you may be disappointed.Picture quality is above my expectations: color saturation is very good in high light situations outside using exposure compensation and low light sensitivity is amazing with little noise. I am also very impressed in the macro focusing and have taken breathtaking photos of spiderwebs with incredible detail. One thing I would change, which is essential and a huge negative, is the finish on the camera should be more durable. In Sony's manual it states not to come into contact with sunscreen or it may damage the finish. Ridiculous. If it is waterproof, you will probably be taking it outside and need sunscreen. Also, use a screen protector, which should be obvious. The camera would also benefit from a viewfinder as the LCD screen is difficult to see in high light situations and you can't tell what you're taking a picture of if the sun is behind you. Lastly, note in the specifications the power of its zoom. This is not an impressive feature, so if that is important to you, look elsewhere.I find myself using the sweep panorama quite a lot and love this feature.

All the different brands have their issues when it comes to water-proof cameras.So off to the dealer I went. I tried a bunch of different brands out, and instantly fell in love with this Sony camera after trying it. It shots amazingly fast photos, and can do amazing things with them that lots of DSLR's cannot even do. I also really loved the touch screen panel. This camera has so much going for it, and I tried really hard to justify buying it, yet I decided against it. Why? Because the way it is made would cause durability issues for me. My first complaint is its smooth slippery body which will easily slip out of a person hand, especially a wet hand. Second, is that it has a lens cover that slides back and forth. I work around heavy equipment and dust and sand gets in everything and this sliding lens cover would scratch everything to pieces. Third, its a Sony. I have never had any Sony products last for more than a couple of years.I really wanted to buy this camera, yet settled on a Pentax W90 which also has known issues, but is so much more durable. (Carry it in a Lowepro Ridge 20)Be warned, these little water-proof point and shoot cameras all have their problems (water-proofness, picture quality, speed), so don't expect too much from them. But of course having a camera with you, you will at least capture the image. And these cameras will stand up to lots of abuse, compared to a normal one. If your going to submerge one of these cameras on a vacation, make sure someone else has a camera along for backup.There should be no bad reviews on a product like this if they are designed properly, so I would highly encourage you to take the rest of the bad reviews seriously.

Su dise\u00f1o la hace muy c\u00f3moda de usar y llevar.- Excelente gran angular para el tama\u00f1o.- Excelente capacidad para tomar fotos sin flash en la oscuridad.- Excelente calidad de construcci\u00f3n. Made in Japan.- Aunque monof\u00f3nica, tiene una buena calidad de sonido. No satur\u00f3 el audio aun en un concierto con alto nivel de ruido.Lo peor:- La bater\u00eda dura poco si se usa intensivamente el flash.- Viene sin memoria.- Debe abrir dos fr\u00e1giles tapas pl\u00e1sticas cada vez que desea conectarla al PC.- En d\u00edas soleados no es posible distinguir nada en el visor touch.- P\u00e9simo o no existente estabilizador de im\u00e1genes para filmaciones.- Las fotos muchas veces quedan sobre expuestas o los colores no son totalmente naturales, sobre todo si se usa flash.Conclusi\u00f3n:Es una buena c\u00e1mara para llevar siempre consigo, a todas partes y tomar fotos de calidad media r\u00e1pidamente y cualquier condici\u00f3n.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Peque\u00f1a gran camara.", "Author": "VIVIANA REYES ALARCON", "ReviewID": "R1G5YTV680F0D3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Un tama\u00f1o muy conveviente para llevarla siempre en el bolso o cartera.
