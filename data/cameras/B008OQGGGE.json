It can take photos in total Darkness and the photos come out looking like it was taken on a bright sunny day.I am the kind of person that likes to learn as i go so i turn the dial  just to see what the F800EXR can do. I also like to photo wildlife, such as Ducks Geese Bobcats, Just about anything that moves. I set it to Advance the display says Advance filter then the very top  i highlight then press the ring to the right select Hi Key. press ok and raise the flash for the perfect Photo in total darkness.SP for scene position Since i like to shoot moving targets i use sport scene.You can use the EXR mode or the auto mode. There is a lot more i have not explored so i am looking forward to a lot of fun with this F800EXR. Can i recommend this camera to anyone else? I sure can!I hope you have as much fun as i am having.PS. make sure you order extra batteries for this camera. Such as the Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Fujifilm NP-50. Works extremely well with the F800EXR.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "A Japanese version.\nSips from Japan.\nThe display language supports Japanese and English.\nBox,manual and software in Japanese.", "Name": "Fujifilm F800EXR (RED) 16MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch TFT LCD,", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414V7JAl1DL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008OQGGGE"}}
