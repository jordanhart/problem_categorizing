I purchased this camera recently and am very pleased.  I am very much a novice when it comes to photography and use this camera for photos of family, pets, travel, etc.  I didn't want anything complicated, and I mostly use this on the auto setting.  It takes beautiful photos, particularly in low light. I rarely need the flash.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy a Sony NEX-6 instead for almost the same price. Price is a bit high for what you get.", "Author": "PR", "ReviewID": "R3HOSL546O1Q4T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good camera, and just good. Don't get me wrong, it takes brilliant pictures and has great quality, but it lacks some features considering it's price range. You're better off spending a couple of hundred dollars more for the A6000. Here are my main gripes with this camera:1. No electronic viewfinder2. No mic input or headphone output3. No 1080 x 60p video.4. No hotshoe5. PRICE!!!!The above factors wouldn't be much of a problem if this camera was priced around say $300-$350, but it's not worth buying in my opinion. You're better off buying last years Sony NEX-6 which is almost the same price (due to it's big price drop recently), but gives you way more and is in fact a better camera! The NEX-6 has a high resolution Electronic Viewfinder, allows 60p video, has  both a pop up flash which bends backwards so you can bounce it off a ceiling and a standard hotshoe, and it's price is about the same!The only advantage this camera has is the flip up screen which allows one to shoot video or take pictures of themselves. Overall, I'd buy the NEX-6 over this, or if you can afford it, buy the A6000.....", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Nitin Manohar \"Nitin\"", "ReviewID": "R1IPNEIMCQKZ99", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Found this to be equivalent to my old NEX 5, great pictures and I could use the all my E-Mount lensesSuper sharp focusing and I like the inbuilt apps you can buy now, the Play memory account had an issue with taking cards to setupNeed to call up Sony to see if they can fix it. That way I can get their inbuilt Timer/Lapse.Also liked the remote app that synced up well with my Android phone, it has full zoom and picture control built in.The OLED display is a bit smaller than the NEX else would have earned a 5 star rating.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Small, compact and loud", "Author": "judy little", "ReviewID": "R1O8LCSZ4M41LE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Enjoying everything about the camera except the noise it generates.The shutter release is very noisy.

Sony chose the restrict the codec to 60i or 24p which is not an ideal situation. Also the video the camera does not allow switching between PAL and NTSC. Rather go for the a6000 which has far better specifications. Personally I think the Panasonic range of cameras offer better features.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Director \"World Artist Yeah\"", "ReviewID": "R3EI1LXPAPQLU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the silver version, fantastic camera with incredible quality images, fast processor, highly attractive and durably made.

After calling Sony to ask them some things about the camera, I ended up returning it after waiting for 3 months for this to come out because the quality of indoor shots is really sub-par.  Colors are really off and anything with a flash is extremely washed out.  There are also a fair amount of particles in the shot.  I've recently used a Nikon D3200 and it was a huge difference with very little difference in price.For a camera in this price range I expect the same as other cameras in the same price category.  I am going to get a D3300.  Sure it might not be as portable, but it's worth lugging it around for a superior image than this provides.  To make sure I wasn't missing something, I went to a local store (National Camera) and asked them to show me both this camera and a Nikon D3300 and Sony A65 SLR.  The salesman there was very thorough and we took indoor shots with all three and looked at them on their computer.  I asked him why this camera is in the same price range as the SLRs when the image is not even close.  He said it's basically for those who want a smaller frame.  He then steered my away from the Canon SLRs and told me that I would be happy with the Nikon.His advise proved correct, as I have been using my Nikon D3300 for the last week.  We just got back from the zoo where there were pictures taken in all different kinds of scenarios. Indoor, outdoor, close and far away shots, with and without flash.  Everything looks wonderful on my new camera, and the colors were spot on unlike this a5000.Hope this review helps.And for anyone who says \"user error\", how come I can take great shots with the much more complicated D3300 SLR than I can with this?  I always read every manual front to back.  :-)", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "20.1 MP Exmor APS-C sensor for great images\nMirror less DSLR - Compact Interchangeable Lens camera system\nQuick Wi-Fi connectivity to smartphones via NFC\nModel: ILCE5000L/W", "Name": "Sony Alpha a5000 20.1 MP Interchangeable Lens Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NcLEYYo%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HNJWTC8"}}
