I am happy to say to you it was a wise choice.I leave all the tech explaining for the techs. I will say this if you have big hands you will have a problem holding it. It is such a great camera for video and if you are a Pro you will get a handle on it.  I bought it used even more better, yep i am a happy camper.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "GH1 need I say more!", "Author": "jimecuador", "ReviewID": "RPKMM1Q0M3EH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an absolutely wonderful camera. I use it more than my AF100 now...just kidding, but I do use it a lot! If you're looking to buy a body alone don't pay more than 500.00 if it's used. Mine was in the box and in mint condition...it looked like it had never been used. It fascinates me how people are always into the latest gadgets and gimmicks and never improve on their craft. Oh well, better deals and great video capture.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A best buy for a hybrid still/video camera", "Author": "Joseph Ogiba \"jogiba21\"", "ReviewID": "R1S3660US19OG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the GH2 in December with Voigtl\u00e4nder Nokton 25mm f/0.95 lens and later purchased the GH1 with 14-42mm for $375 from Panasonic and that is the best deal I have made on a camera in a long time. It makes a great back-up body to my GH2 with the m4/3rds lenses I have and only the GH2 has a better EVF that makes shooting videos much better than my Pentax K-7 or any other DSLR for that matter.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money (and can be hacked to 24+ mb/s for video)", "Author": "DEE", "ReviewID": "RT20X6JIXDUB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the results of video with this thing..and with ptool (personal-view.com), it can be hacked to more than the standard of 17mb/s data rate, which gives excellent sharpness detail in video. Honestly i dont really use it for regular photos, but the ones I took were nice. I use the GH1 with an adapter for the old canon FD, manual type of lens along with an ND adjustable filter and am getting very satisfactory results. I recommend this camera for an all in one solution for video and pictures, or just video for that matter.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best in Video", "Author": "Silus Cramford", "ReviewID": "R37P0ZSO9V1WQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't need to write a review of this camera, there are plenty around.However, wanted to leave feedback as a 4 star rating (as is at time of writing) is ludicrous.  This is one of the best video producing cameras around (with the software hack, to which ALL GH1s are now susceptible). period.  in any class.Plenty of reviews out there from experts comparing the video quality to that of the Canon EOS 5D Mk II (the 'gold standard'; body-only $2900 at time of writing)... some even conclude that it surpasses the Mk II for video.At this price it is a no-brainer.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works great as expected", "Author": "Buyer", "ReviewID": "R1C4EJ9BIG7NP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cant get the hack but 720@60p is not effected by the 24@60i known issue in the GH1I use mostly 720.It is very small, coming from a E3 with a vertical grip, it will take time to get used to.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera - Perfect condition", "Author": "Seth K.

I'm a filmmaker and I enjoy having dual camera coverage for my scenes.The camera came in and it was perfect- so perfect in fact that it's indistinguishable from the brand new GH1K that I bought last October.The camera came with the body lens cap, the charger and camera power adapter, the monitor cables, TWO batteries, a 16GB SDHC car, strap.Did a test video.. works fine. The inner packaging wasn't all original but mostly original. Do we really care about packaging or the quality of the product?You should buy from this seller. I gave it a full five stars. The seller deserves 17.Fantastic!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "GH13", "Author": "Kevin Bartrum \"K~\"", "ReviewID": "R2CUJASSBC0T25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't give this camera enough love. just buy it, get into it, learn it grow with it, know it entirely, witness the unknown power.

After taking many pictures with it and comparing them against the G1 I concluded that the only two advantages over the G1 were: better handling of high ISO and video. However, I found it hard to justify the extra $$$. Today the GH1 body can be found for a little over $500 but I think the G3 is a much better deal.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1-megapixel 4/3-type MOS sensor; interchangeable lens system digital camera\nCapture 1080/24p or smooth 720/60p HD (High Definition) movies in AVCHD format\nLive View Finder and bright 460,000-dot resolution, 3.0-inch LCD * Capture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)\nNew Contrast AF (Auto Focus) function; Face Detection and Intelligent Auto (iA) mode\nThis kit includes Panasonic Battery, Charger, A/V-USB Cable, Strap, + Mini Tripod & Cleaning Kit (CAMERA BODY ONLY, LENS NOT INCLUDED)", "Name": "Panasonic DMC-GH1K 12.1MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera & 1080p HD Video (Body).", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61QT45SC7QL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00404D39M"}}
