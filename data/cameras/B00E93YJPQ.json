{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Cam for the Price", "Author": "Sherry", "ReviewID": "R3QBC5UUU9HIBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome camera for the price. It takes still shot pictures and records video. It records sound and the playback was good for both audio and video.The package includes attachments for helmet, handlebar and dash. It does NOT include a TF card (small disk memory card - class4 min. 4gb).  My charger outlet was European so I had to get a plug-in adapter at Radio Shack. It took about an hour and an half to charge the unit before use and held that charge for several uses over 10 days before I charged it again.Both ends of the camera screw off, one is just a clear filter to protect the lens the other is a metal cover to protect the cable-in for charging/viewing and holds the TF (memory) card as well as the setting for panoramic or standard view capturing.There are two (2) buttons on the unit, one by the lens with two lights which is the power button which you press and hold for three (3) seconds and the back button by the metal cap which is the record start/stop button.The only thing I would mention is that even though the video/audio runs continuously from the time you turn it on and press record to the time you stop recording or power down, the playback gives it to you in 3 min. feeds so you need video software to paste the clips in if you want to watch it as one playback or like a movie.  The other thing I noticed, which is less significant is that, like ANY camera, when it's pointed to the sun or light source, you do get glare so it would be nice to find UV lens filters for this unit or have one made at a local camera shop.Very pleased with the quality. You can see the handle bar mount video I took with this camera on you tube search Torstar100, it's the Johnson Valley OHV video.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work", "Author": "Kent Grabau", "ReviewID": "R2X3N8OKXXB3XW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We followed the included instructions as best we could.  They're difficult to follow as they are poorly written.  Inserted a card, powered the unit up, but couldn't get it to do anything.  The computer recognized it but that's about it.  We've requested a refund and will return it.  Anyone have any tips on a camera like this that works?", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "If simple is all you need", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R3O05CBJ6C9G73", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Video quality is great.  Voice, not good.  Simple to use.  The plug they sent with the camera was made for European countries.  But, I was able to charge it using the usb cable it came with.  Has no view finder (screen to see what you are recording).  Has no lens cover.Came all the way from Guongdong, China, but still arrived earlier than expected.For this price, it can't be beat.  Hard to believe that they can even make and sell cameras for this price.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "kind of like a GoPro but half the cost", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RJI0RHN5BPINF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great picture ! easy to use!instructions however need some work. they are not very clearas far as the functionalities", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Garbage pure and simple", "Author": "S. Anthony", "ReviewID": "R3POAAWR0KJSL2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My experience with this item was a waste of time, money and natural resources.  All video files that the unit recorded were corrupted and unable to be played back at all, or only bits and pieces before it cut out completely.  In my opinion, there's a reason its priced so low, and why the seller DOES NOT OFFER A REPLACEMENT.  Amazon refund only.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best for the Price", "Author": "tyrone", "ReviewID": "R1ZFW5UXB6XOXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Because of the limited time I've had the item, I can't say for sure but, it works fine.  It has a good picture quality and has a nice athletic look.  My 8g card didn't work even through I purchased a 32g anyway.  The only real problem is the adapter it's has a charger setup for European electronics.  You can still charge it thru USB on a computer or anything now a days.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "ibrahim alsubaie", "ReviewID": "RG24IAH8XGICQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lacks the base butterflyKi-riding on the tube for hunting riflesLacks also view accompanying him everywhere without reference to the computer", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Full 1080p dvr cam", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R156F6I6I1WFZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best one so far, so clear, just like 1080, and in real time, I will buy another one. great quality", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad service post sale", "Author": "Audiotoy", "ReviewID": "RJPKD53995UJ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to spend many hours updating the camera, I found it by chance on a blog in Brazil, spend more money in memory of 32 gb, class 10, by which it brings, only recorded 6 minutes, at the end I have gone for when almost 200 euros a go pro 3, I would have gone for the same price, here is the saying you get what you PAY EXPENSIVE ...regards", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "good gift I think", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CV517HP5LAUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Gave this to my brother-inlaw.
