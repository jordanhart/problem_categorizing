I had originally set it up on a shelf in the garage and ran the camera cables over and under things in a hurried manner. I couldn't wait to fire it up and see how it worked. Everything worked just great and only using two cameras at the time. I installed one camera under the front eve of each side of the front of the house. The night vision casts a nice lit area over the driveway and the front yard. Not long after when the summer's hot days started I noticed the DVR would make a couple of beeping noises every once in a while. Sometimes I would turn on the monitor and find it has either frozen the screen of was in boot mode and frozen there. I would unplug it and plug it back in and turn it on and everything would be fine for awhile. I don't know how many months I kept up with that until I took the time to add an additional wire shelf in our laundry room which has a door to the garage. I've been running the system non stop now for almost six months and have never had a freeze or other problem with it. I also added a small battery backup or UPS unit suspended underheath the shelving with some wire ties. We had an electrical outage for almost an hour recently and the dvr never shut down. I did not plug the monitor into the battery backup as that would drain the battery very quickly. I still need to run a power line from the backup to the cameras as what good will it do me to have the dvr running and not the cameras. Just another small project and I will have a complete funtional and dependable dvr security system. I bought my unit at Sams club and I also bought the extended warranty for three additional years just in case something fails.I have had to search for a car one morning that hit a neighbors read tail light lens and broke it for a sheriff. The neighbor was thrilled that I had the system with the event recorded on it. The neighbor down the road is paying for the damage or has paid them by now. It has also been fun just to scan back at 32x speed just to see what has happened during the day. You will see some things you never knew was going on while you were inside. If you can afford it and you want some peace of mind, go for it is all I can say.The hard part of the installation I might add is running the cable from the camera up and thru the eve and into the attic. I went to Home Depot and bought a fish tape it is called, a fifty foot one was sufficient enough, and used that to run the wires. It took several attempts on the one side of the house, the other went the first time. You tape the cable on the fish tape and push it up in the hole and try to aim it so it goes far enough into the attic where you can reach it once you get up in there, and then pull it to wherever and down a hole to the dvr. You will need a power stip to plug the camera power adapters along with the dvr and whatever monitor you use. I used an extra lcd flatscreen I had left over from a broken computer, no problem. And, I even mounted it on the wall with a monitor mount. So, there you have it. I need to get some pictures uploaded here to add to the one that is here now.Samsung SDE-120n 4 Channel DVR System", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Home run!", "Author": "doghots", "ReviewID": "R17JU1SZ3XGB32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleased.

I had it installed in the walls when my home was built so all of the cords are hidden and come out in a secret place and connect to tthe DVR and modem which are hidden.  Always worried if someone robbed me they'd look for the DVR and I'd still be screwed.  They'd have to search awhile to find it.  Now if I just add a security system to make noise they won't stick around looking for it for sure.  Love being bale to access it while away and check on my house and my kids.

Samsung posts a contact number (+1 877-349-3149) everywhere in their site. All you can do is leave a message. THere are no prompts for department connection. Just leave a message. Out of the Box, my unit had to be returned for a defective MAC board. The unit was under warranty but I still had to pay shipping. (the company doing the repair supplied return shipping)PROS: The unit comes complete with MOST everything you need. No monitor of course so you must either buy one of use a KVM switch. I opted for the switch which has performed flawlessly. THe cameras work pretty well which is to say, you can see who is tresspassing or whos visiting while your away. I had to purchase extra DIN cable as the supplied 50 foot lengths are inadaquit. After installing all the supplied cameras and cables, one has to perform the setup routine.Setup is pretty straight forward with the Linux based utility that comes imbedded. Camera sensitivity is something that goes undefined or unexplained. You just have to try different settings to fine tune it.CONS: The NETWORK setup is a disaster. You will end up calling somebody ( 3years ago you actually got asomeone) especially if you are connecting to the internet via a router which is the norm these days. What home network does not have one? You have to do Port Forwarding and identify which ports to open for email notification upon alarm activation. i mean you have to be a genious at networking to get this unit to function properly. It truly is rediculous.If you can get the SDE-120 working right in its entirety, it probably wont disappoint you in regards to to run time, HDD reliability, event capure etc. But for me personally, SAMSUNG released this unit waaaayyy to early and continues to fail to provide any customer support access.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "good product for the price", "Author": "883", "ReviewID": "R2U19EPV8FANZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 4 of these systems in different locations. all have been working great. the oldest one I have is about two years old and is still going strong.
