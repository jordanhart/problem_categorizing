The 700 was my favorite digicam ever, putting most everything else in storage. However, along comes the 720 & adds a 50% better resolution while sacrificing only a small amount of the fine optical zoom (from 10x to 8x) that the 700 is known for. In point of fact, zooming at 10X without a tripod or image stabilization (not present on either the 700 or the 720) is extremely challenging. Anyway, this camera is beautifully made and ergonomically engineered. The aspherical all glass lens system is excellent and the resulting 3 megapixel images are crystal clear at 8\" x 10\" and quite acceptable at 11\" x 14\". The zoom of course remains the trump card on the 720, and the smoothness (just the right damping) with which it reaches its 8x limit is awesome. Another nice feature is its ability to take QuickTime movies, which really adds to its versatility. The camera as shipped does benefit from some upgrading, but these things can be added later. I would suggest the first purchase be a much larger memory card than the 16 megs included (I like the 128); if possible, buy Olympus, as these proprietary cards allow for a few more digital formatting tricks than do the others.", "Date": "July 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera... wonderful zoom and great battery life", "Author": "Joe Peterson", "ReviewID": "R26M47JBS7RTSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th digital camera and they have certainly improved.  I chose the 720 because of it's 8X zoom lens and small size, plus the use of standard sized batteries.  I took it on a two week canoe trip in Ontario and it performed great.  The photos are crisp and sharp.  Even with the maximum zoom, the focus was sharp, although I did use a mono-pod for stability.  I was particularly impressed with the battery life.  Based on my older cameras, I took 6 sets of batteries for the two week trip.... but I ended up only using two sets:  one set of NiMH rechargables and one set of lithium batteries was all it took for two weeks and over 600 photos, including lots of previewing with the LCD display.I also found the LCD viewfinder more acceptable than I had first expected.  It is a bit grainy and takes some getting used to, but it was brighter than most reviews have implied and it was great to be able to see 'exactly' what was going to be in the picture since it is 'through the lens'.  Overall, I am very pleased with the camera.  Very impressive.", "Date": "July 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Extremely pleased with this camera!", "Author": "R. Lane", "ReviewID": "R2164AKIQHBLGZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "****The best selling points of this camera (for me):- it works on AA batteries, and if needed, you can buy them in any country. (Buy rechargeables!)- it has an awesome zoom (when coupled with the digital zoom)- the pictures are beautiful, and can blow up to 8x10 on high resolution- even when you shoot the shot at a high resolution, you can change it later to a lower res if you want to. But be careful, you can go down, but not back up!- it has a panorama function that works pretty good, and it includes stitching the pictures together- it fits on a tripod- it is quite practical in size- it is very affordable for what you get and the quality of output.- you can view your pictures immediately on a television with the video cable- you can view the image on the TV while you are shooting the picture (works great for family portraits so you can see the shot before it is taken and fix things that don't quite look right)- I like the rapid fire shooting it has The things I can live with but wish were better:- it takes any smart media card, but the panorama function only works if you buy the Olympus smart media card- If you plan on using it for extended periods, you really need to buy rechargeables- the digital zoom is not very clear when viewing the image UNTIL you actually take the shot. And you really need a steady hand. But the shot comes out perfect. The thumbnails look blurry, though the picture really isn't.- The pics take a long time to load onto your computer if you try to load them through your camera. I bought the DAZZLE ZIO! SMART MEDIA READER and it downloads the images boom-boom-boom-boom...instantly! Excellent feature, but sold separately.- Doesn't come with a carrying case (good carrying cases are expensive - also sold separately)- it only comes with a 16mb smart media card, YOU NEED MORE! (cha-ching)...for a 128mb, which by the way is about all you need for a week vacation. Takes 167 pics at high resolution.- It sometimes takes a long time to focus and I did miss a few action shots because of this, but if you are prepared and pre-focus the camera it works great. You can also use the rapid firing option and just delete the ones you don't want. I did that too and it worked great. Overall, this (in my opinion) was an excellent choice. I have had the camera for 2 months now and I LOVE IT! It was quite affordable if I were only buying the camera at... but when you add in the rechargeables, the recharger, smart card, carrying case, cleaning rags, media card reader, and tax, you do need to think of it more like an investment than a toy.  The final bill came out to... OUCH! Would I do it again? You bet! Considering the stock market, it was the best investment I made all year. Do I regret not getting the 4.0 mp? No way, the zoom is not nearly as good as the 3.1, and when am I really ever going to print out an 11x14 picture (which is the only reason you ever need to go bigger than a 3.1.) besides, my printer isn't even big enough to print it, so I would have to have a shop print it - not realistic. Don't waste better options for more mega pixels, unless you are a professional, you really won't have the need for them.Hope this helps!", "Date": "December 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "Olympus C-720", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R2PUUZMFDVWAP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a great digital camera for a great price, get the Olympus C-720. Like most of you, I'm not a professional photographer, but in the first week I was able to take what I consider to be some very nice shots. After reading the extensive manual, I quickly came to the conclusion that this camera will do a LOT and I'm going to have to experiment with it quite a bit to learn all of its capabilities. The only beef I have is the slow auto-focus only, no manual focus. Though the manual zoom is accurate, it can be a bit slow when you're trying to catch a fast moving object. For example, I was trying to take a shot of my dog as he was running toward me . . .forget it . . .the focus was just too slow. Olympus' suggestion is to \"pre-focus\" on the subject, then take the shot. Okay, sounds good. But why not include a manual focus? The 8X optical zoom is awesome. Coupled with the 3X digital (to get 24x) it is incredible. As with other high-zoom cameras, use a tri-pod for high zoom shots or a VERY steady hand. The 8X optical zoom is so good, I rarely use the digital zoom at all. Though this camera has a smaller rear viewing monitor than most cameras in its class, it hasn't bothered me at all. I can still review photos with ease and it saves on battery life. The quality of the photos is remarkable. My wife and I have taken quite a few \"jaw-droppers\" in just the first few weeks of owning the camera. It's nice not being saddled with film processing costs and delays. You can review the shots right on camera and delete what you don't want. Consequently, we've taken more pictures with this camera in a few short weeks than with all the other cameras we've owned, combined! So far, the battery life is amazing as well. Around 400 shots!

My biggest problem with the camera was motion blur. I got blurry motion in auto mode and sports mode from very simple movements (hand or head). I phoned Olympus and they agreed that there is motion blur and attributed it to the line of Ultra zoom cameras. They suggested going to manual mode and increasing the shutter speed. That made the auto point and shoot mode worthless. My wife is not a photographer and would never be able to handle that, especially in the short moments you get to snap a picture. These blurs occurred without any zoom. It was worse with the zoom, optical or digital. It would be great for still subjects and a tripod, but not for a simple picture of my dog. I have since gone to the C-4000 and am very pleased. I took a picture of a moving ceiling fan and it froze the blades perfectly.

However, in low light conditions they don't turn out that good.I bought this camera only for it's great optical zoom which is the greatest advantage of this camera so you can compose what you really want.  8x optical is more than twice as much as what most digital cameras offer and I don't know how those other cameras sell with such a useless zoom (3x optical is nothing!) 3x optical is just ridiculous when 8x is already available.The autofocus is sometimes very disappointing.  It might let you down when you need it the most.  For example, African Safari, great opportunities missed because the autofocus just took too long or just didn't focus at all!  Very frustrating. Like if you went to Africa every day!I had the c700 model before this one and I'm not sure if selling it to my brother was a nice thing to do with a brother.  Had the same problems. Big surprise when I found that the C-720 doesn't have sound capability in the video mode. C700 had. Why would Olympus come up with a newer model with more resolution but decrease the zoom to 8x and take out the sound capability?  Go figure!!  Bottom line: if you don't care about having sound on your video clips, don't care missing some once in a lifetime photo opportunities because the autozoom didn't work, then go for it!  But, if you don't mind spending [a more money], maybe the c730 will not have all the flaws of it's predecessors.  However, that's what I thought when I upgraded from the c700 to the c720 so we are back to the beginning and Olympus is unpredictable.

Firstly, this camera has many great features (manual control of apeture, shutter speed, exposure compensation, flash brightness, and much more). It's fairly simple to learn how to manually change these features to fit the situation you're photographing. The camera design and on screen menus are user friendly, and the camera has a very solid feel to it (probably can take abuse well). Unfortunately, over the 3 days and 200 pictures that I had this camera, I don't think I had a single picture that I was impressed with. Most all of them were fuzzy, some of them blurry, or the white balance was incorrect, some of the pictures even had noise in them...and I tried almost every type of lighting condition possible, with tweaking every feature the camera had every time. I believe the problem lies with the autofocus. It's slow, irritably slow...and this camera has trouble focusing on many types of objects (dark, shiny, brightly lit). Should I have to use the auto focus lock every time? I don't think so. In auto mode, I get the same result in picture quality, even though the camera is supposed to set everything on its own. Also in auto mode, the flash is way to bright (thermo-nuclear bright), but can be toned down in manual mode. Finally, the LCD view-finder is noticeably laggy, or jumpy...which would be a problem when trying to snap a fast moving object, where you would have to snap the picture slightly before it was in the center of the view-finder to compensate. Now I've read great user reviews about this camera (which is why I bought it in the first place), but I honestly can't say anything near what anybody else has said. Traded in for a Fuji Finepix 3800 (close equivalent) and have had no problems so far at all (look for review soon). Well hope this helps anyone considering this camera!", "Date": "October 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "My favorite digital camera so far", "Author": "Kevin Garrett", "ReviewID": "R1GFDZ9H1Z7YV8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my third digital camera. Previous to this camera I had a Nikon Coolpix 885, which I quickly learned to despise because I never knew if (or when) it had taken a picture. I sold it on eBay and bought this camera.Oddly, the first Olympus 720 I got was defective and would eat a set of batteries in 15 minutes. I exchanged the camera for a new one which is quite fine in this regard. The batteries last quite a long time and the camera is good at conserving power.What I like about the Olympus 720:First, the video viewfinder is actually through-the-lens like a proper SLR. This is great. I can see when the camera is in focus and when it is not. This also helps in an unexpected way: Because you see it out of focus, you will focus the camera. Thus when you want to take a photo, the camera is already focused and there is very little lag before the image is captured. With rangefinder digital cameras, you don't see it out of focus and therefore you may not squeeze on the release until the moment you want to capture. Of course then it has to do its focusing thing and sometime later actually take the picture.The settings can be viewed through the eyepiece in addition to the monitor. This helps me as I am now getting far sighted, and with the Nikon I had to put on reading glasses to view the settings on the monitor. Not so with the Olympus 720.I can see when the camera takes a picture. Like SLRs whose mirror swings up when the shutter is released, the Olympus momentarily blacks out the viewfinder when the image is recorded. You absolutely know that a photo was taken just then. You don't have to listen for a beep (Nikon 885 doesn't even do this), or wonder if the flash you saw was your camera or someone else's. Many times with my old Kodak 280 I'd get a blurry photo because I had already begun to put the camera down when it actually took the photo. 8 to 1 optical zoom. Not stinkin' digital zoom... optical zoom. Wow. Most digital cameras are 3 to 1. This is a real help. Scanning some of the other reviews here I can only assume that the people complaining about motion blur are simply inexperienced photographers that don't know that longer focal lengths require additional stability or shorter shutter times.AA batteries. I much prefer the flexibility you get using standard size AA batteries instead of some oddball or photo only battery. I got nice NiMH recharables. Works great. In a pinch you could use plain-Jane AA batteries but of course they'd get eaten up quickly.In general, the camera has lots of features as you'd expect. I use the PASM mode. In that mode it displays the f-stop and shutter speed through the viewfinder. Good stuff.What I don't like:Well, the image quality is not quite as good as I'd like. I'm going to experiment with the auto ASA to see if manually setting it to 200 or 100 makes for a better picture. Don't ask me why, but my ancient Kodak DC 280 takes the nicest looking photos of any digital camera I have seen. I wish the Olympus' sharpness and tones were as nice.The manual: There's a quick start guide, a paper manual, and a PDF manual. The paper manual while thick, is not complete. Print out the PDF manual. The quick start and paper manual neglect to mention that when you connect the camera to your computer via USB that you need to set the camera's mode to Image Review. Only the PDF manual reveals this vital fact.Body color: Now I'm getting picky.

There are several reviews here that criticize the camera's \"slow\" auto and sports settings.  I've taken probably 10,000 pictures with this camera, and almost none of them were taken in either of those modes.  I highly recommend using P mode for outdoor pictures, or pictures in good light, and shutter priority (S mode), with shutter speed at about 1/30 or 1/40 of a second, and the exposure compensation on +2.0, for indoor pictures.  The results are great.The good things about this camera include the wonderful 8x zoom (for outdoor pictures, with shutter speeds of 1/250 second and faster, even max zoom shots come out great), the vibrant colors it captures, its wonderful work without a flash (very dramatic pictures), and the nice effect in portrait setting (in which it uses depth of field to have a sharp target and blurred background).  The menus aren't that difficult to use.  Battery life is great; I typically get 200-300 shots on one set of freshly charged NiMH batteries.  My 128 Mb SmartMedia card holds about 200 pictures in the mode I use most often, and they're large enough to print sharply as 4x6 or 5x7, even after I crop a lot out of them.There are two things I don't like about the camera.The first is that it has a tendancy to develop \"hot\" or \"stuck\" pixels when doing a lot of shooting in low-light situations.  Pixel mapping (a built-in pixel repair function) fixes this, but it's still really jarring to see ugly red and green pixels in the viewfinder and LCD and images when this happens.The second is a quirk with my camera, and, from what I've read, lots of Olympus cameras.  The C-720 uses a capacitor to \"remember\" the date and time, even with no batteries in the camera.  There is something wrong with the capacitor in the C-720 I own.  The connection to the batteries, even a freshly-charged set, breaks quite often.  When that happens, the camera won't turn on until I open the battery compartment and rearrange the batteries, and then half the time, the date/time (nothing else) has been lost and needs to be reset.  Because the camera cleverly uses the date to name the image files, this lost date/time is a real headache to deal with.Because of the battery/capacitor quirk, I'm docking the camera one star.  I'd give it five if the date/time didn't reset way too often.As more and more people buy digital cameras, that are usually higher-end than the film cameras they once had, the learning curve associated with camera like this will decrease.  To anyone who finds themselves disappointed with this camera because of blurred pictures, read my advice above and try again.

I have some photography experience but this is my first digital camera, so in choosing a camera my goals were to find one that is as close to a traditional 35 mm film camera, but digital.  This camera acheives that goal.  The main drawback to this camera is that it is difficult to take action photos.  I'll get to that, but first a few pros:- Of course, the powerful optical zoom and optical lens, (combined with digital zoom gives you almost 30x zoom).- For having an optical lens, this camera is really compact!  It is easily held in one hand.- Full automatic controls of shutter speed and aperture, but also the option of full manual (as well as shutter speed priority or aperture priority) should you want to do something creative.  Though it does not have unlimited exposure time; you can't go past about one minute.And a few cons:- The necessary accessories will drive the price up.  It only comes with a 4 MB memory card, and much more is needed (I recommend at least 64 MB, probably 128 MB).  Also, rechargeable batteries are recommended, as well as a carrying case.- Though it uses double-A's, most rechargeable double-A's don't last long.  I often end up buying regular double-A's in the end anyway.- Like other digital cameras, the camera must be powered up before taking photos but you don't want to leave it on at all times in order to save batteries.  However, if you have a sudden photo opportunity it does take a minute for the camera to power up.  The camera will go into sleep mode to save batteries and it \"wakes up\" a little faster, but still somewhat slowly.  This is a minor drawback.- And the biggest drawback, for me, is the difficulty in taking action shots.  It is difficult for two reasons:1) The auto-focus is slow.  By the time the camera focuses and shoots, your photo opportunity easily may have passed.  It does have manual focus but it is much slower!  You have to use the up/down and left/right arrows on the back of the camera to focus.  First, this is an inconvenient location especially if you are using the viewfinder instead of the viewscreen.  And, the buttons are digitally controlled; each press of the button requires a short processing time.  If you think you can manually focus on the fly with this camera while shooting sports photography, forget it!  So, unless you are in a situation where you can focus  manually once and take all of your photos at that focal length, you will have to rely on the moderately slow auto-focus.2) After each photo, the image freezes to show you the picture you just took.  This is a nice feature on most any digital camera nowadays, but since you can't turn it off it can really interfere if you are trying to take several photos back-to-back.  The viewscreen does this, but so does the viewfinder, so there is no avoiding it.  The only option, if you want to take quick back to back photos, is to turn on the \"rapid-shooting\" which will take 2 or more photos every time you press the button.  Fortunately it's digital so you aren't wasting film!All of that said, I will mention that I have managed to take some decent sports photographs.  The drawbacks are a nuisance but can be worked around in ways like those that I have mentioned.I recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a digital camera at a very affordable price that will provide many of the benefits of a traditional 35 mm film-based camera.  It is good for beginners as well as amateur photographers, but if you're planning to do action photography I recommend sticking to the 35 mm, or finding a different (though surely more expensive) digital camera.

There are screws on the lens to add filters and other lenses (check out Ebay: \"720 Olympus filters\"). Also, there camera comes with a wide array of items. It comes with lens cap, straps, cables and manuals. The software included is very good and becomes outstanding with the upgrade-check out free stitch. The memory goes up to 128meg and is easy to purchase at Amazon-lookup \"128meg smartmedia\". The included (stereo port) TV cable enables viewing shots on the TV-and even slideshows from the camera (12' Sterio cord extension from Radio Shack helps). Overall, it's a great camera with lots of good-great for family or pro. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "July 1, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good photos, features; Bad focus, Redeye", "Author": "R.

It is a fantastic camera!!Hoping to get the same quality, but with a better zoom, I purchased a C-720. In fact, I went through two, because the quality of the zoom on the first one was so bad that the retailer thought that maybe it was broken. The retailer did tell me that they had heard of focusing problems with this camera. If the subject you are zooming in on is stationary (like a house), you can get a good picture. But if it is moving at all (like a person), the auto focus zoom struggles terribly to get a clear shot. I could not get one in- focus shot of my son ballroom dancing, even with a tripod, and trying the 'sports' action setting.While in zoom, the camera sometimes cannot handle certain light angles and takes a very dark picture. The viewfinder also looks like you are looking through a screen, and the media card is hard to remove. Neither of these were issues with my C-2020.Bottom line, I returned the camera and will wait until Olympus puts out a decent quality product again.", "Date": "January 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "This is not a camera for beginners", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2IVU4RJ4FFG9R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I did a lot of research before buying it.

The flaws of this camera were said by other reviewers - things like slow focus and blurry pictures. You CAN take good pictures with this camera, but it just takes a LONG time to learn for beginners (and after a lot of mistakes). And if you need somebody else to take pictures for you, it will be plenty of headaches.

It is lightweight and just so great. It has a wonderful optical lens that gets far away objects in fine focus. It's digital zoom comes out surprisingly crystal clear. Plus, the multi adjustable exposure is a pleasure to use. You can set the camera to take manual shutter speed or manual exposure or both. You can set the overall lighting for the scene from dark to light. You can also take movies for 16 seconds! You can take self photos-timed, snaps shot on its own. There are several sizes of photos you can take. There are screw threads on the lens so you can also purchase a separate adapter and use filters such as polarization and UV or wide angle lenses (check out Ebay and search \"Olympus 720 filter\"). You can take time exposures for blurred water flowing or car lights streaming past. You can check out the back of the camera on the sharp active matrix LCD screen and look at the photo you just took and delete ones you don't like. You can watch the movies on the LCD screen. You can use smartmedia cards (check out \"Viking\" at Amazon) to save photos/movies ...for the maximum size 128 meg card which saves about 50 photos at the largest size or about 650 at 640x480. I think the greatest thing about this camera is the lens. You can zoom in to objects that are VERY far away and have them in sharp focus. I took photos of deer recently this way. It's simple to download the photos with the USB cable. The software that comes with the camera is really cool. You can upgrade ... by purchasing a number online that links right from the software that comes with the camera. The upgrade software is absolutely outstanding. The free stitch mode in the upgrade software is especially cool since it really does an outstanding job of stitching photos-this upgrade software is NOT A BURN..-it's really worth it-compare to other software like this online. Plus, the camera comes with a 16meg card to save photos right away. It comes with a CD of the software. It comes with a lens cap and strap to connect to the lens cap and another strap to connect to the camera. It comes with lithium duracell batteries. It comes with a USB connector cord. It comes with a cord to connect to your TV (stereo cable port) to watch your photos on your TV! You can even set the camera to do a slide show of your photos on the TV. You can watch the movies from your camera on the TV. May I recommend purchasing a 12' extension stereo cord for the TV cable from Radio Shack so you can sit at the sofa and watch your piks on the TV. I really, can honestly say.. that this is an outstanding product. I read the whole manual and tried all the different examples to get all out of this camera possible. It's really fun!

The 3mp is good enough resolution for photo quality print outs at slightly less than a full sheet of paper.

My first digital camera. With accessories and the price of the camera at the time (they are now selling for half??) we spent $600.00. From the start the camera on Auto and Sport settings produced pictures that were blurry and out of focus about 1/3 of the time. Best Buy and Olympus had me convinced, being new to digital cameras, that I was the problem and that I might have been better served with a more basic camera (really?). The camera has since been back for repair with Best Buy once already under their extra four year warranty (5 week turn around, I plan to use a $100 Kodak digital I carry on my motorcyle in the meantime) and is going to go back again as the problem is now worse. When it comes back the next two times I will take it out of the box, have them take a blurry, out of focus shot of me and hand it right back to them. After the first \"repair\" Best Buy did not report that anything was found in need of repair only that the camera was recalibrated. I expect that there is nothing to fix as the camera is fundamentally flawed. The shutter speeds at Auto and Sport settings are just too slow. Three \"repair\" tries with Best Buy and we get our money or credit back. Olympus now tells me, after their warranty has expired, to go to the manual settings and increase the shutter speed and shoot in the manual mode. In other words that their camera shutter speed at Auto and even Sport mode will continue to be slow (and ruin pictures). By this time I had already figured this out despite their condescending advice that I probably should not have such a complicated camera! I have read similar reviews re: this particular camera with these problems at several other consumer sites. Check it out for yourself. Stay away from the Olympus C series. Interesting that they are currently not available from Amazon(things that make you go hmmmm)??!! I am staying away from Olympus all together. Customer service is a run around with a product they are unwilling to recognize as defective. Customers experiencing problems with these cameras (it seems from other reviews that not all are troublesome) should be offered a replacement or a trade toward something that works (maybe something simpler for those of us thought of as digitally challenged).
