Instead of buying the wall charger I bought the CSS-PHB Cybershot station for about the same price as the charger alone (great deal). I had bought a similar Sony stand for my previous camera the Sony DSC-S60 real cheap on a bargain table in at a major office supply retailer and didn't know how useful it would be. As it turned out, it was very useful indeed! The CSS-PHB Cybershot station is a cut above the older one as it has a remote control and an adjustable angle, rather than fixed camera cradle. This is handy when the light is reflecting off the back of the LCD, you can just tip it up or down a bit while keeping it in its cradle. (Hint: use the ridged thumb grip on the cradle to rotate the camera instead of pressing on the camera body, this will keep your connector from getting damaged).  With this unit on my desktop, I can always find my camera easily and quickly for unexpected candid shot opportunities and the battery is always fully charged and ready to go. Another plus is that the LCD screen on my camera still does't have a scratch on it, since it isn't laying flat on my desk, but safely cradled instead. All in all, a nice addition to the camera. Glad I got it! - the glassman", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony simplicity", "Author": "Sean P. McSweeney", "ReviewID": "R22ILWLYAQ64IY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW, this thing makes my life much easier.  The DSC-p200 normally charges by opening a compartment on the side and hooking up the cable and it links by a separate cable to the port on the bottom, WHAT A PAIN. Now with the cradle everything happens by just putting it on the docking cradle. My only complaint is that it wont charge unless it is off so if you are running low on charge and want to upload pictures you have to wait but that is small fries.  I haven't used the photo album feature where you can hook it to your TV but that looks pretty cool to. Great buy at a great price.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "A great product, super convenient", "Author": "terster \"Terster\"", "ReviewID": "R30D3HQHAOIT4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When we had the Sony digital camera, this thing was awesome!

Herzig", "ReviewID": "RKGYIPS7AF4UW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: This dock works just wonderfully for most things.  The output to the TV is a nice feature for showing off videos and photos to family and friends.  The remote works just wonderfully.Cons: I thought that the auto picture taking setting would be nice to capture a long time-lapse photo, but it will only capture a maximum of six (what good is six?).  Also, the tilt base for the camera is a good idea, but it doesn't really tilt that much.  I've had to wedge things under it to get it to the desired position.  Additionally, the wires come out the side of the dock.  This looks pretty bad on a desk.  Finally, in order for the camera to charge, it has to be off.  For example, you can't simply charge it while taking pictures or transferring files.There is a fairly limited use for this dock.  I bought it because I had lost my cable, and this was just as cheap as a new one.  But, if none of the cons above bother you, then go ahead and buy it!", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony Cybershot Station for Digital Camera", "Author": "Vick Katoch", "ReviewID": "R2M4E4MPHXPTMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great product!  I bought this dock station because I actually lost the main power cable to the camera.  So instead I thought what a great place to hook the camera to a dock station that hooks up to my TV and my PC at the same time.  All I have to do is place the camera down on the charger/dock and flip the camera button to play mode and I can choose to transfer my pictures and videos to my PC or watch them on my TV.  I never did use the function of the dock to take pictures, it's primary function was a storage spot for my camera and to charge it so I can grab and go on the run.  I took this charger with me when I traveled and the slideshow function was easy to show pictures overseas.  I will most definitely buy more charging dock stations for my future digital camera purchases.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "J.George", "ReviewID": "R340RAOSNW0JSD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great while the camera lasted. easy charging, easy syncing, etc. I've since graduated to an Alpha but this was for my first camera and it was pretty cool for what it was, when it was.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony CSS-PHB Cybershot Station for DSCP200 Digital Cameras", "Author": "Rocknrenee", "ReviewID": "RPQDJG1A9837G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost bought a variety of accesories, that would have cost me more, to do what I needed, but this station does it all.
