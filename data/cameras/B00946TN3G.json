At some point I'd also like to take very closeup pictures of flowers and bugs.I was planning to get just the camera and 1 lens, but this was a great package at a great price.  The extra items included were not just filler.  They were all things that you would reasonably expect to need or use.  You are getting the package for less than the price of the camera and two lenses.Camera.  You can read reviews about its technical specs and quality elsewhere.  As an amateur, I'll say that it was easy to use right out of the box (after charging and inserting the battery, of course).  The picture quality was amazing.  The camera has tons of settings and features so learning about all it can do will be an ongoing process for me.The user manual is clearly written.  I like the fact that instead of writing it in multiple languages so that it is bulky and I have to skip around looking for the part relevant to me, it is ALL ENGLISH.  A separate manual in Spanish is included.  Thank you, Nikon!The memory card was a must, so nice to include it.The tripod came in a zippered case - nice for transporting and storing.  It seemed a bit flimsy and if you are a serious photographer you will probably get a better one.  It was, however, nice to have it included and it is very lightweight, so easy to take along.Extra battery.  I'm sure I will be glad I have this and most people would want an extra.Monitor screen protectors.  If you turn them crosswise, you can get 10 screen protectors out of the 5 pieces included.I'll try to update this after I use the camera more.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fall in love", "Author": "Yozworld", "ReviewID": "R2G6HEO8IBKCML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just wanted a camera. My camera gets so many compliments.  People ask all the time, \"Where did you get a red camera?\" The best part is that it takes great pics. Can hardly wait until I get good at taking pictures. Well worth it. Great investment. Never thought I could have much fun.  Amazon... Bundle for the best deal.

Burney \"Burneymac\"", "ReviewID": "R1J6ELNQ8MLL0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The red color is very sexy!  I actually purchased from another vendor.  Good product so far, picture quality is just okay, but I haven't used it much.  There is a ton of videos and online support so I am sure my picture taking abilities will improve.  I will update review later.  One gripe I have is that it is very hard to remove the rear lens cap from the 55-200 mm lens.  Nikon wanted me to ship the item at my cost and they would \"repair\" it and send it back to me at my cost.  After a quick web search I found that all you need to do us use a rubberized cap remover and it comes right off but it does take some force.  Also the cover for the usb/HDMI/Mic is made of a different material as opposed to the other covers for the battery and sd card.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "D3200 Nikon camera a great buy!", "Author": "Dale J.

The pictures that it takes are really astounding.  The detail is very high.  It has a popup flash that comes up in low light situations.  You can purchase an accessory that lets you send pictures to any new android phone or tablet.  The kit that I bought included a 50mm to 200mm zoom lens as well as a good tripod and a 32GB SD memory card.  With this package I can shoot any picture with full confidence.  It also comes with a gadget bag for the camera and several .accessories.

I couldn't be more pleased with the camera itself and the deal I got on it.  I am a bargain shopper, and nothing about this has been a disappointment.  Thank you!I am updating my review because I have used this camera so much more now, and I have to say I'm as happy as I was the day it arrived.  My daughters recently had homecoming at school, and we had been hiring a family friend to take photos because I didn't have a nice enough camera.  This year I took them myself and they turned out AMAZING.  My girls were happy and I was ecstatic!  This is an awesome camera for a beginner like myself.  Even in point-and-shoot mode, it produces some great shots.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A lot to learn", "Author": "BillMc_Designer", "ReviewID": "R1VWY5R98ANY1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used 35mm cameras since 1974. When everything went digital, i got the company I worked for at the time to pony up for a Nikon DSLR, and was very pleased with it. Fast forward a couple of years and I am now a freelancer. Photography is not my main line, but I do shoot product shots for clients from time to time, and wanted a decent camera without breaking the bank.For the money, this is a sweet deal. Clean, sharp photos at whopping resolution, and fairly easy to use. I've got a lot to learn about all the fancy features, but I was taking good shots about 10 minutes after I got it out of the box. Looking forward to hooking it up to the studio lights and putting it through more strenuous testing, but I feel like this was money well spent.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Tedward", "ReviewID": "R2FK61K149E8Y4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great buy for anyone not just a starter.
