{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty camera but it's all around slow, and frustrating.", "Author": "T. Eller", "ReviewID": "R3FCSM2N80TPE0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The allure of an interchangeable lens camera small enough to fit in the pocket and always have it on hand for those great shots pulled me in, but it just didn't measure up.In theory it's a nice camera, but coming from a very decent SLR (nikon d5200) the incredibly slow focus and inability to take a picture when you want it to are just too much of a pain to keep it.  I upgraded the camera and lens software to the latest and it improved the function a little but it still just thinks too long.  I'm guessing 30% of the time I'd try to take a picture and it couldn't focus or took forever.  It advertises 5 fps but that's only on low resolution jpg, if you want to shoot raw format it's 1.5 fps.  I have high speed sd cards and it's still taking forever to save before it lets you take another shot.  If you're moving up from a very basic point and shoot it looks cool and has nice artsy shot features you might like.  If you've used a good camera before you're going to be disappointed.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for video, but merely okay for photos.", "Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "RCAIDOYZASDIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on Black Friday because my Cannon Rebel was on the fritz.I love that this camera can take wonderful video and pictures. We bought it to replace our handheld out of date digital flip camera.I also bought it because it is the smallest camera on the market with an removable lens. I thought it would be perfect for the diaper bag- and it is, but it cannot replace my Cannon Rebel because:1) No view finder, only a digital display.Because you have to look at the digital display instead of holding the camera up to your check to steady it during shots, my hands can tremble and shake, which leads me to the next point.2) Not having a view finder makes it hard to focus your shots.I have an extremely hard time telling if my shots are in focus and my vision is 20/20. I feel like I need glasses or readers when I use this camera. I can tell when things are way off, but not slightly off focus. The quality of my shots with this camera in comparison to my Cannon Rebel are disappointing. I can take such focused clear shots of my children with the rebel, even when they move. With this camera, it's so hard to tell what your focus is on. Also, the camera won't take shots quickly, so my quick toddlers are running about. It's almost asif the camera is metering every time I press the button. I have adjusted the ISO, hopefully that will help. As you can tell, I'm just a mom with a camera (fauxtographer), and not a real photographer, but these are two points that really have affected my ability to take great focused pictures of my children. I'm sure a real photographer could take wonderful pictures with this camera, but for this novice. It's just not easy.3) Small buttons (Just FYI, for my large fingered peeps out there).If you have large fingers, this isn't the camera for you. This is not a reason for me to not buy it, but others out there might not be able to use it as easily because of large fingers, like some of my family members and friends have pointed out when I let them try out the camera.These complaints aside, it's a great camera to keep in the abyss that I refer to as my diaper bag, but I require a better camera for those moments you want to cherish and not just have snapshots of.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "moonspiralz", "ReviewID": "R1S96YFEQBKHHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is crazy small and a lot of fun.

I used a traditional SLR in college, therefore appreciate the customizable settings but also like option of preset scene settings.

It takes very sharp photos and it suits me just fine.  The shutter is very quick.  The camera is very small.  I bought an 0ld style Pentax camera cover and that completes the camera.

Well, this is my 4th Pentax camera. I believe in the brand and their quality and cheaper prices. I use this camera more than the DSLR I have and have replaced my point and shoot cannon. Great camera, better yet if you buy the other lenses. Smaller than the SLR and if you are a beginner in the SLR camera, this is a great camera to use. Also, takes less space and its definitely lighter to carry around.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fun design and great option for size and price", "Author": "Alexander Chapin \"alejandro_caliente\"", "ReviewID": "R3LRA3ZLXBAZ4M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was immediately pleased with the design of this camera because it is what I am used to holding and I like the idea that I could get other lenses. I have played with the options and found many shooting modes that I like including a raw mode that produces good quality images. My only main problem with the camera is that it requires a separate charger for the lith-ion battery and cannot be plugging directly into a wall or computer for charging.
