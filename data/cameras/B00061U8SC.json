{"Reviews": [{"Title": "When they work, they are great", "Author": "Rick S.", "ReviewID": "RQB42V1CX0NYC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have two Axis 213-PTZ cameras.  They are one serial number apart and were obtained at the same time.  One works great.  The zoom is amazing.  The U/I leaves a bit to be desired and there are some features lacking - most notably the ability to limit an \"operator\" account to just selecting the preset positions.  If you allow operator access, they can use all the functions of the camera.  There are workarounds documented in the Axis customer forum - but they involve crafting control scripts.The other camera, after a flash upgrade of the firmware, failed with a \"NO VIDEO\" message. Axis says it is a known hardware issue and charged me $75 to \"repair\" the camera.  I reinstalled the unit and it had exactly the same error.  I am far less than satisfied with the service.You can follow this case on the Axis Forum at this URL:[...]I am wondering how long it will take to get this fixed.I like the camera - but Axis customer service leaves much to be desired.  It is all documented in the forum page.For the high cost of this camera, I think the money is better spent on a Sony or Panasonic", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Product Type - Network Camera\nFlash Memory - 32 MB\n- Simultaneous Motion JPEG and MPEG-4\n- AXIS 213CM Connection Module for two-way audio and alarm inputs/outputs", "Name": "AXIS Network Camera 213 PTZ - digital video camera ( 0220-004 )", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419UL6vc-IL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00061U8SC"}}
