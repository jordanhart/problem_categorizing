I tried to locate the manufacturer's website to download the software. There is an error message says the website doesn't exist.I tried looking for the software on third-party sites, and only PC drivers are available. The camera seems well made, but it's totally useless to me if I can't get it to operate on my computer. As far as I'm concerned, this product and its company are a dud.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007ROP34U"}}
