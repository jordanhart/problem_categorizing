Myer", "ReviewID": "R2KU31OEOGBU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...it would be an excellent system.  Setting this up has been frustrating.  First thing I did was read the manual.  That may have been a mistake because the manual did not state that it had VGA output, and I could have used that.  Instead, the manual documents a BNC connector output.  I was unfamilliar with those.  So, I am immediately trying to figure what I can do to cable this thing up.  The device comes with a mini-CD, so I put it in my CDR, ok?  Well, I didn't know that it would fall inside the drive and get stuck.  My CDR is side-mount.  So I start dissassembling my computer and rattling the CD around and finding a probe to get the door open, etc.  I got the CD out.  So don't do that.  Then, to use the disk (and have a backup), I set my computer on it's side and copied the disk to a standard size CD using clone software I already had.  Now I look at the CD manual.  The printed booklet says that the Admin password is 000000.  The CD manual says that the Admin password is 888888.  Ok???My monitor, which is not so old (1 year) does not support BNC input.  So I start looking for compatible adapters.  BNC to VGA, RCA, SVideo, RCA Composite, HDMI, etc.  Then I do notice, after ordering cables and adapters like crazy, that there is RCA support that matches my monitor, so I order that too.  I still haven't figured out how to get audio to come through.  Oh, I bought a BNC cable with camera power, but every time I tried to connect it I noticed that the power was Female-to-Female, and useless for powering the camera.  Eventually, after a couple of weeks of experimenting with stuff, and actually considering a splice job for the camera power, I noticed that the BNC cable was not the same on each end as far as the power supply is concerned.  When I switched ends of the cable, viola!, I discovered that the camera power would now plug into the available connector.So, finally I did get the camera connected to the DVR, but I was still trying to figure out how to get the output from the DVR to the monitor.  I initially used a VGA cable I discovered that I had from an old computer, and finally after at least a month, I could see something when I turned on the system.  The documentation is pathetic.  The user-interface is lacking.  The system features are excellent, however.  Of course I don't understand them all because there is nothing to describe what is supposed to happen.I am glad I have the system.  It is pretty awesome.  You just need to dedicate a portion of you life to finding all the connectors you might need.  And still no audio?  I almost bought a separate BNC to RCA converter.  Pretty confusing.Addendum:  after months and months of wondering why I don't have audio, I figured out that although my camera was advertised as having audio capability it does not.  I was expecting BNC to send audio signals also since there was no audio cable from my camera - hence the confusion.  It is too late to return the camera - but, a lesson learned...", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,549.95", "Features": "4 channel H.264 compression triplex real time industrial stand alone DVR, 1500GB hard drive included\n3.5\" SATA hard drive (HDD)\nTwo USB interface, one for data backup, one for mouse operation\nSupport daylight saving time, PIP and EZOOM function\nSupport the live video, parameter setting and copy playback video via network", "Name": "VideoSecu CCTV 4 Channel Video Audio H.264 Security Surveillance DVR Network Embedded Real Time Digital Video Recorder System Support Remote View iPhone Google Phone Build-in 1500GB (1.5TB) SATA Hard Drive 1YT", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NYZy45LuL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000X3PCYS"}}
