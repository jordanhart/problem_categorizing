If you can connect a Red, Black, and White male plug to a Red, Black, White female plug then this is perhaps the easiest device to install even if your a monkey. Seriously, it works great, good quality, good price, includes long wires, everything you need for a 10 minute install. Quick shipping. I have 3 of these and they work great day and night outdoors.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never could get to work", "Author": "Thomas O.

However, the instructions to install were terrible.  It is a newer camera for an older system.  It was hard figuring out how to adapt.  The diagram on the instructions did not show the camera that was sent and did not have areas that were shown.  If it was like the pictures, it would have been much easier to install.  Once I figured out what to do (thanks to Radio Shack employee that knew what adapters to try) and I got it installed, the camera is great.  Very clear, the night time vision is real clear and good.  I'm not sure how easy it is to install with a newer system, but once installed you would be very happy with it.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "Affordable day night color audio video CMOS security camera.
