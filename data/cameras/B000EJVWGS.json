{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Super Optical Quality, Low Light Performance and More!", "Author": "Michael Morgan", "ReviewID": "R2OLR9D3DVTHG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Canon guy for several years and throught that they lead the pack in photographic innovation.  My family has several Canon SLR's, assorted lenses and digital Elph pocket cameras (SD 400, SD450 and SD550).  Pocket cameras trade performance and features for small size and ease of use.  In bright light without flash the Canon Elphs usually provide image quality which is ok for 8 x 10\" photos if one is not too critical about sharpness, especially near the edges and corners.  This resolution limit has more to due with the lackluster optics being used than with the number of megapixels.  Basically, the tiny lenses are the limiting factor and not the sensor.The Fuji F30 is about the same size and weight as the Canon SD550 (or SD700).  I bought it based on the rave reviews it got in the high-ISO, low light category.  So, when I tested it against my 7.1MP Canon SD550 I was greatly surprised by the vastly superior image quality of the 6.3MP Fuji at ALL ISO settings.  The Fujicon lens used provides much sharper pictures than the Canon from edge to edge.  Sure, the Canon will make ok 8 x 10's but those from the Fuji will be much sharper and crisper, especially away from the center where the Canon image gets softer.  The difference is even more striking in lower light, such as indoors or outside when the sun is low or under heavy clouds.  The Fuji provides much sharper AND lower noise images at ISO 800 than the Canon does at ISO 200.  Essentially, the Fuji can use the same shutter speed (to freeze action and mitigate hand-shake) in one-fourth the light while still producing superior pictures!!!  The Fuji could also provide a shutter speed four-times faster in the same light and give sharper pictures and less noisy pictures.Another advantage of the Fuji F30 is the option to have full manual control over aperture, metering, etc, just like an SLR (no manual focus however).  The LCD on the Fuji is also much brighter and clearer (many more pixels and less reflective) than the Canon.  One more advantage is battery life.  The Fuji battery is about twice as large as that used in the Canon SD550.  It is rated at 580 shots while the Canon is rated at about 150 shots.  There's not nearly as much need to buy and carry a spare battery for the Fuji.OK, the Fuji does have a few disadvantages over the Canon.  The worst of these to me is the use of tiny xD memory cards.  Not only do you need to buy yet another type of card but large 1GB xD cards require much longer times (about 5-10 times as long) to transfer images to your computer through a card reader than do 1GB SD cards.  The reason for this is that the small sized xD card require special hardware compression to allow 1GB to be stored.  In reading the card the pictures have to be uncompressed into normal jpeg format.  This slows down the transfer.  The xD card compression seems to have no effect on how fast the camera can take pictures.  The Fuji is at least as fast as the Canon in starting up and taking pictures.Another lessor complaint IMO is the supplied Fuji battery charger.  It charges the battery only while in the camera and has a cord to plug into the camera and another long cord to plug into the wall.  In contrast, Canon provides a very tiny battery charger with folding outlet prongs.  This packs easily and charges the battery directly with NO cords.  Fuji could provide a similar charger but, instead, offers to sell you their version of the Canon cordless charger for an extra $60-90 as an accessory.  You can also buy a non-Fuji version of the cordless charger for about $28, so it's not a big issue, but is an irritation.  It is also worth noting that the Fuji has no peephole viewfinder.  I rarely use this but some folks may think this an omission.  On the other hand, the Fuji LCD is much brighter and less reflective than the Canon screen so it can actually be used in bright sunlight when the peephole would be the only option with the Canon.In summary, aside from the issues of the xD card and supplied charger, the Fuji F30 represents a significant breakthrough in image quality, low-light performance and optional manual controls for small pocket cameras.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Low Light Performance", "Author": "C. Dsa", "ReviewID": "R2W6ECGOQZ1YSC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The F30 continues in the F10 tradition. After years of trying to hype up interest in their cameras with SuperCCD claims of 12 MPs etc But falling completely short with excess noise, Fuji has come out with a decent camera this time. This camera compares very well to the higher megapixel cameras like the Canon SD550 and the Sony W70.Fuji succeeded in besting the previous FinePix F10 which was well liked for the quality of its high ISO upto 800 ISO images. The F30 as about a stop better in terms of image quality. So at ISO 800 the images are similar to ISO 400 images on the F10. Higher ISO increases the sensitivity of the sensor to light but at a cost of increased noise.Generally the image sensors in digital cameras can be adjusted so that the ISO setting can be increased by simply amplifying the output of the image sensor, which increases image noise, sometimes beyond the level that is acceptable. Just as in photographic film, greater sensitivity comes with some loss of image quality, though this is visible as noise rather than grain.Here in the Fuji F30, even ISO 1600 is usable. However, note that ISO 3200 images do suffer from noise artifacts. You are not going to notice any of this for small prints but not for prints above 8x10. However no other small point and shoot digicam offers ISO 3200 - in fact not even DSLRs like Canon Rebel 350XD does this..I think its closest competitors are the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX01, Sony W100 and the Canon SD630 all of which are priced slightly lower than the Fuji and have some really compelling features. The Panasonic even has image stabilization which this F30 does not have.Here are the PROS (Good Things)1)The F30 is almost identical in shape and weight to its predecessor, the F10 except for that it's a bit more rounded. In size, it is in between compact and ultra-compact. It is similar in size to the Canon SD550. It has a nice sturdy metal body, although not as sleek as and thicker than the Canon SD line  but an improvement over the F102) Very low noise upto ISO 800 although has purple fringing on some pictures. Blows away the other cameras here. The ISO1600 on the F30 is far less nosiy than the ISO1000 on the new Sony cameras.3) Low light: This is the main feature and this little camera has actually usable ISO 1600 settings. The ISO3200 is barely useable if you run it through \"neat-image\". In some cases (not all) this eliminates the need for the the image stablization. I have not been able to find a better point and shoot at ISO1600 which is only avaible on DSLR.4) Very good battery life. Fuji says 580 pictures per charge...really good for this small camera. I got about 300 pictures for a charge5) Priced very well if you take a lot of pictures in the nightclubs and parties.6) Finally a good movie mode (at 640 x 480 and very crisp 30 fps)Here are the CONS (BAD Things)1) Uses those pesky SLOWWW xD cards which are harder to find, more expensive and smaller capacities than the SD cards. In comparison to performance. xD is slow, low capacity, and overall really dumb(only on Fuji and Oly cams, while SD are in... everything). A lot of my friends were planning to buy the F30, but really upset at the xD flash format.2) No optical viewfinder. This will come back to haunt you in bright sunlight when the LCD gets completely washed out.3) Really stupid design flaw of the use of a propreitary Fuji USB cable. Thanks for getting rid of the dock/adapter from the F10 for any of the ports, including USB, A/V out, or Power.4) Hard to use menu system. Canon and Sony totally blow away this camera is ease of use menu system5) Manual controls are better than the F10 but not as good as the Canon manual control. Not all combinations are available in all exposure modes. Fuji tries too hard to make their cameras as \"idiot proof\" as possible, which tends to be frustrating for more advanced shooters. Getting the settings you want takes a bit of menu changes and mode switching...but you are buying this camera for its point and shoot capabilities and not manual controls.. right !!6) Lens is not wide-angle as compared to the Panasonic which starts out at 28 mm. The Fuji starts out at a longer 36 mm which are not very useful for wide angle work.7) Autofocus did not work very well for me. It was slow and tended to search and then it picked the wrong points.8) Does not have IMAGE stablization. Fuji tries to compete with Panasonic and misrepresents the camera by labeling a mode as \"Picture Stabilization\". However this is not an optical image stabilization system. Just a really dumb confusing mode which adjusts the ISO setting (from ISO 100 to ISO 3200) to give a shutter speed fast enough to eliminate blur due to camera shake.9) Oddly enough, not as good on outdoor bright sunny days as it is indoors /at night. THe tonal curves produce images that lack highlight or shadow detail. There is also a huge tendency to over expose in most of the outdoor pictures. On large blow-ups (13x19 and above), the colors appear to be kind of \"smeared\". Skin tones appear to be little funny at lower ISOs and with flash. Some have an exaggeration of blues or overemphasis of orange. Some pictures are too contrasty and over-saturated, so details gets lost. Canon pictures are a lot more crisper.10) Controls are very limited.. for example no flash power control.11) Large Bulky AC Adaptor. Canon has a nice one which plugs right into the wall with built-in prongs.12) Built-in flash is weak.. even weaker than the f10 and you cannot attach an external flash13) Made in China. The older models F10 etc were made in Japan. This F30 model is now made in China. I dont know if this will have an impact on quality.Overall this camera depends on your needs.. if you do a lot of outdoor shooting, go for the Panasonic or the Canons.. If you do about 70 - 80% of your shooting at night events and parties then this Fuji is for you. In summary its best feature is its low-light capability and its biggest flaw is the xD cards. I also stay away from any cameras from Olympus which uses the same small capacity slow but expensive xD cards.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fuji F30 vs Canon SD700IS vs Panasonic Lumix FX01", "Author": "Disgruntled Post-Doc", "ReviewID": "RYK6KROCUUMJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently I'd planned to replace my Panasonic Lumix FX7  with the FX9. I love the handy little FX7, but its battery life was prohibitively short. To the point that anxiety about when the camera was going to die was marring the pleasure of vacations.The FX9 has twice the battery life and I thought, problem solved. But just as I was beginning to purchase the FX9, the FX01 came out. I was thrilled, as I could really use the extra wide angle capability.But then the Canon SD700IS came out. What a lovely little camera. Beautifully made, also good battery life, a longer lens, and now with the Panasonic's trump card, optical IS. And while it seems that the image quality of the FX01 is a slight step down from FX9, the Canon appears to be a clear step up.  Megapixel absolutely loved the SD700ISMy only hesitation was that some time ago my wife bought me a Canon A80. It had a tendency to \"smooth\" the image and I didn't like it.  It seemed to diminish the realism and crispness of the picture.  Indeed, the criteria I'm used to using when evaluating a camera or camera lens are sharpness, contrast, and saturation. Yes, I could sharpen the image made by the Canon using the computer, so clearly the data was being recorded. However, the actual plane of focus, even after sharpening, is not obvious.  I know that professionals actually prefer this smoothness, but I found this so troubling that after days of agonizing, I sent the otherwise lovely A80 back.When I later acquired the Panasonic FX7, I didn't hold it to the same standard, since it is truly only a pocket camera.  I was resigned to accepting slightly disappointing images, but was grateful the camera was there to get the shot. And as long as it is set to ISO 80, the FX7 can deliver a pretty good image and has good lens.As I agonized about my decision, I looked at quite a few online camera review sites. I particularly like Dpreview, Dcresource, Megapixel and Dave's picks. So, I carefully scrutinized the sample pictures for the SD700IS, and uh oh, there's that Canon smoothing again. This is particularly obvious if you have a look at the macro shot of Mickey Mouse in the DCresource site. The silver bit on Mickey's hat is just a blur- yipe! It's not out of focus, but it almost looks like it is due to the \"smoothness\". It's just not my cup of tea.As a piece of kit, the SD700IS is a great thing, so despite the smoothness I didn't want to totally let go of the idea of getting it. As I was agonizing over the camera's images, I noted that in Dpreview, cameras are often compared to a very high resolution camera called the \"Fuji F10\". This camera's images are a virtually always superior to whatever they are compared to, so much so that I had just assumed it was a DSLR. But I clicked on it and I was shocked to discover that it is another point and shoot!Now all of a sudden there was another player. I looked through the images from all the website reviews, and in terms of image detail, contrast and ISO the F10 with its \"superCCD\" appears to be in a slightly higher league than other point and shoots, including the Canon 700IS.The newer F30 just came out, and so I decided to bite the bullet and buy one before the DPreview came out. I was a little spooked by the Megapixel review, which did not give the F30 as high a rating as the CanonSD700. On the other hand, Dave's site provides a means of side-by side comparison between the CanonSD700 and the F30. In this case, in equal light, my own subjective assessment gave the edge to the F30. But at 400 ISO and above, the F30 blew the CanonSD700 away.  In fact, the image quality of the F30 at ISO 400 is as good as the SD700IS at 100, and vastly better than the FX01.True, the main strength of the F30 is its light gathering capability, making it seem like a one trick pony. However, it is a very important trick. A camera is a machine whose main purpose it to gather light, focus it, and record it. The F30 is very very good at this. It's bit like saying a particular racing car is a one trick pony if it has more horse power than the other cars. Again, if you are going to pick one trick to be good at, that is a very major trick. And when I'm honest with myself, I frequently use  point and shoots in low light situations- indoors, in shaded areas, at dawn, at dusk, at night. When I look at my average travel photos- a very high percentage of the shots are in low light. With many of my shots with the Panasonic FX7, the static parts of the image are clear, but the people are blurry. This is the legacy of low-light optical image stabilized shots. I'm steady, shooting between breaths, the camera is steady, thanks to OIS- but the subject is not completely still. But by shooting 2 or even 3 stops faster, my hope is that both the people and the background will be clear.When the F30 arrived, I immediately noted it is larger than the Panasonic FX01, which was a bit disappointing. And although easy to use, it didn't seem quite as slick at the Canon. However, as I handled the camera for the first few days, I realized that it is very well made, and one has the feeling that being tightly squeezed in a jeans pocket won't hurt it. So I'm now fairly comfortable shoving it in my pocket.But once I saw the camera's first pictures, all concerns vanished. The pictures are phenomenal. The sharpness, edge definition, and lack of noise in the low light shots are so good that the camera is really in a higher league than the other point and shoots I was considering. Granted, saturation is a bit low. I used to be an enthusiastic amateur photographer- Bogen tripods, Nikkor Lenses, and push processing my Fuji Velvia one stop. You know the drill. Well, that was years ago. But the F30 is good enough that I'm starting to take more artistic shots again. And I'll just bump up the saturation a bit using the computer.Another facet is that phenomenal battery life. I shot 375 images, with flashes, and lots of reviewing, and even transferred them to my computer before the battery indicator finally moved from full to the next level down.  On my second 4 day trip with the camera, I didn't bother to bring the charger. I didn't need it.  Sitting for 2 weeks without use- turning it on- full charge indicated with no losses.  What a difference, and what a relief from the constant ritual of charging the battery after every 5 hours with the Panasonic FX7.So the F30 is a two trick pony- battery life and fantasic light gathering.When the Dpreview came out, it confirmed my findings. The dpreview is spot on. If you compare the images of the Fuji F30 and the Canon SD700 at 400, 800, well, it's not even close. I wouldn't hesitate to blow up an ISO 400 shot from the Fuji, wherease with the Canon, I might not even bother to take an ISO 400 shot. In retrospect, I'm a bit puzzled the scoring of the Megapixel review, which I'm chalking up to their weighting the handling and menu systems highly.Since I'm primarily concerned with image quality, battery life, and the speed to focus, the F30 is perfect for me. The camera does what is it advertised to do and I'm really happy that I have it along with me, knowing that I'll never have to feel even slightly disappointed by the results.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "An Impressive Piece of Photographic Technology", "Author": "Michael G. Leventhal \"dublin9\"", "ReviewID": "RDC6FLG3SGJRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Finepix F30 is the first camera in its class that allows the user to take low light photographs without flash.  In the outdoors, it's the first camera in its class that allows the user to take action photos on cloudy days and capture a dog in mid-leap as it grabs a frizbee in its jaws.I truly wish people would stop lamenting over the F30s lack of \"Image Stabalization.\" The latter doesn't help much at all in capturing real life photography.  Image Stabalization is excellent for taking movies because it compensates for hand shake.That's all it does.  It is not intended to freeze movement of the subject.  For that, you need high ISO sensitivity, and all of you Canon and Panasonic loving syncophants should reconcile your minds to the fact that in this area, the Finepix F30 breaks new and even hostoric ground for a camera this size.Outdoors photography isn't always taking photos of people posing, or static landscapes.  It's capturing the flight of a butterfly, or a flower waving in the wind, or a bird in flight.  And in these cases, high ISO is far more important than worrying about stabalizing the shake of your hand.In an ideal world, digital cameras would have high ISO sensitivity for enabling fast shutter speeds and Image Stabalization for that extra help against a shutter release fumble.  But few things are ideal and if given the option, I wouldn't think twice in choosing the ability to use high shutter speeds with moderate aperture openings.I've used the Finepix F30 for several weeks now as a handy take everywhere supplement to my larger cameras.  I've taken some 350 photos under all conceivable circumstances, including many using flash.  The battery indicator has just dropped to half, which means that Fuji's claim of some 580 shots per charge is accurate.When set to Fine/Hard mode, colors are excellent and photos are quite sharp with virtually no noise through ISO 1600.  ISO 3200 can be used in a pinch.  Compare that to any other camera in of its kind.While I prefer using an eyepiece, a refresh rate of 60 per second for the rear viewer allows comfortable use even on sunny days.  I might also add that the movie mode in 640X480 is very impressive.Finally, I don't like XD cards because of their small size.  I'm 6'2\" and have large hands.  Bud I don't like SD cards either and prefer the 1 inch square and more substantial feel of CF cards.  But you debunkers of XD technology should understand that lab tests on read/write speed are frequently misnomers.  True usable speed is based on the interaction of the memory card and the electronics of the camera.  And in this context, I've found that the F30 writes at about average speed.As for autofocus, the F30 is blazingly fast.  Anyone who claims otherwise is showing a bit of prejudice.The Finepix F30 is with little doubt, the best all around camera of its kind.  There is nothing like it for \"real life\" photography.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Mixed Bag: Big strengths paired with big weaknesses", "Author": "NewsView", "ReviewID": "RO8QQNT0FYM09", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You know the specs. You've read the reviews. You might have even been caught up in the hype. So let me get straight to the point: My Fuji FinePix F30 observations:First off, I'm not sure why people loathe the XD format. I purchased a current-generation, high-speed 1 Gig XD card for about $30 a year or so ago -- not much more than its SD counterpart.Second, I must mention that the video mode on this camera is absolutely phenomenal for a digital camera -- complete with stereo sound!Third, the battery life, at 500+ shots per charge, is astounding. (I wish cell phone batteries lasted this long!)With respect to flash performance, the Fuji FinePix F30 is also a lot better in macro mode than other digital cameras I own (three presently). Specifically, the flash doesn't wash everything out because it stomps down in anticipation that the subject will be close to the lens -- which helps improve image detail and color accuracy in ways I have not been able to obtain with other cameras I've owned or used. Color reproduction, with or without flash, is also a strong point. Even difficult to capture colors, such as those on the feathering of my Budgerigars, are true-to-life -- something that none of my film shots, let alone my digital cameras, ever accomplished.  Likewise, image noise is surprisingly low, which helps bring out the detail -- providing you don't lose them to overexposure or motion blur, which will be the focus of the remainder of this review.DPREVIEW, among other professional digital camera review sites, has mentioned, but underemphasized, IMHO, a tendency for image exposure to vary considerably -- even when shooting the same scene back-to-back. Sometimes auto exposure is spot-on, and sometimes not. That being said, the F30s exposure consistency is still much improved over the F10 (had and returned three of those due to problems I ultimately attributed to inconsistent quality control, otherwise known in the digital camera world as \"sample variation\").  Getting back to my point, overexposure is mostly a problem under bright sun. To one degree or another, many of the outdoor or landscape pictures shown here on Amazon demonstrate blown highlights and/or chromatic aberrations (purple fringing). While all digital cameras suffer from this to some extent, there are others that reconcile light and dark areas of an image much better -- even so-called entry-level cameras such as the Panasonic LZ series -- that are roughly half the price. Translation? This is not your best camera for vacation photos. I went to a theme park, for example, and the white roller coaster tracks against a blue sky just clip off in mid air -- not during a summer at midday, but under a winter sun less than an hour before sunset!Another unfortunate surprise: The camera performs absolutely horridly inside even the slowest and brightly lit kiddie rides (regardless of setting). The low light is not a problem as is typically the issue with competing digital cameras; rather, unlike other digital cameras I have used under the same circumstances, the focus is very easily disrupted by photographer motion. Similarly, if you can't brace well or don't have a steady hand, this camera isn't the best choice -- ostensibly because it completely lacks true image stabilization (to help compensate for the shaking). Consequently, inside the rides, only one out of every 10 pictures was a \"keeper\". True, it's a hard situation for any camera, but I've had digital cameras as old as six years that managed to capture a higher rate -- albeit noisier -- percentage of focused images under identical shooting conditions. The rare F30 shot that came out focused under these conditions, however, was significantly brighter looking with less image noise; however, the camera's excellent handling of low light is precisely why it is so frustrating to have such a great range of useable ISOs paired with a camera that has trouble remaining focused due to motion blur or, perhaps more accurately, anytime the scene is even slightly reframed after the initial focus object has been obtained. The only exception to the motion=blur rule was when shooting out of a moving car (as a passenger, of course!). My amateur guess is that auto focus to infinity helps the camera compensate. In a theme park ride, by comparison, objects are much closer to the lens -- and not as well lit -- which probably explains why they rarely turn out no matter what automatic setting is used.On a related note, Fuji documentation for the F-series warns users that panning is not a recommended use of their cameras. Sure enough, when I shot images of my 60-gallon aquarium, I had no success capturing the activity behind the glass. Whereas a six-year-old camera I owned faired well shooting into an aquarium, even churning out postcard like results with modest effort, none of the Fuji F-series cameras I've used, including the F30, can produce a useable picture under like circumstances. For this reason marine park and aquarium enthusiasts should consider a camera that handles panning better than the F30. For similar reasons, panning to follow active subjects in close proximity would seem to preclude many situations, including sports at close range, fast moving people at dance clubs and active pets or children.Even low light use revealed its share of surprises. Fireworks mode, as the manual states, won't work without a tripod. As such, the anti-blur mode was my choice for hand-held fireworks shots. (Even better for capturing fireworks is the camera's video setting.) Similarly, I shot roughly 100 pictures in dual natural light + flash mode over the holidays, yet threw out all but a handful of natural light pics.  Reason? In default settings the camera tends to choose its unusable maximum setting indoors: ISO 3200. (I guess the people I know don't have very well lit homes.) As a result, indoor images are never particularly crisp or accurately saturated. Second unpleasant surprise: Outdoors at night, the moon turns into a luminous white haze -- so much so that it is barely circular in shape (using the camera in point-and-shoot mode). Seemingly, the Fuji F30, at least in auto settings, cannot reconcile a bright full moon and dark surroundings. Ditto for bright neon lights (Los Vegas style) or even lights in parking lots. Light instead forms streaks, flares and gigantic halos. To a lesser degree, the same phenomena takes place indoors: Lit floor or table lamps in my natural light images cast a diffuse glow that washed out detail in nearby people and objects.Don't get me wrong: I like the camera for what it can do that others cannot (and for its high-resolution, low-glare LCD). So who is best suited for this camera? Answer: Those who negate its weaknesses (in full auto) by making full use of the manual settings and features. For those who do not have the steadiest hands, most camera know-how or just lack the patience, there are less expensive cameras to be found that will serve you nicely. If Fuji's legendary low-light performance has you sold, however, I would say that its main strength is for still-life shots (objects, museums and the like). A second strength is macro photography (flowers and smaller). A third use would be relatively distant subjects (sports scenes from the stands). Who should avoid this camera? I would stay away from the Fuji FinePix F30 if you live in a mostly sunny climate and intend to use it in full auto mode primarily as an outdoor camera (for vacations and the like). Though your individual user experience will vary, it's not the do-all camera to end all searches for the perfect digital imaging tool.Bottom line? Low light superstar or not, there's just no overlooking what I believe to be the biggest oversight of all: Lack of true gyroscopic image stabilization. If you have a habit taking shots over your head or shooting low profile objects, pets or people, you won't be in perfect compensatory bracing form. Similarly, hyperactive or excitable types, those who drink a lot of caffeinated drinks, or anyone who has a medical condition that causes handshake or tremor will appreciate a noticeable improvement using a digital camera, such as Panasonic or select Sony or Canon models, which supplies genuine image stabilization. Problem is, despite the advertising, the Fuji FinePix F30 does not include an image stabilizer -- only a combination of fixed ISOs and increased shutter speeds. It's a modest improvement over the Fuji FinePix F10, which had no anti-blur mode whatsoever, but as an owner of cameras with and without gyroscopic image stabilization I can attest to the fact that Fuji's anti-blur mode is still a poor substitution for the real thing (in terms of percentage of useable pictures, particularly under challenging shooting circumstances, such as panning to follow your subject).  Unlike gyroscopic image stabilization, which is always enabled for every setting and any picture you wish to shoot on competing cameras, the F30's anti-blur mode is only one setting of many on the camera dial, and completely inaccessible in full auto or scene modes. Although the Fuji FinePix F30 takes many steps in the right direction, I won't be joining the \"cult of Fuji\" quite yet.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Superb", "Author": "J.

I have liked my prior two Fuji's but have had reliability problems, battery life problems, exposure problems.  Minor.  I decided to step up.  I was looking at any and everythingi from Panasonic/Canon/Olympus to Leica.  I could afford anything and had 2 cameras to trade in.I finally settled on the F30.  First of all I was impressed with the uniformity of excellent reviews across a whole range of sites online.  Second, my local camera store raved about this, despite the fact that I said the only thing I wanted was high quality pictures, price no object.Frankly, I'm very impressed.  I didn't want to go from AA's to proprietary lithium, but frankly @ >500 pix on a charge I am OK.  With my prior camera the AA's wore down in a day.  With this, it is small enough to go in my pack 24/7 and the battery has lasted over a 2 weeks with no sign of loss.  I am totally fine with Xd cards, in fact I didn't want to switch to something else.  Lack of optical viewfinder was a touchy area but frankly the other cameras I was looking at lacked one also, so I figured I'd make the leap.  Fit and finish are wonderful.  Video is excellent, in fact for travel I used to use a combo camcorder that took stills; now I use this for the occasional videos that I want.  (incidentally, they sync with my creative Zen perfectly.  I mean perfectly)Picture quality is superb.  I buy into the super CCD and the quality of the lens.  This is far better optically than my e550 - no contest.  I can magnify this on my monitor to tremendous zooms and the resolution is phenomenal.  I take a picture of ivy from 20 feet away and blow it up till it fills my 15\" monitor with just a leaf and it is crisp.Menu, great.  Ergonomics - so-so.  Very hard to pick up with moderate sized hands.  NO grip - hard to pull out blind from your pack and orient yourself.  Probably my major gripe.Very happy with selections.  Like the 1600-3200 ISO settings.  Superb in low light.  I was very disappointed with prior cameras - birthday parties, kids indoors, snapshots in restaurants, buildings, museums were blurry and awful.  No more.Zoom is adequate.  I wanted resolution.

Handl", "ReviewID": "R1G0ZZ1NYDLX3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have two small kids and most of my pictures happen in interior settings (at home or at parties) and mostly after the sunset. My previous camera was 5 years old, had a large shutter delay and could not take pictures at low light, so most of my pictures were moved and missed the moment. It basically worked well in sunlight and that was it.I was waiting for the Panasonic LX2 to come out, because it has many features I liked better than the F30 (wide angle, manual controls, etc). But it came out and the noise in even well lit pictures at ISO 100 is really awful, so I decided not to wait anymore and went for the Fujifilm F30.The F30 is not the perfect camera (that would be the Panasonic LX2 with Fujifilm SuperCCD sensor) but it meets my needs perfectly. The flash is only needed to fill a backlit scene, but I never again used flash under any other circumstance. There's no need.I have to say it performs exactly as I expected. I was traveling with two friends, each with his own camera, and all the shots taken at night had to be taken with my F30 because the other cameras (comparable pocket digicams) could not handle the low light as the pictures turned out moved or noisy.As a bonus, the movie mode is so good that I stopped using my DV camcorder, even considering that the 640x480 video frames are smaller than the 720x480 DV frames. But the video quality of the F30 is so much better that I am happy to have less pixels. Of course, I am using a 1Gb memory card, otherwise I wouldn't be able to take useful movie clips.So, I am very happy with my purchase, even after having some problems with Amazon and its customer support (hint: don't cancel an order if you have little credit left on your card; Amazon doesn't handle that too well and their customer support people simply don't get it).", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not a PhD Camera", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3QMASFL3M2D53", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "[Update 7/2/06: As the edits below indicate, I've decided to change my rating to 4/5 stars, but it's not possible to change this on Amazon's site.]I've had this camera for a week now.  I have mixed feelings about it.  I agree with one reviewer that this is a good camera for manual mode, or at least for semi-manual mode.  The biggest problem with this camera, in my opinion, is how the ISO settings are programmed for automatic use.  I don't recommend this model if you are looking for a \"push here dummy (PhD)\" camera.In Fully automatic mode, camera's firmware tends to force it to try to use the higher ISO settings.  This might be an effort to save on battery power by reducing the amount of flash required.  The result is that pictures indoors are often taken at ISO 800 or 1600 (sometimes 3200), all which produce too much noise, even though this camera does better than others in that regard--according to the F10 reviews, anyway.  I found that the camera could have done several things in fully automatic mode to enable it to take better-quality pictures: (1) it could have increased the flash power; (2) it could have opened the lens more (increased the aperture/lowered f-stop); (3) it could have reduced the shutter speed.  Since the camera was billed by Fuji as being a great one for low-light situations, I guess I can't blame them too much for this programming.To overcome this issue, I'm using semi-automatic (or semi-manual) mode.  In this mode, you can tell the camera \"don't use any ISO higher than 1600\" or \"don't use any ISO higher than 400\" or \"use only this ISO (one of 100/200/400/800/1600/3200)\"  [Those are all the choices.]  I've set it to \"at most ISO 400\" mode and that seems to be a good indoor compromise.  My indoor pictures are much better now.Outdoor pictures have a similar problem.  Whereas most PhD cameras would use ISO 80 or 100 for outdoor shots, the F30 picks 200 or more.  Why?  There's no need for this.  The only way to fix this is to go into the semi-manual mode and tell the camera to use only ISO 100.I will say that the low-light mode does come in handy.  I was able to get excellent no-flash close-up shots in the evening outside.  There's no way my old Oly could do that--there would be a flash, the foreground too bright with loss of accurate color, and the background would be black.  That's where this camera (F30) excels.  [Edit on 7/2/06:  I had a chance to use this camera at my kid's show at church.  The lights were on, but the church was not brightly lit.  Still, anyone who has taken pictures in this type of environment knows that a flash is necessary, and most point and shoot cameras have a really weak flash which is virtually useless past about 10 feet.  Well, this camera's flash is no exception.  It was of no use at 20 feet.  HOWEVER, when I used the semi-automatic mode with ISO set to max 1600 and the flash intentionally suppressed, I was really surprised at the pictures I was able to get.  Very well-exposed, though somewhat noisy (grainy) because of the high sensitivity required.  I also took some pictures about 6-8 feet away with the flash in the church.  These pictures were also properly exposed: the skin tones just right and the background visible.  Most point and shoot cameras would slightly over-expose the foreground and severely underexpose the background.  I was so impressed with this performance that I've decided the camera rates a 4/5 stars.  This is NOT a 5-star camera, no matter what anyone says.  Read the reviews carefully to see how much detail you get on those 5-star reviews.]Control over aperture and shutter speed (in A/S mode) is nice.  Again, I think the camera could do a better job of choosing aperatures which would improve the depth of field (light permitting).I'm not thrilled with the autofocus.  In my opinion, the auto-focus is slow (yes, I have it in high-speed mode).  It's also not very accurate.  My 5-year old Olympus D-490 focuses as fast and with better accuracy.  The F30 has a \"multi\" mode for autofocus, in which it attempts to find the most prominent object in the foreground.  Accuracy in this mode is questionable.  The decison point is often flat-out wrong.The camera has problems with high-contrast (light/dark) transitions and shows considerable noise/fringing at those transitions.  I knew from reviews that the F10 has this problem but it was not so bad, from the review pics I saw.  The F30 is much worse.Size:  I don't think this is a chunky camera at all (as one reviewer described it).  It's just big enough that I can work the buttons and hang onto it.  It goes into my front jeans pocket just fine (I'm a male, though and I could understand that, with the tight jeans that females wear these days, the camera would not fit in a jeans pocket).The camera's user interface is very good.  I'm happy with that part.  The F-button is very useful for manual-mode operation. Most operation is intuitive, or quickly becomes so.The software that comes with the camera is just plain pathetic.  I'm not going to waste my time reviewing it.  I no longer use it.  Oh, wait, there is one good thing: the red-eye reducer in the software is excellent.xD is a drawback.  The cards (even the Type H high-speed cards) are slower than the SD competition.  Support for xD is poor among card readers (be careful and make sure your card reader will support Type M and Type H if you buy those cards).  Fuji's own software \"upgrade\" for their own card reader (DPC-R1), to allow it to work with Type M and H cards DOES NOT WORK on Windows XP (fully updated).  It merely UN-installs whatever driver you had, and then what?  Nothing.  Card reader will no longer work.  I fortunately did the \"restore\" on Windows XP to get back to my original configuration.  I tried the Olympus MAUSB-200 reader and it worked fine with Type H.  [Edit 7/2/06:  I installed a front-panel-accessible, USB 2.0, multi-card reader from Atech Flash Technology (PRO-28U/XC-28U).  It is specified to be able to read xD, xD-Type M, and xD-Type H.  It works fine with the xD-Type H, and is available on Amazon and other places.

My nice Sony DSC-V3 has been sitting in the closet ever since I bought this (about 4 months ago).PROS-Absolutely the best sensitivity of any camera shy of a digital SLR. ISO 800 is perfect. ISO 1600 is usable. A digital SLR will blow it away, but ask yourself...do you REALLY want to carry around a big clunky camera with all those delicate parts? You can bring this with you in a jacket pocket, and it will give you the freedom to just snap images all over, discreetly. Its quite small, only a bit bigger and heavier then the real small ones.-The battery life. The other weekend I shot 450 images (without flash), and the battery did not drop down from a \"full\" charge! That's excellent because you can take this thing on a 5-day trip and leave the charger at home.-Its really pretty fast. Of course most of the newer generation cameras are.CONS-Purple fringing can be pretty high. Use Paint Shop Pro's purple fringing tool and you can make it disappear.-XD cards may not be supported by your computer card reader. The USB cable works great, but the bummer is you can't just swap this card into your PDA to check out the photos like you often can with an SD card.OTHER-This camera will not automatically deliver stunning photos. You need to learn how to use it...study its features and study  photography in general (for example, what is exposure compensation?). Then you need to experiment a LOT in different lighting conditions to get great photos. But with knowledge and practice you will appreciate the advantage that this camera offers over its competitors.-XD cards aren't bad...I bought a 1GIG high-speed XD card and it cost like $50. And that card is NOT slow and it holds more than 600 images on the high res setting!

I just wanted to add that I discoverred that, while Fuji says you must use slow type M XD cards, the camera works fine and fast with the older plain XD cards.  512MB says I have about 180 pictures to go, which is plenty for me.Auto mode defaults to ISO1600 and never switches to ISO 3200, even in pitch blackness.  To get ISO3200 you need to be in \"Manual.\"Movie mode makes huge AVI files.The \"stabilization\" labels are a lie.  Maybe the F40 will have optical stabilization.  I'd pay a bit more to have it.Realtime display is brighter than the same dark room by human eye.  However, upon download, these images look a bit dark and need to be photoshopped to brighten them up.Fuji insists you use their software.  However, I found that Win XP has a driver for the F30.  Under My Computer it shows as a Camera (not a drive).  From the Properties menu WinXP provides the option to automatically download the pictures into a new directory auto-created based upon calendar date.  Once configured, just plug in the F30, turn on the camera power and the download happens all by itself.  There is no need to disable the connection before unplugging (like there is with my older cameras).My best photos are candid indoor shots of people who do not realize they are being photographed.

In my opinion, the camera should never be used in fully automatic mode - the results from that mode do not do the camera justice.  I have found using the manual mode so I can control the ISO setting makes a huge differenece in my results.  Most photos up to ISO 800 are excellent and I have some very good results with ISO 1600 pictures.  Pictures taken at ISO 3200 are going to have noise (or loss of detail with noise reduction), but I am amazed at some of the shots that I can take that would just be a black screen on the Canon or the Sony.The Fuji F30 is easy for me to navigate and learn.

I have found image sharpness and contrast to be nearly perfect, with post processing rarely needed...except to fix the occasional purple fringing that appears in the high contrast areas of some outdoor shots.If you want to take portraits in natural light, even indoors, and need a compact, responsive camera the F30 is a great choice.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Low Light - Mediocre Metering", "Author": "Gadget Man \"Gadget Man\"", "ReviewID": "RKXOCRVM0134", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The low light capability is every bit as effective as everything you've read in the other reviews.  I also like the ability to contol the Auto ISO to 100-400 range if you want.  It also has the ability to control it from 100-1600.  Frankly I would have preferred an Auto-800 range to the latter which would allow Auto ISO ranging between 100 and 800.  The reason is that at ISO 800 the camera still performs very well  But at 1600 the quality does deteriorate considerably.This camera badly needs the function to set sharpness, contrast and saturation independently of the other settings.  As it is now, you can set at Standard which to most people will deliver a rather blah image (but you can adjust the saturation on the computer.)  Or you can set Chrome which provides vivid saturation and I think extra contrast - perhaps too much so.  Individual settings would be a welcome addition.The biggest weakness in this camera, which almost made me drop it to 3 stars is the inconsitant metering.  It has a tough time with sunny scenes.  Try to shoot flowers, and it will blow highlights more than 50% of the time.  Even with portraits, the flash overshoots the scene.  I found the best way to use this camera is to keep it at -1/3 exposure compensation, and sometimes use -2/3 compensation.  It's too bad the metering isn't as on the money as those in Sony, Panasonic and Canon cameras.The average metering is fairly worthless. The pattern metering is the most inconsistent.  The spot metering is your best bet to get good shots.One other weakness in the F30 is the inability to accurately examine pictures on the LCD screen.  The magnification is simply not high enough to see whether pictures are in focus or out of focus.  Lots of pictures that appear fine on the LCD, turn out to be blurry throw-aways on the computer.Still debating whether this camera is a keeper.

I do a lot of Ballroom dancing and edit a newsletter for our local chapter of USADance. We like to include pictures of our various dances and other events in the newsletter, and of course these are often of poor quality, since dancing mostly occurs in very dim light, and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the subjects are moving. The Finepix F30 boasted the ability to take pictures of moving subjects in poor lighting. It seemed ideal for my needs.My camera finally arrived on Friday, June 9, and I started using it that night. The results are even better than I expected, especially since I had not had any time to study the manual before leaving for the weekly Friday evening studio \"party.\" (I know virtually nothing about photography, although I have a fairly good eye for composition). Shots of the far end of the room clearly showed the subjects in full color with no black in the background.A couple of weeks later, I went on a bus trip to Maine which included a boat ride. The day was misty, with no sunshine. Again, the pictures were excellent, showing no signs of motion, even thought I was on a moving boat. Shots of seals lolling on a rocky island showed the individual seals better than I could see them with the naked eye.My next opportunity to test the camera came a couple of days later when my son and I visited my daughter with her new baby. Again, it was not a sunny day and we were in the house. I tried using the Natural/Flash setting whereby the camera will take 2 pictures in rapid succession, one with and one without the flash. The flashless shots were superior to the ones with the flash. (In fact, there seems to be hardly any circumstance that would require a flash with this camera, since most indoor pictures seem to be better using only natural light.) Also, although the baby's position and expression changed between the 2 shots each time, the pictures showed no sign of movement. I also took a short movie of the baby fussing and squirming in his little seat, which came out very well.So far, I have noticed only a few minor annoyances with the Finepix F30: The manual is not very user-friendly and contains no index. In fact, I have learned more about using the camera from reviews by people who know photography than from the manual alone. Additionally, the playback button is not a toggle. Instead, you have to press the shutter release button to switch back to picture-taking mode. It's very easy to press this button by mistake when passing the camera around to show off a shot, and then you have to hit the playback button again and find the picture you were on.

From \"semi-pro\" to the tiniest early Canons, my search for a digital camera that left me feeling good day-after-day, month-after-month has been frustrating.  The last digital I truly loved was years ago, the last fixed-focus 2 mp Nikon Coolpix 700.  My kids love how I tend to relinquish the season's Canon so calmly, the only good side of the endless search.  The last camera to frustrate me was the Panasonic DMC-LX1 with its amazing lens and inability to do much worthwhile above ISO 100.  I wanted a camera that would leave me happy with photos taken in situations other than well-lit meadows in the afternoon or coastal tidepools in clear, sharp light.  I decided to get the F30 after reading every single review in \"dpreview\" involving cameras that could be carried in a jeans pocket.  That is one of my benchmark needs.  I look at the clarity of sample photos in various review sites and test one against another with similar portions of same-setting images, and I decided the difference between the products of higher-end SLRs and pocket digicams was warranted only for maybe 10% of the photographic situations I was likely to want to shoot in, and I can live with the 90% for the benefit of having a camera in my pocket.  The F30 has a few issues, notably bright afternoon skylight contrasting with subjects, but its clarity is equal to anything else that size, and when you bump it up to higher ISO settings everything else falls away.  I shot a water polo game in the latter stages of dusk a few weeks ago at ISO 1600, obviously without the near-useless flash, and the results were really good.

There is not battery charger, so you have to plug the camera in itself.  There is no reason for xD cards to exist other than corporate competition at our cost.  There's no question that it's easier to manipulate a Canon or Nikon or Panasonic in menus, but that's not as important as that the images are good in a wider range of situations with the Fuji.  I couldn't get the shutter speed above 1000 in any manual setting while shooting into a sunset the other day, but when I went into Auto it went up to 1800 and 1900.

The F30 is about the same size as its predecessor but actually looks and feels smaller, thanks to its restyling.  However, I found the F10 much easier to hold and operate.In terms of ISO performance, the F30 is about the same ISO-for-ISO as the F10, but adds a ISO 3200 setting.  To be honest, pictures taken at ISO 3200 are barely usable beyond web or e-mail, i.e., an ISO 3200 won't make even a good 6\"x4\" print.  But it's there if you do need it, and I have used it on quite a number of low-light conditions.  In the end, I think it's a good thing to have, because memories, even captured with a lot of digital noise, can be too precious to not record.The F30 simplifies the user interface of the F10 but I find it harder to use than the F10.  If you are not an upgrader from the F10 like me, since shouldn't be a problem.  The buttons are smaller than on the F10 but still usable even by someone like myself with big hands.  One welcome improvement is the F30 now uses a standard mini-USB cable, as opposed to the special-connector dongle the F10 had.  You still need that Fuji cable, though, unless you use a separate USB reader and take out the xD card each time you download to PC (which is what I do).In regular ISO pictures, quality is very good but not yet top-notch.  In other words, you get good-quality, pleasing pictures but you should know that Canon cameras probably still give you slightly better pictures at the low ISOs.  But, alas, this is a totally subjective opinion, so don't take my words for it.  You should judge the picture quality yourself.  Even I'd have preferred Canon's image quality at ISO 100 and 200, I still value Fuji's low-ISO performance, enough to upgrade to the F30 instead of buying a Canon.The F30 is fast.  I think it's a hair faster (i.e., less shutter delay) than the F10.  The built-in LCD, also at 2.5\" diagonal, has twice as many pixels as the F10 but the post-shot preview can look coarse.  The camera is now made in China (as opposed to Japan for the F10) but is quite well constructed.One amazing thing about the F10 was its amazing battery life.  The F30 is even better!  I've taken over 600 high-resolution pictures with hours and hours of VGA video on my F30 in the 3 months I've had it, and the battery status indicator still has two out of three bars remaining!  This is just amazing!  I used to have a Casio that had long battery life, but the F10 and now F30 are just way better when it comes to battery life.So there were two reasons I chose the F10 and then upgraded to the F30, instead of getting a Canon or a Panasonic (which has great zoom and optical stabilization features).  One, the good low-ISO performance.  Two, Fujifilm supports the panda preservation program at the National Zoo in D.C., and I'm a big sucker for those black-and-white bears, so I support Fujifilm.  But when it comes to technical details, I'm totally unbiased, so you can trust my reviews.Feel free to contact me with questions.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Im Really Surprised..", "Author": "BurgerBoy", "ReviewID": "R3T5RLSX4MBR9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have to say that i am really surprised, really amazed about some reviewrs here comparing this camera to cameras that arent even close to its level, surprised that they have given this camera only 3 stars, youll dont have to take my word on it, just search the net enter some proffesional photography web sites and understand how advanced and smashing this camera is.i really cant compare it to any camera out in the market, not in any terms!! just few things to make youll understand what we are talking about:1) with its battery i was able to take almost 600 pics in one charge, no other product even comes close to these numbers.2) the picture quality is not somthing that can be compared to any camera in the market, especially in the night or in dark situations.3) lcd screen is better and brighter then any camera out there and it also has anti glare.4) it has some technological features that make other brands and models seem outdated, this is the main subject i would recomend youll to read about and check into.* i wouldnt recomend this camera to people that just want to look at the screen and shoot, this camera asks to be used manually or should i say use its manual options, if your looking for a camera where youve to just look at the screen and shoot, this isnt the one for you, look elsewhere, but if you want to use it a bit more seriously, it doesnt get better then this.", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT little camera!", "Author": "WV Radio Guy", "ReviewID": "R26J0L10MUXRTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After watching a professional photographer friend of mine use this camera, I too purchased one and I couldn't be happier.

This, more times than not, is a more pleasing effect.

The setting that allows two photos, one with flash and one without, makes getting great pictures much easier.Two suggestions:1. Keep your eyes open for memory card bargains.  We are always taking many more pictures/videos now and even 1 meg cards fill up rather quickly.  One card has been fine but our daughter will be traveling this summer and an extra card or two will come in handy.2. Invest in a screen protector.  We got one from ShieldZone.

I compared the same shot on F30 and my Nikon D50 SLR, also 6MP, at two ISO values, 1600 and 400.  In both cases the Nikon was smoother of course (the sensor is much bigger), but the little Fuji, no bigger than a deck of cards, was not so inferior as one would think, quite respectable comparison.The movie mode is excellent.  640X480 movies up to 15 min long with a 1GB card, enough for a weekend vacation if you make a series of short clips.But whereas Fuji is good on basic functionality, the little items of daily use are annoying and indicate a poor process of designing for the user interaction.  Item: the charger is set of box and cables bigger than the camera itself, hard to lug around.  (Canon gives you a small blue thing into which you plug the battery, much better but an extra cost item from Fuji.)  Item: requires an xD card, a hard to find proprietary format which is used only by Fuji and Olympus, and slow.  You can't reuse your SD cards, the small camera standard.  Very annoying.  Item: the USB cable has some kind of itsy bitsy proprietary connector on the camera end, marginally smaller than the standard USB cable which works with all your other cameras and videos.  Very VERY annoying, and pointless as far as making the camera smaller.Worst is the menu and control system, which is unnecessarily complex on all the Japanese cameras (it's cultural I think) but especially odd and opaque on Fujifilm.  The menu has one set of parameters and a separate little button labeled \"F\" (which I suppose means \"especially cool little variables we are proud of\") which controls some other stuff - the logic of which items go where escapes me.  To use manual aperture or shutter, there is a separate mode; why not just fold this into the manual settings?  There is a separate mode for \"anti-shake,\" which turns out to mean just selecting a higher shutter speed.  Unnecessary.  And, the whole Scene Mode thing; how many mom an pop users actually look for the little \"Fireworks\" icon when Fourth of July rolls around?  Useless clutter.  Finally, it took me a long time to figure out how to play movies back.  Bad design, and most of the choices will never ever be used.In summary, basic performance is good, even unique.

I was also considering the Canon SD700 IS which was more expensive but has an optical image stabilizer.  Our previous camera was an 2 MP Olympus.  That camera took OK photos, but was incredibly slow and had a horrible screen.  We also wanted something that could take good photographs in low light, such as restaraunts or a lit-up Christmas tree.After thoroughly reviewing both the Canon and this camera, I chose this one because, although both had good reviews for low-light performance, this camera was clearly the leader in low light.  And it hasn't dissapointed.  I showed it to my dad and my father-in-law, who are both avid photographers and they were both impressed with its capabilities.  It will pick up more light than you can see with the naked eye when you are there.  I agree with some other reviews here in automatic mode without a flash, the camera will set itself to a higher ISO setting than necessary.  This was probably done to reduce the number of blurry shots, but if you have a fairly steady hand, you can set the camera to manual mode and force the ISO down a notch or two in order to reduce the graininess of the higher ISO settings.  Having said that, the ISO settings on this camera display FAR less graininess than on other cameras for the same settings and they pick up far less light.It also takes very nice daytime shots as well, although you will see a little purple fringing if you crop and enlarge an area with adjoining elements in the photo that contrast highly with each other.  Still, this is not a huge problem for casual photographs.It also has very nice speed compared to our old Olympus.  That might not be saying much, but for our casual needs it is great.  It's ready to take pictures within a second or two of starting it up, and it has no appreciable shutter lag.  It will sometimes take a second or two to focus before you take a shot, but you can press the shutter halfway down to pre-focus on your subject so you can be ready to go when you press all the way down.Finally, some additional pluses are that it has an INCREDIBLE battery life, as advertised, and it has really good video taking capabilities.  I was a little reluctant to buy a camera without a viewfinder because you can really save battery life if you use it, but on this camera you don't have a choice and it still will last forever on a single charge.Overall, I would give the camera 4.5 stars if I could.

I bought a Fuji F10 for my daughter as a wedding present last year and enjoyed trying it out before I gave it to her.I was a little concerned that some reviewers of the F30 thought that the changes to the F10 weren't improvements, but I really like what they have done.  The improved manual controls and the extra pixels on the LCD are reason enough to get one.  The power button is recessed so it's more difficult to turn it on accidentally.  I use the aperture priority mode mostly so fixing the clipped highlights with exposure compensation is easy and the F30 keeps your settings when you power down.  The low light pictures indoors are great but the ISO 3200 ones have too much noise for me.  The battery life is great but it would be nice if they included a direct charger.

If you want a low noise, easy to use, pocketable camera with aperture and shutter priority controls THIS IS IT.  Even Fuji can't improve it much. The new F31 is not necessarily better.I don't give 5 stars because there is some purple fringing in high contrast images.  This camera is not perfect.  I would hope the lens could be improved - 4 times zoom? reduce the fringing?  I have had my camera for 6 months now.  This is the sixth digital I have purchased.  Would I buy it today?  Yes!  There is simply no competition from the likes of Canon or Nikon - and forget the megapixel rest!  And I think I would not even buy the Fuji F31.It doesn't come close to my Sony DSC-R1 but then again it doesn't weigh 1 kilogram!  Or cost a thousand bucks. I am still completely disenchanted with DSLR's.  The dust reduction systems don't work.

The lack of true wide is another reason why the 24mm wide on the Sony R1 is really valuable! And the Sony R1 doesn't know what purple fringing is.  It's Zeiss lens is just unbelievable!Nearly forgot the movie quality at 640x480 is excellent too. Pal analog TV quality (better than NTSC as used in the US)  - this is handy.  The Sony R1 has now video.And don't bother about the even newer F40 - it has no aperture or shutter priority settings - the only way I work. Also its more noisy than the F31 which is more noisy (in my opinion than the F30. Zoom range and lens are just the same as the F30/F31. I could go on but I'll stop here.

Usual modes I never use (flower, landscape, etc.), but one unique mode I use all the time: no flash/flash. The camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 ISO, and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. Usually takes less than one second to capture both images. No flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot, while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image, even if the \"warm glow of candlelight\" is ruined. I always have the camera set to this mode. Uses xD cards, which I hate, but if you buy a 1 GB card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. Also, battery life is unbelieveable! Fully charge the camera over several hours, and you'll be able to take 400 photos, half with flash, before the battery is drained.

I re-visited those places to have a second look then realized actual seen is not that colorful and photo is really the accurate representation of the seen. So why I thought them as dull. Surprise! Upon little investigation I realized my previous digital camera actually enhance the image to show little brighter and vibrant colors in the photo. I looked at other test shots I have taken with few other brands of cameras and they do the same to various degrees except Canon which has accurate color representation. So what to do? Do I want to capture my memories better than they actually look?  May be not! Hmm..... I feel funny when I think of those KODAK moments now :)12-7-2006I took this to my son's indoor basket ball game today. Well low light and fast moving game is little too much for this little camera. It pushes ISO to 3200 but that ISO is pretty much useless with lot of noise. ISO 1600 is usable and 800 is pretty good. Then I discovered something unexpected. Low light Video of this thing is pretty good. Much better than my camcorder. So when action get too fast I can switch to video and I don't need to lug my camcorder now. But you can't zoom while videoing not even digital zoom. Hmm... that's strange!12-06-2006I received F30 today. Took some pictures and videos of our church kid's club night. WOW! I have never seen night photos like that before. Flash-less photography opens up a great new world at night. All in full auto mode and did not even read the book yet. I have a feeling I am going to have fun with this camera for a long time to come.11-30-2006I had an old digital pocket camera with 1.3 MP till recently that take beautiful photos all the time. Then I thought it is time to go hi-tech and bought state of art pocket camera that cost 5 times as much. Wow pictures were so nice under good light conditions outdoors and indoors close ups with flash but all photos were blurry under anything less than perfect conditions. I exchange it to several other camers of different brands but results were same. Most people advised me that if I want good pictures under low light I have to buy digital SLR or be happy with what I got! But that is ridicules because lowlight pictures are not a luxury that I can do without but it is a must for most of us with kids! All of my kids birthdays, basket ball matches, slumber parties, martial art matches, skating parties, piano recitals, music concerts ext ext... are low light events and they definitely don't want a dad touting a big SLR hanging around. Optical stabilization is not a solution for me due to fast moving subjects in my photos. So why most big ticket manufacturers do not address this need? I did some research to see why and this is what I found out. I am not a photography expert so I would like to hear your ideas please.Old digital cameras had low pixel count like my Olympus D-100 1.3mega pixel. The CCD with low pixel count has a good light sensitivity because individual pixel is large so camera could take a photo using high shutter speed that eliminate blur. Then competition for high resolution started 2M 3M 4m ....7M now 12M ext. and they were trying to out do each other to sell the cameras. But CCD size remains the same or small in order to reduce the cost. CCD is the most expensive item in the camera and bigger CCDs need bigger lenses and better optics. So individual pixel become smaller and smaller and now they are so small they need lot of light to take a good picture. That can be only achieved by low shutter speeds hence anything moves or slightest hand shake cause blur. Most people try to solve problem by using flash all the time to increase the light levels but it is a sad solution to this problem. Solution is to produce better and more efficient CCD sensor that is more sensitive to light while producing low noise. Also more computing power and better noise reduction algorithms for speedy and quality noise reduction. While most big manufactures tiring to fool us by adding lots of bells and whistles to cover up the real problem Fuji has come up with very efficient but low cost CCD that can solve the problem. The Camera is FUJI F30. For the first time we the average customer can buy a camera that take sharp pictures indoors for as low as $200. I have decided to buy this camera this Christmas due to this reason. Also I feel I should reward Fuji for their effort to address the real problem. Any other suggestions welcome.My dream camera is the one with Fuji F30 advance CCD, Canon SD800 optics, Casio S600 size / MP4 video compression / dedicated video button and Sony T10 best-shot optical stabilization / silent zoom while recording videos. I tested all these cameras during my quest to find a practical camera.I hope now other manufactures will fallow the Fuji lead and design cameras like this and Fuji will add my wish list to this camera soon.", "Date": "November 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix F30", "Author": "Miss Pilk", "ReviewID": "R32XG1YI0T0RYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera.

Okay, but the thing is, it has a tough time doing anything on its own.  You have to constantly fiddle with it to get the best shot you can.

It takes decent shots either way, but once you see what it can do under optimal settings you want that same quality everywhere and it's not always possible.  Part of that has to do with a not so great metering system.  Multi-metering is not so multi as you'd like, so you're basically reduced to center weighted or spot, which is hugely limiting.  Also, it's a bit chunky (fat) compared to a lot of other cameras in this range.  I don't regret buying this camera, as it has helped capture some memories that I can't ever replace.

We wanted a camera that was small, fast, and not too much money (I have a Nikon D70 SLR that is my primary camera).  We also wanted a camera that did good video with sound (the old 885 was video only).Anyway, we are SUPER happy with the camera.  It's ability to shoot at 1600 ISO means you can get great low-light pictures (good for sleeping baby shots).  The Fuji has very low noise (compared to similar cameras) at the higher ISOs, which means you can get better 'candid' shots in low-light without the flash.  We take almost all of our pictures without flash.The video works great as well. (We've avoided getting a separate camcorder ... the video feature on the Fuji camera works good enoughfor us).One other thing we really like about this camera is how quick it turns on.  It can go from off to taking a picture very quick which is good for getting baby shots that you'd miss if you waited.All in all we really like it.  It doesn't have a lot of adjustment features (no histogram, etc.) but its works very well out of the box.In two months we've taken about >6 gig of pics/etc with this camera and I haven't used my Nikon D70 much at all... the Fuji is perfect for taking lots of pictures of our baby.

Mandell", "ReviewID": "RBLD3UHXS11P1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I narrowed my choice for a new camera to the Fuji F30 and the Canon S700. The draw of the F30 was its ability to shoot without a flash in very low light. My Canon digital SLR has this capability and it's great - I really dislike the artificial look of a flash blasted into my photographs.First a little background for those who might not know about film speed (others can skip to the next paragraph). The ability of a camera to capture an image in low light is measured by a scale carried over from film cameras. Each camera has a maximum ISO rating. A camera with a higher ISO rating can record pictures without a flash in lower light situations.Many consumer cameras on the market only go to ISO 200 before the flash has to kick in. Better ones go to 400. The Canon S700 (and a few others) goes to 800. But the Fuji F30 is unique; it's capable of going all the way to ISO 3200 without a flash. That's the equivalent of two more f-stops than the Canon and 3 more f-stops than a lot of other cameras before the flash has to kick in on the Fuji (though the flash is available if you want it at any time). If it works well, it's a technology breakthrough for such a low price.That's this camera's big selling point.But after shooting with it for several days, I'm very disappointed with the results, on this big \"selling point\" and a few other things as well.Here's why:1. The pictures taken at ISO 1600 and 3200 have too much digital noise in them to be usable without additional computer processing before printing. Noise is the digital equivalent of film grain, but it's multi-colored and it's really distracting. In fact, with the Fuji, you can actually see the noise in the viewfinder when you switch to the highest ISO settings!It can be cleaned up pretty well in photoshop with a noise reduction filter (an add on purchase, by the way). But this takes time, effort and some learning and I doubt most want to do this with a consumer snapshot camera.I was surprised by this poor performance and very disappointed.Other issues:2. The camera's has a setting on the control dial on top for \"Anti-Blur\" mode (symbol is a person with motion lines on either side), but, in fact, the camera doesn't offer any kind of image stabilization technology whatsoever. The only thing that happens when you turn the dial to this position is the program \"selects a fast shutter speed to freeze motion that reduces camera shake and moving subject blurring\" (quote from the user guide).This appears to be nothing more than re-labeling the \"sports\" setting on most any other camera and calling it \"anti-vibration\" or whatever.  I gather Fuji doesn't have the technology to be competitive with Canon (the S700 has true Image Stabilization) and this is just an attempt to mask that, but it's misleading to  characterize it as a separate \"mode\".3. This is the first camera I've purchased that doesn't come with a battery charger. You have to put the battery in the camera and plug the camera into the wall outlet. Among other inconveniences, it means you can't just buy an extra battery and charge it separately. You can pay for a charger as a separate purchase, of course, but it ought to come with the camera.4. Finally, the camera itself is a little chunky. After playing with the Canons, Sonys, etc. at Best Buy, the Fuji is out of step in being a bit thick and heavy. Not a lot; just maybe one generation back. I'd like something I can tuck in the front pocket of my jeans and not look like something's really jammed in there.I suppose I should mention that other than these four problems, the picutures I took with the F30 are fine, lovely, etc, but frankly, that's true of most cameras these days.So, I'm sending it back and getting the Canon.I realize this review has been long, but since it's the first one for this camera, I thought it might be useful to share this information.", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Photo Qualty out of a Pocket-Sized Camera", "Author": "Alberto Uribe \"Crazy Al\"", "ReviewID": "R3MM51R82PMFNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this little baby for about a Year now and it doesn't dissapoint.

Porter", "ReviewID": "R15DNL4HGJZNEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my FinePix F30.  I know what a great camera it is because I have compared its performance against two of its most highly rated competitors.I took a set of pictures and several videos on both a Canon PowerShot SD600 and SD700 in a Best Buy, recording them on an SD memory card.  Once I later purchased the F30 I took it to the same Best Buy and shot a set of similar pictures and videos.  Then I compared the Canon pictures and videos with those from my F30 on my 1289 x 1024 computer screen.  All the cameras took great quality stills when there was no handshake blur.  But I got less hand-shake blur from the F30 than either of the two Canons.  (I assume this is because the F30's lower light requirements allow fasters shutters speeds.)  I got these better results without using the F30's anti-shake mode, which I did not find very useful the few times I tried it.  On average, the F30's pictures had a lot less handshake blur than the SD600's, and a little less than those of the SD700 (which has image stabilization).  The low light performance was better with the F30 than with the Canons, but the F30's low light performance was not as exceptional as I had been led to believe by some reviews.THE FIELD IN WHICH THE F30 ABSOLUTELY BLEW THE CANONS OUT OF THE WATER WAS IN VIDEO RECORDING.  The video from the F30 is only slightly worse than that from my digital video camera.  That from both Canon's was much worse.  (In fact, it was the poor quality of both Canon's video that caused me not to buy one of them.)  When most people first see video from my F30 they express surprise that it is so good.  In fact, it is so good that the only reason one would ever normally want to lug around a digital video camera instead of the F30 is because the F30 does not let you zoom while recording (and it has a much more limited range of zoom).  The lack of zoom means I often find myself sticking the camera within several feet of people's faces to get a good head shot, which can cause annoyance.  The F30's video works well in all but very poorly lit indoor night scenes.  Its audio is also much better than that of the two Canons.  The F30 has no rubber foam to protect it against wind noise, but absent wind the F30's sound is surprisingly good (although not as good as my digital video camera's).  Not only is the F30's video and sound quality much better than that of the two Canons, but it also stores roughly twice as much high quality video per unit of space in a memory card, which is very important.My one main complaint with the F30 is that its pictures aren't as likely to make sunny skies have that wonderful bright blue that I normally got with my former 4 mega pixel Canon PowerShot A??? (I forget the number, I gave the camera away.)  The FinePix's sunny skies tend to be more dark, but they are usually still great pictures.  I also wish the F30 used SD memory cards instead of the more expensive and lower capacity XD memory cards.But, overall, after 4 months of ownership, I would highly recommend the F30.", "Date": "October 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT overall", "Author": "Pinky Patel \"pink7\"", "ReviewID": "R281W1VTM1K93S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera is extremely fast, sharp and perfect for videos.  it's better than i thought it would be.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Casual photographer but this camera seems excellent", "Author": "Oscar", "ReviewID": "R20VZ6A2TKYFTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for about a month.

Daytime fotos are great. Underwater is crappy, then again , I dont have a strobe yet, so we will wait and see. The camera reviews say its noisy.. I dint really know what that meant until i started using the movie feature. Click , clack, clunk.. Is all i hear when i use the movie mode, as the lens is adjusting , yet it has to stay at a fixed zoom ? this doesnt make sense to me, why do i have to have a fixed zoom if the camera iris is constanly adjusting>Overall, if I had to do it again, id get something better. For those that dont care about low light quality wash out, and crappy auto focus, go ahead and buy it.", "Date": "September 10, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Digital camera features full resolution ISO equivalency speeds as high as 3200 for great low-light and motion shots\nFeatures a 3.0x optical zoom Fujinon lens; combined with 6.2x digital zoom, camera offers 18.6x total zoom\nLarge, 2.5-inch LCD monitor features Auto Brightness and an anti-glare, low-reflection CV (Clear View) film\nPicture Stabilization mode and Real Photo Technology combine to produce less noisy and less grainy photos in dim light\ni-Flash system accurately detects subtle light differences within a scene", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix F30 6.3 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NQ5rpMnfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000EJVWGS"}}
