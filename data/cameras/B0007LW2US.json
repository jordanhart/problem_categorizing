Bought it with a 512MB SD-card, which can handle about 250 pictures (highest quality). I never use the automatic setting, defining the shutter-speed and the diaphragm by yourself is much more fun. The possibilities with this camera are enormous. Great zoom range, also with the digital zoom disabled. The Macro-function is also a great feature. Considering the 5.0 MP, the 8x optical zoom and it's price (239 pounds), this is one of the best camera's in it's class!!", "Date": "April 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "User Friendly camera", "Author": "C.

Hill", "ReviewID": "R2VZ48PGC5444I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this refubished from a dealer here and I feel like I took advantage of Amazon.  This is a great camera with amazing control and it is easy to use.  I would not recommend it to a novice photographer but if you love to plow through menus to get the results you want this is the camera for you.  It also starts up very quickly and sips battery power.  I took at least 300-400 photos on my first set of batteries.  Buy it and love it.", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love the Konica Minolta Dimage Z20!!", "Author": "Iamgreavesy \"Keep It Simple Stupid\"", "ReviewID": "R1X59R81HDCWGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had the Dimage Z10 3MP and loved it.  We were in Hawaii on the black sand beach where we dropped it and broke the battery lid latch.  Otherwise we would still be using it.  We liked it so much that we went out of our way to find this very hard to find Z20.  Is it the best camera out there?  No.  There are better with more options.  However, for simplicity and quality, with good features, this is the best for us.  The other reason to buy this camera is the price.  Under $200.  Great buy!", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not so great.", "Author": "Denise Steendahl \"SeattleChic\"", "ReviewID": "RYWYGOH5L7H0R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it was a good price for a 5 megapixel digital camera plus Konica Minolta is a good name in cameras.  The viewing screen is small but worst of all its got a lot of noise in it; it's virtually impossible to see if your shot is clean and in focus.  The camera doesn't have an image stabilizer so the slightest movement and you've got a blurry shot.  It's bulky and odd looking and doesn't travel well.It's one year later and I'm going to buy a Sony DSCW50 because it's smaller, lighter, thinner, has an image stabilizer, is user friendly and with a longer battery life.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Konica Minolta Dimage z20 camera", "Author": "Betsy", "ReviewID": "RTDURXOIHZOL6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was a good camera and took great pictures, but the connection  where you hooked up to the computer wascorroded and it quit working.

Having this camera years ago actually inspired me to be a photographer. Now I shoot weddings and sell fine art prints! (I do have a new Sony DSLR now)It has functions that are just like a DSLR. It looks pretty cool too!

We lived two years in England and traveled all over Europe with this camera. I dropped it once and broke the viewfinder, however, the camera kept working, very sturdy. It takes the most clear pictures you can imagine. I took the most beautiful picture of Leeds Castle in England where the castle was reflected on the water. It looked like a mirror image of the castle. (picture added to the image gallery above) It was outstanding! The camera is a bit bulky, however, I carry a waterproof shoulder bag big enough to put it inside along with all my belongings. After 8 years it finally gave out. When I zoom, the pictures come out black. Time to replace it, however, I will be buying it again. I am so glad they still make them.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dimage Z20 by Konica-Minolta", "Author": "Merrily Weidner \"\"Trusting in God\"\"", "ReviewID": "R25IW07X6VXSUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product no longer made, but it is still my favorite!  Dropped/ruined my old Z20 so went hunting for another -- thought a Z3 was a newer model so got it -- YUK -- and very willingly spent more money getting what I wanted.  Now I have my favorite camera back in my hands and I'm a happy camper.  Works with Window 7.  It's bulky yes, but sure takes great pictures -- even ones I take while watching a TV broadcast football game:  Go Boise State Broncos!!!", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Brandi Mullins \"I Am Brandi\"", "ReviewID": "R3T50L1QQH2B1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera as a replacement for my Z-10. (It got busted. Still works though.) I Love the Konica Minolta Dimage Viewer Z series cameras! They are easy to use, and comfortable to carry. They take wonderful photos and the zoom is great! I have only 1 small complaint. The video setting has no sound. Still overall a GREAT CAMERA!!

While picking up pictures at my local Sam Walton's, I found this one reduced to 199.00 and bought it.  It takes incredible pictures and it's very comfortable to use, even those \"can you take one of us\" to a stranger comes out great. The flash is simple and you can zoom and snap with one hand at the same time.  There are two drawbacks in my opinion, the lens cap is not attached and it seems to eat batteries.  I quickly switched to rechargeables and have since found that by not using the LCD display all the time and switching to rechargeables eliminates that aspect of it.  It's not a mini, you definitely know that it's dangling from your neck but none of these would keep me from making this purchase again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good quality camera.", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Poor quality photos indoors", "Author": "CAT", "ReviewID": "R3JRO83BTSORKI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for a year now and I am not able to get good quality photos indoors.
