{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Top of a Star-Studded field!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2S04VNTC5AQSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great time to be buying a 10 megapixel SLR, as all the top manufacturer's have new, 5-star models.  So let's examine: What do we want most?  Great photos, a well made camera, and features that will let us achieve our photographic goals.  The K10D delivers.All the top contenders will deliver excellent results that can be made into poster size prints with great color and detail.  Although we can point so some shortcomings (like the poor performance of the Sony Alpha 100 at ISO 1600), image quality is something that is still in the eye of the beholder.However, features are features, and the K10D has loads.  The first thing you'll notice is the solid feel in your hands.  It feels robust, and the shutter has been tested to 100,000 shots (same as Canon's bigger brother 30D).  But to this, we add something else not found in any other camera in the class: weather-proofing.  The body contains 72 seals to help keep dust, dirt and moisture on the outside (the optional grip has 38 seals).When you put on the optional grip, it really does feel like a part of the camera, not a wiggly thing that might come off.To get those great photos, the K10D has all the standard feature set, plus a few new ones (like \"sensitivity\" mode), which will come in hand for some people, but of more partical use to many will be the ability to define what \"Auto ISO\" range the camera can use.  Want the camera to be able to use 1600?  Done.  Pentax's metering systems have always been well thought of, but you'll get center-weighted and spot metering as options, too.  Their \"digital preview\" can be very handy in setting up the proper white balance.The viewfinder is the largest in it's class (although the D80 is the smallest fraction behind).  When viewing through it, you'll see the 11-point autofocus.  What you don't see is that the nine central segments are \"cross basis\" points, meaning they focus on both vertical and horizontal lines.  The other competitors simply have one, the center segment, that is cross-basis.  This may not help it focus faster, but it should improve accuracy.  Additionally, the focusing mode is easy to change.  A switch up front allows you to select manual, single or continuous autofocusing, while a dial on back allows you to change from spot focus (only the center zone), wide (allows the camera to select) or free-floating (you select any of the eleven zones, and can change it quickly with the key-pad on the back of the camera).The choice of the SD/SDHC cards is great.  This small cards avoid the dreaded \"bent pin\" issue of the compact flash cards, and the SD are compatible with a hugh number of compact cameras as well.  Another nice touch is the optional remote control.  It can trigger the camera from the front AND from BEHIND the camera, and can store inside the optional grip.  I also love the fact they included the .dng standard for RAW images, as this is an open standard developed by Adobe.And there is one feature that Pentax now leads: Shake Reduction (or VR, or IS, or SteadyShot).  First, like the Sony, the SR is built into the camera.  So for a modest cost up front, ALL your lenses get some stabalization...even older manual focus lenses!  And as a side benefit, you get a slight benefit in keeping the sensor clean.  But what most people don't understand about Pentax SR system is that it is a THREE AXIS anti-shake system, something that no other maker offers.  In-lens, or the Sony rail system, compensate for you shaking left/right & up/done.  By combine these two, it compensates for diagonally, too.  What they do not compentate is for \"rotational\" shake.  Imagine a line running through the camera lens to the subject, rotating the camera around this axis.  The Pentax SR system uses magnets and bearings to allow the sensor to free float compared to the body.  Tremendous technology.Pentax has been a bit light on their lens selection, but keep in mind that this uses every Pentax 35mm lens ever made, and 3 exciting new lenses that they recently announced (16-50 f2.8; 50-135 f2.8; and 60-250 f4.0, all weather sealed with ultrasonic motors) make them very competitive.  For a first lens, the 18-55 is hard to beat.  It's well made, featuring a metal lens mount, and the internal focusing allows for easier use of filters and a more efficient, included, lens hood.Buy the Canon XTi, Nikon D80 or Sony Alpha 100, and you'll get a terrific camera.  But for my money (yes, I did buy one), the Pentax K10D is the best.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "very good camera !", "Author": "J. Skilton", "ReviewID": "R8P9E84GGBZVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A million words have been written about this thing, and this is not an attempt at a comprehensive review, so look above or on dpreview-com for complete info.I looked at Canon, Nikon, Pentax and Sony DSLRs.  The Sony makes sense if you already have a bag full of Minolta lenses, which I don't.  Canon and Nikon put their image stabilization in the lens, which makes their 'good' lenses significantly more expensive.  Canon EOS is not backward-compatible with their old FD lenses, of which I -do- have a bagful.  Pentax is backward-compatible with all K-mount lenses made since the 1970s, and will even take 645 and 6x7 lenses, with adapters.Sooo,  I set out to ease into DSLR ownership with a K100D, then started reading the reviews, and it was a bunch of little things that made me want the K10D.  The viewfinder has an actual prism, not a mirror cage like cheaper cameras, the displays are backlit, and the low-res mode (1800 x 1200px) is exactly what I want for certain applications.  With 10 Mpx, I can point & shoot if I have to, and crop (somewhat) more later.  And the controls are more 'classic' camera-like than the 'scene modes' on beginner cameras.  Not to say this would be worth the price difference to everyone, but I bought the K10D, and the Pentax 12-24mm / 4.0 lens,  and am very happy with both.Digital cameras use less of the image projected by the lens, so your lenses are 'longer' than they would be on a film camera.  Downside: for a 'journalist lens', had to buy the 12-24mm, which is equivalent of 18-36mm on a film camera.  Upside:  my old 50mm / 1.4 is now equivalent of that top-of-the-line portrait lens I never felt I could afford.  Pentax plans to introduce in 2007 a 16-50mm / 2.8  and a 50-135mm / 2.8, which sound fantastic - but let's see what they cost before we get too excited.  Meanwhile, Sigma, Tokina, and Tamron offer some very adequate alternatives.Camera and lens together are pretty heavy, just like an older SLR, and the LED screen cannot be used as a live viewfinder - no image gets to the sensor while the mirror is down - so you have to hoist the camera to your eye to compose a shot.  No problem, I'm used to it, and it's common to all DSLRs.((My personal feeling is that the SLR platform is just about done.  It's hard to see the need for the mirror box in a digital camera, which can use the actual sensor to compose the shot through the lens and display it on the back. Future top-end digital cams will probably be a lot flatter, like the old rangefinder cameras.  Look at the Olympus E330 or Panasonic DMC-L1 to see what direction I think we should be headed.))Having said, I am very happy with the Pentax K10D, it behaves as it's supposed to, and an affordable (barely) 12-24mm rectilinear lens was unthinkable just a few years ago.  This camera has a ton and a half of features and capabilities, and I am still sorting them out.  There is definitely a learning curve if you are to get the most out of the camera, but there are also two full program modes, including 'green zone', so you can start shooting right away with good results.  Pictuers come out great.  Colors, brightness, and contrast need almost no adjustment or photoshop-ing, which has not been true of any other digi-cam I have ever owned.  Happy with this, until the next big thing comes along.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Innovative features rocket K10D to front ranks in prosumer DSLR race", "Author": "Rudy \"pain-doc\"", "ReviewID": "R1V72CEMLATPO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The marriage of Pentax camera expertise, and Samsung's bottomless R&D; war chest (\"SamTax\"), has spawned the great-leap-forward K10D DSLR that promises well-earned laudits for a camera maker inexorably squeezed by wealthier competitors.  Pentax' first entry into the DSLR world (the oddly-named *istD), although a fine performer, failed to compete pricewise with comparable Canon or Nikon entries. The smaller and better market-positioned 6MP *istD-S (which I own) arrived too late to give the hugely successful Canon Rebel a serious run for its money; and Pentax eventually retrenched with cheaper penta-mirror products just to keep a foot in the US market (ironically, the digital Rebel series had cut costs from the start with a seldom-mentioned penta-mirror).The tradeoff for any low cost DSLR, as against the costlier pro models, was the substitution of menu-driven operations for the latter's simpler and faster buttons and dials -- a maddeningly tedious and unintuitive cost-cutter, made all the more frustrating in bright light on small LCD displays.  Even selecting the focus point (grid, spot or select) meant a trip through pages of menus, not aided at all by the infamous penchant for inscrutable abbreviations. In effect, the time lost in flipping the camera to scroll through on-screen menus all too often meant either photo opportunities lost, or just reverting to a digicam's one focus mode fits all. Moreover, adequate as 6MP might be for most, the megapixel race to 8 (then 10) MP sensors left Pentax bringing up the rear of the pack.But no more! The K10D is an altogether different beast, a handsome sturdy 10MP workhorse, with enough racing blood to lead the current (Dec 2006) DSLR pack.  I shan't repeat here the praise for its fine quality pictures, but instead focus on the more arcane issues that affect purchasing choice between 2 or 3 finalists such as sensor dust removal, image stabilization, solid glass pentaprism, and retrograde lens and accessory compatibility. The exposure mode dial now is all professional, with just a single intelligent automatic setting - gone are the smiley face and jogger icons - while adding a novel mode selection for ISO-sensitivity priority.Pentax has tackled the bugaboo of dust attracted by the electrostatically charged CCD sensor -- a gotcha when changing DSLR lenses -- on 3 fronts: a new dust-repellant sensor coating; sensor vibration at startup (employing the sensor stabilization mechanism) to shake off dust; and -- a laudable first in the prosumer field -- a fully dust and splash sealed body that lets you take `clean' pictures in the desert as readily as in the rain forest [just don't change lenses in the open!].Image Stabilization (IS) counteracts the problem of muscle tremors and pulsatile blood flow that destabilize the hand-held platform, by moving either a lens element or the camera sensor mount in the opposite direction -- allowing longer exposures (extra `stops') without incurring motion blur -- an impressive advantage when shooting fast action or in low light. There are two approaches to IS: In-the-lens IS (as used by Nikon and Canon) builds a gyroscopic element into the lens assembly, offering speed and specificity, but adding front-end weight, expense and complexity; the pro is that in-lens stabilization is fast and can be transferred to same-make camera bodies (with matching power contacts), the con is that you pay dearly for the IS mechanism each time you purchase a new lens. In-camera IS (as used in the K10D and Sony alpha), conversely, moves the sensor so as to counteract platform instability -- once you purchase the camera body, you'll always have IS, whatever lens is mounted. This makes for full backward compatibility so that you can attain IS with your older lenses. The con is that the sensor's counter-movement must be matched to the lens characteristics, thus is slightly slower than the in-lens system. The in-camera sensor-moving mechanism, moreover, performs double duty as a sensor-shaking dust removal feature. The K10D further refines IS by floating the sensor electromagnetically, adding rotational to linear stabilization. Oversimplifying: if you need to shoot sports, races, or wildlife for a living, go for the Canon/Nikon in-the-lens stabilization; if your requirements are less extreme, stick to in-camera stabilization for a wider choice of less-expensive lenses to expand your system.On paper at least, the K10D's 22-bit A/D converter sounds attractive, but realize that even RAW images still remain at 12-bit depth; the claim of enhanced color rendition remains to be proven by benchmark testing. Contacts are in place to accommodate forthcoming lenses with hypersonic focusing motors, speeding autofocusing towards the Canon/Nikon range. Indeed, other than for slightly slower auto-focusing, PopPhoto benchmarking rates the K10D's resolution and image quality as Excellent, and noise from Very Low to Low at ISO 800-1600.In sum: The Pentax K10D (and its GX-10 Samsung sibling) emerges as a company breakthrough, in that it offers outstanding image quality, very low digital noise, and image stabilization inside a dust & splash sealed body -- all that with some of the highest-rating metal-mount kit lenses around. The well illustrated manual too has benefited from the new regime. Unless you require ultra-fast auto-focus in low light, the slightly slower autofocusing should not deter you; better yet, new USM lenses are on the way. In-camera IS makes the K10D a windfall for Pentax lens owners; its innovative features are a challenge to the \"big guys\".ADDENDUM: I stick by my original review of \"Great Leap Forward\", except (as I learned) for quality control over suppliers. About 2 1/2 years, and several thousand clicks later the K10D, in the midst of a shoot suddenly showed straight horizontal lines that - on 1:1 inspection - proved to be very dead pixels. Out of warranty, service diagnosed malfunctioning logic board; total cost for labor and parts etc came close to three C-notes. Offered to pay for labor, but felt defective electronics ought to be Pentax' responsibility. Rather than fooling around got a K20D instead.", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "I just can't put it down", "Author": "Gerald Schneir \"Jerry SCHNEIR\"", "ReviewID": "R2KUTYNEF779W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd dSLR and will probably be my last.  I can't see where it can be improved.  I know, all cameras have flaws and can be improved, but this one is so near perfect it is hard to believe.From the moment I handled it and played with the focus i was hooked.  It locked on focus fast, very fast even in very dim light.  You always (well almost always) knew exactly what was going on and how well the shot would be. Playback of just shot images is good, expecially with the ability to blow it up to 20x to check focus.So lets look at a few of the cameras important features.1. It has 11 point focusing, 9 of which are cross which means it easily grabs focus on difficult objects.  And the viewfinder shows you what part of the scene is the focus point.  With two adjustment wheels you can easily switch settings.2. shot to shot time is fast and in JPEG you can shoot until you are out of memory without slowing up.3. switch to RAW and back to JPEG without moving your eye from the viewfinder.  And you can control how the button responds, i.e., just one shot or all the rest until you turn it off.4. weatherproofing so that you can keep shooting even when it gets misty5. solidy built, plastic over a stainless steel case.  It will survive most hard knocks.6. In camera shake reduction which means that any lens becomes image stabilized when mounted on the camera7. the ability to set shutter and aperture and have the ISO automatically adjust for the shot8. easily moves from a beginners camera (when in the \"green\" mode) to a pro camera with almost all the features a pro needs.9. four channel histogram to better evaluate your shots10. long battery life. 300+ on a charge.11. very wide selection of lenses going back to the 1970s that are usable and are image stabilized when used on the camera.12. wireless remote both front and back.There are a lot more very nice features and a few that are not, but nothing that makes my question my purchase even the slightest.  As is so typical, the manual is not the easiest to navigate.  Even after a month there are some features I still haven't gotten comfortible with but am getting there.  I like the backlight for the top LCD and would like the numbers in the viewfinder to be a little bigger or brighter or both.SummaryDuring the 2 + years i have been teaching a digital photography course (Intro to Digital Photography at Emeritus college in Santa Monica, CA) I have owned 3 dSLR and at least 12 other digital cameras.

The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was \"soft\" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.

I fitted the lenses with the standard UV filters and the camera with the Pentax BG2 Battery Grip (more about this later...)I previously owned a Canon EOS-10D 6.3MP Digital SLR with a Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens & a Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens with the usual filters and accoutrements - I owned the whole kit since 2003 and used it extensively through Mexico, the States, Europe & Africa - all in all an excellent camera and lenses.After recently becoming \"savvy\" on the new technology available - I decided to \"upgrade\" myself to bigger resolutions and newer \"pluses\" - I did extensive research and finally decide on three candidates:1- Leica DIGILUX 3  7.5MP Digital SLR Camera (with Leica D 14-50mm f/2.8-3.5 ASPH Lens) with Optical Image Stabilization.2 - Sigma SD14 14MP Digital SLR.3 - Pentax K10D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (with Shake Reduction.)After extensive research and reading many reviews regarding these three cameras - I came to the conclusion that the Pentax was going to be the better choice for the money over the amount of features, reliability and brand performance - in other words I definitely think that I'm getting more \"bang-for-my-buck\" over my other two choices.  The reasons I did not choose the other two were:Leica - of course is legendary and their lenses are superb - unfortunately this camera was compared too often to the Panasonic DMC-L1 - actually it was a joint venture between the two companies - that kind of \"cheapened\" the Leica on my view - no offence to Panasonic Lumix owners - is not just what I was looking for / \"not my cup of tea.\" Also, the technology / features that the kit contained were too little for the price.  My other choice in Leica was the M8 - just a dream of a camera, but way out of my regular \"Joe Blow\" budget! - This is the camera I would have if price was no object - but reality strikes you hard!Sigma SD14 - I am still very intrigued by this camera and the technology it uses - maybe when it is a bit more proven and upgraded in a few features I will do the \"jump\" into the Sigma realm - the experts keep calling it the \"wildcard.\"As for the brand I used - Canon - nothing wrong with it - it is just that the competition -  Pentax and Sigma are offering a better rounded package than what they are offering at the moment - I was interested on the Canon EOS 5D - which I could've used my old lenses - but for the price and the offerings, others give more.So... I finally decided to \"shoot out of the box...\" and leave the market dominated by Canon and Nikon and try a different flavor this time around.Conclusion:  I am extremely pleased with my choice of the Pentax K10D over the other venerable brands (especially Leica!) - the camera does have some issues: speed of auto focus (not consistent, but adequate) - speed of continuous shooting (again not consistent, but adequate) - the battery grip is useful as it can automatically switch to a 2nd battery - very handy - I just wish that they would've applied the same concept to the SD card compartment - it is just for storage - it does not switch for photo recording purposes - I just find it a bit silly to stop and remove the card from the compartment, do the \"switcharoo\" with the used card and replace the compartment back on the grip - I know... moans-and-complaints!Overall compared to my previous equipment - this is by far the best camera that I've owned.I've used: Minolta (film) - Olympus (film) - Leica (film) - Sony Mavica (digital) - Canon (digital.)I've already tried it using both lenses in a variety of sceneries - high daylight, dawn, lots of shadows, nature, etc - and I am nothing but extremely pleased with the results!", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Pentax for Professionals", "Author": "Brian H. Williams", "ReviewID": "R1QJDVXSLUJZBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera immediately after release. I've been shooting with Pentax cameras since the early 1990's. Admitedly, I was slow to switching to digital, primarily because Pentax took longer than most to come up with a digital SLR. I wanted to hold out because of the amount of money I had invested in the lenses, flash equipment and other accessories. So when they finally came out with one, the *IST D, I bought it. At the time, it was fine for what I needed. But as time moved on I needed a camera that had more professional features. I had to wait again. So long, that I almost sold my entire Pentax gear and was going to move to Sony. Then right before I was ready to sell, they came out with the K10D. And I can confidently say that it was worth the wait. For us professionals who don't shoot Nikon or Canon, we needed a 10 mega pix or higher camera, with faster continuous shutter, anti dust, blur reduction, a more rugged body and of course, one with a great processor. Thankfully Pentax delivered just that. For my type of shooting (swimsuit models and glamour photos) I find that coupled with the battery grip, a large memory card, and the FTZ 540 flash, I find myself completely satisfied with what the camera gives me. The shake reduction is a great feature to have and find myself using my tripod less and less. The focusing is quick and reliable, even in low light (with a high speed lens). Even though the standard flash synchronization speed is 1/180, this camera does have high speed synch with the appropriate flash. The camera does take better photos in the RAW feature. Not as sharp with JPEG, but this is under CRITICAL tests. For what virtually everyone will be shooting, the high quality JPEG, coupled with a great lens, like the DA*50-135mm F2.8, or the film FA*28-70mm lens, the results are spectacular. I find that I like my settings on \"Bright\" image tone and contrast on 3. It really makes the colors pop. The factory settings tend to be a little soft on the contrast and I prefer hard contrast. While shooting a bikini contest in Spain, I had to shoot in some rain. The rain didn't even bother the weatherproof body. This combined with the weatherproof lenses are pefect for humid counties such as Mexico and the occasional rain you may encounter. The battery lasts for a long time on one charge, but it's best to have the battery grip just to play it safe. The light meter is highly accurate and the custom user features are great. I find myself shooting in manual mode all the time, but knowing that a simple touch of the green button gives you instantly perfectly exposed shots is a nice. It saves me from hunting for the perfect exposure. The biggest advantage is that the Shake Reduction technology is sensor based, not lens. So you can mount any lens you want on the body and the shake reduction will function. This is not the case with Canon or Nikon. So Pentax has the edge on that one. Occasionally, when I've enlarged my images to 200x the normal size, I have found the occasional hot pixel, or dead pixel. It will be a green or red color. Since then, my camera has been serviced by Pentax (a cleaning that I needed after the swimsuit event. All that sand and dust does a number on your gear!) and they have since run a program on the camera that has eliminated this problem. If you are undecided on what brand to go with, I can only tell you to go with a brand you trust and one that you have had a good experience with. If you want the most bang for your buck, the Pentax K10D will deliver what you need and more. It is the most fully featured SLR for under $1,000. You will not get a better deal anywhere. However, if you are a sports photographer, the continuous shutter speed is slower than the Nikon and Canon. It's fast for my needs (3fps) but if you shoot a lot of fast moving subjects, this camera will not be the best choice. But if you want quality, reliability and a wide lens selection, the K10D is just what you need. The camera truly is a tool for photographic artists. In the wide array of choices for an SLR camera, every brand is great. But I can some it up in saying that if you want a tool to bring out the best in your artistic expression, Pentax is the brand to choose. Nikon is for the photojournalist, Canon is for sports photographers, but Pentax is for artists.", "Date": "November 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pentax rewrote their playbook and delivered", "Author": "C.

I shoot alot of manual focus macro and recently was late day on the backside of Mt Hood and could shoot snow crystals hand held at 1/25th of a second without a tripod.  Could never do that with any other camera.  They claim 3 frames a second, but I clocked mine at 4 frames per which is plenty fast.  One other item is the extended autobracketing to a total of 5 frames.  Though I need to work with this more, I am very impressed with the ability to also bracket on white balance.

I've actually been looking for an DSLR for a long time and checked out the D80, A100, and XTi, but in every model it seemed as though something was missing.  The D80 took great pictures, but was more expensive than it's competition, lacked shake protection, and it didn't have any dust removal features.  The A100 sounded great since it had everything I wanted, but it ended up taking not so great pictures and it really felt cheap in my hands.  The XTi was close, but no shake reduction and it was really too small for me (very uncomfortable).I really waited a long time to get the K10D and almost bought the D80, but I'm glad I waited.  The K10D is perfect for me since I don't have lots of money to spend on lenses with VR or IS.  Also, although Pentax does not have as many lenses as Nikon or Canon, the Pentax lenses are cheaper for their optical quality.  I personally bought the 18-55 kit lens and the 50-200 lens and both feel really solid, have metal lens mounts, and are optically pretty good compared to the competition.Another thing that was really important to me was the weather seals on the  K10D.  Although I wont use them that often (to my knowledge Pentax hasn't released any sealed lenses yet), but I'm glad I have it now.  I remember last time I was in Hawaii it was raining during a trip through the rainforest and I was unable to use my camera since I was afraid it might get ruined.  With the K10D I hopefully wont miss anymore pictures in the rain and I read that even unsealed lenses are very hard to ruin with water.  It's a shame I didn't have weather seals before since I most likely wont go to the Hawaiian rainforest again.I have had some problems with the K10D though.  The noise is pretty bad at high iso (800-1600), but less than pictures I've seen taken with the A100.  The 18-55 lens has some vignetting at 18mm and also the aperture is not constant it's 3.5-5.6 on the 18-55 and 4-5.6 on the 50-200.  The lens cap is sort of tricky to take off with the hood on.  My K10D also front focuses sometimes (rarely) which can be annoying, but I read that this happens with most other DSLRs, and it also has some problems focusing in low light.  I really haven't used it enough to see if the dust system really works, but so far I've had zero problems with dust.Overall I'm extremely happy with the K10D and I can't imagine using a different camera.  It feels extremely solid and if I dropped it I doubt it would break.  The TAv mode is priceless and I'm set to that 90% of the time.  I can't believe no other companies have that feature.  Anyway, I can't give the camera 5 stars since it does have some flaws and I will no doubt find more after using it longer since I've only had mine for about a week (I've taken about 500 pictures).", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great price for a great dSLR with lots of features", "Author": "Doug Milligan", "ReviewID": "RD0W1KBIXPWYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent weeks doing research into what \"prosumer\" dSLR I was going to purchase this year, and this one definately came out on top.

So I only need a decent but inexpensive camera with a handful choice of lenses. I bought K10D mainly for (1) shake reduction (2) dust removal (3) RAW button (4) 10MB CCD. Of course, there are plenty other features to expect. At this pice level, I think K10D beats Cannon and Nikon and any others.

For a working photographer, that means a lot!Over all, for image quality and features, you can't match it until you get up to the hyper-expensive Canon 5D, at which point you're better off going medium format digital.

Functions are clearly laid out and while the K10D does not have any 'beginner' options other than the green mode (focusing more on advanced options - TAv mode is just what the doctor ordered which should on every dSLR, the RAW button is very convenient), menus are very logical, buttons are well positioned and proof being in the pudding, I could get going without much reading of the documentation.The picture quality is on par with the build. While there have been reports of JPEG processor issues, this is a bit unfair as those can be addressed in 3 clicks - for my taste, set the sharpness to +2 and contrast a tad higher, and I would challenge anyone to distinguish any (useful) difference with the RAW output. And otherwise the RAW output is simply outstanding for a camera of this class.Shake Reduction and Dust Removal (already put to use succesfully) are pretty handy. The lens kit is good and better than most of the competition. Since I was in a spending mood, I also added the 50mm f/1.4 (FA mount) which is an outstanding value, the best price/quality ratio I know of. Do yourself a favor, don't think twice and grab it, you won't regret it, it is a stunning mix with the K10D.I could go on with the K10D qualities so let's jump to only drawback IMHO: it does an average job with AWB indoors e.g. compared with my experience with the 30D. Luckily, there are several semi-auto ones which work very well, 3 custom presets and select and the fine tuning is fast and easy. Finally, the Pentax digital lab software is adequate, works under Vista but as expected, it will not replace a Paintshop Photo or CS3, no complaint here: it is included in the box at no extra charge.

Siggel", "ReviewID": "R1DVO6FT1FVU4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "15 years go I bought an analog Pentax P-10 along with a couple of good zoom lenses. The camera took -and still takes- outstanding pictures. Then in the late-90'S I discovered digital photography and did more and more with this medium and less with analog. I looked at the dSLR cameras coming from Pentax but was not convinced that the time to buy one had arrived...until the K10D. As soon as it showed up in the stores at the beginning of 2007 (an unfortunate delay by Pentax) I tried it out and was hooked.  My old autofocus lenses (FA series) worked smoothly, the camera was the perfect size for my large hands and the ergonomy was pretty good.  I received my K10D a few weeks ago and have put several hundred pictures through it on a recent vacation trip.I have found no weaknesses in the camera yet. Given, the stock DA 18-55 lens, which I did not expect to be perfect, distorts slightly at the edges  but is still good for the money. It will take me more time to truly master all the functionality and a thorough reading(s) of the manual is a must.  I am very excited about this camera and the creative opportunities it opens.  It is a major leap ahead for my photography and for Pentax.Nothing is perfect in this world: there are two cons that I have discovered so far:-after the first lens change there was a piece of dust on the CCD and the shake mechanism did not dislodge it (even after multiple tries) and I had to manually remove it (a straightforward task).  I hope that it was the nature of the dust and not the coating or shake mechanism that made it so \"sticky\".-The low light pictures taken with shake reduction turned on are not good.  Perhaps this was a \"pilot error\" of a newbie.In summary this camera is more than worth its' (plummeting) price and I look forward to learning all its' fine points over the next few months.

Prior to purchasing it, I read every review I could find and felt that I was making a well informed decision.  None of the local shops carried the Pentax K10D, so I had to order it online, sight unseen.  On paper, the camera was definitely impressive with weather-sealing, sensor dust reduction, sensor anti-shake, etc.  However, once I received the camera, I found myself becoming frustrated with some of the issues.First off, the JPG images from the camera were definitely softer (lacking sharpness) as compared to any other DSLR that I had ever owned.  This was later confirmed in tests that are viewable on [...]  Although conversion of the RAW files into JPG corrects this issue, I have neither the time nor patience to post process every photo that I take.  I prefer JPG images that are printable right out of the camera without the need for image manipulation.  (I shoot both JPG + RAW and use the RAW as a digital negative)To make matters worse, the issue of JPG sharpness is not resolved with increasing the sharpness level in camera.  Worsening my impression of the camera was poor white balance performance.  Indoors, too many of the photos had a sickly yellow cast which required reprocessing of the RAW files or shooting with manual white balance to counteract.  Lastly, the camera's metering system was all over the place.  With the main subject in the center of the screen, if I took three pictures in a row without moving an inch, one photo would be overexposed and another would be underexposed.  I quadruple checked to make sure that exposure bracketing was off, but this issue would pop up at random.I'll be the first to admit that the camera I received (it was definitely brand new) might have been defective.  However, given all the issues I was having, I decided to return the camera and resumed using my Canon 20D.  The faster speed of the Canon (5fps) as well as the better autofocus (hunts less in low light) and better high ISO performance were all factors that returned me to using the Canon.  I truly wanted to like the Pentax K10D, but was ultimately unable to make it work for me.Given the number of positive raving reviews here, I'd say that just about everyone who owns one likes it.  However, from my own personal experience, I'd say this camera was less than the sum of its parts.  The price is indeed tempting considering how low it is compared to similar offerings from Canon/Nikon/Sony/Olympus, but I'd recommend trying this camera out in person before plunking down your hard earned cash.  Also, be sure to take a SD card along with you so you can save some images onto the card to review later.

So this review will have more resonance for those who are just getting into the SLR world.In searching for a camera to buy, we looked at the K10D, Nikon D80, and Canon 3D and 5D.  All of these, of course, are perfectly capable of taking fantastic photos.  The main thing that wound up sealing the deal for me (no pun intended) was the price/features ratio.  The weather sealing, anti-shake, dust removal, compatibility with just about any Pentax lens ever made, the dedicated RAW button, the intelligent design....all for a much lower price than its competitors.People have made a fuss over certain perceived drawbacks.  Some people say the autofocus is slow in poor light.  We tried taking some test photos indoors at night with just two lights on, and it seemed okay to me.  I suppose it may be marginally worse than other cameras in its class, but unless you're a professional, I don't think you'll notice it at all.Also, someone commented on the sound of the shutter.  It's not whisper quiet, but it's certainly not like some sort of jet plane taking off either.  It's a shutter.  All SLR's will have some shutter noise.  If the shutter noise is really a major priority for you, maybe there's a camera with a slightly quieter shutter action, but it seems to me the noise difference is pretty negligible.  I certainly have no problems with it whatsoever.  And if you're really nervous about the noise, go try it out in a store.Which brings me to another point--if you're considering buying an SLR, you MUST--repeat, MUST--go try several out in a store.  Do NOT buy an SLR without holding it in your hands first and playing with it.  This is particularly true for the K10D.  It IS a slightly heavier camera than others in its class.  Not so heavy that most people would be uncomfortable, but I feel that there are a few people who would probably find it heavier than they'd be comfortable with.  My wife and I both have no problems with the weight (and remember too that you'll have a lens on it).  For me, the heaviness is a good indication of how solidly made the K10D is (metal frame, high-quality textured plastic casing).  This thing is built like a tank.To sum up, I can't be happier with our purchase.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd still buy the K10D, in a heartbeat.  For those thinking of buying it, keep in mind that new Pentax cameras, the K20D and K200D, are rumoured to be announced in January...so if you can wait that long, it's possible you might be able to buy the K10D's successor, which by all accounts might be even better than this already-great camera.  However, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the K10D itself.  Absolutely terrific, highly recommended.EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention.  Many editorial reviews you'll find online speak about how this camera is designed for the \"advanced amateur\", citing things like the lack of \"scene modes\" and other automated features.  This may scare off some total SLR novices.  It almost scared me off too.  Now that I've tried it out, here's the deal: if you are a novice, the K10D *will take good pictures for you without any effort*.  It has a \"Green\" mode, which is its fully automated mode.  You point it at a subject, the camera calculates everything, and you press the shutter halfway down briefly to let the autofocus do its job, and then you take the picture.  Couldn't be easier, and the pictures come out fine in most situations.The caveat is this.  If you want to take *brilliant* photos, the kind you dream about taking when you see those travel magazines or nature shows; if you want to take photos that truly take advantage of the full capabilities of this camera, the kind that are razor crisp and vibrantly coloured or look like they were taken by Ansel Adams; if you want to take incredible night photos, or ultra-high-speed action photos..... then you *will* need to learn some basic photography.  That means learning about things like focal length, aperture, ISO settings, depth of field, lenses, etc.  So if you're hoping to get brilliant photos in every situation without any effort, or if you're buying this for people who permanently have their VCR's set to 12:00, this probably is not the right camera to buy.However, if you're willing to learn a little about photography, this camera will be a very rewarding instrument.  In full automatic mode, it's adequate for most tasks and takes a decent picture.  In manual and semi-manual modes, its performance is among the best SLR's out there (I'm still learning....but if you look through the user gallery at PentaxForums, you'll see thousands of examples of what the camera is capable of).", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "A very good semi-pro digital SLR for legacy 24x36 Pentax lenses", "Author": "Lorenzo", "ReviewID": "RP5XO619Q8JBL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me state that I just received this camera and only took a few hundred pictures to test it. Second, given how little choice one has in Pentax lenses nowadays, the only reason I can conceive for buying this camera today is to use discontinued Pentax lenses. In my particular case, I had a 28-70 f2.8, an 80-200 f2.8 and a 28-200 f3.8-5.6, all of them for 35mm SLRs. I consider the 28-70 and the 80-200 by Pentax second to none in their respective categories in terms of pure image quality, although they are heavier than their Nikon and Canon counterparts, and they are superbly built. By all means, should you come upon a perfectly kept used one, do consider seriously buying it! (just know that the power zoom function will work, but not the auto zoom).As for the 28-200, it is the ideal lens for an expedition, because it is extremely compact and fits all your needs in terms of focal range, although you end up paying for that in terms of sharpness.Of course, as for all lenses designed for 24x36 film SLRs, they exceed the requirements for APS-format digital SLRs. The only inconvenience is the you end up a little short ond the wide-angle side, on the other hand you now have a super-tele zoom at 300mm 24x36 equivalent.Going back to the K10D, I must stress again that it would be a waste to use it with the cheap lenses available in Pentax's current line-up. The upside on this unfortunate state of affairs is that Pentax has to price this camera very aggressively compared to Nikon or Canon (the recently launched Nikon D80 costs around 100$ more than the K10 and is inferior to it both in terms of construction and features).A second caveat is that if you are going to shoot in RAW format -and you should-, Adobe does not support yet the PEF format for this camera. Luckily you have the choice of using DNG, which works wonderfully. Picasa users will have to wait to view their RAW pictures, though, since Picasa doesn't support the RAW PEF or DNG files created by the 10 MP sensor on the K10. I have to make an update about this: if you shoot RAW DNG and import your files through Adobe, the imported DNG files(weighing around 21 MB as opposed to 16.5 MB before importing) are viewable on Picasa.Function customization is outstanding and the most used functions are accessible through dedicated buttons. Both displays are excellent and the camera really is weather-proof in that all the keys use o-rings as well as all the compartments, which close very tightly.I have a second update to make, and it concerns the sensor-based image stabilization: I was a little skeptical about it in the beginning, but when I took some pictures with a focal length of 105 to 135 mm(24x36) at speeds of 1/40 to 1/50 I was amazed by the results. Although I was at least 2 stops too slow, more than half the pictures were excellent and only about 10% were unacceptable. I take a lot of wildlife pictures and I look forward to trying this image stabilization system when following a moving subject: what happens to the background? (with lens-based VR systems, it is best to turn them off in this situation).", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "\"Awesome DSLR!\"", "Author": "Dred242", "ReviewID": "R1MFM5OQQ63YZS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After many years and photos taken with my point-n-shoot Canon S500 Digital ELPH, I've finally moved up to a DSLR! The digital camera market has suddenly become flooded with DSLR cameras aimed at the \"prosumer\" (professional consumer) with a price point of $400-$1000. Without going through the entire list of DSLR's I had considered, I'll only tell you of my top three.The Nikon D40x was No.3 on my list. The D40x gets high marks amongst many in the hands-on world, and it's price of just over $700 at Amazon.com made an attractive selling point.The Sony A100 came in at No.2 with top notched features (most of which can be found on my No.1 choice), and an impressive assortment of A-mount lenses from both Sony, and Minolta. One of the best selling points of the Sony A100 for me was that I could get away with buying the body only ($608 at Amazon.com) and use my older Minolta lenses.....what a savings! I still have my old Minolta 400si 35mm film camera with a 35mm-70mm AF zoom lens, and a way-cool 24mm wide angle lens of which I would love to still be able to use.Finishing at No.1 was the Pentax K10D (retail $1000) with an impressive array of features to excite the masses.....this camera just felt right! My first 35mm SLR camera was a Pentax K1000 bought back in the mid 70's. I learned everything about photography with the K1000. So it only makes sense to return to the point at which I started. Go check out all of the features of the K10D over at the Pentax website.....and watch the video! Amazon.com offered the best price at $835.49 (plus a $50.00 rebate brings the final price down to $785.49). I also picked up a Pentax BG2 Battery Grip for the K10D for $124.33. When you buy both the K10D along with the Pentax BG2 Battery Grip at the same time, you get an additional $75.00 rebate for a total of $125.00 in rebates from Pentax. Plus I joined Amazon PRIME which gets me free 2-day shipping.....cool! The Pentax K10D comes with a 18mm-50mm f/3.5-5.6 auto focus zoom lens with lens hood & lens cap, battery & charger, neck strap, USB 2.0 sync cable, flash shoe cover, viewfinder cover, A/V cables, and Pentax Photo Browser and Laboratory software to process/edit RAW files.The major selling points for me on the Pentax K10D:*10.2MP*Shake Reduction (SR)*Pentax Real Image Engine (PRIME)*Dust Removal System*Two RAW file format*Instant-on RAW button (no menu access needed)*BG2 Battery Grip option. (It's extra battery extends shooting time)*11 Auto-Focus Points (vs. Sony's 9 Auto Focus Points)*Universally recognized flash mount (Sony's A100K is proprietary)*Sensitivity Priority AE (Sv) Mode (eliminates the need to recall a menu screen for sensitivity changes)*Top mounted back-lit (green) LCDIn all fairness.I must admit that the Sony A100 has almost all the same features as the Pentax K10D, but what of Sonys future? Will Sony continue to support their DSLR market and product line in the long run. Sony has been around since the beginning of time, but they jump from one area of electronics to another so fast that it worries me. Anyone can discontinue a product line or even leave an entire market like Minolta did when they got together with Konica several years ago only to then sell off the 35mm product line to Sony a few years later......bummer. I just feel better about going with Pentax right now.So what sucks?It's the Pentax Photo Browser and Pentax Photo Laboratory software. The Photo Browser works well when simply downloading images from the camera or card, and viewing them on your PC, but the Photo Laboratory software opens several windows with different tools all over your desktop.....yuck! Don't get me wrong, it works, but it's got some funky and sometimes janky tools.....I just didn't like it. I tried PhaseONE LE which is another RAW image editor that's offered as a FREE download with the purchase of a Sandisk Extreme III 2.0gb SD card. This application also sucks, as it's only a LE (light edition) and missing some of the better features of the PRO version.....nice try! I Went surfing and found Raw Therapee which is a FREE RAW image editor. It works, but suffers from janky tools just like the others. But at least all of the applications tools and features of Raw Therapee are conveniently located in one UI (User Interface).Best of my bunch.The current winner is my out dated version of Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0, and it's built-in photo browsing plug-in. It will grab my images directly from the camera or SD card, load them into Adobe's photo browser for viewing. If I need to edit the RAW image it offers up a separate \"mini editor\" for quick adjustments, then dump the image into the full version of Elements (still in it's original RAW format....cool!). From here I can continue to edit or adjust the image before saving it out as a JPEG. All of these RAW images editing apps require way more steps than I would like, but if I'm to take advantage of the true power of today's DSLR cameras, I'm just going to have deal with it....\"You get what you get, and you don't throw a fit\"!Current conclusion.I'm happy with my Pentax K10D. It's body grips, as well as it's weight & balance feels correct in my hands at all times. The viewfinder is adjustable, and appears surprisingly bright and clear to my tired and sore eyes. Being able to make shutter speed, aperture, and ISO adjustments on the fly with the front and rear e-dials is worth the price of admission. I also love being able to preview white-balance setting with an actual image from my SD card.....Awesome! When In JPEG mode the shutter just keeps snapping photos at 3fps until the SD card is full, that's something I could never do with my smaller Canon S500 Digital ELPH. I charged the battery right out of the box a few days ago, and the K10D still shows a full charge after at least 200+ test shots.....wonderful! The Pentax BG2 Battery Grip will add an additional battery which should increase the cameras up-time. It also add's another shutter release button (for when shooting portraits), e-dial, and remote control compartment. The BG2 Battery Grip is still in-route with UPS, but once here my system will be complete and I'll be good-2-go! My plan is to bring my photographic skill back to the level I once held back in the 80's. With this new Pentax K10D, I think I'm off to a good start.

There is dust and then there's sticky dust, and living where dust and dirt are a way of life, I can say the dust removal upon starting the camera is not so great for sticky dust.  Although, there are many products to help with manually cleaning the sensor.  The LCD screen is bright, and easy to see your work, although since it came with no cover, mine is now getting scratched. Somewhat loud shutter slap, or I am just (still) not used to it.  I've noticed some color fringing when beefing up the in-camera saturation, etc. while in JPEG mode, although it is much less in RAW.  Pentax software is a joke.The good:  weather sealing; capable outdoors (icy, dirty climb to Round Top peak, elevation 10381 ft); capable indoors; good shooting with available light; good noise reduction;  great quality pictures at high ISOs.  I like having more control on the outside of a camera, rather than hunting through a slough of menus.  Straightforward controls.  Good grip.  I like not having a bunch of amateur modes - like little symbols on the dial for macro or portrait.  I mainly shoot with Aperature Priority.  I took the view screen out the other day without much fanfare. I LOVE the center weighted and spot metering; growing up with a Spotmatic mated my love of spot metering. I like the handling of bracketing and dial to choose focusing.What am I shooting with it?  Weddings, and people.  Outdoors and black and white, as a usuall passionate pastime.I plan to get two more back up k10 cameras for my bag.  Right now I'm shooting with a Tamron zoom, but that will probably change.

I though I was going to become locked in the Nikon system, at least for a while, when I accidentally came across a web review about Pentax's new come back to the prosumer DSLR scenario with the highly appraised Pentax K10d.I must say it was a very though decision, but after actually having the K10d in my hands for the first time and feeling it's healthy heft, I realised was in front of a serious camera, a product in a league of it's own. For this price there's no other way you could get a weather sealed 10 MP DSLR with polycarbonate covered stainless steel chassis, on-body shake reduction, dust reduction, 2.5 inch LCD monitor, gorgeous big and luminous pentaprism viewfinder, unique exposure modes, two RAW formats, compatible with every Pentax lens ever made.The K10d is one of those cameras that just feels right and makes you believe no corners were cut during it's development. You have all the critical adjustments at the tip of your fingersEven though, I believe the K10d isn't for everybody. It's not that I'm a snob. I just think the K10d was made for people who want to WORK with photography in a similar way they did with film. Meaning you probably like to shoot everything in RAW and enjoying making large prints of your work. If you are looking for something really straightforward out of the box probably, this is not the best place to look for. For example the K10d's metering firmware is set to preserve highlights. Some might confuse this with underexposure under high contrast lighting situations. Use your flash to fill in instead! The K10d is for people searching for a more photographical approach, as for example, the hobbyist would want.Some commonly cited cons about the K10d are regarding to auto white balance performance under incandescent light. Personally, I can't think of a most horrible light to work with or a DSLR that handles it correctly.  If you are forced to shoot under incandescent light, use your flash and/or shoot RAW. Also some people think the K10d gives dull, not very sharp images. If you want sharp saturated, sharp JPEG's just set the camera to \"Bright mode.\" It doesn't give you much post-processing freedom though, but that's basically your call.After all you probably realised photographers with the photographer in mind designed the K10d. Using the K10d it's an empowering experience, one that pushes you to further unleash your creativity.", "Date": "March 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "More than what a DSLR photographer could hope ask for", "Author": "Skibum", "ReviewID": "R1Y6V9D5XLYWZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the K10D for more than 6 mos.

However, changeing lenses is a pain, especially in the heat of the battle,if you know what I mean.  I elected to put a Tamron 18-200mm on my camera and I am glad I did.  (Pentax should take note  of this).  Changing lenses in the battle when time is of the essence, is unaccpectable.  There simply is not enough time to change the lens and properly put it away.  Too much fumbling, unless you have 3 hands.I am extremely pleased with this camera.  It performance is great and I am an old SLR photo.

Lowe", "ReviewID": "R2Q3426TK189ZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Pentax user for awhile, starting with the ZX-L film body. For the most part I have mostly good results to report upgrading to the K10D:- The camera's meter works very well. In the vast majority of scenarios where the older film camera's meter would have under or over exposed, the meter is right on.- The exposure latitude is great. I tested it at about 11 stops in RAW mode, about 2 1/2 stops more than what you can see. You will need a good raw processor like Adobe Lightroom to take advantage of this, but it allows you to pull details from contrasty scenes like woods in daylight which would have 'blocked up' on film.- Higher ISO sensitivity and longer shots have a very low noise level. The noise level is the same or better than a good 35mm pro film. For long exposures (1 sec or longer) the noise filter is flawless -- my long exposures are better than film, since the digital camera has no reciprocity effect like film does. In addition, in 2 second delay mode the camera has auto mirror lock-up, which my older film body lacked, a feature I am very fond of!- The SR (shake reduction) is good for 2-3 stops, as advertised. With a monopod I can take 1 second exposures at 70mm with no visible camera shake with SR on. With SR off, the image is so blurry it is unusable.- DNG format and AdobeRGB colorspace (set in custom menu) are ideal for working in Lightroom and Photoshop, no raw converter needed.- My 28-70 f/2.8, 70-300 f/4-5.6, and 50mm f/1.4 FA lenses all work very well with the K10D.A few downsides I have noticed:- Battery life is dreadful with the built-in flash. If you use the flash alot, you will get only about 100 exposures before it's dead. Buy an extra battery, and/or use a hot-shoe extra flash (I use the 360FGZ and it is *great*). Without the built-in flash, I have shot 150 pictures with less than 50% battery drain though.- Focusing in low light doesn't work well. I have to use a supplementary light (like a pocket flashlight, which I carry in my bag, or the built-in flash) to use auto-focus when I want to shoot at f/2 or f/1.4 in low light using my 50mm lens.- The biggest drawback is lack of TTL metering. My 360FGZ works great in P-TTL mode, but my macro ring light has to be shot as a manual flash, and I get over-exposed shots using a (cheap, non-P-TTL) slave flash that would have been perfect on the ZX-L, requiring careful selection of flash compensation.Still, for what I do I have to give this camera 5 stars, because it exceeded my expectations.

I just opened the box, and I'm in love with this camera already.I decided to get serious about photography about three months ago and have been shopping for a dSLR since. I've owned Sony, Nikon, Minolta and Canon Point & Shoot cameras. My heart has always been with my Canon S1 and S2, so naturally I looked at the Rebel XTi; I also looked at the Sony A100 for it's in-body shake reduction.I wanted four features: in-body Image Stabilization, 10MP, a tough and durable body, and under $1000.I looked at the Sony hard, but in the end declined because it felt cheap. I never liked my Sony or Minolta P&S; camera's so I didn't trust the A100.I love Canon cameras because the are easy to use, take great photos and are solid. However, the XTi felt cheaply made and was too small for my hand. Besides that, no IS in the body and IS lenses are too pricey for my tastes.Enter the Pentax! I never considered the Pentax K10d until a week ago when I read a review in Popular Photography and did some research on Pentax. Like Canon, Pentax focuses on imaging products only. Somehow, I believe quality is compromised if you have a wide range of products, i.e. Sony.Right out of the box, you can feel the quality in the K10d. The body is solid and heavy; rubberized plastic in all the right places. The menus and buttons are thoughtfully arranged and placed and operation is smooth.I love this camera!

What an amazing piece of equipment. I also own the Pentax K1000 which for you new to the photo world was basically the standard of 35 milimeter SLR Film cameras. All of the lenses are interchangeable and still to this day work flawlessly. Upon opening the box i felt the same feeling i get when i open an ipod box. Its pretty plain, and simple. Except Black instead of White ;-). The camera Truly works amazingly and the anti-shake does a great job. My professor didn't believe that it actually worked so i took a shot at a third of a second 1/3, with and without of the same subject, F-stop, and shutterspeed. The results were amazing. The shot i took free hand was hardly readable (took a pic of a flash drive), while the picture i took with shake reduction was amazing. I think i even felt it vibrate a little as it moved the sensor while i was shaking.Pros: Amazing Lenses. Honestly canon doesn't have anything on us ;-). Our lenses are proven to last and as many will say \"If you want the best glass go with pentax.\" Nice big LCD screen, though it is the standard, they make good use of the size unlike some other brands. You can grip it extremely well. When your holding it, even if your sweating, you feel in total control. The strap is cushioned and comfortable, not to mention stylish.

Two wheels conveniently located on the front and rear of the grip. One for F-stop and one for Shutterspeed. They work amazingly and are so appreciated. SD cards. They are cheap, fast, and easy to find. FAST Processing. You can skim through pictures lightning fast and even do it while zoomed in (scroll in with the front most wheel, then use the one on the front of the camera to go between pics retaining the zoom)Cons: its big (but i like that... some might not). The Menu is a tiny bit confusing. But once you get used to it, its very easy. The lense that comes with it is a fantastic lense but i really honestly wish it was maybe 20's up to 70's just so you have a bit more of a verity. This lense will most certainly kick the canon xti's cheapo one out the door but i still think this should have been a little bigger. Not many pixels for such a large screen. Sure you don't need them, but it could have been just one more thing this camera had over canon ;-).Other Notes: I did my research for nearly 3 months. I honestly took the time, talked to experts, and i kept coming to the Pentax K10D and the Olympus e-510. Both look like great cameras, but the sheer fact that the pentax is that much more sealed + a steel frame goes to show this one was built to last while the other one was built to make it look good in hype but maybe not last as long as you would like..

I bought a Canon S3 IS as planning to take pictures of my daughter birthday party to come, and then the S3 went half dead just after 2 weeks with rarely used. I went to look for another camera and asked for opinions on various forums, then there were some advises that I should go for a DSLR camera. I was kind afraid of my lacking knowledge in photography that could end up in getting a camera, and then don't know how to use it. But out of curiosity, I went and researched then compared specs, features, reviews, and hand feels from various models of Olympus, Sony, Canon, and Nikon; all except the Pentaxes - non available in stores in my area. But all the cameras I'd tried, non gave me a satisfaction feel in my hand, then I spent more time in researching into the Pentaxes. Finally I narrowed down to the K10D. Because of the value compared to its features plus all the good reviews, I decided to give it a try, thinking of if it wouldn't fit well in my hand then as the other models from other brands, and may be after a year or so I may get a hang of it (being DSLR). So I bought it without seeing it in real life.To my surprise, the K10D arrived and the first time I held it in my right hand, it gave me a comfortably fit. But when looked at it with the mounted lens, and all the buttons and controls and the thick User Manual, I felt intimidated (lol). In two days without taking a shot (I was afraid of messing things up and couldn't go back), just reading the Magic Lantern and Understanding Exposure. Those books I had in the same order with the K10D.Later after taking shots, and learned and adjusted, I learned more and more about it, and day after day I saw my improvement considerably, thus I gained more confident in taking pictures with it.Now, just after one month of owning it, I have taken quite a few so nice portraits of my kids with some used manual primes which I got from Ebay (not close to $100 each). No way I go back to P&S; again, and no way I take my kids to studio to get portraiture pictures taken.I now have acquired quite a few lenses and found out that the problem in low light slow focusing, usualy varies with which lens is using. Also there's some misunderstanding of the K10D's JPEG being not sharp. Actualy, because in default, its JPEG output is set to Natural; if you want to have your JPEG pics look sharp, vivid, and punchy, just change from Natural to Bright mode and adjust the Saturation, Sharpness, and Contrast to suit your liking.

I tried out the Canon Rebel, Nikon D40 and Olympus E510 at a local store but they all felt \"cheap\" and \"plasticky\" especially compared to the point and click digitals I'd previously used. So it was with some trepidation that I ordered a K10D, sight-unseen.I need not have worried, the camera is all that users claim it to be. It is solid, extremely well engineered, all flaps, switches, dials etc move easily and securely. The first thing you notice is the weight, this is no feather-weight, slip-it-in-your-pocket camera. But the weight is reassuring, gives the camera great balance and feel.What about specifics? All the switches and dials are where you'd want them to be. The absence of a scene-dial gave Pentax room for more useful switches/dials. The priority switch lets you move effortlessly between shutter/aperature/ISO priorities and all their combinations. There's a switch to save images as RAW instead of JPEG. Easy access switch to flip between auto and manual focus. Info LCD panel on top lets you see aperture, speed, shot quality etc without resorting to the main LCD screen. Bright easy-to-use viewfinder. Software menu settings are predictable, you don't need to spend hours with this camera's manual - which is just as well because one of few issues you might have with the K10D is the manual. It's essentially a technical directory of the K10D's capabilities, in the Sony style. Anyone who's had to fight their way through a Sony manual knows what I'm talking about. But as I said, the manual is not something you need to constantly refer to.Using the K10D is a breeze, but it's a long way from point-and-click, I had to re-learn a lot of old optical SLR habits. The delay on automatic focus is minimal but soon seems like an eternity when you have an alternative - switch auto focus off, focus manually and wait for your Kodak moment. Perfect. The continuous shooting mode is a wonder, hit the shutter button and it keeps on taking shots until your SD card gets filled up. And they all look good. As other reviewers have pointed out, the out-of-the-box images are a little soft and color is a little \"flat' but it only takes a couple of menu clicks to change those factory settings - sharpen up a notch and up the saturation level and you'll have whatever keeps you happy.The K10D is clearly head and shoulders above the competitors in build quality, And I'm already taking photos every bit as good as friends with Nikon's and Canon's. And one of the most important features is something I hope I never have to be concerned about - dust-reduction.

The newer models (K20D, K-7) are certainly evolutions on this platform, but they don't really add enough new features to justify the cost.  I guess that's another way of saying that there isn't really much missing from my K10D.What do I love?  I love all the buttons and dials.  I love being able to throw a switch to change the metering mode or to turn on exposure bracketing.  I use those features -- a lot.  I *love* the little green button that quickly adjusts the shutter speed to correct exposure when in Manual mode.  That makes it extremely easy to set a reference exposure and then fine-tune or re-compose the shot, etc.  That feature is something that I think I would miss greatly if I didn't have it (and I haven't found that feature in any Canon or Nikon body).  I also love having dedicated wheels for aperature and shutterspeed and the lever on the side near the lens for flipping between the various focus modes (manual, AF-S and AF-C).In case it's not obvious, I'm a big fan of Pentax ergonomics.  This is a solid camera and fits great in larger hands.  My *ist DS before that was solid too -- but a lot smaller.  Compared to other brands, the Pentax just felt like I was getting my money's worth.  I'm also a big fan of the weather sealing.  I don't stand out in the rain, but I'm not concerned about it getting splashed, etc.  Maybe it's just psychological, since I haven't really put it to the test, but it feels like a rugged camera.And features like anti-shake are great; I use that all the time.  And the sensor clean seems to be working really well.  I had dust issues with my previous Pentax camera (*ist DS), but have had no problems with dust on my K10D sensor.Now, it's not all puppy dog tails; there are some ways that the K10D is inferior and some ways that just owning a Pentax is a little more work.For one thing, choosing Pentax does mean that you will have to settle for a narrower selection of lenses and lens accessories (especially if you're not interested in using older lenses).  For a long time after buying my K10D, there wasn't a single fast, long lens (70-200 f/2.8) in production.  Now there is a Tamron, Sigma, and a couple of Pentax models in this general area.  And now I'm a little disappointed to be going through something similar with a long (180mm-200mm) macro lens.  I'm also bummed that Kenko extension tubes don't seem to be available anymore for Pentax mount; maybe that's a temporary thing.  Yeah, it'd be simpler to own a Canon or Nikon, but then I wouldn't own a Pentax. :)  To be fair, though, one of the strengths of the Pentax DSLR bodies is that you can use basically any Pentax mount lens ever produced.  This means that you can buy used lenses to fill the gaps; they just don't come with as many acronyms tacked on -- or that new fancy, fast-focus system (SDM).And the menu system is pretty rough.  The basic shooting functions (flash, WB, etc.) are simple & intuitive, but you should avoid pressing the \"Menu\" button if there are children or clergy nearby: the idiosyncratic interpretation of how you accept/change/cancel settings will likely end with explitives.  Once you get used to it, you'll be fine navigating the depths of the camera's configuration -- but then probably unable to operate your microwave.And finally, there are some things that I am waiting for before I upgrade the camera again.  I don't think these are problems, but they are things that I'd like to see improved:  (1) mirror lockup (MLU).  Currently there is a 2-second timer that serves much the same purpose, but other cameras support this MLU feature without requiring a 2-second delay (that would be useful to me for macro work).  (2) Better control of noise.  I'm happy with a 10 or 12MP camera.  I'm fairly convinced by the claim that the lens is the limiting factor at this point anyway.  I'd rather Pentax focus on low-noise at high ISO.  Sure, I can shoot at 800 without really losing quality, but I want to shoot at 1600 without noticing it.  If my wife can do that on her Canon 40D, why can't I?  Pentax needs to step up their game in this area.So, despite a few niggles and qualifications, I think the Pentax K10D is a phenomenal camera.  I've periodically looked at other systems (and I use my wife's Canon 40D from time to time), but at the end of the day, I really like the Pentax.  It's got a lot of character, really suits my propensities for manual controls, and its rugged & weather-proof body makes me imagine that I could trek through the jungle with this camera ... even if the closest I usually get is lying on mulch to photograph Snow Drops in the Spring.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Two Years On...", "Author": "Allen Whitaker", "ReviewID": "RKBPIGUW4KR8N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pentax K10D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens I purchased this camera in December of 2007.  I have waited two years before reviewing the performance of this camera in order to use it under a wide variety of conditions.  I am happy to report that it has performed perfectly in a wide range of conditions over the past two years.  The camera body is extremely well made, (even though final assembly for the bodies of Pentax DSLR's occurs in the Philippines and the Pentax lenses are assembled in Vietnam).  The quality of the lens is equally good, while also being extremely light.One reason for the design of DSLR's is to duplicate the \"What you see in the viewfinder is what you get in the image\" feature of traditional 35mm and some medium-format film cameras prior to the arrival of digital cameras.  The K10D accomplishes this very well.  I find myself framing, composing and shooting the same way I used to with my film cameras.  This is accomplished with the traditional reflex mirror SLR design used in the K10D.  This does however create a drawback in that the K10D cannot display the through-the lens CCD image on the 2.5\" LCD display.  In order to see the image the camera sees on the LCD display, you must utilize the preview feature which allows you to capture the CCD image in the LCD display without the captured image actually being saved to the removable memory card.The image quality is outstanding, and the K10D offers a wide range of options for manual control.  In addition to the fully automatic Green setting, which allows \"point and shoot\" capability in a wide range of conditions, there are priority settings for shutter speed, aperture, EV (ISO \"film speed\") value as well as a unique feature which allows for both aperture and shutter speed values based on a continuously variable ISO value, something impossible in film cameras.  The built in metering system works well in most regular lighting conditions.  Extreme low light shooting requires use of the system's built in spot and area metering system, which allows you to set which of four quadrants within the frame are to be read by the CCD for rendering exposure settings.  The built in pop-up flash unit works well within its limited capacity as a fixed angle straight on un-diffused blue xenon electronic flash.  I recommend getting either one of two available dedicated flash units, Pentax AF 360 FGZ or the AF-200FG if you plan on doing a lot of flash photography.  As with virtually all Pentax cameras, the K-mount lenses will mount to this camera, even lenses used on my old K-1000 film SLR.  Although the formatting is not 1:1 between the 35mm and the CCD format, conversion is easy.  Although auto focus does not work with the older lenses, the K10D still beeps when the subject is properly focused manually with an older lens.  Diaphragm automation in older lenses depends on how old the lenses are, so this varies depending on the individual lens.The included and proprietary lithium battery pack has good charge life and holds its charge well when not in use.  However, I've noticed that the threshold between fully charged and fully discharged is narrow and abrupt, so you can suddenly find yourself with discharged battery and a shut down camera fairly quickly.  Carrying a spare battery pack, easily available for about $50 is another worthwhile accessory.  The included and dedicated charger charges the battery pack fully within about two hours.  Overall, an excellent camera.  One that is as of this writing no longer in production, having been replaced by cameras that have been refined designs of this camera.  I can say that any of these newer machines would be an excellent choice because the K10D is such an outstanding camera.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "PENTAX K10D DIGITAL SLR CAMERA WITH SHAKE REDUCTION AND 18-55mm LENS.", "Author": "Robert Caselnova", "ReviewID": "R2KGOY3LUR4I59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax K10D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 LensLast year, when on assignment in Switzerland, I used several models of digital still cameras. I carried along the K10D, carefully testing thefirst \"shake reduction\" I was ever to try.Usually, I am a stickler for steadiness. Since my first days as a workingprofessional, it was always a must to employ the use of a tripod - notonly for longer exposures - but also for general shooting. Humans holdingcameras can almost never be quite as steady as a tripod or other camera stand. Think about it, our heartbeat causing pulse and cafeine shake inour hands is nonexistent in a tripod. People do not always stand steadilyand firm.My tests included handheld images with the shake reduction,  tripoddedimages without the shake reduction, and even handheld images without theshake reduction, all cases using manual exposure settings ranging from1/60th to 1/1000th sec., making notes as the images were casted on the23.5x15.7mm CCD.There is not enough room here to detail the hundreds of exposures madeduring the three-days testing. Therefore, it shall suffice to say thatthe K10D with its CCD-shifting shake reduction system allowed me to makesharper pistures with three different lenses. Comparing the images madeon the tripod with those handheld using shake reduction there is not anynotable difference at 16X. Of course, one 6MP camera I tested, which did not have image-stabilization was used solely on the tripod, and images from it were as sharp as the handheld 10MP camera (not deploying shakereduction and in similar lighting with auto-exposure.)Other characteristics observed: The AF points on the viewfinder are redand illuminated for easy visibility.

I like its size, proportions and weight. Autofocus and usability were greatly improved over the Pentax *Ist Ds (which I also own). It focuses much faster and really acurate.Built-in shake reduction system (SR) works well for me. It gives about 2 extra stops when shooting in low light conditions. It works the best for me for exposures between 1/8 to 1/30 s. But in certain situations the SR can be an enemy. I noticed that when I shoot at 1/50...1/60 with the 18-55 kit lens and SR switched ON, the percentage of blurred shots is noticebly higher compared to the situation with SR switched OFF.JPEG quality has improved dramatically compared to *Ist Ds.Rather poor color balance for lower color temperatures is not a problem for me, since I shoot only in RAW.Multi Exposure mode with two available optons (with and without auto-adjust) is amazing. I only wish it would work simultaneously with auto-bracketing too.Some peolple reported a \"sensor tilt\" problem - meaning that the CCD sensor is misaligned (rotated) in the camera. I am not sure if this is a problem with the sensor mounting itself or with the viewfinder alignment, but my shots are indeed tilted by some 1 degree, compared to what I see in the viewfinder. Odd, but I can tolerate this.

I have not compared this camera with its competition. 2. I am not even half-way through exploring the many features this camera has to offer.I used to sell cameras, back when it was necessary to have someone hold the flash powder a safe (not for him) distance away while the photographer stuck his/her head under a big, black cloth.  More seriously, my first Pentax was an H2 (semi-automatic lens diaphragm!) and my last film camera was an LX.  Pentax have the habit of waiting and watching other manufacturers, learning from their mistakes, and then coming late to market with a superior camera.  They did it with the LX, which didn't sell well but which I thought was markedly superior to the Nikon.  Now they have done it again with the K10D which really is a SENSATIONAL piece of equipment.  Once again, they were the last major manufacturer to bring a semi-professional DSLR to market, and once again they have forfeited market share to Nikon and Canon.  (Once upon a time Pentax was the best-selling SLR in the world.)I have had the camera a couple of months.  It is so well designed, and performs so well that I get a thrill every time I use it.  It is bigger than the *1stDS (and has a more sensible name), but I am surprised to find that the added bulk in no way detracts from the camera.  In the abstract, I always prefer a smaller, lighter camera, but Pentax have made such good use of the space available for various controls and read-outs, and the camera is so very well balanced that the size feels perfect.Outstanding features, some of them unique to this camera: Variable ISO, unique to this camera.  All DSLRs enable the user to change the \"film speed,\" but only the K10D lets you give the camera a range of sensitivity, such as ISO 100-400, and the camera will choose the appropriate sensitivity automatically.  The anti-shake device is astonishing.  The first weekend I had the camera, I took it to a fund-raiser where I took pictures of the band with a 200mm lens (=300mm/35mm) by available light, hand held.  I took some at 1/2sec and they were razor sharp.  I could go on and on, but instead I will just say this: Every gismo on the camera works exactly as promised.  Although I have not played with other makes (except the Olympus), I seriously doubt whether the Nikon or the Canon is the equal of the K10D which is, of course, considerably less expensive.One recommendation for those of us who hate using flash.  Buy the 50mm f1.4 lens, a real beauty.  The 50-200mm zoom is also a very nice lens, and the camera feels perfectly balanced with that lens attached.", "Date": "September 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not here yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", "Author": "Vance E.

Beautiful pictures, quick focus, solidly made, excellent camera.The problem I have is with low light situations. Not dark, but something less than bright sun. This camera has significant trouble focusing if the subject isn't well lit. Since I bought this camera to take action shots of my son's wrestling team (think about how poorly lit gyms are for taking pictures) and playing football (Friday night lights aren't always so bright), it has been a challenge to get the shots I want. Another problem is that above an ISO sensitivity of 800, the pictures are grainy and ugly, which is pretty much impossible to Phtoshop out, making low-light photography even more difficult. To compensate, I bought a fairly nice 28-200 Tamron for the wrestling mat, which allows me to keep the aperture and ISO relatively low and take some pretty nice pictures with my hot shoe flash (Pentax AF360-FGZ). I also bought the 50-500 \"Bigma\" from Sigma for football - it doesn't cover the whole field, but as I walk the sidelines, I can get some decent shots while avoiding ISO settings over 800.Bottom line: if your main purpose is to take low-light action shots, spend the extra 300-500 on a mid-level Nikon.

I found that the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 works great for the K10D with its supplied kit lens.  Although the camera/lens does fit into the Lowepro Topload Mini, it does so just barely, with no room for the strap.  So if you're looking for an inexpensive bag, the Topload Zoom 1 works great.  (I'm putting this comment under the camera because I figured if you're looking at the K10D, it's best to report on a bag under the camera's heading, than randomly under the bag itself, which would take a lot more work to find!).  My comment has to do with the Pentax's battery.  I've been incredibly impressed by its ability to hold a charge.  I bought the camera over a month ago - charged the battery when I got it, and it's STILL, one month later, indicating a full charge, despite having been in the cold, and I've taken about 300 pix (about 1/2 w/flash)!

Then I did my research on it by visiting numerous photographic review sites. Everyone had a very positive review about it and I finally decided to go for it. Thank God I did that. The camera is truly amazing. Not only it takes amazing pictures but it has loads of features that the Canon/Nikon at the same level lacks. The user interface is also pretty simple.

The RAWS are at par with any the Canons/Nikons.2)Excellent build quality. It feels so comfortable in the hand even though it is a bit on the heavier side. The body is completely weather-proof which cannot be found on any of the other sub 1000$ digital SLRs.3)Top notch features with body built-in Shake reduction and sensor dust cleansing technology.4)Excellent noise control till ISO 800. Even ISO 1600 is completely usable. Night photography had never been so simple for me.5)Superb penta-prism viewfinder.6)And ofcourse PRICE.

The built in shake reduction works with all lenses, including the old ones!  Full seals for shooting in inclement weather to keep the rain and snow from damaging your expensive tool are impressive for a camera in this price range.  I have had no issue with JPG files as some have had, but they aren't as good as a post processed RAW file for sure, but don't expect them to look bad as some reviews have said.  Who should buy the K10D?  Anyone considering a mid-grade DSLR camera.My cons for this camera are minor gripes.  I actually like the weight, as it feels stable and substantial in my hands.  My complaint with the shutter button is that it is different than my Canon Digital Rebel was.  It doesn't have a well defined mid press point for focusing/metering.  I found I accidentally triggered the shutter a few times, but now that I have 2000 pictures through the camera I don't notice.To address some concerns floating around from reviews on popular internet sites, the low light focus can be bad at times if the lighting is really low and low contrast, but at other times it does fine.  Overall it does better than my Canon Digital Rebel (300d) did.The JPEGs might be a little soft, but are still impressive with a good lens.  I have zero problem with the JPEGs. You usually don't print poster sized prints from JPEGs, shoot RAW if you are doing that, and this camera excels at RAW.  I posted a Santa cropped 25 to 1 in the image gallery that was taken at the default JPEG settings of the camera.  It is plenty sharp.  I think some of the online reviews might have been testing JPEG settings at non-ideal focal lengths for the kit lens or something.  RAW is even better of course.As for my pros, they speak for themselves.  The camera feels high quality in my hands.  It does have a plastic body, but it is over a sturdy metal frame and the plastic feels high quality.  All mechanical actuators (like flash and SD and battery compartment releases) also feel high quality.  The shake reduction is wonderful, and I have gotten many good shots at up to 1 second exposure with it, but if an item is really close to the camera, don't expect a lot of help.All my old manual focus lenses work great.  My beauty is my 50mm SMC Pentax-A f/1.4, razor thin depth of field at f/1.4 and crystal sharp by f/4, and it is easily one of my favorite lenses for this camera.  This lens even allows the camera to control its aperture (A designation).If you do use manual lenses be sure to set the camera to allow use of the aperture ring through the menu. Also be careful with some old lenses, they have a pin that will stick in the autofocus screw drive and get the lens stuck, use a feeler gauge to dislodge the pin and remove a stuck lens.  This electrical contact pin can be removed or ground off if necessary (my Albinar had this pin).  I think this is on the Ricoh mount lenses.Words cannot describe how happy I am with this camera.

Before buying the camera I read several books on digital photography, read a number of blogs, read [...] and listened to podcasts etc.The reason I chose the K10D was mainly the weather resistance since I live in Washington state. Another reason is that the shake reduction is built into the camera. You'll hear a lot about having image stabilization built into the lens but independent sources are not convinced that one is better than another and there are a LOT of disadvantages to in lens IS. For instance you can't get IS with an old lens. You pay for IS over and over for each lens you buy. I bought a few lens' off ebay. Some are old manual focus and I still get IS with them. You can't get that with Canon or Nikon.You'll see a number of reviews on Amazon complaining about soft images in jpeg. If you take the time to go through the menus you can fix those right up. It's simply the default settings that are the problem and you should be shooting raw anyway. Shooting raw is such an improvement over in camera jpeg. You can easily fix color balance problems and recover shadows or blown highlights. There's no comparison.You'll see some reviews that mention or complain about a loud shutter. Yes the shutter is louder than a point and shoot. That is the nature of SLR's. That mirror coming up and the motor driving the shutter is louder than a point and shoots fake camera sound. I haven't had any problems and I am taking close ups of horses. Horses are skiddish when it comes to strange sounds.Frames per second is also a common complaint. I'm not taking sports photos so I haven't had any issues being limited to three frames/sec. Also with a fast SDHC card the buffer flushes in less than a second even shooting large numbers of raws. So no problems with that. I'm going to test it at a paintball course to see if I have a problem there. I don't expect a problem.I love this camera. I've shot in the rain with running horses.

I have been shooting with Pentax camera's and lenses and upgrading them since I started shooting with a K1000 in 1980. Over time, I have accumulated and upgraded camera's and lenses (now to some of the auto-focus lenses), and all of them  can be used (including bellows and teleconverter) with the K10 D. I often shoot in low light hand held (because I can't bring in my tripod) and I think that the \" IS\" is going to be a benefit when shooting under these conditions. I also work with a 100mm-500mm telephoto lens and in experimenting with it, I was able to photograph (hand held & clearly read), at a lower shutter speed, a license plate on a car about 125 ft away.As I have been going to larger prints, the RAW & RAW + jpeg formats (on the fly) will give me the ability to make better images of the important shots that I want to create without using up memory on images that are not as important.All of the new shooting modes (in addition to the Av & Tv modes) may be overkill. Sometimes I think that it is easier to use the M setting. I can see that if you are shooting a lot of images in succession of action or a lot of depth of field control, it might be appropriate for some users to use these camera settings.The optional battery grip BG2 is an important option for serious photographers to consider.

It doesn't hurt that my girlfriend is beautiful. So, with only basic point & shoot experience under my belt, I started reading up on photography techniques and looked for a camera. Being the novice as I was, I was only looking at Canon and Nikon. Fortunately, a photographer friend of mine recommended the K10D by Pentax, a very experienced camera maker that doesn't have the marketing dollars of Canon or Nikon, and I was simply floored. On paper, it looks great, especially given the price. You're getting higher end features like shake reduction and weatherproofing for introductory DSLR prices. Shake reduction featured in the body is particularly valuable, as it applies to all your lenses and thus reduces the price you have to pay for them.I went to a camera shop to compare the cameras, as my friend told me it's also important to see how the cameras feel in your hands. While the K10D is definitely heavier than the Canon Rebel XTi, I found that the extra weight was actually reassuring; it doesn't feel like a toy. I also like the way the controls were laid out on the back, and the dual dials plus extra exposure modes together with the green button really make things a snap.The only cons: ISO performance beyond 800 could be better, and some people may like having dedicated buttons for ISO and WB, though the new firmware makes selecting ISO a lot faster. Oh, and you might find yourself spending a lot of time taking lots and lots of pictures...If you're serious about having better control over your pictures and getting great image quality without breaking the bank, go for the K10D.

I've used several(most) DSLR brands, and I would be hard pressed to pick out one over the other image quality wise.  Lens wise, I've use several moderate to low-end zoom lenses, and again, which maker has the image quality is kind of a toss-up.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone moving up to a digital SLR. I am age 81, so it`s never too late to move up the ladder.

It has numerous features that would be important to a serious photographer.  It may not be the best choice as thefirst move up from a point and shoot camera.  However, it appears to be the state-of-the-art for a 10 megapixel DSLR for those people desiring such a camera.  I was looking to move up from a two year old K-M A200 which I think is excellent in good light conditions.  I paid twice as much for the Pentax as I did for the A200 and the improvement in images does not justify the money.  However, my quality curve has flattened a lot, which is to say I willneed to work harder to improve my images significantly and I think the K10d can help me do that.  I understand that the next issue of Popular Photography will have a comparison of the K10d's rivals and would recommend anyone looking to buy such a camera to review the article carefully.  Except for the K10d's anti-shake, probably the Nikon D-80 would be hard to beat, on a tripod.  Do not expect a quantum leap in image quality from the serious cameras the level below the 10 megapixel DSLR's.The build quality appears to equal my friend's Nikon D-70, but the kit lens is not impressive.  I bought the extra handle/battery holder.  Whenattached with the Pentax flash, it is an impressive looking rig.  Probablybuying a new DSLR is like buying a new car, one can read all the specs andopinions, but nothing beats a test drive, because they are all pretty good.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "The new KING of DSLRs!", "Author": "Rico Laguna \"ricolaguna\"", "ReviewID": "R27MGYDFUZWGHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thats right folks...I've owned em all...the Canon XT, Nikon D70 and D50, the  Sony, Canon S3 IS,  ect.This camera has the ergonomics and features to appeal to the professional and prosumer photographer equally...plus it takes all the OLDER manual focus Pentax lenses as well!!The Shake Reduction feature is worth the price alone but the new shooting modes, the high dynamic range RAW files, the professional film look and feel give, and the great price push this camera over the edge and give it the advantage over all the competing DSLRs in it's range and even higher!....Welcome back Pentax!....what took yoa so long!?Now simply come out with a firmware upgrade/patch to fix some of the niggling issues such as the inferior Jpeg quality and the noise banding in high iso images", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pentax K10D with 18-55 lens", "Author": "Geert", "ReviewID": "RCHNMBACL9DHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product, with many goodies included.

I am a newbie (well, a prospective, researching newbie) and am doing my homework before I shell out the bucks for a decent DSLR as I've outgrown my Nikon Coolpix 8800. From what I can tell from my homework, the Pentax is a great camera -- ergo the distinguished awards it won in Europe and Japan for being the best camera of 2007 -- but has trouble in low-light situations with the auto-focus. This is important to me, since I do a lot of low-light shooting in jazz clubs. I need a camera that can handle those sorts of situations as well as one that can handle portraiture, landscapes and such. On that issue alone, I am leaning against this camera and toward the Nikon D80 or D200. The Canon 30D would be great, but (and I know this isn't as important to some) it only has 8MP, which is what I have now. I want the ability to crop photos without losing too much data, so that camera is out of the running. In an ideal world, all these cameras would be 12MP, but the price for those are astronomical to me and I can't justify one of the costlier Canons. But to say, as this reviewer does -- without qualification -- that this camera is only good if you have Pentax legacy lenses is just not true and is misleading. I still don't understand (perhaps it's the time of night I am writing this) his explanation of why he said this, as there are, from what I can see, plenty of Pentax lenses. All of which is a pity since all the lenses in the world can't make up for a camera that can't supremely handle low-light situations.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pentax K10D problem", "Author": "C.
