{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Corey Scott", "ReviewID": "R1YW72U8PKKJE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought a Sony DSC-S950, for around half the price of this camera, but I returned it the same day due to a faulty flash bulb.  I decided to upgrade to the W290, because I wasn't very happy with the S950 - it felt cheap, and lacked features.I've put together this list of pros and cons of this camera.  Don't let the seemingly long list of cons scare you though, as they are all quite minor and not even important enough for me to rate this camera anything less than 5 stars.  I just felt it was necessary to list everything I could think of.  Sorry, I couldn't properly review the HD Video capability, because I don't have the HD cables (see below), and my computer seems to be too slow to properly play back HD video.Pros:-BRILLIANT colors!  I am very very impressed with the colors in my shots, especially when shooting outdoor scenery shots (which is primarily what I purchased this camera for).-Night-time shots using a tripod turn out very well also, giving as much detail as one could see with their naked eye.-Smile shutter, as mentioned in previous reviews, works flawlessly.  One thing that doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere, is that when it's in Smile Shutter mode, it will continue to snap photos automatically as long as it keeps detecting smiles, which is very cool.  So if you are taking a group picture, and you're one of those people that likes taking 3 shots of the same thing \"just in case\", just keep on smiling and the camera will take care of that for you.-there's a 3-shot burst mode, where it automatically takes 3 pictures when you click the button: one with your default EV, one at -1EV, and one at +1EV (or different intervals even, if you choose).  That once-in-a-lifetime shot you take will have 3 different versions automatically, and you can choose the one you like the most and delete the rest later.-The Intelligent Auto mode works fantastically, it takes a lot of the stress out of taken urgent pictures.  The only time I ever don't use it is when I have plenty of time to plan for a shot.-Startup time is great!  I've seen other complaints from people that say this camera takes too long to startup and be ready to use, but those people must be the most impatient people ever, because this thing is faster than any other camera I've owned, digital or otherwise.  When you click the power button, the lens fires out lightning fast and the screen immediately displays the picture and is ready for action.  Probably takes about 0.5 seconds from pushing the button to being ready to use.Cons:-Plastic cover on LCD screen protrudes from the camera body, making it more easily scratched.  I would recommend getting some screen protectors, as I'm about to do.-the jack for the all-in-one cable is on the bottom of the camera, which will be great once a dock is available, but in the meantime it's a very inconvenient place to plug in the cable.  It forces you to lay to camera on either the lens side, or the LCD side (which, as mentioned above, is designed in such a way that it could be scratched quite easily without a screen protector)-Doesn't come with HD video cables, only the typical yellow/red/white RCA analogue cables.  Seeing as how this camera records HD video, it would be nice to be able to play it back in HD on my tv without burning it to a DVD first.  You can buy the HD cables from sony if you really need them, though.-Comes with an NP-BG1 battery, which disables the camera's ability to show you the remaining minutes.  You have to buy the optional NP-FG1 battery to see that.  That's the only difference, both batteries have the same capacity.  It was obviously designed that way to force us to buy a second battery... but that was fine with me, since I planned on buying one anyways.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great quality point-and-shoot digital camera!", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Comparing the Sony DSC-W290 to the Canon SX110IS.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1AQIETEGRJH5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "NOTE: IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT, SEE WARNING BELOW!My wife and I are planning a long vacation trip and needed a compact, but versatile, alternative to a full blown DSLR. I've owned this little camera for just 20 hours, but can offer some first impressions. We bought a Canon SX110IS at Christmas for our daughter. Compared to the jewel-like Sony, the Canon's build quality seems substantially less. However, it has a 10X optical zoom compared to Sony's 5x, but 9 mega pixel resolution compared to 12.1 on the Sony. I doubt that the image quality difference will be notable, but I will update this when I can make a valid comparison.One of the main reasons I picked the Sony over the Canon is that it is truly compact. While the Canon is small, the Sony is flat - less than 1\" thick - and hardly shows in a pocket (although I have ordered a case). Comparatively speaking, its LCD screen is huge and bright (but does not swivel like some Canons). BTW, neither camera has a viewfinder, so I am not confident that either will be easy to see in bright sunlight.This model does NOT employ a touch screen (which I did not value), but the controls (though small) are simple and generally intuitive once you learn Sony's ops language (different from Canon's). I will admit, if you happen to be a bit ham-fisted, you may not be willing to struggle with such tiny controls which are suited more to a child's hand than an adults. Also, because they are so small, the two adjustable dials are hard to read - not so handy when your eyes start to fail as are mine.The special features (many on this camera) all seem like they may be useful, but the \"smile\" feature seems a bit useless to me. The facial recognition works great - even when I pointed it at a TV image. It takes longer than I am used to to auto focus (I normally shoot with a Canon full frame 5D that uses focus motors in the lenses - hardly a fair comparison).Also, if you plan to use this camera to record full 12.1 mega pixel images, you will have to buy plenty of Memory Stick storage, although it will shoot at much lower resolutions, it has limited internal memory. I bought two 16GB Sony brand Pro Duo sticks on eBay for $21 each to be able to do so. BTW, that is much cheaper than Amazon, say. Also, since this camera shoots HD (720P) video in MPEG4 format - one of the features I plan to exploit - you'll want plenty of extra storage anyhow.I'll have to reserve my opinions on picture quality until I can do a real world test, but the images I shot indoors with the built-in flash were crisp and noiseless at 12.1 mega pixels, less so, of course as I tried lower resolutions.And did I mention that the Sony's \"anodized\" blue finish trimmed in \"black chrome\" is elegant and stunning?WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!Shortly after writing this review, I decided to double-check my \"cheap\" memory purchase. What I found was disturbing. It is very likely that the Pro Duo memory sticks I bought on eBay are FAKES! I'm telling you this so you won't make the same mistake I probably did (my Memory Sticks have not yet been delivered). If you will check out this eBay link BEFORE you buy memory for your new camera (or other Sony device), you may be able to save yourself a lot of trouble (and $$$).[...]Like they say, \"If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is\". I know better, and now, so do you. I will confirm the results after I have had a chance to try them out. Incidentally, just shot some outside images of our flowering crabapple blossoms. Pictures look great and I could see the LCD in \"cloudy bright\" afternoon sunlight.4-28-09As promised, an update. The Memory Sticks from Hong Kong did indeed turn out to be bogus. They look exactly like Sony products, including the very detailed packaging, but they simply didn't work. The Sandisk Ultra 4GB version I bought at Staples works great, even when recording \"HD fine\" video. Playback looks beautiful (considering the source) on the computer, but not nearly as sharp on an HDTV when using the composite cable that came with the camera. I now have no qualms about substituting this for my miniDV camcorder on the next trip, however.The \"smile\" function actually works, but I could live without it. The camera makes it really difficult to mess up exposure. I've even tried fooling it with extremely harsh back lighting and it still exposed faces properly. 12.1GB images are not as sharp as I'd like when I carefully examine the detail, and there is some noise present. Keep in mind, however, that I typically shoot with a Canon full frame DSLR. I will, however, compare it to a Nikon Coolpix I used a couple of years ago. The Nikon was substantially sharper in similar situations. If the ultimate picture quality is high on your priority list, look at the comparably priced Nikons and Canons. For the features I wanted, this Sony remains the best choice for me. Finally, Sony make two affordable underwater housings for this camera. One for snorkeling and one for diving.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera with some set backs", "Author": "BOGY.", "ReviewID": "R1DLTGJK8O7XX3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera does take great pictures.  These days the cameras are very easy to operate with all of the auto settings and advanced face detection and scene recognition - it's hard to mess up a shot.  This camera is no exception and makes the user feel like a pro when taking pictures.  However, here are some things to think about when buying this camera:1) The controls are on the right rear side of the camera.  In particular the W/T buttons and the directional pad/button - the W button is hard to press and the left side of the dpad as well.  For some reason they are right up against the right side of the 3\" screen which causes a problem and you have to either reposition your finger or use your nail to press the buttons I mentioned.  No, I don't have large fingers - it is just a design flaw.  The buttons are set below the screen - if they were raised there would not be a problem. If you really want to see what I mean look at the pictures here on Amazon and zoom in on the back panel picture. Something I never noticed before but the directional button even has a part of the 3\" LCD frame cut out because it is so close to the button.  See for yourself....2) The video is crisp and clear (720p) but you CAN NOT ZOOM while shooting video.  Compared to the T500, T700, T900, T90 ect where you can zoom when recording video. Very disappointing and if someone here mentioned that in their review I wouldn't have bought the camera - I bet people here don't even own the damn thing.  The steady shot works well too by the way.3) There is a rattle when you shake the camera.  This is apparent only when the camera is turned on so I think it is the lens cover(s) which retract and automatically opens and closes when you turn the camera on.  The lens protector is very fragile and when closed you can push it open with your finger unlike the DSC-N1 that I had which was like solid doors covering the lens.4) This thing is BIG!  OK it's not huge but compared to the W300 It's thick. I know, it has a 3.0\" screen compared to a 2.7\" screen but it is heavier and thicker than the W300 and the T series but I want to compare apples to apples.5) Switching from menus and functions is a bit slow.  There is definitely a processing delay with video and some pictures that I took too. I wouldn't begin to throw a number out there (seconds) but it is definitely slower than the W300 for good comparison.  Turning the camera on - slight lag - lens pops out - it's just a lot slower than the N1 and W300.6) There is NO docking cradle, memory or a case provided with the camera. I like the new battery charger which does not have a power cord but has plugs that flip out so you just plug it into an outlet and walk away - when the indicator light is off you are done charging - really good idea!7) You need two hands to operate this camera.  With the W300 you can work the zoom and shutter button with your right had with ease.  Not so with the W290.  Watch that left hand too!  The RF illumination is located right where you might put your left forefinger.  Careful.8) The shutter button is on top of the camera along with the power button and a new SMILE button.  The smile button will automatically engage the smile detector and will snap a shot automatically when activated.  Very cool.  However, the button, along with the power button is so small and inset that you really have to wonder if you are pressing it or not.  You do feel a click I should say so it isn't that bad I guess.Canon - who's that?  I don't use their products - Sony only baby.  This is a great camera but could be better.  Like the T700 the T900 came out and fixed a lot of issues.  The W300 is a better camera than the W290.  I am sure they will come out with a W400?  It will be great I am sure!  Get this W290 camera for the price and basic functions as a starter camera.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "J.

My Canon 710 was much better.  Anyways, thought I would try this new Sony 290.  I am pretty impressed.  The few photos I have taken, indoor and outdoor, have been really good. The colors and clarity are nice.  Low light were consistently still (not blurred).  The 880is blurred in the low light occasionally.  The face and smile recognition works very well.I never write reviews but after all the slamming Sony gets, as far as point and shoot cameras, I felt that this camera is as good or better than the Canon 880is and Im the first to defend Canon.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sharp", "Author": "R Lovan \"mrfollicle\"", "ReviewID": "RTGEI0R4NQIP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "+This camera takes amazing pictures. Sharp, vivid, crisp, (insert synonyms here).+Having such a high resolution is nice and the wide angle lens is great. It also has a little extra zoom than other point-and-shoots, which is another great feature. The smile detection feature is fun for about 30 minutes, but ultimately useless. (At least to me....)+It has tons of little features and settings and even allows for some \"editing\" on the camera like red-eye removal and such.-I do wish i could mess with the settings a bit more though. I like to be able to manually set the exposure time and mess with other things as well. These are unaccessible to the user. Regardless, it takes great pictures without me fiddling with things, so perhaps it is best. Though I do wish it had a long exposure setting to take some cool lightning shots or mess with light graffiti, but I think I'll live.-Also, you can't zoom while shooting video. This is a bit of a frustration as well.+The camera itself is amazingly small for it's high resolution and hi-def video capabilities.+Its construction is solid and the black looks pretty slick.+Great \"bang for the buck\" camera. Simple enough for the family or girlfriend to use, and enough features and good enough quality for some more creative shots of my own.

While European prices are consistently about 25% higher than in the US I went ahead and bought the unit. I have had three prior versions of the Cyber-shot and have found them to be sturdy, reliable and easy to use. The DSC 290 with its 12.1 MP clarity really is first rate. I have now started leaving my Cannon SLR and my Cannon Video Cam at home. I get all the still picture quality one needs plus the movie resolution is considerably higher than most competitors at any price. I was starting to look for a HD Movie cam but decided that the near HD quality of the movies produced by the DSC 290 are more than I could have imagined and instead spent a fraction of the cost of a new camera on 16G Memory Sticks to hand my movies. I like the camera so much I ordered two more on Amazon today to be shipped in the US for graduation gifts.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, fantastic photos", "Author": "Wat", "ReviewID": "R1L0NZUT3V37JV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned the Sony T500 because our family needs a camera that can take HD video, but also great photos in one package. I recently upgraded my personal camera and was going to hand down the T500 to my wife, but she did not like the all touchscreen controls. She prefers physical dials and buttons. So I sold off that camera and went in search of one with similar or better features that would be easy to use.I ended up going with the W290 and it easily surpasses the T500 in photo quality. Right out of the box she was taking great photos on the auto setting. Low light shooting is problematic for all point and shoots, but the W290 did much better than I expected, just don't expect miracles. The 3 inch screen is gorgeous. I don't think I could ever go back to the 2.7 screens anymore.The W290 is also priced well. It does cost more than a Flip HD or those other pocket HD camers, but purely from a video standpoint it's far superior. From the much larger lense to the bigger screen, there is no comparison. Then you add the full features of a quality camera and it's a no brainer. She's very happy with it.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "T. Dobmeyer", "ReviewID": "R3OKDJN1A8SN5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works great! I have only had it a week but it is great. The smile detection works pretty well. I noticed subjects that wore hats had troubles with their smiles being detected, possibly due to extra shading from the bill of the hat, but for my one-year-old daughter, it took almost 10 pictures in 30-45 seconds automatically while she was having a laughing fit. A lot quicker than I could do. I also like how the portrait mode takes 2 pictures to try and get one without eyes blinking, and if it detected a blink, it alerts you to that. The HD video shoots pretty smoothly. I haven't gotten a chance to check out what it looks like on TV, but it shot well. I was worried about being able to keep this steady when taking pictures, but I do better with this camera than I did our old Canon Powershot A530 (it was taking upwards of 5 minutes to charge the flash for one picture with brand new batteries!...thus being the purchase of a new camera).It takes a couple seconds for the camera to turn on, so if you think you may have a shot to quickly take, be prepared and turn the camera on early. Also, I am nervous about the rechargeable battery versus just dropping in new AAs. It seems like the battery takes a little too long to charge fully, but so far I have just charged it while sleeping.Overall I am extremely satisifed with this camera. I mainly need a camera to capture my daughter's memories and will mostly send them out over e-mail and print out 4x6 images for my wife's scrapbook. This camera is giving me hope it will take pictures well. The picture quality looks great and it seems slightly faster than my old Canon for taking successive pictures.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot", "Author": "M. Cuellar", "ReviewID": "R1JAAE4FLTK1ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera back in March.  I had originally wanted a pocket hd video camera like the Flip Mino HD or the Creative Vado HD.  After comparing prices between the different cameras I decided my best route would be to purchase a point and shoot camera which could also handle 720p video.  Then Canon and Sony released two point and shoots which did just that.I compared the Canon Powershot SD780IS to the Sony W290.  The canon was more compact than the Sony.  Both recorded 720p video. Both are 12.1 megapixel cameras. The Canon has a 3x optical zoom while the Sony offers 5x.  The Sony has the 3 inch lcd while the Canon only has a 2.5 inch.  And finally the Canon retailed for about $30 more than the Sony.  I picked the Sony since it was a little less expensive and I liked the fact that it had the larger lcd and zoom.My wife and I took it on vacation with us to the beach in April and I was able to use this camera to take many pictures and a few hd videos.  I was very happy with the quality of the stills.  Not being a pro photographer, the images looked very sharp and detailed to me.  The HD video was excellent as well.  I wanted the video ability so that I could record video that would be uploaded to sharing sites like youtube and facebook.  So watching it on a hi def television wasn't that important.  It looks great on a computer monitor.The one drawback is that you have to buy sony memory.  The camera doesn't use SD cards like most other point and shoots.  But I was able to buy a 4gb memory stick card for about $15 so it wasn't too big a deal.  A 4gb card can hold many hundreds of photos and several hd video clips.After 3 months of owning this camera I can say I've been very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wanted to love this camera, but...", "Author": "D. Harrison", "ReviewID": "R22SKLTPSADHX7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "...there were so many things I didn't like about it, I finally exchanged it for the Cybershot DSC-H20, which for me is, soooo much better! Back to the W290. On the positive side, I liked it's looks (???) and the burst feature is great. The features are also easy to use. But for me it just didn't take GOOD PICTURES! I shoot mostly candid shots of ppl and this camera was a real letdown. First off, the shutter button is flush with the top of the camera so it's difficult to press down, half way to focus and fully to shoot. Secondly, the focus (or lack therof) is terrible. The camera took forever to find a focal point, then the pix still wouldn't be sharp. And the pixel noise was over the top. I never felt like i was in control of this camera...it seemed to have a mind of its own! Thirdly, the 12MP is too much for this camera to handle, it didn't seem to know what to do with all those pixels. The file size made for slow loading  onto the computer. BTW, the software is not compatible with Mac, although my Kodak Easy Share software recognised the memory stick and had no trouble connecting the device. So after a 2 wk commitment, I had to let it go. I've had the DSC-H20 for less than a day and there's a huge improvement in image quality, features and ease of use.

It turns on quickly, processes pictures rapidly, and charges the flash faster than any camera I've used before.In terms of picture quality, I am simply astonished.  I have 2 35mm SLR cameras that I use when I want to be artistic and tend to be pretty particular about images.  What surprises me the most about this camera is that the intelligent picture settings is phenomenal.  I have taken photographs directly into sunlight, sunsets, dark rooms, fluorescent lighting, outside, etc and the camera's ability to quickly and properly adjust the ISO, aperture, speed, etc to create a wonderful picture is unparalleled.  I actually think it's the first camera to adjust the settings for the environment even better than I would manually do myself by overriding the settings.  In fact, I love leaving it on auto almost all the time now, taking a picture without worrying about anything at all, and then pleasant admiring how good the picture came out.  Steady shot works well.  Focus is terrific.  And, the LCD on the back of the camera is enormous given the camera's small form.If there is one complaint, red-eye subject notification could be set up better.  While red eye reduction works great itself, the camera pre-flash is very similar to the actual photograph's flash and confuses subjects in the picture into thinking that I've already taken the photo, whereby the start to look away.  I'm trying to get into the habit of telling them that the flash may shine 'twice' so as to get them to stay still.  However, since the red eye reduction is automatic, it doesn't always come on, which adds more confusion.  I like the blinking flash that cameras I've used in the past had a bit more.But, that said, I'm really happy with the quality of the photos and the user interface of the camera.  Again, it's the best compact I've owned and I really think one can't do wrong using it.

I received it two days before I left on a cruise, so I got to test it out on my vacation.The shooting modes are plentiful. I always had one that would best suite the shooting conditions, even one for food! I loved being able to take pictures in settings that would normally require a flash but the W290 didn't need the additional light. I was taking pictures of the stage performances and not breaking the \"no flash pictures\" rule. The ability to \"stabilize\" photos is great. It even works well in pictures without flash. I am notorious for ruining photos taken indoors due to shaky hands, but this camera overcomes that.The video recording is clear and looks great when played back. I was able to put together a great movie of my trip and didn't need to bring a digital camera AND a camcorder. The software used to download your shots and video from the camera to a PC works well.The battery lasted quite awhile. I got 4 days of taking pictures and video before I needed to recharge. I did purchase an extra battery after my trip so I can always have one fully charged. The new battery I bought off the Sony Style web site also has the ability to show you how much use time is left on it. I haven't used that one yet but will post when I do with the amount of time it says it will last.There are only three things I found that are minuses on this camera:* You can't zoom in or out when using video - the shot is fixed until you stop recording. If a newer model comes out with this ability I would seriously consider upgrading.* The button for snapping photos and starting/stopping video recording could have been raised a little more to make it easier to find by touch. A few times I find myself pressing what I think is the photo button but nothing is happening because my finger is not on the button.* On a few of the videos there's a section of black \"corruption\" that pops up in the corner of a video. Out of the approx 30 videos I took, this happened on 3 of them. It's only there for a few frames but is noticeable. I haven't seen mention of this in any other reviews yet so it may be an issue with my camera.I might have dropped my review to 4 stars because of the video glitch that happens except that it may not be inherent with the model. I am also upgrading from an old Nikon CoolPix 990 (the one with the swivel body) that is cranky and doesn't like to focus when you try and take a picture - The difference in shooting pictures is night and day between them.

The LED screen smudges very easily, and the selection buttons on the back are very small but manageable.  I think 4 stars is a very good rating and I probably would not find another similar product worthy of more than that.  I like the fact that there is a video feature, but that is not important to me, so I don't care that there is no zoom feature while recording.  Would be nice, but....I am writing about the still-photo features.Since my teal blue Sony Cybershot W290 arrived only 2 days ago, I am giving a review of my short-term experience with my first point-and-shoot digital camera.  I do have decades of amateur experience with photography using several SLR models, so I appreciate the sophistication of the many advanced features which are simplified for the user in this model.  Effects that used to take lots of study, practice and skill are now manageable right out of the box.  I am far more impressed than I had ever expected to be.  I think that this product is an exceptional value for the money.  I did a lot of research~~before and since making my selection~~and in that process I've made some observations that might be worth sharing with those folks who are trying to decide on a purchase.First, I noticed after repeated visits to this site that there seem to be more reviews and a higher dissatisfaction rate here depending upon the color of the Sony W290 camera body.  I don't know what that might suggest, but it is of interest to me.  I point it out because initially I did not realize that the reviews are organized by the specific details listed in the product description.  I have read all the reviews on all available colors of the Sony W290. Very few of the reviews are duplicated, so there are actually many more total reviews~~and what appears to be a much higher satisfaction rate overall~~if you add all Sony W290 reviews together and take a percentage of that total for each of the criteria evaluated.Second, it seems unreasonable to me that such wide variation in satisfaction with picture sharpness and indoor lighting can be a result of production quality control.  If that were the case, Sony would have been driven out of business long ago.  I've read many comments on \"soft edges\" and clarity \"only in the central focus\" which are normal characteristics of a short \"depth of field.\"  If all long distance photos have \"soft\" or blurry edges, that may indicate a faulty lens.  Otherwise, that softness is more likely related to the mode/setup the user selected.  And I took hundreds of indoor shots with no difficulty at all.Third, I've seen no difference between the LED image and my high-resolution computer screen after directly uploading with the USB cable.  I use a Mac with OS 10.4, which can't use the PMB image software on the CD.  It seems to me that the PMB program could account for image discrepancies many have described.  I had a few pics printed at Costco today to check for consistency, with no problems to report.Fourth, while I have lots of experience at steadying shots on my SLRs, I noticed immediately that the shutter release button requires more pressure than I prefer, probably to avoid inadvertent picture taking in your pocket, given the portability, as others have mentioned.  At least the \"steady shot\" and the 2-second self-timer (using tripod or other support, like roof of car, etc.) features can improve some of those situations, unless there is motion in the subject.  But I anticipate that this will be an adjustment.  Personally, I am willing to work at that until I have the technique down~~as a tradeoff for all the fabulous features in the total package.  (UPDATE:  I am not noticing this tough shutter release any longer; I may have adjusted to it!)Fifth, the charger that came with the camera charged the battery in 90 minutes rather than the 5 1/2 hours stated in the manual; but I followed the suggestion in the manual to leave it charging for an additional 60 minutes to get a \"full\" charge.  I have taken hundreds of shots using the flash and in various higher resolutions, deleted lots of pics and uploaded about 50 shots to my computer, and the battery seems to have about 1/4 of the life left.  (UPDATE:  The battery does not last very long, especially when shooting at higher resolution.  I recently had to change what had been a fully charged battery after about 100 outdoor shots, set at 8x10 resolution.)Sixth, I bought some accessories that are probably a very good idea (suggestions I took from others in earlier reviews):  an NP-FG1 extra battery, two 4GB Sony Mark II Pro Duo memory sticks (not eBay knockoffs), an LED anti-glare protection film, and a slim case.  I also bought some that are probably not at all necessary:  a travel charger pack which is supposed to charge much faster than the one that came with the camera but which actually charged in the same 90 min., and a media memory stick reader/writer because I didn't realize that the camera kit came with the USB cable to upload.  Since this item can write to the memory stick, it will probably come in handy down the road.  (UPDATE:  This item can not write to the stick as I had thought.)(UPDATE:  I carry this camera and the extra, charged battery and memory stick with me all the time due to the convenient size.  So I take more of those shots that I always missed before.  I am still amazed at the picture quality from this lens and all the tricks it can do without operator skills!!)Happy hunting and may you be at peace in your decision....(ADDENDUM:  It is August '10 now and I took some sunny backlit shots which the camera automatically corrected.  They came out great.  Also, I cropped and enlarged head shots out of larger photos and had them printed.  The quality was fine.  The camera had been set on 8x10 resolution.  Needless to say, I am very pleased once again!!)Rennie", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Faulty - returned for service after 2 months", "Author": "Amy A", "ReviewID": "R1XL21KS8UV13E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first two months with this camera was great.

During the trip I took about 512 pictures and a ton of HD video and was pretty impressed with how much of an improvement it was from my Sony DSC-W50 (6 MP camera).Highlights:* Great picture quality - especially for outdoor shots.* HD Video is really great when staying still- HOWEVER it gets really shaky if you try and move too quickly. (This is not a full blown HD camcorder replacement.) I took about 30 seconds of video atop Angels Landing in Zion Park and just slowly rotated 360 to capture the view. At home, my friends were stunned by the beauty of the park and the details the video captured.* HD video was easy to edit in both Movie Maker (I have a Vista Ultimate PC) and new Mac Book Pro. You will need a pretty speedy processor to edit large chunks of video as it really makes the computer work.* Picture modes are great - IF you are a point and shoot person. (Like me) A friend on the trip was a bit frustrated by the lack of fine tune options - he kept turning down my EV setting to make the sky look dark blue VS whitish blue.Lowlights:* I wish there was a mode to shoot fast action shots. (Maybe I haven't found it yet?) I had a few shots of bikers zipping by that just looked like blurs.* The huge display on the back seems to drain the battery.

The thing about this camera is that you have to change settings to get that good picture rather than keeping it on auto.  Some of the zoomed-in pics were a bit grainy as the other reviewer said but the PMB picture loading software that came with the camera fixed it and made it into a great picture.Another bad thing about the camera is that you have to hold it still to keep from getting a blurred image and it takes a sec or two for the flash to go off.  Not a big deal to me.I went to a baseball game and was taking pics with the Cybershot and the people sitting behind me (2 different couples) were gushing about the clear LCD screen and how clear the pics were at the 5x zoom.

The Electric Daisy Carnival really comes alive at night and I think I missed a few great photos because it is difficult to get great shots with this camera at night!- I occasionally encountered an error message asking me to turn the camera on then back off. Maybe the mode knob got shifted around too easily during the carnival.- No zoom during HD recording, but I didn't use the zoom that much anyway during video recording.- Lack of shutter- or aperture-priority modes is *extremely* frustrating, especially if you're accustomed to having more control.- Textured surface tends to collect dirt and debris and is not easily cleaned.BOTTOM LINE: If you want a simple point-and-shoot, then this camera more than fits the bill. It's sleek and stylish and takes very good quality pictures in broad daylight. It's also pretty fast, has a wide-angle lens, and is a good compromise between a high-end dSLR and a low-end cheap camera. Camera produced pictures with natural, true-to-life colors. Night time shots, however, require that the user tinker around a bit with the Program Mode, potentially causing the operator to miss a shot.

No option other than the 3in screen (which is beautiful) so no way to save power with an optical viewfinder.The absolute kiss of death for me is that the W290 took terrible indoor photos, about 1 out of 10 were usable.  I thought, well it doesn't do low light well.  So I took it on a field trip with my daughters Kindergarten class to a nature center on an absolutely beautiful clear day - same story, horrible pictures.  The W170, under identical conditions, produced 8 out of 10 usable photos.The HD videos are worthless without the HD cable that is not included.  They just plain won't play well on any of my computer based video players and I updated all their CODECs.So, stay away, far away and get a different Sony.  Sad, I really wanted to like this model.

The pictures are very grainy in low light or even medium light.  Almost every pic looks \"soft\" and even indoor pictures were very grainy or had auto-focused on background objects.  My previous camera did require settings to be changed manually but if the automatic features goof up the shot, what's the point of the technology?

Therefore, I reviewed and researched pocket size portable cameras that would give us some memorable shots on our trip to Kauai. There are so many biased reviews it seems on Amazon. Even for different colors of the same model DSCW290, so it was confusing to me, and I am an avid reviewer of things. So anyway, it is our 3rd day of vacation in Kauai and here is our take on this little camera. The Sony DSW-290 is about as thick as a deck of cards. Its zoom is about a 7 score on a scale of 1-10. However, I already knew that ahead of time. The pictures seemed like they were too far away when we were taking them, but when they were displayed on my computer they were fabulous and easy to see everything we were aiming to shoot. I am a shaker and all my pics normally come out blurry, I even shot some amazing photos with this camera. The battery life- lasted about 100 shots and it was toast; so you have to consider the cost of a spare if you plan to shoot a lot (approx $29). Overall, the pictures were just wonderful but hey it's KAUAI! I will post one if I can. I give this camera of 5 rating because you can't have everything perfect for the price range in which we purchased this camera. I love this little camera and I am happy we got it.

This camera isn't good value for the money.  It's $200+ of disappointment.I took some indoor shots...wow...unbelievably awful.  Unless you're taking indoor photos in a room lit with insanely bright light, then expect to get tons of noise in your photos.  I could hardly salvage any photos that could be printed above 5x7 because the noise is so bad.  Tried to take photos during a special occasion dinner in a restaurant (restaurant was somewhat dimly lit as most are) and ALL BUT THREE of my photos were blurry and filled with noise (and I took 25 photos!!).  I'm leaving for vacation in two weeks and have returned this camera for a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3.  Yeah, it's $90 more, but I think that's more than worth it to correct the Sony's horrible indoor picture quality--plus the DMC-ZS3 adds a TON of extra features (and 12x zoom).  EVERY image taken with the DSC-W290 is grainy.  Will it be fine for 4x6 and 5x7 images?  Sure.  If you want anything bigger than that, or expect to crop and zoom out of full-size images, then forget it.  This camera takes the softest photos I've seen in its class.  It's just a major disappointment on every level.Spend another $75-$100 and get a camera with great image quality.

I have 3 Sony digitals and each one was 'ahead of it's time' technically.  This one is no different.  I'm not a photo affecionado but know good pictures when I see them.  I opted for small size to throw in my front pants pocket rather than a bulky larger more powerful camera.  But I too was surprised.  This is one powerful camera!Every feature of this camera is AWESOME.  The high resolution allows photo editing to crop and enlarge great pictures.  The BURST mode allows for fast action multiple pix.  The stabilization software appears to work great, almost completely eliminating the unstable 'hand'.  The HD video movie mode is wonderful but even though the stabilization software is great be careful when 'zoomed in' and taking video.  It will shake!  Better than no stabilization BUT...it will shake.All of the cons reported by others are true...but probably for a reason.  The small buttons keep you from turning it on/off or taking pixs while it's in the pocket along other small items like keys etc.  Smile detection is for babies and kids and works very well.  You need 4-5 feet focal point minimum for it to work but it does and pretty well.  Those that think it's useless never took pix of kids before.The colors are brilliant!  We went to Alaska and I took over 1500 pix and movies.  Alaska offers a full range of overcast, cloudy and sunny full light days.  The little W290 did well.  I bought an 8G and 4G strip and used up about 20 g or more...but transferred it to a laptop to keep it managable.  I never even pulled the 4G strip out!  BTW...the 4G strip was only $12 on Amazon.  Imagine a roll of film holding 350 shots reusable for $12!  The HD video mode allows for 30 min/2G of memory.To me a 4 STAR is perfect.  Nothing probably deserves a 5 STAR so that's why I gave it a 4.  It is a well engineered, well thought out highly technical camera but EASY to use.  You don't need to even hardly read the manual.

I have had many digital cams over the years and am very experienced with them.  Most people would be satisfied with this camera. The reason I only gave a 3 out of 5 is as follows.  I went to a concert, and when it started to get dusk the pics started having a hard time focusing. When it was dark it was terrible.  Even from the lights of the stage, I hardly got any pics after the sun went down. I thought with the iscn and iAuto mode that the low lighting or stage lights wouldn't be an issue. I took some video and instantly became annoyed with the inability to zoom in and out while the video was recording. Once I started recording I noticed that the battery life was instantly drained. I was thankful that I had brought my other sony batteries with me.  I didnt get close to 5 mins of video out of the 3 batteries I had with me.  very disappointing.

I have a film SLR, a DSLR, even a medium format camera - after all, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Photography. So, I did a little research and finally decided to get this camera to add to my collection. My main reason was portability and if you're looking for an easy camera to slip in your pocket on purse, this will fit rather well.In terms of photo quality, I've found that outside daylit photos are beautiful, crisp, with near-perfect color. One feature this camera does not have that many other portable digicams have is adjusting camera based on a light source, say fluorescent lighting. Inside photos will definitely need some editing on the computer. In addition, if you don't use the flash indoors, the photos will be grainy because for some reason, the camera says you're shooting at nighttime.One feature this camera does have is smile detection. Now, you might dismiss this feature as a gimmick, but I've found it to be quite useful. For example, I wanted a friend of mine to take a photo of my husband and I. So, I just turned on smile detection and said, \"Point the camera at us. You don't have to press any buttons. Just point it at us and the camera will take the picture.\" We smiled and the camera took the photo. It's pretty good at detecting smiles (and you can set its sensitivity) though sometimes you have to smile like The Joker to get it to register at close range.All in all, it's an easy to use portable digital camera with great photos (depending on the situation) and some interesting features.

Soft! Soft!  In bright sunlight the 12.1 megapixel DSC-W290 with its wide-angle zoom lens does reasonably well,  The 'Steadyshot' feature helps at max zoom.  The 28mm equivalent end of the lens travel produces some nice panoramic shots.  The color rendition has the usual pleasing Sony balance.  HOWEVER, bring it indoors and it doesn't perform anywhere near as well as my old 5.1 megapixel Sony DSC-P93A. All settings of automatic and manual focus, with and without flash, produce very soft, dark images.  Using the DSC-W290 and the DSC-P93A side by side, I took about a hundred exposures at a recent child's birthday party.  The 5.l megapixel P93A produced excellent, sharp pictures of fast-moving four-year-olds. I had only 5 out of fifty-seven images to delete.  Fifteen of the images were notably good.  The W290 produced only 2 images out of forty worth saving.My conclusion: don't buy a camera on the basis of its pixel count.  Lens quality is more important, and so is the processing software.  In my weeks of using the W290, I found only two advantages over the old P93A.  One is the excellent battery life. Pack two spares and you could tour the world if you exploited the second advantage, the ability of the W290 to use multigigabit memory sticks.  The P93A only recognizes 1 gigabit of memory.  Video performance of the W290 was good indoors and out, but I have a Canon videocamera so I didn't give that feature much weight.  If you already have a pretty good digicam, don't buy the Sony DSC-W290 or any other of the new 12.1 MP and up cameras unless you can try it out first.  You might be surprised to find that where it counts, that is, in the quality of the pictures you get, your old one does as well or better.I'll keep the W290 as a handy outdoor image collector; its small size and good battery life are enough to prevent me from leaving it on my dashboard for someone to steal so I can collect the insurance.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cyber-shot DSC-W290 is great!", "Author": "Tampa \"T\"", "ReviewID": "R9TXIDBBVGQO6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched many cameras before I finally selected this one.

I've taken nearly 500 photos already, and just can't believe the brilliant color of the photos from this Sony camera! The build quality of this Sony camera is top-notch, it's so well built and just out right rock solid! I've sold three poeple on this camera already. They were so impressed, they just had to buy one for themselves! I don't at all understand some of the negative reviews! I think some people just don't know how to use it. Which is hard to believe, because it's so simple to use. If you're looking for a great point and shoot camera that's a terrific value for the price! Do yourself a favor and buy the Sony CyberShot DSC-W290! It's the BEST!!!", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Thomas W.

I really hate that even at high ISO too.With manual mode I just set shutter to 1/125 seconds and turn on flash then I can take razor sharp not out of focus of people are dancing in a club or party.Sony must improve this camera by creating another mode like \"High shutter\", \"Dance Club\", or \"Moving subjects\"...or adding the manual mode for this camera.Since Sony has built in shake free features, It is good for keep the camera steady when taking picture with bear hand without tripod, but it is useless for taking moving subjects at low light.Other features are great love the quality and HD movie.I guess I have to wait for a Sony W350 if sony has later...", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "SN", "ReviewID": "R5AEXEN2KC0ME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I think I'd rate myself as a pretty average camera user.

The pictures we took outdoors on a cloudy day didn't turn out well.  It seemed like the camera kept focusing on objects in the background instead of the background.  When we used pictures using the zoom, the pictures were grainy.  Most frustrating was that when I took pictures indoors, the pictures were really grainy, and the focus just couldn't get very sharp.  One requirement for this camera was that it take pictures indoors in low light--and it couldn't at all.  I don't know if this is a problem with this particular camera, but anything we took a picture of that had a lot of white in it (like white tents) there was this weird halo/cloudy effect.

We traveled with friends, who had just bought this very same Cyber-Shot. Nearly all of their DSC-W290 shots and HD video came out awesome. The shots I took with my 5.0 megapixel couldn't compare. After my return from Disney and seeing the potential for this camera, I immediately ordered the DSC-W290 from Amazon for my very own.The \"first\" DSC-W290 arrived from Amazon with some problems. All my lighter-scene shots had a small cloudy spot, about the size of an eraser head in the upper left corner. It was in the same place every time. The cloudy spot appeared in actual printed photos and on the LCD display. I called Sony because the sticker on the box said to call them (not the retailer) if there are any problems. Sony's solution was for me to send in this week-old-camera for repair. Not happening. I then contacted Amazon via their automated return/exchange process. Oh man, how smooth this process was. It took me all of 3 minutes to complete Amazon's on-line exhange form and wham, a replacement camera was in my hands 48 hours later. I then sent the defective one back to them using the retun label Amazon provided me. I applaud Amazon for making this potentally bad situation a non-issue. Bravo Amazon!The replacement camera was put to use almost immediately. I took munerous still and action shots during the recent December 09' blizzard the blanketed the DC area. In a word, phenominal. I took multiple shots of the same scene, varying just the scene setting from \"easy\" to pre-set \"snow\" backgroud. Both shots - incredible. Holiday shots were equally as nice. The camera compensates nicely for indoor low light. The only shot I struggle with is nightime shots that have movement (i.e. parade). Oddly enough, nightime HD video comes out great with no special adjustment. Go figure.Fit and finish is seemed better than other comparably priced cameras I looked at. As for battery life, have a spare on-hand (although I do take a lot of shots so it's probably me).Again, a major kudo's to Amazon for their customer service process.

I paid less and got more, feature-wise than my brother's carmera. Pros: easy manual zoom ability; macro setting (X 1.2); built in lens protection (retractible); manual override for flash, mode et al; great auto-focus feature. Cons: Memory stick not included ($35 to $60 extra cost), somewhat over-simplified explanation of features in the manual, short battery life, protective case not included ( more $).This is my first digital camera. Overall I am very pleased. Although it seemed to have a short battery life on the rechargeable, I do not have anything to compare it to. I am going to look for an auto charger.

This helps to really bring out the appropriate colors underwater, and produces stunning images and movies. All the underwater movies (720p) look absolutely amazing and crisp on a HD TV set (40 inch).This camera also has a setting for the \"intelligent\" detection of scenery and lighting. This setting seems to work quite well in detecting landscape or macro mode, or settings for underwater.With a 16GB Memory Stick PRO Duo there is plenty of space for tons of pictures and movies.The Bad:Somehow with all the latest and greatest technology on board, this camera will not allow you to zoom while shooting a movie. This is really too bad, as sometimes it is nice to go from an overview shot into more of a close-up.In all fairness; shooting a movie underwater does not really lend itself to zooming, as there is invariably some difficulty in holding the camera still.Also; this camera uses the Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo, and with SD cards becoming more of the norm, it seems silly for Sony to keep on peddling their own media.The Ugly:While this is a great camera (and underwater housing combo) for what I needed it to do, the most annoying and frustrating drawback is the fact that the focus while shooting movies is extremely poor. I understand that is is difficult enough to focus on a moving object in water that is also moving, but even in great shots where there is only one large object (say a turtle) in the foreground, the focus continually drifts in and out. At first I thought it had to do with the variable light distorted and morphed by the waves above, but even on cloudy days there were the same focus problems. A dark subject on a light background, or the reverse; nothing seems to be good enough to hold focus all the way through, or even just for more than a couple of seconds. I have tried different focus / metering settings, all to no avail.Bottom line:In the end, and despite the frustrating focussing issue, this camera still gets four stars, as it has tons of useful features and it does produce amazing underwater footage and images.I have included a few still images captured with this camera, but the movies I have made with it are even more stunning.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Miss Foxy", "ReviewID": "R2CLBS8UJU2BYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really LOVE this camera!

I am a student, so I needed something cheap (When I bought, this camera costed me $228.46. Couldn't afford an SLR!), but yet something that would capture the beauty of Switzerland. I have made three Europe trips so far and I must say I don't regret buying this camera at all.2) It has got multiple settings for choosing image size, which means if I'm short on memory on the SD card, I don't need to delete photos. I just change the photo resolution. Of course, it will affect the quality, but at least I'm glad I have the option.3) The zoom is perfect not just for landscape images, but also on the macro setting. Of course, since it's not an SLR it doesn't have a wide-angle lens. But I generally just put it in the burst mode and capture the whole landscape in a panoramic fashion. It works for me!4) MOST LOVED FEATURE: I like the iAuto mode. It feels like it actually has a brain of it's own!! I am not a pro at photography, but by putting it in the Auto mode, the camera can capture dual images. The first one is usually how it looks (as it is, probably with bad lighting and all), whereas the second image is adjusted for lighting by the camera itself! It's really helpful! Plus it can auto detect if it's taking macro images, or there is backlight, or even if your hands are not steady (SteadyShot image stabilization feature)!!5) This is probably the only P&S; that takes brilliant indoor pictures (even in dim lighting), mostly due to the iAuto mode. I've tried several canons and kodaks. But this is the only camera which hasn't disappointed me at all!CONS:1) It is NOT an SLR!! :( I've compared identical images taken by my friend's SLR and my camera, and the difference is noticeable. That does not necessarily mean that my image is bad, but there's no way a P&S; can compete with an SLR.2) The LCD screen is really nice and shows you a great picture! However when you transfer this pic onto your PC, it looks like the PC wiped out all the colours and shine that you saw on the LCD. But if I see the same pic on my iPad, then again it looks nice and colourful. I know this is a problem with the screen resolution of my PC, but nonetheless, before I could figure this out, I used to get very disappointed with my camera after transferring the image to my PC. In short, the LCD does not give you a real feeling of how your image is going to look on your PC.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "sony cyber-shot dsc-w290", "Author": "P.

The main drawback with this camera is indoor or low light photography. When taking pictures inside the house or at parties, the colors as well as focus is off. Outdoors, the camera is passable, however the sharpness can be hit or miss.The reason for the 2 stars is that approximately 6 months after we bought the camera, the lens cover stopped opening fully. That meant that every time we took a picture, we had to manually open the cover, or else the picture would be cropped. This was past the warranty period, so I was stuck with a defective camera.After reading  Ken Rockwell's website, I bought the more expensive Canon S95. The difference between both cameras is day and night!Pro's:- Small, compact with easy controls.- Decent battery lifeCon's:- Poor indoor/low light results- Mediocre video- Prone to breaking downIn summary: If you would like to capture cherished memories of your family, I would not recommend this camera.

I had the first one over a year before I stupidly stuffed it in the pocket of my cargo shorts and jumped on the wild and crazy Simpsons ride at Universal Studios, in Florida.  As Bart says, \"Eat my shorts...\" and that's what the camera did.  Had the DSC-W290 been equipped with a view finder to supplement its sizable color display, I would still be using my old W290.  But, alas, there is no such view finder on the W290, and when the display shattered I was operating in the blind.  Other than that the W290 has everything I want in a snapshot-style camera.There are a few things you should do if you plan to purchase the W290:  (1) Buy at least one Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo Magic Gate Mark 2 that holds at least 2GB (I have a 2GB and a 4GB as a backup); (2) Purchase a Sony carrying case that is compact enough to fit on your belt, but has a storage pocket large enough to hold a spare memory stick and a spare battery; it's much safer than your pants pocket; (3) Buy a Sony NP-FG1 Lithium battery; the camera comes with a Sony NP-BG1, but the NP-FG1 displays the minutes of battery life remaining before a recharge is necessary; (4) Don't carry the camera in your pants pocket unless you want to hear your wife express her opinion of your I.Q. and/or you plan to purchase a new camera shortly thereafter; (5) If you do plan to carry the camera in your pants pocket, you might want to buy accidental damage insurance for it, along with a set of wife-resistant earplugs.  My replacement W290 is fully covered through a three-year Square Trade Warranty.  Sony guarantees the W290 for the first year, but not against accidental damage or stupidity.  You can find Square Trade Warranty on Amazon, at http://www.amazon.com/SquareTrade-Camcorder-Warranty-Accident-Protection/dp/B002I03UQG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1293929931&sr;=8-1.  It's well worth the $39.99! Or, buy directly from Square Trade Warranty and you might find a better bargain.The W290 has been around for awhile, but the price keeps going up while most of its counterparts are going down faster than the Simpsons ride at Universal Studios.  That's likely because Sony has packed this little gem with a bunch of quality features and it works like a charm.Finally, if you want a camera that allows you to take a snapshot with the touch of one button, or if you want to play with the settings, this is the camera you're looking for.  Our now seven-year-old has been taking beautiful pictures with the W290 since she was six, while I like changing the camera settings.

Imagine a roll of film holding 350 shots reusable for $12! The HD video mode allows for 30 min/2G of memory.To me a 4 star is perfect. Nothing probably deserves a 5 STAR so that's why I gave it a 4.

I have 3 Sony digitals and each one was 'ahead of it's time' technically. This one is no different. I'm not a photo affecionado but know good pictures when I see them. I opted for small size to throw in my front pants pocket rather than a bulky larger more powerful camera. But I too was surprised. This is one powerful camera! Every feature of this camera is great. The high resolution allows photo editing to crop and enlarge great pictures. The BURST mode allows for fast action multiple pix. The stabilization software appears to work great, almost completely eliminating the unstable 'hand'. The HD video movie mode is wonderful but even though the stabilization software is great be careful when 'zoomed in' and taking video. It will shake! Better than no stabilization but it does shake.Most of the neghatives reported by others seem to be true...but probably for a reason.

We just got back from a trip to the Carribean and took over 640 pics and 4 video's and still had 135 pics to go. Battery life so far has been great, but I would suggest to everyone to completely drain your battery prior to charging it for the first time. This is a several day process but it well worth it. Just leave the camera on in video mode until it dies. Then just keep turning it on until it stops turning on after several hours of rest. My next camera will be a Sony, but I'm sure that won't be for many years to come since these camera's are durable and reliable.

This camera is lightweight and does turn on fairly quickly. The display screen is a nice size for viewing and the setting options are easy to read, navigate and understand. It also has really great features and functionality, if the whole thing would work properly. No matter what setting I have selected for a picture if the object moves even slightly (I'm talking about not even breathing for the picture!), or your hand shakes even a little bit, the pictures all come out blurry and fuzzy. I'm not sure if the camera I have is defected or what, but compared to my previous Fuji Finepix camera, this one overall is just very frustrating. Unfortunately, I used this camera to take pictures of my evening wedding and barely got any decent pictures as it doesn't seem to do well in low-light, even though there is a specific setting for it. Depending on what setting and size of pics that I pre-selected on the camera, I also had a very difficult time resizing pictures to put into an online photo album creator (it's as if the pics were stuck to their size). Im very disappointed because I read extensive reviews and did my research before getting the Sony Cybershot and had anticipated receiving a great camera that was lighter in weight than the Fuji Finepix and a sure way to take great pics of my family/friends, my dog and vacation experiences...but it sadly just didn't happen.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera", "Author": "P.

This camera takes care of most of these tasks producing excellent photo results. You can make just enough tweeks to get the desired result. For example turn off the flash and this camera adjusts the shutter speed to produce perfect available light photos. Unless you are really moving when shoting photos this camera simply eliminates problems with your unintended camera movement. I installed an 8 gig. card so with the 12 meg. max photo size there is plenty of capacity. The action video mode works great and the 8 gig. card provides plenty of recording time.

I expected with the advancement of technology a camera 7yrs newer would blow my old camera out of the water.  This was not the case at all.  I had to pull out my old camera to go trick-or-treating to ensure I actually got some good pictures.  I actually took both cameras to compare later, and yes the 7yr old camera produced much better pictures.My number one complaint is that it is horrible at taking action shots.  I can barely get a picture of my kid sliding down the slide, running, or swinging; it's just one blur of colors.  The second complaint is the colors, especially red is all messed up.  I'm not a photographer, just a mom who wants to capture my kid's special and not so special moments.  I'm not sure what is wrong but reds tend to come out like fireballs where the red objects are almost glowing.  I have tried to fix the red but the other colors, which were fine, get dull and washed out.I guess if you could freeze time, adjust the camera to the new settings, then take the picture you might have a chance of overcoming the short falls of this camera.  However, in real life when the moment if gone it's gone.I can live with the red problem, but missing every picture at an outing with the kids is not an option.  I've had this camera and tried every setting for 3 months and I'm looking for a new camera even though for the price it should have met the needs of the basic user.Outdoor pictures tend to turn out better and landscape pictures are very nice as long as it's well before dusk.I do like the smile feature, it is much easier to use than a timer.  You can allow the camera to take a few pictures before the group moves and therefore increase your odds of getting people looking at the camera and smiling.The video feature is a great improvement over my old camera.

Anyway, for the price point, this camera has very good, fast shutter response (low shutter lag) which is great for pictures of the dog.  The picture mode options are very easy to understand and the automatic mode does a great job.  Understandability vs. the expensive Canon is tremendous.One problem: I edited several pictures (crop, zoom, etc.) on the camera and saved them.  I viewed them several times, then suddenly, they would not diplay on the camera and a file error code came up.  This turned out to be ok since the edited pictures could still be downloaded to a computer and they were fine, as edited/saved.  Sony's help/ support site offered no help except to suggest not editing on the camera - THAT'S A COP OUT SONY!!!  I would expect more from them.  Also, the cable with multiple connections is clunky.

I would rather sacrifice a little image clarity than have to carry around both a camera and a video cam.  Of course I love that it fits in my pocket so I don't have to carry a camera case.  The camera start up is fast, but there is a lag time between pictures if you are using the flash.  The burst option is great to take action shots.  I don't use the smile recognition much.  The person's smile must be large to be recognized.  The 3 inch screen is fantastic and the buttons and control dial are simple and easy to use.

I think it's one of the very best point-and-shoots.  Consumer Reports thought its predecessor the Cybershot w300 was the best in its class.  The w290 costs at least $100 less than its discontinued predecessor and only gives up some unnecessary features and about 1.5 megapixels.  I actually appreciate the reduction because, at 12.1 the pictures are still great but the files are about 10% smaller.The software's ability to identify faces and adjust to scenes is very good.  (The smile detection feature is extremely cool for showing friends but not terribly useful.)  The very large screen looks terrific when playing back photos and videos.  While it's reason for being is to take great photos, I must say I'm a huge fan of having an HD video recorder in my pocket.I love the w290 but it isn't perfect: It is not as small/sleek as a Canon Elph but I think the pictures and especially videos are much better - and that's why I love the Cybershot.  The fact that the Sony is about $100 less expensive than a comparable Canon Elph was an added bonus.Downsides:  In low light pictures are sometimes fuzzy or noisy.  This is generally most noticeable if you review the photo and zoom in close.  Without zooming in its less noticeable.Having to use Sony's proprietary accessories is annoying(eg camera does not take a standard mini USB; you also have to use a memory stick instead of the typical SD card) and was almost a deal breaker, but the quality of the camera and pix/videos won me over.  I used the money I saved to buy my memory stick and still had plenty left over.Like all other cameras I found with HD video, this one doesn't let you zoom while recording and the files are massive - making them tough to email to friends and family.Despite these flaws, I still think this is the best point and shoot in its class and highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Camara I have ever bought!", "Author": "Carla R.

With a baby blog, indoor picture quality and fast flash reload were a must.Now this is not just a Sony thing - one of the newer Canons we tried (the 880IS) along with, I'm sure, the dozens of other marketing-driven high megapixel count cameras suffer from the same problem - was lots of noise all over the pictures. But ESPECIALLY indoors. At all the best quality setting, this brand new camera couldn't hold a candle to the ragged 4-year old Elph. Colors were washed out, grainy textures appeared on smooth hardwood floors.Of course, we have to buy the $40 Memory Stick and an adapter because Sony's still beating that dead horse while everyone else has long agreed to more prevalent SD cards. We have two different laptops, they both have SD slots too - which used to make it easy to post images from the comfort of our living room - but with this we have to go downstairs to the office PC to use the big multi-card reader.But you ask, why not just keep the little USB-to-Camera cable handy? Surely it came with one right? No!! In yet another ridiculous proprietary scheme, the only cable (and slot for the cable on the camera) is a juggernaut, 3-in-1 video, audio, and USB cable for hooking up to the TV (RGB only) or USB port. You have a micro USB cable lying around? TOO BAD! You can't USE it.On the upside, the outdoor shots were nearly indistinguishable from the quality we're used to - bright and clear with less noise than indoors.

Another thing about purchasing camera, I think you should go to the store and check out the cameras yourself, check, feel, compare all the cameras that you like and pick out the best one that you like, remember each person has different taste of thing:)So I returned W290 to Dell and kept W230.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor image quality ruins an otherwise good camera", "Author": "Jason Smid", "ReviewID": "R2BPXSEHACRUHA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I used to own a Sony DSC-p10, it's a 5 megapixel camera from around 2003. The camera was great, but finally gave up, mostly due to abuse. Since I had such good luck with my first Sony camera, I decided it would be great to get another Sony over the more popular Cannon's. I got this camera around the end of June, which at the time of my writing this was 4 months ago and I've taken just over 600 pictures.Let's start out with the good:The display is huge, and easy to see things in. Everyone that uses this camera comments on how big and nice the display is.Battery life is outstanding. Actually, what's better than outstanding? I'm not sure, but that's what it is. Kudos to Sony on this one, I've charged the battery 3-4 times since I've owned the camera.The video is phenomenal, quality is better than I would expect out of a point-and-shoot but it suffers from the same focus problem as the still shots, which I'll explain later.Feature wise, this camera has plenty... mostly you'll probably never use.One of the reasons I got this camera is because I was familiar with the Sony menu system, so as far as I'm concerned it's easy to use but this is more opinion than fact.The camera is fast, or at least I've not noticed it being slow which is a welcome change from my previous camera.The zoom works as expected, nothing good or bad to report. It doesn't work while recording a video but that's not really a big deal to me.Size is good for me, but I'm a guy and have big pockets. It's slightly larger than some other point and shoot's but it's also mostly screen. Can't have everything.Now for the knit-picky things,There's no viewfinder, and the screen doesn't work very well in direct sunlight. It's bright enough to be seen outdoors if you're facing the right direction, but I've found myself wanting a viewfinder a few times. Its lack of one is no surprise though, since I clearly knew this before I bought the camera.Whenever I hand this camera to someone to take a picture of me, they are ALWAYS confused by the buttons. There's the goofy \"smile detection\" button on the top, as well as on/off and shutter. The shutter button is oblong and apparently confuses people. I feel it's a bit hard to push with my big paw sized hands. It would be nicer if it was a round button that protruded from the top of the cam.The mode selection wheel often turns its self in my pocket or backpack and I find myself taking videos instead of pictures too often.The lanyard that came with the camera didn't have the little clip that slides on it to snug it up to your wrist, which pretty much defeats the point of a lanyard in the first place. This seems like a very silly place to save $.01. I used the lanyard from my previous camera, and it works great.This camera uses a proprietary plug to attach to the computer and requires an external battery charger. This is basically the same thing that Cannon does, but my old Sony camera used a standard mini-usb style plug and I could plug the charger directly into the cam without removing the battery.If you've made it this far, you're probably still seriously interested in buying this camera, and I don't blame you. Most of the things I listed above aren't really that big of a deal. But honestly, don't buy this camera, and here's why:The image quality is AWFUL. TERRIBLE. WRETCHED. This thing's supposed to be a 12 megapixel awesome fantastic camera, but my old 5 megapixel camera from 2003 took better pictures hands down. The W290's daylight performance is acceptable... not fantastic, but I could live with it. The low-light performance if this camera is really bad though. Pictures that are even in moderate light start to become grainy way before they should and the flash doesn't make up for it.That's not the worst part though; the autofocus of this camera is worthless. I've taken more out of focus pictures in the past 4 months than the past 4 years. It's always confused, zooming the focus in and out trying to pick out whatever is in the foreground. I've tried center focus, multifocus, etc and nothing seems to help. Medium light action shots are impossible. Most recently, I tried to take a picture of my girlfriend moving her head while in the bleachers at a stadium at night with all the stadium lights on... the flash went off (it was on \"easy mode\") and still she motion blurred AND out of focus, this is just unacceptable. In another case I tried to take photos of dolphins off of the bow of a fishing boat at high noon (plenty of light) and the camera was unable to properly focus. I took photos in exactly the same conditions with my previous camera and they turned out perfect.Basically, in closing, this camera is worthless unless you just want some flashy looking toy that you can maybe take non-action pictures outside on sunny days with.

My previous camera is Sony DSC-W7 and I was expecting to have at least the same quality of the new one. Surprisingly the new DSC-W-290 was outstanding all my expectations. The camera is nice, light and very very portable. The pictures are really amazing! You feel that every one is better than the previous one. The menu offers many features which are more than enough for the category this camera belongs to. I was on a crossroad between this one and Canon but after several tests and comparisons I believe SONY caught my sympathy. The camera has quick reaction responding well to your changes of the options. The display is nice and bright. The battery's life is really long. One battery charge-discharge cycle has approximately 280 pictures with FLASH !!!! If you need even longer battery life, you could purchase a battery which has 1200mA hours or even bigger. This camera is really good for people who are not professional but want to have excellent pictures every time they use it. The only one minor concern I have is the power-on button and the point-shoot button. They are little smaller than I would like which makes them little hard to feel them under your fingers when you use the camera.

Having owned a few Sony cameras, I'm very familiar with Sony's quality and performance. I am actually a huge fan of Sony products, so I was looking forward to receiving my new camera.I had also considered the Canon SD970IS. I have owned several Canon PowerShot models throughout the years. However, the Canon was priced $140 more than the Sony, which led me to decide on the W290. After all, their features were comparable (12.1 Megapixel, 5X optical zoom, HD video, etc.).When I received the camera, I charged the battery and began taking test still shots and video. I made several indoor and outdoor shots to test the cameras capabilities. As soon as I downloaded the files to my PC, I immediately noticed that the pictures were grainy and not very sharp. Although they were taken at the camera's highest resolution (4000 x 3000), they looked like they were taken in low res or even from a cell phone camera. I tweaked around with some of the settings and made additional tests (in manual and auto). Again, the pictures were very disappointing. I compared the indoor and outdoor test shots I took around the house with pictures I had previously taken with my 8 megapixel Canon SD850. The difference was very apparent. In the interior pictures taken with my Canon, you could zoom in and see the details of the wood grain on furniture. In the Sony pictures, the details were blurred. The same was true with the outdoor pictures - you could see much more details in the pictures taken with my old Canon. I went back and reset all the user settings to default and made another set of tests. The results were the same. I then tested the HD video capabilities (indoors and outdoors) and was again let down. The video looked over-exposed. I adjusted the EV setting on the camera, but it made very little difference. I also noticed a lot of lens flares even in the indoor shots. This was not what I expected.I tried to convince myself that I was missing something obvious, so I looked through the manual, tweaked around with the settings again, and even cleaned the lens. I took several more tests, but with the same results. Believe me, I really wanted to like this camera, but reasons for keeping it were quickly diminishing. Having read the 5-star reviews here and on other sites, I am convinced that the camera I received is defective, which is why I didn't give the camera a lower rating.

I have had about 5 different digital cameras before this one, all very inexpensive and built to be very simple point and shoot cameras. I have documented my daughter's childhood with these cameras and have always been able to just plug the camera in, download the pictures, and view them immediately. No problems at all.The Sony, however, is the worst design ever. All of the files save into different little folders in the camera. It's like a Windows PC disaster. At one point we needed to download the pictures and videos in order to take some more at an event, so we downloaded to a laptop without the special (read 'special ed') PMB software provided by Sony. Nothing happened. My past cameras - all played friendly with any computer, regardless of whether we downloaded the software. We were able to 'explore' the camera drive and look through the folders contained within it, finding all of our pictures in one of the folders. After downloading them over, we deleted all the files from the camera, inadvertently losing all of the videos which had been saved to a separate folder in the camera. This was really upsetting since the videos were of my son's first few days in the hospital and coming home for the first time. Awful design.The worst part is yet to come. All of the videos can ONLY be viewed in PMB. They save automatically as MP4 files that are supposed to play in QuickTime. I am running the latest version of QuickTime and the videos are AWFUL. They jump, the audio jumps, they're blurry, just awful. In PMB, they are perfect. So what the heck is one to do when sending a video by email or DVD disc to a family member? Send a pirated copy of PMB with them and instuct them to download the software and view the videos that way? Ridiculous. I have tried multiple MP4 to AVI or WMV converters to no avail. The products are all much lower quality versions of the video, if I get video at all. Often only results in audio.Finally, the camera itself is terrible. We frequently turn on the camera in a hurry to take a quick shot of a special moment that is about to be lost forever and find that we are still on 'video' from the use before. It takes a good 20 seconds to turn the video off and then switch to the still shot features. The function wheel is useless and should be done away with. All other digital cameras typically start up in still shot mode and then you have to take an extra step to switch to video. The camera also comes with either 'easy' mode or 'intelligent', which are both awful. The easy mode produces terribly pictures and the intelligent mode nevers focuses on the right subject. Terrible and expensive camera for anyone who wants easy pictures with ease import and viewing.

I have found it to be difficult to use, simply because the controls are tiny! I have normal-sized hands and fingers, but have a terrible time telling if my index finger is on the shutter or not. Half of the time I end up looking at the top of the camera to see if my finger is positioned correctly, which is very frustrating if you are trying to snap off a picture quickly. As a matter of fact, I have missed a few good shots because of this.Also, you can't access some of the features that would be nice to change, such as the length of time the picture is displayed after taking it, or similar functions. This may not be a problem for most users, but I find it very irritating. My Fujifilm and Canon cameras allowed the user to change many of the menu functions, why doesn't Sony?Worst of all is that the picture quality just isn't very good. Outdoor shots are usually fine, but I have found that indoor pictures taken with the flash are always very over-exposed. I tried making changes in the user-accesable menus, but never could compensate for the over-exposure issue. I even tried sticking several layers of opaque tape over the flash to see if that would work, but as expected, the results were inconsistent.The build quality of the camera appears to be fairly good, and the battery life is also very good as well.

I kept good care of the camera and used it regularly for about 8 months until it started saying the battery was out. I bought new batteries, a new charger, etc, but the problem persisted. I contacted customer chat and did a power reset (hold power down for 15 seconds then wait one more minute and reinsert the battery) but the problem persisted. I got through to sony phone help -- 800-222-7669 -- after about 15 minutes, they said that it is under warranty (within on year of purchase) and that I can send it in for repair. I believe the issue is known (likely, since another reviewer had the problem) and that it may be covered by recall warranty no matter how long you've had the camera. I am sending the camera into the sony repair center in Texas today an I will update on how that goes.Oh, and when the camera WAS working, it was GREAT, for a portable point and shoot. The folks complaining about picture quality simply don't understand that the smaller lens size of any portable camera will reduce quality significantly. if you want best quality, get a real DSLR. My only grip is that Sony has done away with the little charging and download dock that they has on older models like the T1. That was SO CONVENIENT. You can still charge the w290 easy enough, you just have to remove the battery and put it in the charger, and for downloading there is a separate usb cable. Again, easy enough to use, but I sure miss that handy little dock that the t1 came with.Update: 10/25/10 - I got it back from the Sony repair center in about one week (I had to pay for shipping = lame) and then I used it one time and it broke again in exactly the same way. I called the tech center and they said they'll try fixing it again and this time they sent me a paid shipping label. I have to try that, since I really have no choice. I explained that this is my thrid cybershot and I was very happy with the first two and would happy to just by a newer cybershot model if I could get even a partial credit toward it due to this broken one they sold me. They said they don;t do that, so I will just have them keep trying to repair it and then just try to sell it on my own if and when that ever happens. In the meantime, I've said adios to the cybershot line for good and just bought myself a brand new Panasonic Lumix ZS7. It's still in the box as I write this, so let's just hope it works as godod as it looks and lasts a lot longer than my W290 lemon did. Good riddance!Bottom line is that I reccommend staying away from this or any other cybershot now. Because they might ship you a lemony product and then not stand by it and make no motion for a refund or any other consolation. You, the customer, will be out, as was I. boooo on sony!", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "great camera at a great price", "Author": "M.Bown", "ReviewID": "R3CR7HSOZSGCQK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "liked the quality of the pictures, but the battery life is low. good price and great look. love the blue color.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "great camera for every day use", "Author": "Donald J.
