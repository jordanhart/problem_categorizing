Despite its impressive-sounding features, this camera simply feels cheap. You sense the fragility of its stamped plastic construction the moment you hold it in your hands. Also, despite having an alleged 7.1 megapixel capability, the photos are noticeably choppy, jagged and grainy from any distance, in any light. I thought at first that the grainy jaggedness of the photos was a result of \"automatic\" settings needing to be manually fine-tuned, but I found that no matter how I set the camera's picture-taking options, the photos were simply not good.My cellphone has a built in camera of 3.1 megapixels, and its photos are clearly superior to the Vivitar camera. How can this be?This is simply not a good camera, that's why. One would think that the flash is useful, but it's very weak and doesn't really take good night photos (or even photos in a house with lamps on and not outside light) unless you are right in front of your target.The LCD screen is of extremely poor resolution and doesn't really show a good depiction of shots you took unless you zoom the image, which seems easy, but the software inside the camera is very... slow... and you'll be waiting forever just to check and see if your kid smiled in the shot you just took.This camera isn't even really good for beginners who just want to take photos and aren't all that interested in quality. Why? Because this camera eats batteries so fast!It takes 3 AAA batteries (not included). Also, you need to buy an SD memory card, don't forget. This camera has no built in memory at all and is inoperative without the card. When I purchased the camera I bought a package of 12 AAA batteries separately. This camera went through them really quickly.Especially when you use the flash -- your 3 AAA batteries might last only ten or fifteen shots before the LCD screen says \"flash charge failure\" and the camera turns off automatically.Okay, then, how about with non-flash photos? Your 3 AAA batteries will last for dozens and dozens of photos, right?No.I bought high-quality batteries, and noticed that after only about thirty photos, the batteries were already used up.So, to summarize, this camera is not good for adults because it feels really cheap, and IS cheap, and takes cheap pictures.For kids, they'll run through batteries so quickly they won't have any fun.Overall, the money you waste on batteries for this thing will very quickly erase the initial advantage of the camera's lower base price.I returned this camera to the store and bought a different camera from a different manufacturer for only twenty-five dollars more. It has an internal rechargeable battery, so I won't waste more money on endless batteries. It too is rated at 7.1 megapixels, and yet is pictures are superior both in flash and non flash occasions.This leads me to believe that the Vivitar is just ViviJUNK. Do yourself a favor and skip it -- bite the bullet and buy quality the first time. Profit from my mistake!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "worst camera ever..don't waste your money", "Author": "Melody LKK", "ReviewID": "R1JVHK3Z57F5IU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this \"cheap\" camera for my granddaugher's 11th birthday. She loved using my digital Sony and says she wants to be a photographer. I thought I would get her started with a lower end Vivitar just to see if she is responsible enough to take care of it and not lose it.  I could not believe they would actually sell a camera that took such terrible pictures. What is the point in having a camera if you cannot get a good picture out of it??  No matter what setting we used it was grainy and blurry. It even felt cheap, like a child's toy. It was actually embarrasing. We downloaded the pics to the computer and tried printing it out after using good photo software...nothing.  I took it back to Target and bought a Nikon Coolpix. I did not want to initially spend that kind of money, but it was either that or nothing.If you are considering this camera, don't!  How disappointing to give it as a gift and have to take it back and get something else. Very disappointing.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "--Buyer Beware--  You MUST buy SD card", "Author": "Laurie", "ReviewID": "R3V7WFU4M39TF3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got 2 of these cameras for my kids for Christmas.  Thought it was a great deal and a good first camera.  Little did I know that the cameras have NO memory and NEED a SD card.  My kids were very disappointed that they could not use their new cameras today and now have to wait until the SD cards are ordered and shipped.  Th item description is very mis-leading.  It states there is a slot for an SD card (all digital cameras have one) but it does not state that an SD card is required.  It does not state that you need to purchase an SD card because the camera has absolutely no memory capability what so ever. As far as picture quality, I really can't say as we have not had a chance to even use the cameras yet.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "7.1MP still image resolution capture\n2.4\" TFT color LCD\n8x digital zoom\nAnti-shake capabilities to combat blur\nMemory card slot: SD (sold separately) and Uses 3 AAA batteries (not included)", "Name": "Vivitar ViviCam V7024 7.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.4-Inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B1pDnX-cL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003P3TV22"}}
