{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Colorful, Razor-sharp Pictures - Highly Recommended!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2KF8ATTGE91TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Canon A80 (4.0 Megapixels) and also bought this new camera (known over here as Olympus C-310) recently.  While the Canon may have a 1.5 inch swivel LCD screen, this camera has a larger & more pleasant 1.8 inch LCD screen, definitely takes SHARPER pictures, and has less chromatic aberration (purple fringing).  It does have slightly more picture noise (i.e. digital 'film grain') compared to the Canon, but you will notice this only if you have a keen eye for it.  (the extra picture noise probably arose from the more aggresive sharpening algorithm employed by Olympus as compared to Canon)The heavier & more solid Canon uses 4 AA batteries and last for hours upon hours even on alkaline batteries, but you can only take a few more shots once its low-battery warning flashes.  In contrast, the Olympus uses 2 AA batteries only and is therefore much lighter, but one caveat - on both new & newly charged rechargeable 2100mAH NiMH batteries (2100 mAH and above are strongly recommended), the low-battery warning indicator does start flashing too soon, when the camera gets warm.However, I have found to my surprise that with the low-battery indicator persistently flashing, this camera still allowed me to take approx. another 120 continuous shots, around 80 of which had used flash.  This means that while rechargeable battery life is actually ok for the camera, the low-battery warning is way too premature to be relied upon.While this camera also lacks other features found on the more expensive Canon and requires the newer, smaller (and more expensive) xD memory card, it is very much more pocketable, and has a new hidden Ace - the 'Super Macro Mode' hidden in the Menu option, which allows fantastic close-up photos from under 1 inch (2 cm) away, compared to the Canons and Nikons which can only go as close as 2 inches (4-5 cm) max only.Overall, this camera takes very colorful, contrasty, razor-sharp pictures, and pictures taken with the flash were also well exposed.  I have noticed that the latter are definitely brighter than those taken with competing Nikons, such as the Coolpix 2100/3100 & newer 2200/3200 range, which seem to suffer from slightly underpowered flash and remain unrectified by the manufacturer until this very day.VERDICT: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - despite the premature low-battery indicator, the camera delivers one of the very best picture quality in its price category, with a new hidden bonus (Super Macro Mode!).  This is my very first review ever at Amazon.com, and I hope this short review has helped.", "Date": "May 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "An Outstanding Camera", "Author": "James E.

The Olympus 540 won hands down. This is the camera I take with me every day. I own a better camera, but like the size and ease of use of this camera.I took identical photos with this camera and a 4 mg pixal camera and you couldn't tell the difference in a 8x10 print done on a color laser printer. I also enlarged and printed a 48\"x36\" image on a large format printer and was extremely please by the results.The camera is easy to use. In seconds you can choose anyone of the eight shooting modes. Also, adjusting the flash to be auto, always on, off or a fill flash is a quick click on the back control button. By pushing the shutter button half way down you can set your exposure.  This is very helpful in some lighting situations.If you purchase the camera, I would recommend buying re- chargeable batteries and a larger storage card.", "Date": "August 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2U26L644J3N93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched high and low for a new digital camera, buying and returning 4 different cameras in a week before finding this awesome little Olympus.

First off the LCD display is extremely crisp and clear and the menus are very user-friendly. The camera starts up fasts and takes pictures relatively quickly also. I will say, it is not the best with batteries.(a common problem in digital cameras though) Just invest in some good rechargables, it's worth it.

This camera was outstanding: easy to use, produces good quality pictures, lightweight. It makes toting \"regular\" camera gear around too cumbersome to contemplate: this camera slips into a pants pocket easily enough. As my first digital camera, it's everything I had hoped it would be and more.The software (Olympus's Camedia) is pretty good and relatively easy to use, although managing your pictures can be more work than it needs to be. Maybe I'll upgrade that to the Pro version. Nonetheless, I was downloading pictures quickly and everything worked cleanly. The main reason to use the software (rotating pictures) is convenient.The camera itself is lightweight and pretty durable (my son dropped it a few times and it survived just fine). The 16 MB card that comes with it is too small for realistic use, but a 128 MB card is easy to purchase: budget for it, as you'll want the storage. There are only a few minor annoyances that you'll want to compare to other cameras before choosing this one (I don't think anyone else does it any better).First, this camera (like many digital cameras) devours batteries. The \"low battery\" warning comes on very quickly--way too quickly, since battery life far exceeds the warning. However: as the battery runs down, the camera itself processes more and more slowly. So I've found that you'll often miss shots because you need to know about a second in advance to push the button. The lag between \"go\" and the camera firing is annoying.Second, the zoom control is a bit difficult to use. It's located on top of the camera and twists, an action that I find difficult to perform while aiming the camera. I've taken to holding the camera at about chest level to shoot pictures so that I have better control.Overall, the picture quality settings are easy to manage and the pictures themselves are bright, clear, and sharp. The autofocus is almost always perfect and you'll rarely dig into the menus to adjust the camera performance. The panorama capability doesn't seem to work, but it's an extraneous feature.In any case, this is a great little camera. It does everything a digital camera should, is well made, and makes me a happy camper.", "Date": "July 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Lot's of pluses but some minuses", "Author": "Julie K.

I picked this one for my latest based on it's features (macro, self portrait, etc) and the awesome huge LCD screen.  The screen is much bigger than it's competitors.  The self portrait mode worth noting... some one was finally genius enough to note that many a snapshot is taken where two subjects squeeze together and hold the camera at arms length and snap the pic.  This setting adjusts the flash and lense to accomodate that!  Genius!The downsides... even with rechargable batteries this sucker goes \"battery low\" way before other digi's I've had.  It's worth noting.  I think it runs out about 30% to 50% quicker than other camera's I've had.  That's pretty notable.Also... the bootup time is Loooonnng.  When turning on the camera, the time between turning it on and actually taking a pic is way too long.  Also the lag between shutter press and actuall photo/flash is incredibly long.  MUCH longer than other cams I've had.You sacrifice a few things here and gain a few there with digi's but, the lag time and battery life are deal breakers for me and the type of pix I take so this puppy is going back.  :(", "Date": "September 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great camera", "Author": "Karthik Elangovan \"Karthik\"", "ReviewID": "R3NJ0W6NJ6MOXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have taken more than 1000 pictures with this great camera. Here are my opinions on it..Positive Stuff:1. Excellent picture quality. No doubt, I liked the picture quality more than a Sony Cybershot 3.2 MP camera.2. The most powerful flash I've ever seen. The camera can take a good picture in complete darkness.3. Decent battery life. Even though the camera might indicate a Low battery indicator soon, it actually lasts for a long time. I used Panasonic 2100 mah rechargeable Ni-MH battery. I got about 32-34 pictures (all with flash). If you actually turn off the LCD display while not using it, it saves a lot more battery power.4. Transferring images to a PC is pretty straight forward.5. The camera is compact and light as well. It was able to fit in to my jean pocket!6. The camera makes good judgement when to use flash and when not to use. At the end of the day, we are totally satisfied with the image quality.Negative stuff:1. The camera is just too slow to respond, particularly, if the battery is low.2. There were occasions where I had to take some moving objects, but just couldnt time my camera to take it. The response time between pressing the trigger and the camera firing is about 1.5 to 2 seconds (which might be too late sometimes).Conclusion:1. If you use a rechargeable battery with a good MAH, the camera is pretty neat.2.

This camera operates on either two AA batteries, or one lithium battery. Here is the problem - it burns through them at an umbelievable rate!! If you are planning on taking lots of pictures at once (on vacation, or taking the kids to the zoo, etc), one set of AA batteries will not even get you through the day. You will easily need two or three sets of AA batteries to get through a day of heavy picture taking. That really starts to add up! I tried buying two sets of rechargables with a charger, but the first set of batteries will run out before the second set has enough time to charge. You would need two or three sets that could be charging simultaneously to keep up. I then went to the litium option. While these do last longer, they still only last about 10 days with limited picture taking. Again, if you were in a situation where you were taking lots of photos, you would probably need one lithium battery for each week. At about $10 each, that's gonna add up quickly as well. To make matters worse, you burn the batteries when you are downloading your photos to your computer, and there is no \"safety\" that turns it off after a minute of two of not being used. So it is easy to hook it up, download your pictures, get busy managing your photos and forget that the camera is still on. An hour later - dead battery!For the record, my mother has a different model of Olympus camedia that comes with its own rechargable battery, and it is much, much more practical.

KIM \"mom2sarah\"", "ReviewID": "RBQAMJFI5ADTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1st, BELIEVE THE HYPE !  The image quality is TRULY AMAZING! GORGEOUS, TRUE to LIFE COLORS! They are about as close to a 35 mm photo as I have seen (including those from cameras costing 3-4x the price!).  The salesman at my local WOLF camera store (who is very knowledgeable) was surprised that the pictures I developed were from a (3 MP) digital camera.  YES-THEY ARE that GOOD.  And I am not easily impressed (anymore).2nd, I am by no means a \"novice\" when it comes to digital cameras.  I have lost count as to how many cameras I have bought and sold over the years in my futile attempt at finding \"the perfect camera\".  It is my belief now that there is no \"perfect\" digital camera that will fulfill ALL of your digital needs.  You need to prioritize what's important.  For example, if video with sound is very important to you, you can rule this camera out.  However, if image quality ranks HIGH on your list, please keep on reading my review.  I have tried all of the really tiny, expensive cameras and have ultimately, always ended up disappointed by its picture quality.  My \"BIG\" camera (which I highly recommend) is the Panasonic Lumix FZ20.  This has become the perfect \"take anywhere\" camera for me.  I like it better than the Sony P200 that I paid over 3x for.3rd, a term I just coined for this review is \"megapixel smegapixel\".  Four years ago, I paid a thousand dollars for a top-of-the line 3 MP camera (Nikon Coolpix 990).  To this day, that camera has taken some of the best pictures including those from 5 MP cameras like the Nikon 5200 or even 7 MP camera like the SONY P200.  The thing is that the higher the megapixel, the higher the incidence of NOISE.  99% of us do not need a 7 MP camera.  It's simply overkill and the pictures, ironically, often end up looking more GRAINY than a picture from a great 3 or 4 MP camera!  Even though this is \"only\" a 3 MP camera, that is enough resolution to print up to 11\"x14\". So, don't get too caught up in the \"megapixel race\".  You just end up paying a lot more for something that you don't even need! This camera proves that you don't need to spend $500 to get a great digital picture.Finally, like all cameras, there are the \"cons\" which other people have alluded to - namely, the short battery life and relatively long shutter speed.  If you are trying to capture a toddler on the loose, this is NOT the camera for you!  But I find it more than acceptable.IMPORTANT: NOW, FOR THE MAJOR ISSUE OF BATTERY DRAINAGE - I read ALL of the reviews on Amazon IN FULL and no one has yet mentioned that it can also use CRV3 battery which lasts longer than rechargeable \"AA\" batteries.  Or even better, that for $30, you can now purchase rechargeable CRV3 batteries !!!!!  My favorite is the one by MobyPower, sold here -[...]Also, I always use use a Card Reader to download photos from my cameras instead of draining battery power. I'd recommend you buy a separate card reader - they are very inexpensive and will save you lots of money on batteries!Fianlly, I paid less a tad over $100 for mine.  In my humble opinion, dollar for dollar, this is simply ONE of the BEST DIGITAL Cameras out there.  Whether you are entering the exciting (but often intimidating) world of digital photo,or you need a great Second Camera, this camera should more than satisfy you, without leaving a dent in your pocketbook!IMPORTANT UPDATE : As of April 2005, If you want video with sound, you can buy their NEW 5 MPG D-595 camera for only $50 more !", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera but some problem with the battery ilfe", "Author": "Efr\u00e9n D\u00edaz \"Efr\u00e9n D\u00edaz\"", "ReviewID": "RGO5MESVQ1REV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have always love Olympus image quality, the colors are great and the lcd discplay shows exactly how the picture will look like when you get it into the computer, the pictures look alive, i compared to other digital cameras such as HP, Kodak, and there is no point of comparison, Olympus Rocks!!, the only problem with this model is the battery life, i recommend that yo turn of the display, disable the flash when you dont need it and get rechargable batteries, and carry them with you every time.", "Date": "January 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good camera, a little slow on the shoot", "Author": "Aaron Lawless \"a law\"", "ReviewID": "R3IXCWYS3J2V5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Olympus D-540 is a good camera for the money.

This camera was my first ever digicam and was received about 2 years ago.I've been using it for so long and still discover new things I can do with it, and new features. I can't say one negative thing about this camera, even if I wanted to. It's been reliable, easy to use, and takes absolutely lovely pictures! I have heard negative things about Olympus in the past but chose this camera anyway, and am very glad I did. It hooks up effortlessly to my new laptop, and transfering digital images to your computer is so simple and easy to do. I have a 256 card in it so that it holds tons of pictures.Back when this camera was first introduced, it's larger screen was far more rare among other cameras. The screen is very nice and clear. The shooting modes offer a wide range of choices for any shot you could want to take, I especially like the landscape and movie modes. I can take over 5 minutes of video (without sound, the movies on this camera do not have sound).The zoom is easy to operate and the lense has a cover that wraps over it when closed for protection. 3.2 MP is PLENTY for almost any shot you could need, and some of my pictures have come out so beautifully, you would've thought that they were professionally done. I will post a few photos I have taken with it in the \"customer images\" section.One thing I adore about my camera is the total and complete EASE of operation. Anyone could use this, whether novice or professional.

For the price however(I'm a college student with a double major and work only part-time, so money is tight), Olympus is the way to go. The ratio of quality to price is untouchable.I've taken this camera to college, on vacation, out for nights with my friends, and just used it around the house... and it's performed beautifully each way. The fact that it is compact and light enough to not be cumbersome, yet still feels sturdy, makes it easy and un-obtrusive to bring anyplace you go.If this camera will be as good to you as it has to me, don't have any worries. It will last a while if you take good care of it. It's been a joy to use. Just make sure you buy lithium batteries (AA's simply DON'T cut it), and you're good to go.", "Date": "February 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for Price it is now", "Author": "Paige Bishop", "ReviewID": "R2WDEL4DKKRCFE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a couple of years, we paid a lot more for it when it first came out.  It takes pretty good pictures although if the flash isn't on, they turn out blurry.  I don't know why this happens, but it makes it difficult when needing to snap the shot without the flash on.  I have noticed that regular batteries don't last even one day in this camera, although the Lithium ones last several months. It is worth it to spend the extra money on them.  I have learned that making the size of the photo smaller makes the pictures look a lot less clear when you try to develop them.  It is defaulted to the 3rd largest setting and it's for a reason, they're the ones that turn out clear, very clear in fact.  I really like it, takes great color shots and even does great in the Sepia setting.  The camera is very user friendly and even when it's pitch dark, the flash lights up the area and takes great pictures.  Also, the flash hasn't given us any \"White out\" pictures, it seems to have just the right amount of flash for almost any picture.  I really like this camera, it isn't top of the line, but for the price that it is now, it's a great buy.  I really like it's durability also, a few weeks ago at a family gathering, my little sister pushed me in the swimming pool not knowing that my camera was in my pocket.  I took out the memory card and batteries and let it sit on a dry towel all night, it dried out and works great to this day.  I even developed some pictures I had on the memory card and didn't have a problem at all.  She was worried, feeling that she would DEFINITELY have to replace my camera, but it was a trooper, it works great to this day, took a few extra days for the LCD screen to dry out completely, but it did.  I gotta say, this camera is AWESOME in that respect.

I was very excited, but soon found this camera's flaws. When taking a picture, the time you must wait to take another picture is too long. Sometimes, my camera shuts off and turns itself back on again between pictures. When attempting to capture a shot, this is extremely annoying. Also, when the camera's flash is turned off, I've found that the picture quality is less. I bought rechargeable AA batteries to go with this camera, but after inserting fully charged batteries and taking 2 pictures or so, the battery light is already red. Obviously the battery detector in the camera has something seriously wrong with it since it always tells me the batteries are dying, when in fact I can continue taking more pictures. The xD memory card this camera comes with only holds 19 pictures, so I purchased a 256 MB card, but now regret it because the next camera I get will not be Olympus so, it does not use xD picture cards.  This camera is also bigger than a lot of the models out there. It takes up too much room in my purse.  The only things I really like about this camera are the picture quality and how easy it is to download the pictures onto my computer.  I just plug it in with the USB plug it came with, hit a couple buttons on my computer, and boom, they're all there.  Overall, I do not reccommend this camera to anyone.

It had no lag, started up quickly, and took pictures fine. Then I noticed wear that came from nowhere. Cheap parts. The camera took an unusually long time to startup, even with brand new batteries. It flashed black every time I turned it on. Eventually, it just stopped working altogether. I've tried replacing the batteries, and I've tried Olympus for help, but they have absolutely nothing. They have the worst website information I've ever seen. They didn't even have a FAQ of common problems as they're too busy releasing new cameras with cheaper parts every 3 seconds to pay attention to their current customers. This camera sucks. If you're looking for something that will last and not break down on you, then you should be looking somewhere else. This has completely soured me on digital cameras since it seems that all of them break down, are horrifically expensive especially considering you need a memory card, battery charger, warranty, dock if you want to print, ink, etc. The memory card included with the camera could only hold 20 pictures!! I had to purchase another one for $40. I'd suggest that you stick with regular cheap cameras. Until they start making digital cameras cheaper, stop releasing new ones and lowering prices for old ones, providing more in the package, and offering better technical support, I'd say don't bother with them at all.", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "nice.", "Author": "Rosita", "ReviewID": "R21ARXRJGR8KK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera takes great pictures.

I was fairly happy with it. I even liked the Camedia software that came with it enough to buy the full version. It had it's pros and cons, but this is not a review of the C390.Why, may you ask, am I writing about an older camera in a review of the D540? Because in every aspect, except size, this camera is by far the inferior. It's so slow that most of my pictures of my kids are of the sides or backs of their heads. Here's my normal photo taking process: First, I half press the button on the camera to get it ready, then I call the kids to get their attention and when the look I push the button all the way in. By the time the picture is taken they have normally looked away, or gotten up and left. The camera might be ok for studio settings, but useless for \"capture the moment\" type photography.As bad as the delay is, it's not the worst feature. The worst feature is it's battery consumption. The C390 mentioned above can take hundreds of photos on it's four AA NiMh batters, of which I have several sets. One would expect a camera that takes half the number of batteries to be able to take at least half the number of pictures. One may even hope that in the intervening years of improved circuitry and design that maybe you could take more than half the number of pictures. One would be wrong. Very, very wrong. Typical battery yield is a measly 20 to 30 pictures.The problem was so bad that I was convinced there had to be some sort of circuitry problem, and I sent it in for repair. I just received it back today marked \"No problem found.\" As I told every employee of Olympus that I spoke with, yes, I am using NiMH batteries. Typically, they had a very good response to my problem - that I should use NiMH batteries. The returned camera came with a little pre-made flyer stating that I should use NiMH batteries, I'll get much better results.In summary, if you plan on using this camera in some sort of low-quality studio, or for taking pictures of things that don't move AND you can do it somewhere close to a charging station with enough batteries to always have a set in the charger, then this might be the camera for you.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Oldie but Goodie", "Author": "PJD \"smart shopper 30144\"", "ReviewID": "R5KLB4ZIURFP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK I know this model is approaching vintage.

It's my first digital camera and I have read a lot of reviews about it. Everyone has their own list of pros and cons. I guess that they are all \"true\" for the person who has experienced them. I got into digtital photography after throwing out thousands of 35mm slides and photographs and swearing off of collecting phots any more. My 30 year old Asahi Spotmatic sits on the shelve. Then, I started to think about the digital concept. Why it's just a lot of electrons arranged in a lot of 1111111111s and 0000000000s. And so easy to \"develope\" and \"throw out\". Easy to carry in the forest and so convenient for taking pictures that I really have no intention to save or develope. Well, I do save a few...but just electrons, remember. I love it!I cracked the LCD screen after a few months. Oh, fiddl-faddle! Well, what to do?I decided to order an LCD replacement from Olympus and fix it myself. I thought...\"what the heck, it's that or throw it out. So, I'll gamble the $70 for the LCD and try to repair it myself.\"It was a little scary at first. But I did not care if I fatally messed up the camera. I took out all of the little screws I could find and pried the back off of the camera. There I found more small screws holding the LCD in place. There is a tiny two conductor cable with a tinsy two prong connector on it. Also, the LCD is attached to the camera electronics with a tiny ribbon cable. I took out more screws and used tweezers to disconnect the cables. The two conductor red and white cable has to be de-soldered and re-soldered to the new LCD. The LCD bracket has to literally be pealed off of the old LCD and reused on the replacement LCD. Will it work? It put everything back with no parts left over! And it worked!!!! Let me confess that I have worked in the electronics industry, so I am not too intimidated by the computer \"guts\" of this camera. However, I think it really was my \"I don't give a hoot\" attitude that got me through this repair.Olympus Parts Department is not very easy to deal with. Some rude people and some helpful people. After gettting 3 different prices, each higher that the last, I ordered the part. I did not receive a new screen. It had a date tag on it from the previous year. No one said it was a used part on the phone ! It was back ordered and took two months to come in. I was so tired of dealing with Olympus that I used it and all has turned out well in the end.I can shoot all of pictures that I desire and a movie or two on just the 16 meg card. I never print photos, so the 16 meg card will hold about 135 email quality pictures that I can send to friends and they can easily throw out. Who needs the clutter! I got a deal on a 64 meg card so I got that as a backup.I love this camera. It does all of the good stuff that other reviewers say and more. I think that most negative comments are from people who are very particular about some feature or expect this camera to perform outside of its price range. It does a great job, is easy to use and repair, easy to carry (don't bump any concrete walls with the LCD) and has lots of features to explore.Prices are going up with the pixel count. I don't want more pixels. Probably 1 would do for most internet photos. 2 would give good 4x6 prints.
