The other included lens were a joke as was the tripod. Save your money and buy the camera, which is wonderful, and get your filters elsewhere if you need them. After extensive use of this camera, I haven't found the filters particularly necessary. Definitely buy the camera though.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD BUY FOR SOMEONE WANTING TO TAKE LOTS PIC,S", "Author": "JIM", "ReviewID": "R2IE7F0LG2TWYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SAME AS BATTERIES AND CHARGER WORK GREAT AND TKES GOOD PHOTOS.

Down side is the lack of me being able to take quick unexspected snap shoots . Quality  is awesome for me.
