{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worthy Successor to Leica's D-LUX 2", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "RHECRO1HB5XKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The brand new Leica D-Lux 3 is a stylish update of the popular Leica D-Lux 2 which was available in limited release late last year. It carries on the now grand tradition of Leica digital point and shoot cameras with improved optical image stabilizing and enhanced Leica-designed firmware for ultimate image quality. I had the chance to use this camera briefly twice recently, and was extremely impressed with both its easy handling and superior image quality. Like its predecessor it offers three different types of image formats. But, best of all, you don't need to rely on the camera manual to pick it up and use it immediately (EDITORIAL NOTE: I had the opportunity to use the camera from 11/20/06-11/30/06 primarily to photograph some of the most impressive Christmas store displays here in New York, NY, and to photograph fellow Brunonian - and former classmate - author Rick Moody at a private reception held in his honor prior to a public event featuring him at the venerable 92nd Street Y. I'm greatly impressed with both the image quality and the realistic color saturation of the images I took using the least amount of .jpeg compression at a maximum pixel size of 8.5 Mb. I am grateful to Leica Camera USA for allowing me to borrow a current production version of this camera.).  Although the Leica D-Lux 3 is available in a superb black finish, I am more than a bit partial to chrome, since the chrome version reminds me more of such classic Leica M-mount 35mm rangefinder cameras like the M3 and M4.The Leica D-Lux 3 has approximately the same dimensions and features as its illustrious predecessor (Dimensions (WxHxD) - 4.2 x 2.3 x 1 inches (105.7 x 58.3 x 25.6mm) Weight - 6.5oz / 7.8oz (185g/220g) (without/with battery, memory card and lens cap)). But it is replete with an extensive list of features that weren't available in the D-Lux 2. For example, I believe there is more opportunity for creative manual control via its manual control features. There is also ample flexibility in available apertures for different kinds of photography from wide angle to telephoto (Aperture - F2.8-F8.0 (wide angle) F4.9-F8.0 (telephoto)). There is also a flexible array of flash options ranging from red eye reduction to second curtain synchronization modes. And then there is a flexible in image format modes. There is a video recording mode in which you can choose between 16:9 and 4:3 formats: - In 16 - 9 format a choice between 1280 x 720 pixels 15 fps or 848 x 480 pixels 30 fps/ 10 fps; in 4 - 3 format a choice between 640 x 480 pixels 30 fps/10 fps or 320 x 240 pixels 30 fps/10 fps. Your only limitation is the storage capacity of the SD card you use. Images can be stored in the following file formats: Still - RAW, JPEG (Fine/Standard), Movie - QuickTime Motion JPEG. Last, but not least, you can dictate the type of digital photography being done and let the camera handle the rest via these scene programs: Portraits, sport, night scenes, night portraits, fireworks, parties, snow, self-portraits, food, high-sensitivity mode, Baby 1, Baby 2, soft skin, candlelight, starry skies, landscapes, print . Quite simply this camera offers so much at a relatively reasonable price for a digital Leica - or indeed any other digital - camera in this class.", "Date": "November 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Leica got it right", "Author": "Jeffrey A. Lindh \"Bofo\"", "ReviewID": "R2PSV7R5II5RP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say I've only had the camera for several days so far, but it's all that I expected from Leica. You perhaps pay a bit more for the name, but it's in the details where it succeeds.  The screen is beautiful, with the font large and so easy to read. The menu is simple to navigate and the three picture format sizes is perfect, well beyond any other camera for the price. About the only thing that would have been a nice addition would have been a simple case for it since the screen is large and probably easily scratched through normal use. The delay normally experienced with digital cameras when taking a photo is still true with this camera, but is minimal compared to competitive brands.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very nice, but not perfect.", "Author": "Diavolino", "ReviewID": "R1J4PLURIH6QE3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a silver one a few weeks ago, and have taken it to a few trips and events and now have the following comments:1) It is very small and light.  This thing really is a point-and-shoot.  The good news is that it's more portable than I expected, though one should not purchase this camera expecting it to feel hefty like an M3.2) It's very pretty, and the fit and finish are of a high standard.3) The lens is a thing of beauty to behold in all its multi-coated splendor (if you're into that sort of thing).  The lens cap feels cheap.4) Images taken in the near macro to about 30 ft. range are very sharp, clear, contrasty, and beautiful.  They are so good, in fact, that you could easily convince someone that they were taken with a hefty SLR system camera rather than a pocket-sized one.5) Long shots (landscapes, etc.), seem a little bit soft, and this disappointed me a bit, though when I compared it to my Nikon Coolpix S2, it was actually sharper.  I will need to perform more tests at infinity focus.6) The flash is not very powerful and does not have much \"reach.\"  This is problematic indoors if your subject is more than 8-10 feet away.7) The display is gorgeous, and puts my other camera's display to shame.8) The manual controls are good, and there really is an astonishing degree of manual control for a pocket-sized machine.9) The lens is a bit soft when wide open, and while this could be nice for portraits and such, if you want to sharpen things up you can use aperture priority and a tripod, and then they're beautiful.10) One of the strengths of this camera is its large glass and fairly fast lens (for this camera class), and its ability to capture really nice images indoors in available light, though you need a steady subject and either tripod or to rest it on a solid surface to get the most out of it.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Leica D-Lux 3", "Author": "zigzagzilla", "ReviewID": "R3R2CZUCCPY3JP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this item at a brick and mortar store--immediate gratification at the same price.  The camera is a beautifully minimalist housing for the high-quality lens, which made opting to pay the extra one to two hundred dollars over the higher-end WorstLie (BestBuy) offerings a no-brainer.  I have been pleased with the ease of use--at present I have only used the manual settings in a limited way, but the auto-focus auto-exposure systems work very well, and the ability to set the aspect ratios is proving to work out very well for the various uses, creative and/or practical that I put this camera through.The downsides are the high cost of peripheral items.  The camera does not include a power cable, and the USB does not power the apparatus.  Batteries are expensive to replace, and a case runs from $90 to upwards of $300--when in stock at all.This is certainly a good choice for the upper-end consumer-level material, but the lack of US marketing focus, makes Leica a brand to be pursued, rather than simply \"opted-for.\"", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Met all my criteria", "Author": "aabgoosht", "ReviewID": "RHKB5273RSQAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had three criteria for a camera and the D-Lux 3 fulfilled them all. My criteria was 1. to have a digital camera capable of producing high quality images (The D-Lux 3 has 10 mega pixels and a great lense). 2. to economize on size -basically needed the camera to be small ( no use having a fantastic quality camera sitting somewhere at home because it's too big and I didn't feel like carrying it) and finally 3. I wanted full manual settings. No matter how many modes the camera has, it will never be able to do everything you want, unless you have full manual control, and besides if you, like me, want to wean yourself off the fully automated but ultimately limited Point and Shoots, and move toward creating artistic shots, then you will need full manual settings. The D-Lux 3 has given me everything I needed. Already I am getting more comfortable estimating what a particular lighting will need in terms of aperture and shutter speed. I can take great night shots without a flash. The D-Lux 3 has a shutter speed ranging from 1/200 to 60 seconds! (I use the long exposures a lot. I shot in a desert at night on 40 seconds exposure and it came out looking like daylight!) Try getting that on any other P&S;! It has a 16:9 aspect ratio on the lens that allows for a very wide Panaramic style image that looks great! With the research I did I couldn't find a single other camera apart from Leica that offered all the above.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Everything it's cracked up to be!", "Author": "Max Crowe \"Bleary-eyed in PTY\"", "ReviewID": "R35SK4G4X3W060", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After taking a few trips overseas with my wonderfull Nikon D200 10.2 MP digital SLR, I beagan to feel the weight (and bulk), to say the least.  Still, the capabilities I could enjoy with this cam and its 18-200mm zoon lens were just too good to give up in favor of a pocket-size.  Nonetheless, I started researching like crazy and finally wound up somewhere between the Panasonic and this Leica, which is modelled on the Panasonic (yes, not the other way around).  In the end, I couldn't resist the idea of owning a genuine German Leica for just under $600!  After having it for a few weeks, I have some simply spectacular pics in the 16:9 format at the full 10 MP.  It really helps to take some just awsome images (and I am not in the obnoxious habit of overusing the word \"awsome\", BTW).  The camera's heft and feel is one of sheer quality, as is the look, and use of it is simple, fun, and gives an amateur like me both a killer backup cam to the D200 AND a stand-alone that I can take pretty much around the word knowing I will miss very little and carry even less.  It has literally contributed to making me happy in a way that few possesions ever have.  But then, that's because I love to take pictures so much.

While you can certainly use it right out of the box, this is a deep camera that is very open to the creative and demanding user.I first saw this camera while killing time in an Admrials Lounge. As it had just been released, I had never seen one so I had to ask. Turns out the owner was a professional photographer and taking it to Thailand for magazine work. He said it does everything his very Pro Canon can do except for very low lighting situations, like a shot lighted by a single candle. His praise and excitement is what got me thinking about buying one.Sure you can get the \"same\" camera in a Panasonic version for $200 less - but no thank you, I was raised with a Leica SLR. I want that red dot. I want that solid German feel in my hands. I want that quality.And what makes this sexy piece of chrome so superior? Picture quality and the flexibility of the camera. Ergonomically many of the controls are right  there in your fingertips, tangible hardware. And when you need a menu item it is easy and quick to access.And the lens. The legendary Leica lens. The pictures look incredible. Crisp clear vibrant. And shooting in RAW mode allows incredible resolution for post-Photoshopabilty.So while shooting you have flexibility and one great looking accessory. Afterwards you have some great quality shots to fake what a great photographer you are! (And if you really are that good then you will certainly sell more photos).Be sure to read the manual.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "An almost perfect  point-and shoot camera", "Author": "W. Saumweber", "ReviewID": "R1YMKQS93IYC8X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the camera because of the many manual overrides/controls it offers; also because it is the only one in the 10MP-class featuring the RAW image format. The camera indeed performs as the manufacturer promises. With one exception: the RAW output is awkward and surprisingly noisy (not what I am used to with my Nikons). The RAW images the camera produces take up 20MB each (instead of ~10MB in the Nikons) and are in most cases not worth the amount of storage space they take up. The two JPEG options (especially the hi-res one) produce much better, less noisy results using 80% less memory and in 1/3 of the time to process.Overall: Yes, I love it.After 7 months (and about 1500 images) I have to say I still love it but the unusual noisiness (visibility of pixels) and the lack of sharpness in all image settings has started to annoy me. To produce a high quality image for a large print you need to work even the RAW image extensibly in Photoshop and Noise Ninja before it reaches the quality you get from 10 megapixel-SLRs. Because of that I purchased a Canon Powershot G9 - which looks less chic and weighs more - but delivers exactly what I was looking for.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Leica Quality", "Author": "R.

A simple sun reflecting on a calm beach, this camera will meter wrongly.Buy the Panasonic equivalent instead. It still has a 'Leica' label around the lens!Then spend the differemce on say the Olympus shockproof/waterproof for your snorkeling/scuba trips.

It is small enough to keep with me at all times and quick and easy enough to use.I always shoot RAW which allows amazing flexibility after the shoot. Like all compact cameras I've owned before, getting a stable shot is tricky - my digital SLR I can pull out and snap and generally get a sharp shot. Rarely so with a compact. I have to take more care to steady the camera to make sure, and take a few shots to make sure I get what I want. Small price to pay, a little caution and extra shooting and I always get what I want.Video is better than most cameras, if you want true HD or zooming while shooting, by a camcorder. If you get hung up by the lack of live shooting zoom, well, zooms are annoying in home and professional videos anyway, teach yourself to avoid it, it helps!This is the best compact camera I've ever owned. I shot 4000 pictures on it for a timelapse sequence just before christmas - in one day - and loved the results.
