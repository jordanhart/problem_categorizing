It came with everything an amateur photographer might need.  We like the fact that we can zoom when we want to without having to add an extra lens.  The pictures are crisp and we can take great video when we want to.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Kay", "ReviewID": "R13SYG5T3S9O5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my husband for fathers day.

Especially in low light. I mean no flash indoor pictures look great. Sharp and in focus every time. The batteries last a long too. Very easy to use. Glad I bought the kit and not just the camera alone. I love the view finder option too. Its my preferred method for shooting pictures.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Astrid N.
