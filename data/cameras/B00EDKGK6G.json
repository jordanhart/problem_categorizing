{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung WB200F Digital Camera", "Author": "Dan N.", "ReviewID": "R2QIDS7ASIEJRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife because she wanted a camera with a better optical zoom than her current camera. So far, having only used it for about one week, she's really happy with its performance. Pictures taken in low light, using the flash produce pictures that are very life-like, i.e., not washed out as some cameras tend to do. Outside, the zoom capabilities of the camera enable her to get close to far away objects without having to enlarge and crop as we had to do with cameras of lower zoom capabilities.Also, the ability of the camera to link up with our home's LAN network is very cool. Right after taking a picture, the photo can be sent directly to our printer or shared on Facebook, much like a smart phone can do.We'll keep playing with the camera to see what else it can do, but so far, we're both very happy with it. I'll post an updated review if and when we come up with any else to say.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$119.99", "Features": "An elegantly designed SMART CAMERA\nWi-Fi connectivity and a Hybrid Touch User Interface\nDelivers higher-quality close-ups, candids, and panoramas\n18x Zoom and 24mm wide-angle lens", "Name": "Samsung WB200F/WB250F Digital Camera 14.2 Megapixels 3-Inch Screen WiFi USB (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Vthz8nj0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EDKGK6G"}}
