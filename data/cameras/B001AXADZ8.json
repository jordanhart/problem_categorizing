The label on the box says \"almond\". I was expecting white based on photos.Picture quality is ok, not up to the level of other cameras in my system, but it's only 420 lines while my others are 600, for the location/use it's in, the lower res is ok, it's on a corner of my covered outdoor patio to keep an eye on the dogs.I have doubts about how long it will last due to the plastic construction, but for the price it's a reasonable value. The lens is very wide angle and gives a good viewing area, better than my usual bullet cams.Listing says a power adapter is not included, though I didn't need it, mine did come with one. Perhaps they grabbed the wrong box off the shelf as there is another listing that does include the power supply for a few dollars more.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "HomeCoder", "ReviewID": "R3QWKTCY7PP418", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is small, adjustable and affordable.
