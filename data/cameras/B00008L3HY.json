I had read the reviews on almost every 3-5MP digital cam on Amazon.com, and had several in the final running for my actual purchase.  This camera won the contest because of its high quality user interface, low light performance, and most of all its video mode capabilities.  Its the only camera I've seen that does a reasonably high quality video mode, with no time limits other than what your storage capability is.  Also the resolution of the video mode, and the fact that its in a very compatible format sealed the deal for me.  This camera is very intelligent when using the \"auto\" settings, and could definitely help anyone take better pictures.  For those like me, most of the features are manually controlable as well, in addition to saving manual settings to your own program.  One thing that didn't get mentioned in previous information about this camera is that it saves the settings information as part of each picture, so that you can go back later and compare which settings are working best for you and your picture taking styles.  I already recorded several movies and was astounded at the audio/video quality that I was presented with, I was able to connect it directly to the T.V. and the frame-rates and resolution were just fine for home-movie quality recording.  If you get tired of only having a camera, or only having a camcorder, and never both.  You have to take a look at this thing.  Also, this camera comes with 4 effects like Sepia, Black and White, Solarize, and Negative.  I was very pleased to find out that these effects can be used in BOTH the camera mode and video mode.  I was also amazed to see that in video mode that the zoom is available for use, and that the camera utilizes an auto-focus, much like your average camcorder.  For what I do, I did not need 5 megapixel.  I mostly print images smaller than 8x10, and much of my work ends up on my websites.  So I wanted to trade extra megapixels for features.  This was absolutely the right choice for me.  Also, the camera came with 2 nickel metal hydride AA batteries as well as a charger, USB cable, and television intervace RCA cables.  That is a lot of toys for the over-all price.  This camera has also gotten great marks for battery performance, and I wasn't able to kill them after playing all afternoon and evening on about half of a full charge.  I ended up having to put it on never-ending slide show mode to drain the batteries all the way down.  It took over 4 hours even then.", "Date": "April 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "My First Digital Camera", "Author": "cherrielectric \"Praise Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R3UEGSC4EDW1GU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have always put off getting a digital camera because I did not have much faith in the current \"at home\" printing technology.  But I changed my mind when I discovered I can have digital pictures printed profesionally.  I bought the Sony DSC-P72 in August this year and have not regretted my decision.  This is my first digital camera.  I like that it takes clear and crisp pictures.  It's flash and AF illuminator are powerful.  Allows some manual control over the settings to give help me get better pictures.  Menus are very user-friendly.  It took me only less than 2 hours to figure them out.  I also like the rechargeable batteries that came with it.  But if you're planning to go on trips better have an extra pair or two ready.  It also takes normal AA batteries.  Only two things I didn't like, the measly 16MB memory stick and the \"slow\" battery charger.  Get a 256MB memory stick and you're on your way to taking tons of pictures and a (fast) travel charger.  For those who are complaining that the camera cannot take multiple shots in quick succession, read the camera's instruction manual again.  You can either shoot in clip motion, multi-burst mode, or burst mode.  However, the picture quality will suffer if you use one of these modes.  Better shoot with a film camera since we all know that as of now, film cameras are still faster than digital.

The camera was a snap to use for this first time digital owner. Menu is excellent, focus does a terrific job, and the download to my computer was instint. Picture quality after I enlarged to 12 by 14 was superb. Sony supplies you with ni-mh batteries and charger, plus can use regular AA batteries.With Optical zoom, 3.2 megapixels, charger the $329.00 was normal but with sony quality. Memory stick media is getting cheap too, I purchased 128 m for $40.00 and 256 is available. I don't need more functions or 4 or 5 meg after using this camera!I also compared with our Canon A-70 to her Sony P-72 and I still love my A-70 though. Her P-72 was the same price and takes great shots as well. It just lacks manual aperature control and shutter control against the A70's ability to do so. However, the P-72 takes sweet shots too for the person who just wants the camera to do all of the work. Sony is top quality as well. But hey, this is a camera, not a camcorder!

My picture files had lots of pixels, but mediocre contrast and only so-so sharpness.

My guess is that the culprit in the Sony camera is the lens -- all the electronics seemed to work OK.Update,  May 17Since writing the above I have purchased a Canon A70,  which is comparable in size and price to this Sony...with the same number of megapixels.The Canon gives the photographer a lot more potential control,  including,  if one wishes,  the ability to set f stops and shutter speeds manually.

Hitay", "ReviewID": "R4SNZM5YUYJKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera and I must say I'm really impressed, it takes great pictures (I was personally impressed and 3.2MP is more than enough for me) and besides the pics, you can take very long movies as well! But of course you would have to use a bigger capacity memory stick (cause as everyone says, the supplied 16mb MS is just not enough) and record your movies until the card fills up. And the beautiful thing is that you can edit (divide, cut, delete the parts you don't want) your movies on the spot, so you can still save some more space by getting rid of those unwanted moments in your videos and still keep the good ones. There are so many good specs to this camera, yes it's true that it doesn't have the most extensive manual control options, but it certainly has much more than you would expect from a \"point and shoot\" camera. I simply love it, and I'm so happy for the day that I waved goodbye to 35mm cameras and film processing costs. I'm more than happy to keep all my photos on my computer and just print those which are special. This baby is full of pros, but the only con as I mentioned before, is that the supplied memory stick is just a tactic to make you buy a bigger one. 16MB doesn't do it (unless you only take lo-res pictures and no movies!)I also would like to add a comment to bpm003's review, about the LCD being off when the flash is charging. Despite what bpm003 thinks, this is definitely not a con, it is just the factory default \"battery saving mode\" which you can always change. This way it turns off the LCD to make the batteries last longer (also the camera activates the auto focus only when you half-press the shutter) whereas if you turn the battery saving option off, you can enjoy the instant playback of the images (by simply pressing the quick review button) and not worry about the LCD turning off, plus the camera focuses more quickly even when you don't press the shutter, so you can take quicker shots. Just wanted to make this clear.The bottom line is anyhow, you'll like this camera very much if you're looking for a P&S; camera.

I thought hard about buying the FUJI with the 6X zoom but am very glad to have bought the Sony instead.  In comparison to my buddy's FUJI, it takes TERRIFIC PICTURES IN LOW LIGHT SITUATIONS.  This is key- the picture doesn't black out at parties/indoor graduations/weddings, etc.  As an experiment, I took several pictures of my girlfriend's dog in near-complete darkness.  They turn out beautifully- the illumination feature for this camera's autofocus/rangefinder is very powerful.  Very few cameras in this price range have this capability (I checked).  Also- this camera has a TERRIFIC BUNDLE, making it a great value.  I figure the charger itself is worth $.., and it uses standard-sized AA batteries.  They are interchangeable with the rechargeables on your walkman, meaning that you're not stuck with buying $.. \"battery paks\" that don't fit anything else in your house.  Only two minor quibbles:  the camera automatically defaults to a \"no flash\"/energy saver mode every time it is turned on and off.  This feature is irritating and you will probably miss some good shots because of it.  Also, the shutter speed is slow.  But this is true of all digital cameras.

Cowart \"Tmortn\"", "ReviewID": "R35O5AYA77KCI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Can't say much that hasn't been said about the camera itself so I will mostly just mention a few tricks for dealing with some of the issues many people have brought up regarding this camera. One note.. the video with sound capability is underated if anything. While it is deffinatly not a replacement for a cam corder, its portability makes it far more practical and less obtrusive for capturing 'moments'. With 256mb you have about 12 minutes of recording. Quality is around 15-22fps at 640x480( think webcam ). Additionally if you drop it to the lower quality you have more than 2 hours of recording time. However, while the sound quality will be the same, the image will be pretty pixilated.Many have complained about the slow shutter speed ( as in the time between pushing the button and the picture being taken ) but there is at least one way to get around it in certain circumstances. Provided you have enough light to forgoe the flash you can hold the button partially down and it will spot autofocus, then once it locks in it will immediately take the picture when you fully depress the button. Practice by trying to capture shots on the TV... sporting events are geat for this, especially when they do replays. It will give you a good feel for the timing of the camera.It sounds tricky but the button sensitivity actually makes this very easy, To engage the spot autofocus you basically just need to rest your finger on the button, then actually pushing it requires a deffinate increase in effort. Additionally, using both single point AF and spot metering will make the process even faster. Not perfect but an improovement over the general performance if you are trying to catch fleeting moments.In low light indoor shooting you can up the ISO to 400 and increase the exposure to attempt some flashless shots using this technique. Taking the time to steady the camera in some way will help immensely. If you think tripods are expensive try some of the table top versions, there is one at Bestbuy that goes for a whopping $11 and does a great job.When the flash is being used I have yet to find a way around the delay completely, however if you turn off the red eye feature the amount of pre flash will be decreased which will lessen the delay. Red eye can be manipulated on the computer with a little effort.I would never bother using the digital portion of the zoom. Just keep your image setting at the highest quality and you will have all of the same information anyway and more freedom in choosing how you want to crop the image later as there will be more image to work with. Even if you use lower quality to preserve memory I would suggest switching to the high quality to take any shots where you start zooming beyond the optical 3x max. Again you will have all the information you would have had using the 'smart' zoom and will have more options when editing later or even on the camera itself... the same goes for the solarize,bw, and sepia functions. All of those effects can be done later from the full color picture, full color pictures however can not be regenrated from pictures taken with these effects selected on the camera. A negative can be turned into a normal shot by filtering it using a negative image editing effect to get the negative of the negative.", "Date": "April 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "fantastic camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R30OIKU4M1KYBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Camera is everything that we needed from a digital camera and more.

If however, you can afford the 5MP Optical (Sony P92 Cybershot) purchase that instead.  That is not to say, in any way, that the 3.2MP Optical is not a good purchase.  It is.  The difference is a slightly better image quality and higher price.  The P92 will allow you to zoom in a little closer and provide more detailed images.  Specifically, the P92 provides 3X optical with 4X digital for a total of 12X or quality prints up 20 x 30\", while the P72 provides 3X optical with 3.2X digital for a total of 9.6X for quality prints up to 11 x 14\".  Currently (January 2004) the price difference is about $70.00.  The extra money might be worth it if you're the type to say, \"I wish I could have gotten in just a *little* closer ...\"  Specifics: The P72 has all the standard bells and whistles that come with higher priced cameras such as auto focus, auto exposure, night mode, etc. (click on the PDF link for the manual if you have specifics you're wondering about).  At the time of my purchase (September 2003) I had three main requirements for a digital camera: at least 3.0X optical, a movie mode and it had to be around $300.00 or less.  There were many good, even excellent, quality digital cameras that offered all three including this one.  However, the movie mode for this camera is the bomb!!  It was the final thing that sold me on it.  Again, at the time of my purchase, most digital cameras only allowed for about a 30 second movie mode without sound.  The P72's movie mode is only limited by the size of the memory stick used *and* it records with sound!  Really good sound!  (The sound quality actually surprised me a little.)  A 128MB memory stick can record up to 5+ minutes (10+ with a double sided 128MB) and a MSX-1G memory stick (if you can afford one) can record up to 44+ minutes!  Unless you need long uninterrupted recording time (say for an entire wedding or graduation) who needs a camcorder?!  This is smaller and lighter to carry and the image quality is just as good.  In addition, Sony includes a cable that allows you to plug the camera directly into your VCR or DVD recorder's audio and visual jacks allowing you to record/copy your movies directly to VHS or DVD with full screen image quality.  Or, you can plug the camera directly into your computer via USB connection on the back of the camera (again Sony includes a cable) to burn images to a CD or DVD.  How cool is that?!  But wait there's more.  Sony has a 1.7X telephoto lens and adapter (Item numbers VCL-DH1730 and VAD-PEA respectively) that work on both the P72 and P92 (as well as the P8 and P10) that takes the total zoom times even higher!  I highly recommend these additional accessories especially since with the purchase of the camera Sony will probably provide at least one discount coupon you can use towards their purchase.  In general: The camera is easy to use - especially if you read the directions and manual *before* you use it like you should with anything.  (Often people gripping about problems haven't read their manuals.  You know who you are.)  :)  It's compact and lightweight.  It's great for trips or just to have at the ready.

I'd have to say it exceeded my expectations, but I can't really compare it to other models. One pleasant surprise, among several, for me is that the camera can take quite serviceable MPEG videos with sound. This fact has rolled back my schedule for acquiring a a digital camcorder. Most 3 megapixel digital cameras can take video but often with restrictions on length or without sound. The P72 will take video as long as there is memory stick capacity. (I have a 256 MB memory stick ([$$$], July 2003) and can probably get more than 10 minutes of video on it. BTW, resist the temptation to rotate the camera 90 degrees to take \"portrait mode\" videos; while it is generally easy to rotate still pictures with the included software, this does not seem to be the case with MPEG. The P72 comes with two AA formfactor NiMH batteries and a charger, something to keep in mind when doing price comparisons. I've also successfully used AA alkalines, which exhaust much more quickly than the NiMHs. I think my main disappointment is the Pixela software; I struggled along with it and got some use. However, I recently put an HP photo scanner into service and started using its bundled software, instead, and find it much better for organizing and navigating a collection of photos.I can definitely recommend the P72 as a combination point-and-shoot/short-video camera and, as a beginner, I've founddigital photography to more rich than expected, and I expected it to be good.", "Date": "July 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good starting camera", "Author": "John P. Thompson", "ReviewID": "R3NONX1AFNOJLC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera back in the summer of 2003, primarily for my trip to Europe. The camera didn't dissapoint.My only gripe is that some of my pictures from the beaches of france are a little grainy...may have been the humidity(as it was really hot in all of europe that summer) that messed things up...and I was on the beach with my camera... all day.While those photos aren't bad...the quality isn't up to par with the rest of my photos from the trip and back at home.One other gripe I have about the camera is the \"zoom\" sound the thing makes...it gets annoying and only draws attention to you in quiet areas(like the beach or a museum). Sometimes the color wasn't what I had hoped it to be either...maybe I didn't have on the right settings but I didn't think it caught the colors of the sky too well. Eh.Enough with my whining...this camera is pretty darn good. The ability to zoom in with the optical...and zoom in with the digital is great...you can never take a bad picture. If you're taking shots from any distance...it is good to zoom in all the way with the optical...just so you can zoom in again closer with the digital and take another high quality photo from that.This camera is also very strong. I got sand in it...and the shutter eye was kinda [messed up] for a bit(which may have to do with why some pictures didn't turn out so well)...but after awhile it kinda just fixed itself. The shutter protecting the lens began to open all the way again and works great. I also dropped my camera once and my memory card went flying...thankfully the camera still worked great...and I was able to find my memory card(in the dark no less)...and the camera doesn't even have a scratch on it from the instance. The camera is very strong. What seperates this camera out from the less sony series...the p52 and p7 is it's ability to take movies with audio. The quality is pretty darn good for a digital camera. Playing movies I've taken on my computer...they are in excellent quality from like 4 by 6 inches or so...distorted quality when you put it on full screen...but hey...if I want full screen I'll save my pennies for an actual camcorder, right? The audio is pretty good too from my experience...not as crystal clear as if you were actually there...but decent enough where you can understand clearly what is being said.Overall, I'm pretty darn happy with the camera. Are there better camera out on the market? yeah...maybe...Canon's are supposed to be pretty good and some people I met travelling had those and they were cool...but the P72 is pretty good from my experience.This camera is cheaper from when I bought it...and it's bigger brothers are fairly cheap too. So if you're set on getting a camera, and this one in particular, ask yourself what kind of money you're willing to spend...(this is fairly affordable now) and do you want 2 more megapixels(this camera's original price for 2 more megapixels). This technology just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper though too. So that is something else you wanna figure into your purchase...do you need a digital camera now?

Among the 3 contenders was the FujiFinePix A301, Olympus 520D and the Sony DSC-P72.  Each has their nice features but the Sony was by far the most feature rich.  The MX MPEG movie format by far the best movie format that I've seen on these digital cameras.  The Sony has full sound and 640x480 resolution (great for displaying on the TV) and will record for as long as you have Memory Stick space.  I've made numerous little movies that were spur of the moment that I certainly would not have thought to bring out my camcorder.  The photo's are excellent and the menu system very intuitive.  Navigation is nice but like other cameras, the nestling of the file directories is somewhat tedious to navigate through.  The biggest disappointment was with the included software.  The Imagemixer is a mediocre software at best, not that easy to use and very limited features.  Sony does not even provide a image browser for those folks that just want to see the pictures and maybe put up a quick slideshow.  Cannon at least has the ZoomBrowserEX software, Sony doesn't give anything.

Cemendtaur", "ReviewID": "R2PF4I1UVKQ1S5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony DSC-P72 is my first digital camera.  I am writing this review four months after buying the camera because I have been busy--busy taking a lot of pictures.  The magic of the digital camera still enthralls me.  You press the button, a lot of things happen inside the camera, and a jpeg file, comprising the photo you took, is stored on the memory card.  No need to worry about buying film or spending money in developing it.  I wonder what took me so long to switch to the digital technology.Well, I think I should move beyond my encomium of digital photography and give you some information about DSC-P72.  I believe DSC-P72 is the right camera for beginner to intermediate level photographers: for beginners who don't have any experience with digital cameras, and for intermediate-level photographers whose first digital camera was a paltry 1.2 Mega pixels or thereabouts and lacked any maneuvering capability.  The DSC-P72 can take up to 3.2 Mega pixel pictures (it can take lesser resolution pictures too) and has a lot of features you can play with.  You can make this normally-color camera to take black and white, negative, solarize, or sepia styled pictures.  In its basic mode it is very easy to operate.  Just click the button and take a picture.  And if you want to go for more sophistication you can always press the menu button or go to the `set up' and change the settings there.  Its slight weakness is in taking pictures using the in-built flash.  You can't just take pictures click click click.  After taking a picture with a flash the screen goes blank for a few seconds and a little lights keep flashing.  You can take the next picture when the camera recovers and the screen starts showing the view.  The DSC-P72's metallic silver body looks sturdy and I believe it can take a little abuse.  This workhorse is small enough in size to be slipped into a picket.The DSC-P72 can even make movies, in three modes.  The easiest to use mode is that of making a motion picture.  Unlike many other digital cameras (purportedly preset to take movie clips of 30 seconds or shorter) the DSC-P72 can make a movie of as long a duration as the space on your memory card.  This camera can also make animation clips, though I neither understand that feature nor have used it.Once you become proficient with the camera you can start making folders on your memory card to sort the pictures as you take them.  The camera let's you make folders but won't let you delete them from the menu; to delete the folders you would have to reformat the memory stick--something I do after each transfer of the pictures to my computer.The 16 MB memory card that comes with the camera is obviously small in picture-storing capacity.  A normal picture, at 3.2 Mega pixels, would take 800 kbyte to 1.3 Megabyte space.  After realizing that the best use of the digital camera is to take several pictures of the same shot (and later decide which ones you want to keep) I bought a 256MB memory card over the Internet.  I can now store over 120 pictures on that card.Transferring pictures from DSC-P72 to computer is a breeze.  I just hook up the digital camera to my Apple computer via the cable that came with the camera, turn the camera switcher to `preview', and turn on the camera.  The Apple senses the presence of the camera, opens up iPhoto, and asks me if I want to import pictures from the camera.  I am sure transferring pictures to a PC is equally simple.  I have found a very effective way of obtaining prints of my choicest pictures.  Once the pictures are on the computer I upload them for free on Ofoto.com (a Kodak subsidiary) and order prints at 30 cents/each of the selected pictures.The DSC-P72 comes with two NiMH rechargeable batteries and a re-charger that you can connect to a standard wall outlet.  It is a good idea to buy an extra pair of batteries.  I have an extra set.  I have made it a habit to put one set in the re-charger and put the re-charged set of batteries in the camera, after each session.I don't have a lot of experience with other digital cameras, but I am pretty happy with my DSC-P72 and I'll highly recommend it.", "Date": "August 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nothing Better !!", "Author": "SiriusVector", "ReviewID": "R1LAJH3XWJTKAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best Digital Camera I have come across.

I read somewhere that if you do a lot of cropping, a 3 megapix will start to lose its clarity.  Nonetheless, this is a remarkable point and shoot camera, easy to operate and the rechargable AA batteries are the best.

Still working, but somewhat battered and still hard to use, I replaced it with this Sony.If you want to buy a digital camera for fun use, for amateur picture-taking, for ease and for a good value, this is a great camera for you. The camera body is neither too small nor too big, and can fit in your purse or small bag for everyday use (I keep mine with me all the time). The menu is simple, the settings easy to master, and there's still quite a variety to work with. I found the shutter lag to be minimal, though slightly longer when using a flash. Zoom isn't exceptional, but it's standard to this class of digital camera. Last but not least, the video function is nothing short of phenomenal for a digital still camera: you get 640x480 video with sound, with clips as long as your memory card allows. Let's put it this way: the quality is just as good as an old home movie's. Perfect for someone who wants to play around with digital video a little.Of course the camera only comes with a 16 MB Sony memory stick; it's pointless to mention this as a detraction so *no* digital camera comes with much more. You have to buy memory for cameras; it's the price you pay for not having to buy film, and that's all there is to it. Memory sticks are certainly readily available, and the new Sony Memory Stick Pro series holds a lot of pics.But now for the only negative comment I'll make in this review: I mentioned at the beginning that I was using a 5.0 megapixel camera before this. As I needed to replace that, I went for a better brand and lower MP, thinking it wouldn't be that noticeable. Sadly... it was. I miss the higher resolution.

But cards are relatively cheap these days [money amount]for 128 MB so not a big deal.However I have to agree with PC World magazine this camera is too slow especially when taking photos in lower light conditions.  The action that you want to capture will be long over before this camera takes the shot.  It takes a pre-flash and then 1-2 seconds later takes the actual shot with another flash.  I couldn't even get a shot of my Lab trying to take a treat out of my wife's hands and I tried 3 times.  Never had this problem with my last camera which was an Olympus.  Also when preview the pics on the LCD the photos start out blurry and then after a second or so they focus in.

Of course, some light source is DEFINITELY necessary, but it deals with especially \"dark\" conditions and actually \"brightens\" the picture so that when you see it on your computer, it looks the SAME way as we humans actually see!

I did a lot of research to figure out the features I wanted (1) at least 3 MP, (2)video with audio and (3) at least 3x optical zoom.  The camera is very easy to use.  I got it while I was on vacation and didn't really read the manual, just started taking pix.  When I got home I used the Lexar USB to transfer the images/movies on the memory stick.  (BTW, the Lexar worked great.)  I was very pleasantly surprised at how sharp and vivid the pictures are, and how easy it is to transfer to the computer (I had also considered a Kodak and the Canon).  I love having the movie w/audio, which actually took some nice clips of a family ping pong game.  The movie length is limited only by memory, unlike Canon which has a 3 min. limit.  Also, unlike Fujis and Nikons, the Sony has audio.  I didn't experience any slow \"shutter\" -- except in very low light situations -- and even then I thought it was tolerable, considering I didn't expect much based on what I heard about earlier dig. cameras.  It also comes w/batteries and charger which is nice.  128K memory stick is a must.  I did buy the Sony brand sticks just because the first one produced such good color that I've stuck with it, but may try the Lexar stick bcz that has gotten good reviews too.  For my next camera, I will probably get a 4x optical zoom, because it would be nice to have a longer zoom function, but all in all this is a good camera at a good price.", "Date": "September 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good camera but similar issues", "Author": "D.

The strange power off/with lens open, then reversing. The only thing I've done is immediately remove the batteries after turning on the camera while pushing the lens in. it works!I have a suggestion for those of you with blurry pictures. This camera has 5-6 settings for the quality of photos. If you press the trash icon button while in regular mode (do not have an image up screen) the menu for image size will appear. These are jgs folks. They are pixel based and can be very small. Also jpgs are meant for screen viewing, not printing, so you need to boost them up in order to get decent prints from these images.  If you want clear images..please try to use the highest setting possible in order for the camera to record as many pixels of information. I use the highest setting 3.1M (other options are 2.8M, 2.0, 1.2 and VGA (which is the lowest and will give you terribly blurry picutres). It's quite easy to mistakenly press this button and change the image size, (this happened to us once while on vacation..terribly frustrating when I discovered what should have been beautiful, mmemorable photos were all at a low resolution.)

It's a hardy camera that works well, the buttons are well-placed and easy to learn, making stuff like deleting and viewing photos, adjusting image size, using the timer a piece of cake.I especially love that you can take good quality movies with this camera, it doesn't restrict the movies to 30 second short films like some other cameras, the only limit is the storage space in your memory stick. The movies have good sound and picture quality. Another good pt is that it uses rechargable AA-size batteries, making it easy and cheap to replace the batteries when it dies. I bought a pair of spare AA batts and use them alternately. The batteries are dying now that it's been a year but considering the usage, I think it's reasonable to replace the battaries once a year.the only complain I have is that the LCD screen tends to black out whenever I use the flash. In fact, the flash seems to eat up alot of the batteries, a couple of shots using flash kind of clean up most remaining battery life. But if you switch the camera off for a few moments, it might return to normal. As I rarely use the flash, its never been much of a problem for me. All in all, its a good camera for people like me that uses it for touring and family events. It's a good camera size too. I originally liked the Canon Ixus and thought that size was perfect. But after trying my friends' Ixus, I find that such a small size is not suitable for me, as I have weak hands and my photos with such a small camera tend to come out blurred. No such problem with this camera though, the weight is just right to steady my hands. However, it's a compact camera that's easy to bring around.In one line, I really like this camera.

It fits in a shirt pocket with room to spare.  It does short video snippets with sound well.  And the corner vignetting is an improvement over the P31.  But the light metering sometimes saturates (burns out) parts of pictures, it does not focus for macro imaging (the P31 does a great job with this) and waiting for the lens to move is slow.  Also, you need to carry extra batteries because this eats power, but, fortunately, rechargeable AAs are cheap.  Having a real physical zoom is an improvement, but this camera doesn't zoom in that close.  And 3 megapixels really aren't that much better than 2.
