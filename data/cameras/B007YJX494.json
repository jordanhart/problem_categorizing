It recycles fast, gives decent picture  results. Small & compact. The camera does have numerous settings  for various conditions you may want to snap a pic and an ISO from 100 to 26800, believe it or not.!! White balance setting and many more. Her favorite color is Pink so I couldn't go wrong in my selection. Price was right.  She is usually happy about the decisions I make and agrees with them. Yes, I know, there have been times when the dirty looks appear, but it's not that often. I researched the camera to what I thought her likes & dislikes would be and I think she'll be happy.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$158.79", "Features": "16.2 megapixels\n5X optical zoom\n2.7-inch LCD\nFull HD 1080/60i with dual record of stills and movies\nPicture Effect for more expressive photos", "Name": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (New Model) Pink", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51agm2CRe9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007YJX494"}}
