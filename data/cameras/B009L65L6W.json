{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera but so so bundle", "Author": "J Monica", "ReviewID": "R1L6AIV18QZTO8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This bundle could be an awesome deal, but it comes up short.First the positives; The camera is awesome. I've had a Lumix FZ30 for years and my photo's have always been so beautiful, but I wanted a faster higher rez camera and the FZ200 fit the bill. The only thing I've seen that I don't like, compared with my FZ30, is the manual mode. The FZ200 adjusts the zoom and focus all from a series of buttons and switches while in manual, I'd rather it was more like the FZ30 where the lens could be twisted to zoom and focus, more like a DSLR.  Also a positive is the seller, Willoughby's. The spare battery that was a part of the bundle arrived dead and unable to be charged. I called Willoughby's and without hesitation they they replaced it. For me, that says a lot about them as a company...  Now for the negatives, in my opinion the bundle is just barely worth the extra cost. The Battery, SD, SD reader, and camera case were all fine and worth the price barely. The lenses however are disappointing. The 2.5x telephoto for example, fits well and looks high quality and does provide some magnification, but it renders the autofocus useless and causes a cloudy image. So yes it does what it says but i'll never use it because the resultant image is so poor. The aftermarket lenses are made by Zeikos.  SO if you're buying the bundle for the lenses, I'd say don't, the camera has beautiful optics.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "25-600mm f/2.8 Leica Optical Zoom Lens\nLSI Venus Engine Image Processor\n3.0\" Free Angle 460K-dot LCD Display\n0.2\" Electronic View Finder w/ 100% FOV\n12 fps Continuous Shooting", "Name": "Panasonic DMC-FZ200 Camera + 0.45X Wide Angle Lens + 2x Telephoto Lens + Lowepro Bag + Battery + 32GB (10) Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JZSZWIGKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009L65L6W"}}
