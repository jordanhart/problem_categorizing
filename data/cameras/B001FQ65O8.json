Rather than using a plain white background against whichthe black printing contrasts, this product utilizes various shades of color background, thus reducing thecontrast between the print and the background.  Unless one has the visual acuity of a Wall Street lawyer used to reading very fine print, I would caution against buying this product.The  information presented regarding the Nikon D700 digital SLR camera is excellent, but what good is itif it can't be readily seen?", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review of a Nikon D700 condensed instruction sheet", "Author": "Robert L.
