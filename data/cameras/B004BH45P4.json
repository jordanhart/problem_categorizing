{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT PACKAGE DEAL!", "Author": "BC \"NY City Knight\"", "ReviewID": "R18GXTPMSYNIN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually went to B&H; photo to see if they would price match this package price(sorry 47th street photo) and they just shut me down.  They went on to say there was no way you can get all that for such a price.  I showed them the printouts so they could clearly see you can.  Then they went on and on about how they do not believe 47th is an authorized canon dealer...well, they actually are.  After 20 minutes of B&H; hustling me to buy the Canon G12 at their store (for 20 dollars more I might add) I just was turned off by their hustling BS and so i left.  I decided to give 47th Street photo a call to see if I can go to their actual store so I can pick up this great bundle.  When I spoke to a salesperson he explained they were now just an online store but he can have the package delivered to me by the next day, he was extremely helpful, polite, professional and informative.  I decided to put the order through Amazon since I had a credit with them...lol.The package was delivered in a timely manner.  Of course the camera is great and has excellent reviews already so i won't get into that.  What I will get into is the package.  The extra lens filters and attachments are awesome and when used with the camera allow you to even better your photography options.  The lens filter case came with Opteka brand neutral density, circular polarizer, macro, UV and fluorescent lens filters which attached very nicely to the G12 when using the adapter it also came with.  It also came with a telephoto and wide angle (which separates to become another macro) lens attachments.  Again, a really good amount of picture taking option attachments.  Along with all of that I received a very sturdy and well-padded Samsonite camera carrying case, 54 inch Opteka professional tripod (pretty sturdy, light and very collapsible and portable), an extra battery along with a quick one hour battery charger which comes with a car lighter adapter), a lens cleaning kit and an extra pocket size mini tripod.  A GREAT ALL AROUND PACAKGE!!!...I'm so happy with this purchase.I will definitely shop from 47th Street photo moving forward...their prices are REALLY competitive and their customer service is top notch.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Master Accessory Kit Package and The Canon Powershot G15", "Author": "S.

I have been researching cameras for a few months now, and I decided on the Canon Powershot G15. Well I was about to purchase one when I saw this ad offering all of these accessories with the camera for $30 more. Amazon and47th Street Photo are an awesome combination. Free shipping was the icing on the cake. I now have more than I know what to do with, but I plan on learning. I think all this set may lack is the optional flash. BTW, I ordered it and received it in 5 days. Way to go!", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Value for a Great camera with accessories", "Author": "Victor K. Neumann \"DRM MKR\"", "ReviewID": "RLF0WN346R3DY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off the G15 is a phenomenal camera and it absolutely Rocks. I bought this after researching for months the best low light compact for my needs. What ultimately sold me was the 1.8 to 2.8 ultra fast lens, the newer DIGIC 5 processor combined with CMOS sensor, and the super fast focusing speeds. I'm thrilled with the all around performance but this compact really does shine in low light situations. The build quality is superb. It's a gorgeous looking and feeling camera. It takes excellent pictures.As to the package itself, it's a pretty good value for all the stuff you get. Consider that your getting a little carry bag, and a couple of tripods (one to table mount the camera, the other a normal descent enough tripod for a compact). HDMI cable, extra battery pack, cleaning kit,etc. As to the Opteka len's and filters, I consider them just a bonus though I really haven't used them and I'm not sure if I will. The camera is so phenomenal that I've yet to use them. I did opt for and use the Carry Speed MagFilter Adapter ring so that I can snap a good polarizing filter on in a hurry without having to use that ugly looking adapter tube. This package definitely gives you a great value for your dollar", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "The pacakage was uncompleted", "Author": "M Carmen Barquin Ll", "ReviewID": "R1N1S67LFT4QX6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first time I am disappointed with amazon, the package arrived perfectly and on time, there is nothing wrong with the camera, the problem is that it came uncompleted, the extra battery was missing, everything else is  fine", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.08", "Features": "5x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens\n12.1 MP High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor with DIGIC 5 Image Processor\n1080p Full HD Video With a Dedicated Movie Button\nHigh-speed AF, High-speed Burst HQ for a maximum of 10 frames\nDeluxe Accessory Kit", "Name": "Master Accessory Kit Package For The Canon Powershot G15 Featuring Canon Powershot G15 Digital Camera, Opteka Microfiber Deluxe Photo/Video Camera Bag, 8Gb High Speed Memory Card, Extra Battery Pack + 1 Hour AC/DC Battery Charger + More", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YVTxwkq6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004BH45P4"}}
