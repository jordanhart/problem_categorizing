{"Reviews": [{"Title": "quality, size & value", "Author": "philosoph", "ReviewID": "R2U6IEW3CUTLDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the E-620 for a few weeks now and am quite pleased.  Other options I considered were the Nikon D5000, Canon T1i & XSi, Panasonic G1, Sony A300 & A350, and Pentax K200D & K20D.  Some comments with comparison notes:1) SIZE & WEIGHT -- There's no point in having a camera that is so bulky that it doesn't get much use. Only the Panasonic G1 is smaller than the E-620 but not by much.  There is a more dramatic difference in the size of the lenses, with Olympus being much smaller than all but Panasonic.  Makes for a very compact outfit. For anyone used to the size of film SLRs, the E-620 is very similar. My wife also found it the most comfortable for her to hold.2) BUILD QUALITY & HANDLING -- Very impressed with Olympus here. Solid, dense and with lots of sensibly placed buttons for direct access to settings. The other cameras had a less solid, plasticy feel, and their larger grips still weren't large enough for a comfortable pistol grip with my average size hands. The Sonys, in particular, had awkward button placement. The E-620 has a different style of grip where you hold the camera in the same way as old film SLRs, and is more appropriate to such a small camera. I carry the camera comfortably in my *left* hand, grasping the body and lens barrel with my fingers on the zoom ring; this frees my right hand from having to support the camera while working controls, and leaves my good hand open (I'm a righty).3) LENSES -- The kit zooms from Olympus are reputed to be of higher quality than the others, as well as being more compact. So far I have been very impressed. I didn't want to buy a camera only to feel the kit lenses needed replacing; I'd rather spend on lenses that offer new capabilities, like fast primes or dedicated macro lenses. For anyone interesting in using legacy manual focus lenses, inexpensive adapters are available to attach virtually any MF SLR lens to Olympus bodies; used lenses can be quite inexpensive on eBay. Panasonic is limited by a very small range of lenses. For a two lens kit, the E-620 was the cheapest option.4) IMAGE QUALITY -- I wanted to spend my time taking pictures, not fiddling with them in post-processing; Olympus has the best out-of-camera JPGs of the bunch (Canon and Pentax, in particular, fall short here). Although the smaller Olympus sensors are reputed to be a bit noisier, what noise there is is primarily luminance noise, giving images a film-like grain, rather than the colored blotches of chroma noise.  I've found noise very well controlled through ISO1000, even with noise reduction set to LOW. For printing up through 8x10 and monitor display, I don't think noise is a concern up through ISO1600 (certainly with noise reduction set to standard). One caveat: be sure to keep gradation set at NORMAL (the default), not AUTO, unless you really need it; using AUTO gradation will noticeably increase noise.5) IN BODY STABILIZATION -- I prefer in body stabilization to lens-based stabilization for two reasons: in body works with all lenses, and lenses can be more compact. You only carry one body but you are likely to carry multiple lenses, so it pays to keep them small.6) LIVE VIEW & LCD -- Olympus has the best live view implementation (maybe tied with Sony) with quite quick autofocus. This is very important if you want anyone, e.g. my wife or random bystanders, who's used to compact cameras to use your SLR for snapshots or the like. The tilt & swivel LCD is very handy and seemed more natural than Nikon or Sony's implementations.Overall, I found the E-620 to be the best value for a two lens kit.Here are a few notes on the other cameras I considered:Nikon D5000 -- Good build & handling, but a bit bulky. Live view isn't great. Much more expensive for a two lens kit than the Olympus.Canon T1i -- Not impressed by the build quality, felt plasticy. Not comfortable for me to hold. Out of camera JPGs not so good. Inferior kit lenses. Much more expensive for a two lens kit than the Olympus.Canon XSi -- Not impressed by the build quality, felt plasticy. Not comfortable for me to hold. Out of camera JPGs not so good. Bulkier than the Olympus.  Inferior kit lenses.Panasonic G1 -- Limited lens selection; will take legacy MF lenses but doesn't offer image stabilization with them since it isn't in the body.  Plasticy.  Not much smaller than the Olympus.  More expensive than Olympus for a two lens kit.Sony A300 & A350 -- Hated the button placement--ruled them out on that alone. Live view is very good though.Pentax K200D & K20D -- Poor out of camera JPGs. Great handling and build quality. Short on features. Kit lenses aren't great. No live view / live view useless.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great images with less weight", "Author": "Robert Bell", "ReviewID": "R3495LSSLA46WY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had an E-620 for about a month, and with each photo I'm finding more to like about it.Any camera represents a series of compromises as the manufacturer trades weight vs. features vs. cost vs. ergonomics vs. image quality. Any purchase decision should be based on how those particular trade-offs jibe with the intended use. None of the name-brand cameras in this price range that I've looked at are bad. But, for me and for the type of photography I do now, the E-620 is the closest fit.Number one is the available lenses. Read the reviews of the kit zooms such as the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS with its chromatic aberration and the Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S VR DX with its barrel distortion. Unlike the Olympus Zuiko Digital 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 ED, both have front elements that rotate when you focus, making the use of a polarizer or a petal-type hood difficult. Unlike the Olympus, both have manual focus rings that can't be used without shifting the lens out of autofocus. Yes, Canon and Nikon make other lenses that are sharper, faster, heavier and more expensive -- so does Olympus. But if you want to use the kit lens, the Olympus one gets better reviews.Olympus also makes a sharp and handy Zuiko Digital 35mm f/3.5 Macro, which has been spending more time on my E-620 than either of the kit lenses. For me, it's a great walking-around lens, good for both environmental portraits and product shots. On the other hand, if I needed a 600mm f/4 or a 14mm f/2.8, I'd have gotten a Canon or a Nikon.The E-620 has in-body image stabilization, which means you buy it once and haul it around once, instead of adding weight and cost to every lens. Again, one could argue that at the extreme high end in-lens image stabilization is better, but I don't live at the extreme high end.I had thought that the E-620's live view would be a gimmick, but it's quite useful zoomed in 10 times for manual focus on a copy stand- or tripod-mounted camera for macro work. You can easily assign the E-620's Fn button to auto white balance when you need it, and just as easily re-assign it to toggle face detect or autofocus on and off when that's what you prefer.In the kit with the 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and the 40-150mm f/4-5.6, the E-620 is currently priced comparably to the Nikon D60 and its kit 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 VR lens plus a Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6 VR lens and to the Canon Rebel XS and its kit 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens plus a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS lens.The E-620 lacks the D60's manual focus indicator and separate autofocus assist light, while the Nikon lacks the Olympus' dedicated ISO and white balance select buttons and has only three autofocus points. Like the Olympus, the Canon has seven autofocus points, but it has a very awkwardly placed exposure compensation button. All three cameras have a viewfinder with 95 percent frame coverage, but the E-620 has a magnification of 0.96x, compared to 0.8x for the D60 and 0.81x for the Rebel XS.The E-620; the 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6, the 40-150mm f/4-5.6, the 35mm f/3.5 Macro; and an FL-36R flash in a Domke F-3X bag weigh 6 pounds, less than the equivalent Nikon and Canon kits and far less than what I schlepped around when I was shooting film. The best camera is the one you have with you.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very competitive mid entry dslr", "Author": "Waqas Mustafeez \"waqasm\"", "ReviewID": "R1LMWFATGNFPUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the E-620 for about a week and i moved from a E-510. E-510 was my first DSLR and using that over the years i have been very satisfied and happy with the 510 especially due to the in body image stabilization and lens line-up. Liveview was also a plus over competitors but i never really used it unless it was really dark or i needed to manual focus.Some things on the E-510 that were aging and were kind of the few weak points of the entry level E series was the 3 point autofocus system, small viewfinder and low light focusing. The lcd was so so too but for an SLR i don't see why a high pixel LCD should be important.. sure its good to have one but its not important.Anyhow the E-620 really improves all these problems and really becomes a strong no compromise camera; worthy of buying just because its excellent.. not because its great value as was the case for me for the E-510.1) The viewfinder is much larger; suitable for manual focusing.2) now has 7 points - 5 cross (which is better then any entry slr .. d5000, t1i etc included). -- now that Ive had sometime to try out the imager AF; ill say that although its not the fastest AF system (talking about the hybrid mode as i don't have compatible lenses for standalone imager mode) -- it works very reliably in low light conditions; better then the phase detect sensor on its own. Using liveview to compose night shots many times i found my e510 hunting and eventually taking out of focus shots forcing complete manual focus-- hybrid mode definitely lets you use AF in seriously dark conditions.3) nice flipping LCD which again trumps the other 2 boys in the group in terms of utility.4) Much better tone curves/gradation/dynamic range.. people argue .. i don't know.. i just know that highlight and shadow information is retained very well. Of course jpgs turn out nice due to the gradation but there is dynamic range improvement visible in raw too.Some things that have continued to be Olympus selling points5) in body image stabilization6) Excellent body quality... compare it to canon entry levels and see what i mean7) Very strong, potentially the best lens line-up out there. kit lenses being outstanding value for money -- you can start taking good photographs right away.. unlike kit lenses from others.Some other feature like the Art filters and multiple exposure (over laying multiple photos) are just a side for most people. Id say all of them are aesthetically pleasing filters and fun to try-- if you use them, you still have your raw file to do off camera processing. But id say that these features to me are like the video recording by canon and nikon -- just a pleasant aside but not really what dslr photography has been about (at least in the past).The issue of high ISO with oly has always been there, some thoughts:I like the extra ISO steps and use the ISO 160 as standard ( people say 200 gives best DR in comparison to 100 -- but i think 160 is slightly better then 200)In contrast to canons move up to 15MP for the 50D and t1i-- Olys move from 10 to 12.3MP you will find actually better high iso performance then the E-510 and 520. ISO 1250 is about comparable to 1600 of others. id say upto ~ 1250 is useable. Notice that 15MP and over the APS-C pixel density actually goes above the 10MP 4/3rd sensor. Essentially low light performance in APS-C cameras has been going down (or staying stable at best) across the board. So if you want to take pictures of football games in pitch dark at 6400 ISO  4/3rds or APS-C is not what you are looking for. Generally the solution to low light is not pumping up the ISO the first course of action is of course flash- with regards to that E-620 allows a lot of functionality with the Fl-36R/50R units including built in wireless flash support (no need for carrying a transmitter)Over all for an mid entry SLR you will be very happy with the E-620. Another factor is ergonomics and i like holding an Olympus but that you will have to try and compare yourself-- happy shooting!-updated to include thoughts on Imager AF and wireless flash support", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Olympus E-620 for fine art photography", "Author": "Moreno Tagliapietra \"fine art photography\"", "ReviewID": "R1OGG9XAOYC5IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello, I am a seasoned fine art photographer. Outdoors, I photograph landscapes and classic architecture, mostly European. In my studio, I do my own flower studies and reproduce original artwork for artists and crafters. My main system is a Pentax K20D with DA* and DA lenses. I use an Olympus E series as a backup system or when I want to travel light.I have recently replaced my E-510, that had served me well for one year, with an E-620 two-lens kit. As soon as I got it, I put the camera through a set of field tests consistent with my kind of photography. My conclusion is that with the E-620, Olympus have fully met their 1999 promise to use the 4/3\" format to develop small and light cameras and lenses without compromises of quality and price. I was concerned about the diminutive size of the body but I found it to fit my average-sized male hands remarkably well. The feeling is comfortingly solid and the commands are logically placed. I never had a problem with the Olympus control system and this camera is no exception.The new 12.3Mp sensor is quite good.  Depending on light conditions, noise is very low up to ISO800-1600. Dynamic range is definitively improved. Pictures taken in early July of my house and garden at noon in full sun recorded the entire tonal range with no shadow/highlights clipping. Minuscule detail is also captured remarkably well. Co-responsible for this are the two kit lenses, rightly famous for their high quality/price ratio with good corner-to-corner sharpness and low optical distortion and chromatic aberration. Very important to me, the viewfinder is larger with coverage of 95% and magnification of 96%, and allows me to focus manually.This is my first (transmissive) LCD monitor truly usable in full sun. It is completely articulated, hinged on the side of the camera so that it does not interfere with the head of the tripod (like the Nikon 5000). Even with \"only\" 230,000 pixels, I still find it to be remarkably bright and sharp.  It helps a lot with copy stand work and macro in the field. This is enhanced by the quality of the camera's Live View. The E-620 can use contrast-based autofocus eliminating the need for the sequence mirror down/focus/mirror up. Live View shows a lot of information, live histogram included, and allows for many key regulations. You can choose any area of the picture and enlarge it x5, x7 or x10 for fine focusing. The enlarged view is quite clear and sharp. The new 7-point phase detection autofocus has evolved and feels faster (I use spot autofocus anyway to ensure that I always know where the camera is focusing). Image stabilization on the sensor allows for smaller, less delicate and less expensive lenses. Lab tests indicate that it provides a 2 to 2.5 f/stops gain. The dust suppression system is still the best (some experts say the only one truly effective on the market). The camera offers an unparalleled wealth of manual and automatic regulations through its dedicated buttons and the LCD monitor.Outside, I use the camera on aperture priority at f/8-11 (to minimize lens diffraction) at a setting as close to ISO200 as possible (the camera's sweet spot for noise and dynamic range). No matter how good the exposure meter is, most of my pictures have always needed compensation. I take as many test pictures as necessary (with the Fn button set to \"test picture\") to get the proper exposure. The half-pressed shutter button is set to lock focus only. I focus where I want (mostly with an eye on hyperfocus), recompose and take the picture. In studio, I use the Fn button to get a custom white balance and set the camera to Live View and manual focus. I enlarge the subject for fine focusing, take some test pictures to perfect the exposure, and shoot with an extension cable and the \"anti-shock\" function set to 3 seconds (with anti-shock on, when you press the shutter button the camera lifts the mirror and waits the number of seconds set by you - up to 30 - before shooting, letting the mirror vibrations subside). Since the camera is on a tripod, I do turn image stabilization off. I shoot Raw+jpeg, use jpeg for family emails and reserve Raw for all my professional work. Developing in Camera Raw 5.4 at 16bit/channel in the ProPhoto color space, processing in Photoshop CS4, upsizing in Genuine Fractals 5, and printing with Epson UltraChrome inks and fine art papers and canvas, I obtain impeccable prints up to at least 24x30\".I believe that the best camera is the one that gets you to carry it around and have fun photographing. Today, it is the Olympus E-620 that does it for me. If Olympus is listening, I would respectfully wish for an AC adapter.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Full featured compact DSLR camera with two flaws", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R2LCCC5L8AZHO0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Olympus E-620 is positioned between Olympus beginner and advanced DSLR camera. Currently, Olympus has E-420/450 and E-520 in the lower level class, and E-30 and E-3 in the higher end class. Compared to other popular DSLR cameras, Olympus employs smaller image sensor called 4/3 live MOS sensor. 4/3 means that the native image has 4 : 3 ratio instead of 3 : 2 ratio. This could be plus and minus. The plus is 4 : 3 ratio is widely used in TV screen size and monitors. It is also squarer.  In my opinion, it is better for portrait. However, you can adjust the ratio to 3:2, 16:9 or other as you like at the expense of maximum image resolution.The negative side of this type of sensor is the noise in high ISO. There is appearance of noise in lower ISO level such as ISO 640 or 400 as well. Fortunately, I found the noise is rendered very fine and more pleasing to look at than noise generated from other DSLR or compact cameras. It has the film like feel to it.WHAT IS NEW COMPARED TO E-420 and E-520?Compared to Olympus E-420, the E620 is just a tad bigger, but it is now has Image Stabilization that works with Olympus or third party lenses. Compared to both cameras, E-620 has 7 AF points instead of 3. A slightly bigger viewfinder, improved 2.7 swivel LCD screen, wireless flash commander and six art scenes mode.BODY & HANDLINGOlympus is not the lightest camera around. It weights 521g, which is almost the same as best seller Canon XSi / 450D, but measured 130 x 94 x 60 mm, 2mm shorter and thinner than Canon XSi. The E-620 noticeably smaller than Olympus E-520.Despite the size, Olympus E-620 is very solid to hold. Thanks to the weight and ergonomic design. The built quality is  also a step up from entry level DSLR cameras. It has a nice rubberized texture in the hand and thumb rest on the back.It has one thumb dial and four-way buttons which you will use to change various settings and navigate the menu. Each of the four-way buttons for navigation and also for access popular settings such as ISO, WB, metering, and AF mode. This is buttons are similar buttons that you often find in compact camera layout.In addition, there is Super Control Panel. By the touch of INFO button, it will let you navigate and change various important settings in one screen. This is very smart design. Canon and Nikon interface does not come close.Buttons are considered small compare to other DSLRs, so if you have a big fingers, you might find a bit uncomfortable to find or access the button. Unique to Olympus E-620, it has backlit buttons, which is automatically light on when you are in dark condition. This small feature is significant if you often shoot in low light condition indoor or outdoor. There is also a dedicated live view button, which will activate live view mode instaneously.Viewfinder (96% coverage, .95 magnification) is slightly bigger than E-520 but still smaller and narrower than other entry level camera. Looking at the viewfinder is like looking at the tunnel, which is uncomfortable. You will notice significant different if you regularly shoot with higher end cameras such as Olympus E-30 or Nikon D90.Overall, the body design and ergonomic is very good, better than some beginner DSLR cameras on the market. Despite that, you might have balance issue when you mount Olympus pro grade lenses which is heavier than regular kit lens. Olympus has thought about it and provide battery/vertical grip to counter this problem. The only significant downside is the small viewfinder.LCD SCREEN & AF PERFORMANCEOlympus E-620 has swivel LCD screen which is helpful for composition and also for people who are used to compose photos using back LCD screen (compact camera users). The resolution of the screen is standard (230k) but it is clearer and more detailed than other DSLR with 230k resolution.Auto focus in live mode is slower than most compact camera, but works very well in bright or low light condition. Depending on the light condition, it takes a round one to two seconds for the camera to focus.Aufo focus performance in viewfinder are much faster. Now it has 7 AF points, 5 of them are cross type sensor. AF continuous works very well, it is very quiet and fast. There is nothing to worry about.To change AF points, there is dedicated button in the top left of the camera, and then  you change it using thumb dial. This approach is similar to Canon DSLR cameras, but different from Nikon approach. Nikon uses four way buttons which I prefer more because it is faster and spot on.IMAGE QUALITYImage rendered by this camera is generally very good dan very detailed. Thanks to the above Olympus Zuiko lenses. ISO. Unfortunately, noise in in issue. There is noticeable noise especially in shadow area across ISO (low of high). Of course in high ISO, the noise are more prominent. ISO 800 is the limit between acceptable and unacceptable image.However, to be fair, the noise generated by this camera is not annoying like many other DSLR. It is more film like than electronic noise which is usually generated by camera with CMOS sensor. It is also worth to mention that Olympus prefers to keep details rather than losing it by smearing the noise, which could be good or bad depending on your taste.ART SCENE MODEArt scene mode is fairly new in Olympus DSLR cameras. Basically, the camera will process the image directly after you take the picture. The process is very fast and negligible. If you use live view mode, you can see the effect on the screen. This might be fun for people who has no editing or photoshop skills but for advanced / photo enthusiasts, they might want to take original image instead and edit the photo later. In the other words, donft based your decision on buying this camera because of this feature.OTHER1. The shutter noise gka-chingh is not very appealing. It is quite loud and sounds cheap.2. The size of the camera and kit lenses are equally small. It is half the volume of pro grade system, and much more enjoyable to carry on traveling or walking.3. Evaluative metering is slightly underexposure to protect highlight, but there is also exposure compensation button that you can use to adjust it. I usually set it at +0.7 in various lighting condition.COMPETITORSOlympus E520Olympus E-520 is an older DSLR cameras which is a bit bigger in body size, but have fewer and less sophisticated features. Like E-620, it has built-in image-stabilization, but thatfs about it. E-520 has a smaller viewfinder, non-swivel LCD screen, no backlit buttons, no art scene mode, and only has 3 AF points and 10 megapixel image resolution. But E-520 wins in price. It is approx. $250 cheaper than E-620.Canon T1iCanon T1i is $100 more expensive than E-620 but it has movie mode, bigger and hi-res (910k) LCD screen, 11 AF points and compatible with EOS lenses collection.Pentax k-xNewcomer Pentax k-x has better image quality in high ISO, very compact size, has a live view mode but in a cheaper package. Pentax kx might be the toughest competitor Olympus must face beside Canon and Nikon cameras.Nikon D5000D5000 also has swivel LCD screen, but lack of AF motor that prevent this camera to use older Nikon lenses. Image quality is superb in low or high ISO setting.CONCLUSIONOlympus E-620 is an interesting camera, it focuses on compact size which is the right thing to do to get advantage of four third sensor. Built quality is better than most beginner DSLRs. There are many dedicated buttons and very friendly menu / control panel so you can find and change setting you want very fast. The ergonomic is also very good especially for average hand man/woman. Featurewise, this camera is very up to date although it lacks movie mode. In addition, it has backlit buttons which is non-existence even in my Nikon D700, a $2500 camera. It also has crystal clear swivel LCD screen. I find myself using it for many occasions.  There two weaknesses of this camera, small viewfinder and noticeable noise in ISO 1600 or higher. If Olympus fix this problem in upcoming dSLR while retaining the compact size, this camera will make a great travel or street companion.Subjective rating relative to beginner DSLR cameras in 2009Image Quality : 4/5Features : 5/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 4/5Value for Money : 3/5Please visit my website for sample images, high iso comparison and size comparison.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Olympus improves E-series image quality", "Author": "Douglas Henderson", "ReviewID": "R2RLMBOKRW3U8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an Olympus E-620 from Adorama a few weeks ago and took it to Yellowstone to compare performance with my other Olympus digital cameras--an E-330 and an E-510.  Took along my two good Olympus lenses--a 14-54mm and an 11/22mm.I'll leave a fuller discussion of the camera to others and just say my photo results from a day of shooting was a set of images easily acquired that were of superb quality--very sharp, very well exposed and yielding a tonal/dynamic range that was much greater than I've come to expect from Olympus digital cameras.  Very easy to take photos without blowing highlights that also showed more detail in darker toned areas of an image.  Olympus has greatly improved dynamic range with the E-620 over earlier E-series cameras.One notable difference with the E-620 was the need to increase the exposure settings.  My older Olympus E-330 and E-510 required setting exposure with -1/3 EV (minus 1/3), to insure most highlights weren't overexposed.  With the E-620, the EV needs to be set to +1/3 or more--otherwise images initially look too underexposed.  The JPG engine in the camera seems to do very well--producing warm, saturated images.  I developed RAW files with Iridient Raw Developer 1.8.3.  The end files saved in Photoshop or TIFF are larger than those from earlier Olympus cameras (69mb or so, vs. 42mb from the E-330 and 57mb from the E-510).I have had some odd, variable auto-focus behavior (back-focusing, sometimes), but this only requires I pay attention to what the camera is doing while taking pictures--and only seems to happen at the wide end of my lenses. Battery life was better than I expected--shot an 8GB CF card and most of another 4GB CF card with the battery still showing to be full. I'll post a few images to demonstrate the nice results.  The E-620 is highly recommended.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nimble Beauty and a Complex Beast", "Author": "-Ashi-", "ReviewID": "R2OGR3BVUMRKR2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "REVISED for 2010!  :-)Are you stepping up from an P&S; and got baffled?  No, you're not alone.  That's where I was (and I already knew how to use Manual mode!).  Hopefully this guide will make the transition from a P&S; to E-620 easier and start shooting better pictures.First of all, here is what I think of e-620.Very compact, like a good old 35mm film SLR camera.  The built quality is like a tank.  Everything is well assembled together and doesn't feel like something will turn loose at any moment.  It is NOT weather proof, but it feels that way.Olympus's lens collection is top notch.  I read many reviews and saw many sample pictures from users before I made the commitment.  I believe you get the best bang for the money with Olympus.  I purchased a lens (Zuiko 14-54MM 2.8-3.5 II) along with the body-only option, and shot some baby portraits and landscape pictures.  From the baby picture, I can see the glistening of his eye brows where sun shined.  The detail is simply amazing.  Nothing is perfect, so please read my review on that lens for a more complete view of the combination.  It's very impressive overall.Tips:1.  Try to play with your camera first and see what each button does before move on.  Take a few pictures to get a feel.  Use Pg. 2 and 3 of the manual to locate where each button is.2.  Super Control Panel:  Press OK on your four-way direction pad will let you access Super Control Panel (SCP).  Learn how to use it instead of going through the complicated but feature-(super)rich menu; it'll save you a lot of time.  Don't you wish this is a touch screen?  :)3.  Customization:  Right after setting up your E-620's time clock, you should turn on the customization menu by going to Menu -> Utilities (wrench icon) -> Menu Display (gears) and turn it On.  Press OK on your four-way button to go back, and voila, now we are ready to rock.You can find all of the following in Chapter 8 of your manual, but they're not in layman's terms.Here are few stuff that you should be aware of in Customization Menu that you cannot access through SCP:  Under AF/MF Menu (Menu A, A for AF):  * AF Illuminat: flash strobes, or AF assist as called by Canon.  It's quick flashes of light used to make low light focus easier for the camera.  It can be disturbing.  Turn it off when you are in the museum.  Under Button/Dial (Menu B, B for Buttons)  * Dial Function and Dial Direction:  If want turning clockwise to decrease aperture (or slower shutter speed) instead of the default counter clockwise, or something similar, then you go to this menu to reverse the dial direction, or change the default action of the dial.  * AEL/AFL Memo:  AEL/AFL Memory.  Basically when you press and hold AEL/AFL button, you can do a spot metering (Auto Exposure Lock) and even after you move your camera away from that spot, the picture's metering stay with it.  It's not that easy to hold and press AEL and half-press shutter button to focus at the same time, and that's why there is this \"sticky-key\" option.  Press it once to turn it on, then again will turn it off.  * Fn Function:  This is a biggy and can save you time!  Read your manual on pg. 97-98 (of the current English edition) to find out more.  I customize my Fn button to do one-button white balance.  More on this in Tip #5.  * My Mode:  If you want your camera to automatically turn on face detection, no flash, spot meter or similar series of options just by pressing a single button, this is where you set that up.  Only work if you also set up Fn button to use My Mode.  * Four-way direction button Function (icon: four-way buttons): Don't want the default quick functions associated with direction buttons?  Use this.  * Multiple Shot Function (icon: three photo shots):  If you don't use burst mode that much or you don't care about timed exposure, then you can change this button into another Fn button (sort of, they have different options you could use).  Under Release Menu (Menu C)  *  RLS Priority S/C:  These two options change the behavior of S-AF and C-AF.  Typical shutter behavior is when you pressed the shutter release all the way down (i.e., without half-press it first to AF), it'll auto focus quickly, lock it and take the picture all in one operation.  If you need the picture intentionally out of focus, then you need to turn either one of the options On, so it'll just take the picture without AF first.  Under Display Menu (Menu D for Display)  *  USB Mode:  When you update the firmware, you should change the option to STORAGE (that's the current instruction from Olympus's website as of October 3, 2009)  *  Live View Boost:  Should be Off, if you want to see the effect of changing shutter speed/aperture, etc. under Live View (only).  Otherwise, you can turn it on to dynamically adjust the LCD screen brightness level for reading LCD screen under bright sun light.  *  Info Setting:  Don't like cycle through so many screens when you press Info button, here is the way to get rid of a few screens you don't use.  Under Exposure/Meter/ISO Menu (Menu E for Exposure)  *  ISO-Auto Set:  Here you can set minimum and maximum ISO value when you use Auto ISO.  E-620 is said to have the best dynamic range when you use ISO 200-800.  *  ISO-Auto:  If you don't want Auto ISO grayed out when you use Manual mode, then here is the way.  *  Anti-shock:  Turn Off for better picture quality.  Turn On when you need anti-shock, i.e., when you mount the camera on the tripod to minimize residual shakes where the slightest movement will count because you turned off your IS.  It's called \"mirror lock up\" by other camera makers.  This is not the same as IS.  Under Pixel/Aspect/Color/WB menu (Menu G)  *  Color Space:  Change it to AdobeRGB for wider color range (i.e., more color).  *  Pixel Set (picture of a triangle with some pixels):  Here you can set \"how fine the grain\" of your output jpg files are.  You can change it from Fine to SF (super fine) for excellent output without RAW post-processing.  This option does NOT affect RAW file's resolution.  *  Pixel Count:  Similar to the previous except this changes the resolution (i.e., 3200x2400 or 2560x1920 or 1600x1200 for Medium size jpg).  *  Aspect Shooting:  You can change the aspect ratio from native 4x3 to 2x3, 1x1, etc..  Only works when you shoot with LCD (not through Optical View Finder).  Will only crop if you use Olympus's supplied software.  RAW files will not be affected (always 4x3).  Under Record/Erase (Menu H)  *  DPI Setting:  You can increase your Dot Per Inch setting with E-620!!!  Most photo processing shops use 300 dpi, so you can do that.  If you want to have finer detail or just being future proof, you can increase the pixel count.  Under Utility Menu (Menu I)  *  Pixel Mapping:  If you have dead pixels, use this to map them.  Please read manual first.  *  Cleaning Mode:  READ MANUAL FIRST before you do your own sensor cleaning and follow the instruction carefully.  *  Exposure Shift:  It's known this camera will slightly under expose, so go to this menu to bump up the exposure by 1/3 step (or whatever you're comfortable with), that way you don't have to do a lot of post-processing because of it.  I love this feature.  Please read the tip on White Balance as well.Update and added on Jan 6, 2010:4.  AF Performance of E-620:Use S-AF for best performance, period.  I enjoy using both AF and MF, but instead of using AF+MF, there is an alternative way, which you may like it better.Press Menu button, customization menu (gear icon), select B (Button/Dial), and then select AEL/AFL menu.  A sub-menu will show up with three settings.  S-AF, C-AF, and MF behaviors.  Choose MF, and change it to Mode 3.  In this mode, you can do MF as usual, but also an \"AF on demand\" when you press AEL/AFL button on your E-620.  I like it better than AF+MF because you don't get an unwanted AF when you press the shutter button (you mean to shoot, not to AF again after you just did a MF).5.  Learn how to use Custom White Balance.  Read the Fn Function customization instruction above and start using Custom White Balance.  Your picture will look better, because the color is correct, exposure is more likely to be correct, and less problem with dynamic range (extreme light condition).  There are tools that can help you achieving excellent white balance (gray cards, white balance caps to name a few), but you can't do it until you set the Fn button to do custom white balance (Custom White Balance deserves a separate button, like E-30 has).6.  Under Playback/Display mode.  *  Press +/- button will rotate the photo.  *  Press Fn button will call up the zoom box.  Use direction arrows to move the box around, Control Dial to change the magnifications (2x, 3x, 5x, 7x, 10x, then 14x), then press Fn button again to zoom in (or you can zoom in first, then use Control Dial to change magnification).  *  Press Focus Area button [...] to compare two photos.  Use left and right direction buttons to change candidate photo.  *  Undocumented:  Press Sequential Shooting/Timer Button (the one next to Flash button) will switch between viewing photos stored in CF and xD memory card, if both were inserted.7.  To shoot back-lit scenes, such as the sun within the frame, try this.  Turn the metering to SH[*] (Shadow Spot Metering) if your subject is in the shadow/darker area of the frame, then OVEREXPOSE.  Usually I find +2.7 works best, but to get a more accurate \"estimate\", turn on LiveView mode (LCD), then press Info button until you see the multiple-frame screen which maybe either WB or +/- on top of the screen (if you're on WB screen, press Down arrow to switch to +/- screen).  This is where you get your exposure estimation visually.  Choose the look you're trying to achieve with left or right arrow and you're set.  You might have to experiment a little because it's an estimation, and also you're reading the LCD screen under sun light, which may not be 100% accurate.Why under-expose with Shadow Spot then overexpose?  Because this way you retain the detail in the shadow area.  If you just use the regular reading, the dark area will just be silhouette (perfectly fine if that's what you're aiming for).  Even if the photo turned out dark, this way, it's \"more\" fixable with Lightroom and similar software (remember to shoot RAW+JPG for more versatility).Wish List:  The hand grip takes time to get used to.  It hurt my below average size hand initially, but once I got used to it, I actually could mount my Zuiko 14-54MM f2.8-3.5 II lens on it and running around a hiking trail taking pictures.  It is highly mobile.  I do wish Olympus could make the buttons larger.  I also plead they'd switch the placement of Info button with Menu button, as I use prior more often to switch LCD views.  At current position (next to the viewfinder eye cup), the button is hard to press.  Another tip for Olympus's interface department, the control dial should be right under PASM dial, cascading in a Mastercard logo formation, as that's where the user's thumb is.  The current design of the thumb pad forces the user to hold the camera in a very specific position.  Moving the thumb backward to turn the control dial at its present position can be very uncomfortable (and it's the most often used dial).  It takes time to get used to, but I think my design is more ergonomic.  Also, like one online reviewer has mentioned, Olympus should try to make the control dial a button, like Panasonic G1's, so no more two-finger operation to change aperture and shutter speed when one works with Manual mode.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "The perfect set up", "Author": "G. Sager", "ReviewID": "RF2OVP371UNHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't go deeply into the features and benefits, if you're reading this - then you've already researched those.  I would rather tell you about how much fun this camera is to use.  I've been a fan of super zooms for a long time and while they have their obvious drawbacks - they really are very handy.  I was a big fan of the Canon S5 IS and when I moved up to an DSLR - I looked at Canon, but ultimately decided on an E-510.  I liked it - solid camera, but I missed the swivel screen.  It was really useful when shooting at odd angles (such as in a crowd).  So along comes the E-620 and I jumped at it.  I then added the battery grip, an Olympus grip strap and a Zuiko 18-180 lens.  Suddenly I had the perfect camera (for me, of course)- a DSLR Super Zoom.  It fits my hand perfectly, has 10x capability, is fast, light, perfect for a wide variety of shooting situations, and it has the versital swivel screen.  It's a HOT set up.  Put it in a Tamarac 5683 and you have a great travel photography combo.  I have this camera with me nearly all the time and the results have been fantastic.A word about the art filters - LOVE THEM!  I recommend you pair this camera up with a wrist strap and the Zuiko 25mm pancake lens.  Then use the \"grainy B&W; film\" art filter for astounding retro results.  (This lens works well with the \"Pop Art\" filter as well).  This set up has nearly the same size and weight as a point and shoot (like the Canon G series for example) with the image quality of a DSLR.  Again, very fast and light and it can fit in a small bag or big coat pocket.  Think - a cross between the E 410 and the E 30.  It's perfect!This is Olympus' best work to date.  I highly recommend this camera.  It's a true artist's camera and an absolute blast to use.  If you're already an Olympus fan, this is a \"no brainer\".  If you own another brand and are not too heavily invested in glass - this is a great camera to start with.  The photographs you will take with this camera will WOW people.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Stujoe", "ReviewID": "RD7F9NRKJEALY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera yesterday and am loving it. I am upgrading from an E510. I was very interested in the better live view and the flippy twisty screen of the 620 and it does not disappoint. I will use the optical viewfinder most of the time but the imager AF live view and the ability to angle the screen is going to eliminate me laying on the ground and such quite a bit.The size of he camera is nice. A bit smaller than the 510 but still easy enough for me to hold. The biggest lens I have is the 70-300mm and it feels fine with the camera. I am not sure how the bigger Oly lens would feel...I can't imagine the 50-200mm of one of the SHG lenses on this camera but I won;t ever own any of those anyway.The IQ of the 620 is very nice. I think Oly jpgs are the best. Great color, contrast, exposure, etc. I think 1600ISO is perfectly usable and easily cleaned up if you have a severe case of noisephobia at 100% pixels.All in all, the 620 is going to be a great camera for me. Feature packed, small, not too expensive and a joy to use.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Camera, Highly Recommended", "Author": "T. Port", "ReviewID": "R2YFXYSH6D11L9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Olympus has knocked one out of the park! I have had my e620 for just a few days and I must say I am very impressed with it's capabilities and features. The competition can not even come close in this price range. You really would have to spend hundreds more to get the same caliber of camera from the leading competition. Although no camera is perfect, this one comes close for my needs. There are already lots of reviews out there talking about the technical specifications and capabilities of the e620 so I won't go into that.  I'll just tell you what I like:I bought this camera as replacement to my e520. I loved my e520 but it was lacking in a couple of areas, mainly, the e520 didn't perform well at high ISO settings. But that is all fixed in the e620. I also wanted the improved continuous shooting speed from 3.5 fps to 4 fps. There are many other improvements over the older e520 so I sold my e520 and ordered the e620 from Amazon / Adorama.The e620 produces super high quality photos. In auto mode this camera takes amazing photos. I have members of my family using the two leading brands of DSLRs. If we all take photos of the same thing, mine always turn out better with more vivid colors, sharper image, more accurate white balance and better bokeh effect,. The ironic thing is they paid about the same amount as I did for their more popular name brand camera kits. They thought they were getting better cameras because of the name, but the truth is, currently, no one can match the e620 at the same price. The features and capabilities of this camera at this price puts the e620 in a class all its own. The images produced by the e620 are really great. You can shoot in RAW if you want, but the JPEGs produced by this camera are amazing. I used to shoot in RAW but now I almost always use the JPEGs straight from the camera.The e620 has tons of  flexibility and custom settings. It truly gives you all the control you would ever want. There are many extra features that I will probably never even use but I like knowing they are there in case I ever need them. For those who don't need all of the extra control, this camera's full auto mode takes very suburb photos on its own. But if you're like me and like to play in the manual settings, this camera is a dream. The e620 pretty much gives you the same control as the professional cameras. The menu system is laid out in a very logical way and is easy to get accustom to. The other brands don't give you near this many manual settings in this price range. Some amateurs complain that they are overwhelmed by the many buttons and controls on the Olympus cameras. But the button layout and the control panel make it a snap to quickly adjust your settings on the fly so you can get the perfect photo. For me, I would rather have the flexibility and options to control the camera than be locked down to a limited set of functions.Image stabilization is built into the camera body. Don't believe anyone who tells you lens stabilization works better than in-camera stabilization. For the type of photos I take, lots of action and sports, and some with a 300 mm lens without a tripod, the in-camera stabilization works very well. And the best part, you can save a lot of money when buying lenses because you don't have to buy the image stabilization with each lens. This is a must have feature.Fast continuous shooting at 4 frames per second. Faster than the other brands at this price. This is very nice for sports and action shots. I use this feature a lot to take photos of my children's sport events.Fast auto focus. You can take photos really fast with this camera because it focus locks so fast. And it has lots of focus points making focusing even more accurate and fast.The buttons are back lit. This is great when you are trying to shoot in the dark and need to make adjustments. Once you are used to the camera, you will pretty much have all of the button locations memorized, but it is still nice to have a visual confirmation of the button locations when shooting in the dark.Excellent high ISO performance. This is a huge improvement over the e520 which I previously owned. This make taking pictures in low light without a flash possible. And the noise level is quite acceptable and on par with the competition. I have already taken 3200 ISO photos that are usable. And the 1600 ISO photos I have taken are not bad at all. I am very excited I will be able to use these high ISO settings. I couldn't really go over ISO 800 with the e520.Art filters are fun to use and allow you more creativity with your photos. I like these art filters. You can do the same thing in Photoshop, but it is fun to be able to use the effects in the field and see the results on the spot. I think I will use these quite a bit.The ingenious dust reduction system was invented by Olympus and works flawlessly. You don't ever need to worry about needing to clean your camera's internal sensor.The fold out screen makes macro shots near the ground so much easier. This is a huge improvement. Screen is very bright and crystal clear. Not sure how much I will use the fold out screen, but it is a cool feature.This small camera body is nice and comfortable to use. The camera feels well built and does not have the cheap plastic feel of the other brands at this price. And it is unbelievable how feature packed this small body is. I can easily fit this camera with the pancake lens in the front pocket of my cargo pants. Even thought the camera body is small, it still feel adequate and balanced with my 14-54 mm lens attached.This camera has really good battery performance. You can take several hundred photos without needing a charge. Charge time is 3.5 hours. I bought a spare battery for $10 from eBay and it works as good as the Olympus battery but I'm not sure I will every really need to use it but it will be nice to have.Live view works really good and is nifty for some situations like macros. I'm not a big fan of live view on the DSLRs, but it is a feature that is nice to have when you need it.The Olympus lens lineup is top notch and the kit lens is very good, and better than what you get with the other brands' kits.In summary, this is a top notch, highly capable camera, packed with features. You can not go wrong with the e620. Check out [...] for an in depth technical review of the e620.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "A camera that has it all (almost)", "Author": "Ravenhurst", "ReviewID": "R258B5YI7UU3EX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the E-620 as a Christmas present to... myself in December 2009. I went the Olympus way basically because of sentimental reasons: an old guy I used to know was a World War II photographer who shot Olympus until the day he died; he was the one who introduced me to the brand back in 1982.Quickly after I set my hands on the E-620 I knew that this was a compact powerhouse. I am an amateur enthusiast with unfortunately too little time to pursue my passion for photography, but even without too much familiarization with the E-620 I was able to shoot some incredible photos right out of the gate and with the kit 14-42mm, which is a little gem if you get to know how to use it.What I truly like about this camera:1. Body built like an armored car; I've used much more expensive cameras that feel \"flimsy\" in comparison to the Oly.2. A Super Control Panel with tons of information.3. Excellent Live View.4. Swing and tilt LCD monitor -- one BIG plus in my book!5. In-body image stabilization that the competitors should really study and adopt, too!6. Dust-removing system that WORKS...7. Power Grip HLD-5 that offers endless battery life and balances the camera wonderfully in both larger and smaller hands ( I have smaller hands).8. Without the power grip, I can comfortably and steadily hold the camera like my much smaller Canon point-and-shoot.What I slightly dislike:1. Viewfinder is a bit smaller than in other comparable cameras; I wear glasses and using the viewfinder requires some getting used to.2. If you do not use the battery grip, the single battery will drain rather fast, especially if you decide to tweak with the Art Filters and Scenes.3. LCD not as crisp and bright as the competition.4. Menu system that is often a bit confusing and takes a lot more effort to learn than the competition.That this Oly does not offer video recording leaves me unconcerned. I never really understood why I should be buying a still photo camera in order to shoot video, but this is another story. Don't let the absence of this rather useless function deter you from VERY seriously considering the E-620.Image quality: I have shot some 10,000 pictures with this camera, mostly during experiment runs. Without too much digging into the menus and various fine tuning choices, output from the E-620 ranges from excellent to truly stunning. In fact, one of my routine complaints (to myself) is that I just don't know how I got to shoot the stunning ones! My next step is to get a notebook, set the camera in a particular way, make an exact notation of the settings, shoot, say, 50 photos, and mark the end of the run so that I get to know exactly how a series of photos was produced. I am convinced that once I get to know the Oly beyond the rudimentary, results will be consistently pretty amazing.By way of comparison, I recently purchased a Nikon D5000 which, right out of the box, has pleasantly surprised me with incredibly sharp, beautifully colored images. Adding a Sigma 18-50mm to the package has produced even greater output. I know the Oly is quite capable of similar performance, but it needs nudging and tender loving care.Another thing is that Olympus offers a limited choice of lenses that won't break the bank plus finding non-Oly lenses for the Four Thirds system is a bit of a challenge. In contrast, with the Nikon you are almost spoilt for choice; I have already bought two lenses beyond the two included in the kit, whereas with the Oly I have practically run out of choices after the kit lens, the 35mm macro, and the 70-300mm, both by Olympus.I never shoot RAW; the Oly's JPEG engine seems entirely prepared to meet the crunch with aplomb. I rarely need to post process.Bottom line: the Oly E-620 is an extremely attractive package, tightly manufactured, well calibrated, more than reasonably priced, and expertly equipped. It feels \"snug\" and \"natural\" in one's hand and this is the kind of feeling that, to me at least, adds significantly to the pleasure and comfort a photographer gets from a camera. Give the E-620 the utmost serious consideration. If you decide to buy it, you won't be disappointed (but you NEED to devote significantly more time to getting to know it well).", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Compact DSLR", "Author": "H. Lii", "ReviewID": "R1QSUNS31V3S05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E620 is my first DSLR and I have no regrets in buying it.  Before this camera, I primarily used point-n-shoot cameras which I feel are great for casual events do to the portability and ease of just taking it out of my pockets and shooting away.  However I wanted an upgrade to use for more special gatherings such as graduations, weddings, family functions, or vacations.  I wouldn't say that the pictures I was taking with my point-n-shoot were bad, but they were definitely a step below photos taken from my friends DSLRs.  The most imporant features for me were 1) size, 2) price, 3) live-view screen, and 4) quality of pictures with the included lenses.  With those factors in mind, I narrowed my choice down to the Nikon D5000, Canon T1i, and Olympus E6201) Getting used to small pocket point-n-shoot camers, I wanted a DSLR that was also small and light weight.  I knew that there was no way I'd be able to fit the DSLR into my jacket pocket or anything like that, but I at least wanted something that was going to be easy to carry around and easy to take in and out of the bag.  I've seen people who carried what looked like 10-15 pound bags of camera gear and this is what I wanted to avoid.  The E620 is probably one of the most compact DSLRs out there.  I went to the local store and compared the E620 with the Nikon D5000 and Canon T1i.  It wasn't clearly the smallest camera since the Canon seemed pretty compact too, but when holding the camera, the build quality of the Olympus felt like it was a better assembled camera.  The buttons, dials, and switches all felt like they were carefully put together and would last many years of use.2) The price of the E620 was about a $100 less then the Nikon and Canon.  This was a pretty big factor for me since I knew I also had to spend money on a bag, storage device, lens/camera cleaners, simple lens filter, possibly an extra battery.  My budget for the entire package was about $800.  I didn't want to get low quality accessaries like a $5 camera bag or the generic storage device, since I knew that my bag was going to help protect the camera from any accidental drops and the difference between a failed flash card and a one that didn't fail is almost priceless.  The accessaries I wanted to get was about $100 street value, which was perfect since that was about the same amount of money saved from buying an Olympus compared to the Nikon or Canon.3) Being used to point-n-shoot cameras, I really wanted a DSLR with a good live view screen.  Before doing more research into the DSLRs, I used to think that live-view was standard on all DSLRS.  They all had lcd screens which I thought was for the users to see what s/he was taking a photo of.  However this is not the case and live-view is a relatively new feature on DSLRs.  Apparently most DSLR users use the view-finder which I find to be slightly annoying.  The E620 easily and acurrately focused on the subjects when using live view and this made it a very easy transition to use the E620.  Now I just need to play around more with the manual controls and have my photos coming out the way I want them too.  As an added bonus, the E620 offers a swivel screen.  This is great when you need to raise the camera above your head to take a picture since you can easily swivel the screen so you can see what you are taking a picture of.  Its also very useful when you need to take a picture from the ground up.4) Lenses are the most important part of a DSLR camera.  Even after a few years when a camera depreciates, a good lens can hold its value fairly well.  Many times buying an extra lens will cost more then the camera itself!  Since price was a concern for me I wanted a camera that came with decent lenses.  I didn't want to spend an extra $500 on another lens.  After reading many reviews, it was determined that the Olympus came with very qualified kit lenses that were quick to focus and took sharp looking photos.  I understand that a more expensive lens should produce better results, but many times I always felt that my point-n-shoot cameras took really good photographs already, so there's a good chance that I'll might not even be able to tell the difference between the a good picture and a great picture.  And again, I'm just a casual camera user and wouldn't even consider myself a hobbiest or an amateur photographer.  So I think kit lenses will be enough for my needs.I've owned my camera for about 6 months now and I must say that I'm still very pleased with it and that I'm slowly learing more and more about photography and how to take better pictures.  This camera fit perfectly for my needs and happens to also take very good photos.  For those of you trying to decide between the Nikon, Canon, or Olympus, you really can't go wrong with any of them, but just know what your needs are and it'll be a much simpler choice.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Entry Level DSLR", "Author": "JFK1969", "ReviewID": "R3E9M8UXMBML71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur photographer, not a professional by any means.  But I've been using an old Canon AE1 35mm film camera and/or a point and shoot digital for a quite few years and wanted to upgrade to a DSLR.  After doing the research, I went with the Olympus.  Everybody has their own preferences, so that plays into the equation.  My friends with Canons say that Canon is the only way to go and every other brand sucks.  My friends with Nikons say that Nikon is the only way to go and every other brand sucks.  I compared this camera with the comparable Canons and Nikons and when it all played out, the Olympus was the camera that best matched my wants/needs.The Pros:One of the main selling points to the Olympus is that it has in body image stabilization, so you don't have to worry about buying lenses with IS vs. without.  Pretty much, you can slap any lens on it and get image stabilization.  This also cuts down on the weight of the lenses.  This is something my Canon friends bitch about.  They have lenses that do not have IS, so they get some blurred shots from time to time.  Buying the lenses with IS is a lot more expensive.  With the Olympus, you don't have to worry about it.  For most amateur photographers, this is a big plus.The Zuiko kit lenses are top notch.  I've got the 14X42mm, the 40X150mm and the 35mm Macro lenses, and they are all very impressive.The other Zuiko lenses are all great quality and get great reviews, while Canon and Nikon lenses tend to either be damn excellent or nearly crap.  Plus, since the E-620 has in body image stabilization, you can simply buy an adaptor and use Canon and Nikon lenses (the ones without image stabilization), or other old prime lenses (though, the autofocus will not work with these 'other' lenses).The live view function is excellent, even though I hardly ever use it.  I always use the viewfinder, but in playing with the live view, it rocks for what it is.  If you are gonna use the live view function a lot, this camera has a very good one.The rotating/swiveling LCD display makes it easy to use the live view function (or the menus in my case) from odd angles if/when necessary.  This is really helpful when taking macros, or using a tripod, or any other time you may need to be at an odd angle or attitude to the camera.Built in dust reduction system.  This is a very handy feature to keep the sensor clean without you having to do anything but turn the camera on.The built-in art filters are excellent.The image quality is excellent.  You have to play with the camera settings and learn how to get what you want out of it.  It will produce stunning pictures, once you get the hang of it.  This is true with any higher line DSLR.  Right out of the box on \"Auto\", this camera produces nice images.  But take the training wheels off, and this camera quickly gets even better.The controls are well laid out and pretty easy to use, plus they are programmable.  So if you want to 'customize' the buttons for certain features that you use often, you can easily do so.The body is smaller, compared to other comparable DSLRs.  I also find it to be very comfortable to handle.  This is nice because you can carry the E-620 around without too much hassle.  It is still a full size unit, but less size and weight are a plus if you are gonna lug the thing around all day.The basic functions are pretty easy to learn/use with a little practice.  But as with anything else, RTFM!The price.  If you shop around, this camera is a LOT cheaper than the comparable Canon (50D) or Nikon (D5000).  You can get the body, 2 kit lenses and a few accessories for what it would cost you to get the comparable Canon/Nikon body and maybe one kit lens.  Why pay a lot more $$$ for the Canon/Nikon name, when the odds are, you'll never notice a difference anyway?  Sure, the brand snobs will point out all kinds of things that they say make their brand of choice \"better\", but unless you are a pretty serious photographer, it won't mean a thing to you.  And if it does, you are probably gonna buy a much more expensive/sophisticated camera anyway.  If you are looking for the most \"bang for your buck\", this camera delivers.The Cons:Overall, the Canon 50D and the Nikon D5000 will have a slightly better picture quality at high resolution; but the difference is not really noticeable unless you are a professional or otherwise have a lot of experience in the field.  Most entry level buyers will never notice the difference anyway.  Or, they'll cover the difference in Photoshop/Lightroom, etc.  If you ARE sophisticated enough where these minor differences are going to make or break your selection, the odds are that you probably were not going to buy into this price range anyway.The viewfinder is a bit small.  This takes a little getting used to and is something Olympus could (and should) improve upon.  This is a minor inconvenience, but still, it could (and should) be better.The camera does NOT have video recording capability.  For some people, this is a problem.  For me, it is not.  I already have an HD camcorder that I like, so I didn't want (or need) one in my still camera.  Plus, for me, it just seems wrong to be taking videos from this type of camera.  But that is just personal preference.  If I'd wanted a camcorder/DSLR hybrid, I'd probably have considered the Olympus PEN.  But in any event, if you want a camcorder function, the E-620 doesn't have one.The XD memory card.  This camera uses both XD cards and CompactFlash cards (one slot for each).  I like the CompactFlash cards, but the XD is not ubiquitous.  Plus, the panorama function on the camera will only work with an XD card installed.  If you are switching from a point and shoot, unless you have a Fuji or Olympus (about the only two cameras that use the XD cards), your existing memory cards (SD, etc.) will not work.  And here is a tip:  Buying high quality CF cards will speed up the write times.  So don't skimp.Selection of lenses/accessories.  There are a lot more kit lenses and accessories for Canon and Nikon.  Not all of them are necessarily good or useful, but they are out there.  So if you want the widest selection of aftermarket goodies, Canon or Nikon is probably gonna win that race.  Yes, you can always buy an adaptor to use other manufacturer's lenses, but this is not exactly the same as purpose built accessories because not all of the lens functions will work with an adaptor (autofocus, etc.).The autofocus can be a bit fickle in low light.  If you use the built-in flash with the auto-focus in some low light situations, it will still sometimes take the camera a while to dial in the focus.  This can be pretty damn frustrating.  Using manual mode and manual focus solves this problem.  Since I have progressed to using manual mode with manual focus almost exclusively, this is no longer an issue for me.  But it is an issue that Olympus should work on improving.  I am told that the Canon/Nikon cameras can also have this issue, but that they are less temperamental about it than the Olympus.Battery life.  Personally, I think the battery life is fine.  However, if you use the live view function, it drains the battery a lot quicker.  I seldom use the live view function, so I don't notice much of a problem.  However, I bought a spare battery to keep in the bag anyway, so this is moot for me.  If you are gonna spend $500-$600 on a nice camera, go ahead and drop the extra $10 for a spare battery, no matter what brand you buy.Brand recognition.  People know the names \"Canon\" and \"Nikon\" very well.  Olympus, not so much.  So if you are a 'brand conscious' consumer who needs to go along and fit in with the crowd, then play it safe and buy a Canon or Nikon, and you'll be happy.The Bottom Line:I LOVE this camera.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  It is a pretty sweet rig.  The truth is, at this level, you will probably be satisfied with whatever you buy.  But for me, for the money, this is the best value for what I wanted in a camera.  As with any DSLR, there is a learning curve.  You HAVE to put the work into learning how to use the camera.  If you are just gonna set it to \"Auto\" and snap pictures, then you may as well save the money and just buy a nice point and shoot because you are not going to enjoy or appreciate ANY complex DSLR.  But if you are willing to put some time and practice into it, this camera will do whatever you want and more.  It isn't a perfect camera, but none of them are.  Do your research and make your decision based on the features and functions (and budget) that YOU want out of a camera.

In short, the E-620 is easily capable of recording outstanding RAW and JPEG images.  The art filters are also fun to use and experiment with, according to scenes that lend themselves more to the pop art setting, or the  grainy black & white setting, and so forth.

Unless you're looking for some specialized feature, you basically want three things: a great chip, a great lens, and total creative control. The E620 delivers on all counts.  (By the way, I've had one for about a year now, so lots of experience with it).Since the 1970's, professional photographers have gone to three sources to get the perfect SLR: Nikon, Canon, and Olympus. That's because they all work extremely well, and they keep working despite extensive abuse, which is the lot of a professional camera (at least, if it doesn't belong to a studio photog). As in 1975, Nikon and Canon are large, heavy, and come with systems that have an immense variety of lenses and accessories.  Olympus, on the other hand, has a moderately extensive system coupled with size and bulk about 35% to 50% smaller than the competitors.  If you're like most users and will be happy to own only a few lenses, then the issue is simple: do you want to walk around with 3 pounds of metal and glass around your neck, or 1.5 pounds?  With the Olympus, you never groan and say \"maybe I'll just bring the point-and-shoot.\"  When you're out in the field and that great photo comes along, you have the camera, and that means you get the photo.  For 35 years I've been using Olympus cameras and they've never let me down.The E620 has a CMOS chip. These photos have a far better tonal range than any conventional CCD I've ever used. In fact, they are much better than I ever found with film. I'll never buy another CCD camera.The E620 lenses are optically superb and very well-built. Thanks to the 4/3 format they  are also much lighter and smaller than the competition's lenses. I have the two-zoom-lens setup, which effectively gets me a 10:1 zoom. The wide end is a 28mm equivalent and you can't get much wider than that with the standard Zuiko 4/3 lenses, which is probably the most serious drawback to this system that I've found.  Olympus needs to get to at least a 14 mm equivalent. You can buy an adapter that allows you to use the E620 with older Zuiko lenses, and that would be workaround for a super-wide-angle lens.The E620 is also a little limited in its macro performance.  Up to its limits it produces superb photo quality, but you can't go closer than 1:1 magnification, and some of the competitors can beat that.  Again, you can better it with legacy Zuiko lenses.All in all, though, I love this camera. I've taken it into some very hostile field environments and it performs well. It has wonderful ergonomics and an intuitive user interface (although 35 years of Olympus use has likely biased me on that point).  It doesn't do voice memos or movies, which is a drawback, but I carry a small Olympus P&S; for times when I need to record such information. The E620, though, has given me the best photos I've ever taken.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Questionable System Future?", "Author": "Trent P.

After a nasty drop made my E-420 unreliable I bought an E-620 as a replacement.  I also picked up the kit 14-42, a lens I didn't have.Simply stated, the E-620 is great.  It received better press reviews than perhaps any of Olympus' Four-Thirds cameras  and I believe deserves every good word.The camera takes a great picture straight out of the box, but not the picture for me.  Fortunately Olympus gives you a huge amount of control over the camera.  I scaled back most of the more aggressive/beginner-pleasing settings and take a slightly flatter picture.  Not a problem.That is one of the benefits of this camera - although it works well as a low end camera, it also is flexible enough for a carry-around camera for more advanced shooters.When the E-620 came out it did better competing at high ISO settings than any of the previous Four-Thirds cameras.  I've tested it all the way up and have made some good pictures at pretty high levels.  On a day-to-day real world basis I have taken up to 1600 and beyond and have been happy with the results.  Maybe not beating the Canons up there, but good enough for my needs.Over all I love the camera - it takes great pictures and handles like a dream.  Someday I may want a high-end replacement for my E-1, but this can't be beat for an everyday, carry-around camera.So why 4 stars?A lot has happened in the few years since this camera came out.  It stood its ground against the competition when it came out, but the competition hasn't been standing still.Olympus hasn't been standing still either, they have just been putting their resources in other directions - i.e., the Four-Thirds line seems to be coming to an end in favor of the micro-Four-Thirds/Pen line.  I hope this isn't true - I hope the line is just on hold while the Pens establish a foothold, but I'm not holding my breath.The problem is, the new line fulfills the original promise of the Four-Thirds in some ways better than the Four-Thirds themselves - small, light SLR like cameras.  They've also been selling like hot-cakes.As I've said, I have a pretty good investment in the system - 3 bodies and 6 lenses.  I also feel a camera like the E-620 fills my needs better than any of the Pens.  I just can't see how a Pen can replace something like the E-5, which I'm drooling over.  I'm hoping to see a E-630 (or similar) come out building on all of the latest advances.But I'm not betting on it.In other words, I love my E-620 and would highly recommend it, only I have to put warning out there to be careful buying into a new system that may not exist in 2 years.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big improvement over the Olympus 420/520 cameras", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R3BWM8FHJ0FIID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My biggest complaint about the the Olympus 420 is the slow autofocus speed. This is especially notable in low light. I have a great deal invested in  Olympus E system accessories and lenses so was reluctant to change camera brands. I have been very happy with the newer E620. it is a major upgrade on the 420/520 cameras.The AF speed is much better, even with the kit lenses that I already own. The 620 has 7 auto focus sensors,5 are are the cross type. The 420 has only 3, non cross type AF sensors.Another improvement is the contrast detect auto focus when using live view.There is still a significant delay when shooting with live view, but it is much improved over shooting with live view in the 420, which was essentially not usable except for landscapes and studio workMuch of my photography is underwater, and have found the slow autofocus of the 420 to be an annoying handicap especially shooting macro. I plan on purchasing the PT-E06 housing for the 620, and based on on dry land experience will expect the 620 to much more responsive.Overall I think the 620 is a one of the best Olympus DSLR cameras to date, It has the same sensor as the E-30, in much smaller and lighter body. It also shares with the E30 the ability to do double exposures, and the \"art filters\".Though I have yet to find a use for these features.

Myles", "ReviewID": "R1IBSUGKWBLSGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having used Olympus equipment since 1978 (OM-2), I was even more impressed with this camera when I discovered how well it worked with legacy lenses.  In my case I'm using macro extentions, super wide angle, telephoto zoom - and even a 300mm super telephoto (all Olympus Zuiko lenses used with my OM-2).  The ease of use and picture clarity is nothing short of stunning.  An OM Lens to OM 4/3 Mount Adapter (in my case I used the inexpensive Fotodiox version) is required, but the results were worth the extra $30 I paid for the adapter - and the 2x zoom factor (i.e. 300mm -> 600mm) due to the 4/3 conversion is an added bonus.Though Manual mode may work best - it was surprising how well Auto mode worked with my 30+ year old lenses - a testament to Olympus equipment.  I was even able to use the Quick 310 flash & bounce grip (though limited and mostly in reverse bounce due to the intensity of the flash) to take some striking photographs.Past the legacy issue - this camera is all it's advertised - and more.  Long battery life, incredible flash mode array, image stabilization, multiple built in filtering - including B&W; color lens filters, monotone colors (blue, purple, sepia & green) - and to top it off 19 art/scn modes that others have talked about that truly are amazing.Yet that is only the beginning.  The articulating display - including 180 degree viewing (from the front of the camera) makes this a top contender in the DSLR world.  For previous Olympus owners - and before considering other DSLR cameras - put all the other brands in your hand and compare it to the E620.  The ergonomics of size, weight and control functionality may very well make your decision for you.NOW FOR THE OLYMPUS MANUFACTURER:I have only one major issue - could you please make a high quality camera bag (not a backpack) with enough room for this camera and its lenses?

This may sound like a review for the E-300, but because of the E-300 being such a good camera I wanted to stay with the Olympus brand. Yes, I could have gone to Canon.. Nikon.. or whatever others but it was a valid CHOICE to stick with the Olympus. I've taken probably 100k+ pictures with the E300, the battery still lasts forever, the camera still works great. the E300 is now my backup camera.I've had the E620 for about a month now and have nothing but praise about it as well. Its smaller than the e300, it shoots 4.5 fps and with an 233x card you can shoot about 15 CONTINUOUS shots (high jpg) before a small lag starts. I think in raw its about 5-6 pictures.The e620 is really light weight, live view is pretty neat (i still use it sparingly) the fact that you can twist and turn the LCD is very nice and has already been helpful in a few instances. The in body image stabilizer also is a cool feature. I've used it, but, the experience with it still limited (been shooting mainly outside, w/ a fast shutter)The only \"cons\" so far with it is the Raw files, higher ISO (1000+) and long exposures.- With Raw files...

It handles well, it shoots well, and it's a wonderful value.I have owned many bodies from multiple systems, and the E620 continues to fare well against competitors in its price bracket. The autofocus system (especially when matched with an SWD lens) is especially impressive, arguably better than its similarly priced APS-C competitors even now. Its size advantage is immediately apparent, being dramatically more portable than APS-C bodies. Even though it's long in tooth (over two years, now) it still remains a sensible purchase, as its price has dropped as well and it competes quite well against entry level units from the competition.The build quality of the E620 feels quite substantial; more than what I was expecting in this price bracket. The controls are all very solid and the unit feels tightly constructed. No creaks, no groans. I know it's plastic, but there's a difference between cheap plastic and good plastic, and this is clearly the latter.The E620 has in-body image stabilization, which is a clear win in my book compared to in-lens. Every lens you mount is stabilized, even old manual focus stuff; it comes in incredibly handy.Olympus is rightfully renowned for its jpeg processing engine, which continues to impress me in the E620. A lot of people think of jpeg processing as a \"meh\" feature, claiming that all shooting should be done in RAW, but to those people I say - well, I'd rather be shooting than processing. This is a substantial advantage to Olympus which I think is commonly overlooked or downplayed.One of the most attractive aspects of the E series, other than its size, is the wealth of excellent and affordable Olympus lenses. Olympus glass is right up there with the big boys, and the cost is way lower; this is a marvelous system to be in if you're value-conscious.Of course, it's not all roses.There are several general disadvantages of Four Thirds when compared to APS-C that are manifest in the E620: poor high ISO performance (generally 1 to 2 stops worse than APS-C of similar class), poor dynamic range (again, 1 to 2 stops worse), and more limited DoF control (also 1 to 2 stops worse at a given FoV).Although the E-620 is usable at high ISO, the noise levels just can't compete with APS-C bodies in the same price range. Low-light also brings out the worst of the E-620's AF system, which suffers huge lag and hunts frequently below a certain threshold. This is only compounded by the fact that there's no built-in AF illumination lamp, making the E-620's low-light performance even worse. If you're shooting primarily in challenging lighting conditions, you should either consider a different system, or invest in some of Olympus's wonderful (but very expensive) f/2 zooms to compensate for these weaknesses.Speaking of lenses, although Olympus' own lineup is superb and represents a generally good value, the number of 3rd party Four Thirds lenses out there is very small, so you're looking at minimal competition for the value sector. It's pretty much Olympus or the highway; there are a few Sigma and Panasonic Four Thirds lenses available, but not many.That brings me to possibly the most disturbing thing about the E620: it's the only consumer-level Four Thirds DSLR still on the market. Olympus has bet the farm on the mirrorless Micro Four Thirds system, and it's left a lot of question marks surrounding their DSLR strategy. Excepting the E-600 (a stripped-down version of the E-620), the Olympus E-5 12.3MP Digital SLR is the only new Four Thirds DSLR since the release of the E620 over two years ago, and that's aimed squarely at the high end; there's nothing to replace the E620 now and nothing on the horizon to do so in the future.Should that stop you from buying the E620? Not in and of itself, but it should certainly give you pause. There's a reason that Olympus is investing in the Micro Four Thirds system, and the reason is that it's *good*. Modern Micro Four Thirds bodies like the Olympus PEN E-PL2 will give you a very similar feature set to the E620 at a very similar price point, which raises the question: why would you still buy a DSLR at all, when the future is clearly in mirrorless technology?The reason I personally own and use the E620 is the autofocus, which is still unmatched by the PEN series. I personally own the excellent Olympus Zuiko 50-200mm f/2.8-3.5 Digital ED SWD lens, and the PENs just can't autofocus it acceptably for sports; for such an application, you need a DSLR, and the E620 (or the E5) remains relevant due to this. Of course, with every new body release, the gap narrows, and eventually Olympus will surely remove DSLRs from its lineup completely.That brings me to the bottom line: who should buy the E620 now?That's a tough question to answer. If you already own Olympus Four Thirds glass (in particular, lenses that don't work with Micro Four Thirds CDAF natively) and need to upgrade from an old Ex00 or Ex10 series body, well, this seems to make a lot of sense from a cost/performance perspective. Micro Four Thirds won't provide you with the AF you're used to on those nice Olympus lenses, and there's not really anywhere other than the E620 to turn. That was my situation, and I've been happy with the decision.If you don't have an investment in legacy glass, I'm not sure that the E620 really makes sense now. It's a capable camera, sure, but why not think of the E-PL2 or the Panasonic GF2 instead? You have a much smaller kit with a very similar feature set.

The image stabilization has really helped on hand-held shots with my 70-300mm zoom.  The LCD is very large, bright and sharp and I really like the swivel capability.  I also like that the LCD can be folded to face inward to the body for protection/storage.  The body is very light and easy to handle and seems very solid despite being made of plastic.  My E300 had a metal body and was as sturdy as a tank, but was also *much* heavier.I also like that Olympus uses the Four-Thirds image sensor format. A lens designed for this format has a 2x focal length multiplier of the equivalent lens designed for the 35mm film format.  For example, my 70-300mm zoom has the equivalent field of view of a 140-600mm lens designed for 35mm film.  This 2x factor is also a significant increase over that of the APS-C image sensor format used by Canon and Nikon which have multipliers of 1.5x and 1.6x respectively compared to 35mm.  This allows for significantly smaller and lighter lenses for the same focal range.  Combine this with the excellent Olympus Zuiko kit lenses that you can buy with the E620 (as well as the rest of the Zuiko lens offerings) and you have smaller/lighter lenses with a reputation for excellent image quality for less money.

(Not the same one - a burglar got the first one in the 1970s, but one i found at a good price in a pawn shop.)About the same time that i reached the point that the only lab that could print the shots from the Pen FT was fifty or sixty miles away, consumer/\"pro-sumer\" digital cameras finally started getting almost as good as a half-frame film camera, and i decided that - with reluctance - i was going to have to go digital.First i got a factory-refurbed 2-lens Olympus E450 kit.  Used that for about a year, and was quite happy with it.  (Wanna see pictures of my grandkids?)But i saw a good price for a used 620 body, and decided to the 620, which has a slightly-higher resolution, the swivel LCD (very nice; since i'm left-handed and -eyed, it cuts down on the noseprints on the screen), and generally more flexibility of use.And body-based Image Stabilisation.After living with Olympus digital gear for almost two years, i am generally satisfied and happy with the equipment and the results.Olympus's Zuiko lenses were always pretty good glass - not surprising. since they also make high-grade microscopes, and the lenses i got with my 450 (the same ones that would come with an E620 kit) are no exception.  They could be a little faster, but fine for everyday use.The 620's shooting modes are well-thought and all work well.Image quality (with some caveats) is excellent; the IS seems to do its job well and unobtrusively.I shoot in what Olympus calls \"Large Super-Fine\" mode - only RAW mode gives higher-resolution/quality images - minimally compressed JPEG images with a resolution of 4032 x 3024.  This allows making prints up to 13 x 10 inches printing at 300 DPI resolution.  At that quality/resolution setting, my 8-gig Compact Flash card is good for about 800 images; the 620 (unlike the 450 it replaced) is capable of using a 16-gig CF, but i haven't gotten around to the upgrade. (\"Middle Super-Fine\" gets about 2100 images on the CF; \"Small Super-Fine\" allows about 8000.)The camera is capable of several different aspect ratios, in addition to the native 4:3 of its Four-Thirds sensor - 3:2, 16:9 and 6:6, which allows printing to various sizes of image without too much cropping a bit simpler.  (Selecting other ratios does reduce the total pixel count of the image, since it accomplishes the ratio change by cropping the image on the sensor.)The resolution settings range from the \"Large\" resolution of 4032 x 3024 down to \"Small\" (1280 x 960).  \"Medium\" would be quite acceptable for  4 x 6 prints, while \"Small\" would be more than adequate for images to use online.Theoretically, you should be able to get about 500 shots on a fully-charged battery; there is a hand-grip that allows you to put two batteries in for extended shooting and also makes it easier to shoot portrait (what we film dinosaurs still call \"vertical\") images.As i say, image quality is excellent - so long as you keep your \"film speed\" below about 640 ISO.  Getting higher, and in lower light levels, the sensor does get somewhat noisy and image quality can suffer.  There is automatic image noise reduction, and it does help somewhat, but, unlike film cameras (where you can get 1000 or higher ISO with good image quality), this is not a camera for shooting in extreme \"available darkness\" modes.The built-in pop-up flash is excellent - within the limitations of such devices.  If you plan on doing a lot of low-light flash photography, investing in an external flash - either from Olympus or one of the excellent third-party units available.  Besides offering greater illumination range for taking pictures of subjects further from the camera the built-in flash can handle, the external TTL-capable flashes include an infrared focusing aid, which is less-annoying than the quick flickering of the built-in flash as the camera attempts to focus in low light conditions, but also rather faster.For the money i spent on it, this is an excellent camera, and i am quite happy with it.If i had A Lot More Money, i'd probably want to step up to either an Olympus-built pro body (allowing me to continue to use the lenses i have until i could afford better glass, too) or to a \"pro-sumer\" or pro camera built by another company.Absent an Incredible Deal on another manufacturer's equipment ... i'd buy this one again.(Of course, my next contemplated photo purchase is a used Pentax 67 \"medium format\" [6 x 7 CM, 120 roll-film] outfit, so, hey...)", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Noisy Little Bugger", "Author": "Rosa A Agosto", "ReviewID": "R2AGW1IMSQXOKM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "O.k. so, with the kit lenses, the noise is pretty ugly as you bump up your ISO (I'm talking even ISO 400).

You'll absolutely need a tripod to get a good shot.The autofocus on this thing can really suck.  And don't even think about using autofocus in low lighting.  As it probably is stated in many other reviews, the on camera flash goes haywire if the autofocus is struggling.What I've personally done to cope with this cameras downfalls is 1. shoot with manual focus a lot and 2.  buy an adapter for my film lenses (e.g. my lens with 1.7 aperture doesn't have a noise problem at ISO 400).I have shot a lot of great photographs with this camera.

Heath", "ReviewID": "R1VX5P57F7MLYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will be the briefest of reviews as my technical knowledge of DSLRs is very limited--in fact this is the first one I have used--and so far I have only taken one set of test point-and-shoot photos with the camera set on automatic.My first impressions of this product favourable: this is a nice camera to hold and use. For me it's important to have something lightweight--a larger DSLR is out of the question, and the E-620 is not a burden to carry around. The user-manual is rather intimidating and I came to a grinding halt on page 74: \"Flash shooting\". But that's because I don't have a separate flash gun yet! Anyway, it is a sophisticated little camera and clearly one must study the user manual at some point...My first set of photos, taken on a sunny high-contrast day, were as good as one could expect. The auto-focus and auto-exposure worked quite well and the text on various sign boards (I photographed a downtown shopping area) stood out sharp. Basically, I'm happy with these first pictures. However, I don't think this is a beginners camera, and extensive testing and study is required to get maximum utility from what is essentially a smart product.Some gripes: not a great lens cap; the viewfinder is rather small; the menu design is very poor (mentioned by a previous reviewer, and quite rightly); battery life seems a bit on the short side to me (but then I left the camera switched on most of the time out of habit). None of these drawbacks are critical, but I have deducted one rating star because of them. But really an intriguing camera, and that's why I chose it, after a not-too-long deliberation. The E-620 struck the right balance between price and functionality for me, and came with highly-recommended, lightweight kit lenses.Other cameras I considered: Nikon D3000 (lower end) and the Pentax K7 (higher end).To be continued...Update (1.11.10) I've now been using this camera long enough to add a bit more to this review, though my comment/s will again be brief.I have to say that I have mixed feeling about this camera. I'll start with my negative feelings: it's not an especially easy camera to use out of the box, and I find the way the functionality organised convoluted. Let me give you an example: to adjust aperture you don't go to the super control panel, but hit the info button. This just doesn't make any sense at all: you should be able to adjust aperture much more easily than that. Other things I just haven't figured out yet, so it's not the fault of the camera, but why is it taking me so long to get a handle on fill-in flash and the panarama function? I think this camera's interface is not intuitive at all and there are a hundred ways it could be improved. The E-620 appears to chronically underexpose and though there are ways around this I find the need edit almost every picture I take irritating.On a more positive note, the camera does take good quality images (once you've worked out the camera's parameters). The small size of this camera is a winner: I find it no burden at all to carry around. The swivel-head LCD screen is a real boon for all kinds of work and must surely become a DSLR standard. It's a well made camera and appears to be able to take a knock. The filters are a gimmick I suppose, but why not work with them and see what you can do? The camera is not boring. On the contrary, and like a sports car, it demands attention and driving hard. The E-620 does, however, have limits -- only a 7-point meter, for example -- and it occurs to me (in hindsight) that it is expensive for what it does. The price is dropping all the time though, and the kit package is better value for money than when I made my purchase. Bear in mind that when you buy a DSLR that this is only the beginning of your expense, and you should consider the whole system. Olympus' four-thirds E-system is innovative, but has drawbacks in terms of performance. It seems to me that Olympus score very highly in the portability department, which was important to me.

For live-view in low light, like using the modeling lights in studio, the aperture has to be wide open at 3.5, and this also makes focus easier, since at 3.5 DOF is very narrow.

I mainly enjoy macro photography, but do shoot the occasional (family) sporting event or senior portraits.  There are plenty of high-quality, yet affordable lenses to choose from to obtain the look & feel one desires in a variety of situations.The inclusion of image stabilization into the body itself is a HUGE plus, as it decreases the hassle of searching for lenses with that feature already added (but one need not use it).  The multi-point autofocus system is nice touch when either deciding which part of a scene to focus on.  (One can also change where the autofocus locks in the camera's settings.)With this camera, I never suspect the possibility of a real letdown:  the images always come out superb, it's lightweight & durable body hold up in less-than-perfect conditions (e.g. non-room temperatures or a little extra weight on it won't hurt, though I wouldn't take it out in the rain or snow), and the art filters provide a fun alternative to the usual camera shooting modes.I must say, though, that the battery life quickly drains if one uses live view--something macro photographers MUST have--for too long.  On that note, the LCD screen's ability to flip outward makes the E-620 essential for capturing those awkwardly angled photos (ex: holding the camera over a ledge).All in all, this camera is perfect if you are looking to get into photography on a more serious level, but are lacking in money (or time or desire) to commit to it full-time.

With this screen, I can simply flip it out and rotate it to be easily seen from a seated position facing the camera/tripod assembly.

If there were a need to hold the camera high over your head, you can rotate the screen down so you can just look up to see what the camera sees.

It is obviously more responsive than a point-and-shoot, and is better in low-light situations, though not good enough to take satisfactory pictures of people inside my house in late afternoon without using a flash.  However, I have taken fewer \"wow\" outdoor pictures with this camera than I did in a similar period of time with an Elph.  The limited dynamic range makes it difficult to capture outdoor scenes where part of the scene is in shadow; this is more pronounced than I saw with an Elph and limits the utility of the camera in early morning or late evening light, when I'm accustomed to taking my best pictures.

With the 620, you're just not sure. Most of the photos are spot-on, but sometimes the meter seems to be simply overwhelmed. This happens most frequently in situations with very strong and directional sunlight, but it will get into a run where you literally cannot get a shot -- it overexposes by 4 or 5 f/stops.

Shin", "ReviewID": "R1GQ1X08F5WH8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1.  By way of background, I've been shooting for many years--> Contax / Zeiss 35mm, Noblex and Xpan Panoramics (ie film cameras) and then with the Sony R1, Olympus E-420, Ricoh GX100/200 (ie digital cameras).2.  I bought the E-620 basically for the minor upgrade that it represents compared to the E-420.  After a month of moderate use, I'll give my non-scientific impressions about this camera.  Obviously for the proper and technical review--> you'll have to wait for dpreview to come out with their review (which should be very soon).3.  Basic thoughts and impressions:  *  re:  Size:  just a tad bit bigger than the E-420, but overall--> obviously a very compact camera, which is really one of the big reasons why I went into the Olympus system in the first place.  Although the camera is a tiny bit bigger than the E420, I find this to be a positive in that the E-420 hardly had any grip.  * re: Handling:  as noted above, this is a small camera but not cramped.  it feels well, at least in my hands.  However with midrange quality lens (ex:  12-60mm), it's on the border of being unbalanced, but doable.  Definitely with the 50-200mm, this body would be an unbalanced with that size of a lens.  * re:  Viewfinder:  as noted via many folks on the internet--> man, it really stinks.  Because the data display is now on the bottom of the frame, it's even more difficult to see compared to the E-420.  If you wear glasses, you'll have to wear contacts to properly use this camera;  yes, the viewfinder is that lame.  I would say that the viewfinder is the worst part of this camera.  *  re:  Focusing:  definitely better than the E-420.  I mainly use the 12-60mm and the focusing speed and I'm thinking accuracy is overtly better.  It's more than adequate for generic shooting situations, however perhaps may not cut the mustard in re: sports shooting or low light shooting.  I mainly shoot landscapes and thus this isn't an issue.  *  re:  Image Quality:  In general good to very good quality images are capable with this camera (as well as the E-420)... However one has to know how to properly expose the images (as is true with all cameras, but perhaps a bit more with the Olympus cameras) and shoot in RAW (because the Olympus cameras definitely have less... tolerance when manipulating the images in Photoshop etc...).  With that being said, the colors are nice, the images are sharp, the much talked about dynamic range is... ok.  I haven't used the camera enough to know if there is more dynamic range compared to the E-420 despite what the hype is on the internet.  Nonetheless, there is enough data in the RAW data to work with the image in most shooting situations.  Despite what folks say, I wouldn't use this camera beyond ISO 400.  *  re:  other stuff:  The above were the most important features / issues for me.  Other stuff--> LCD (average, the swivel feature is a plus, however I haven't had to use it thus far).  IS--> not that big a deal for me, but nice to have.  A slightly faster frame rate (4 frames / sec), but with the downside of the buffer filling up sooner.  Menu system--> same as the E-420 (which is a nice logical system).4.  Overall, this is a nice camera , especially for those who really know how to maximize the camera's potential and don't shoot sports or low light / high ISO photography.  As an landscape / mountaineering type photographer, this is an ideal camera due to the light weight, high quality optics and overall good feature set.

I would rate myself as just beginning the intermediate skill level, mostly based on technical rather than composition or creative skills.There are, as advertised, lots and lots of features and functions with this camera almost too many for an intermediate photographer. It gets overwhelming at times. For someone of my skill level it has not produced stellar pictures right out of the box, it requires a fair amount of knowledge and fiddling with the controls. As I get more familiar with the camera I am sure the quality of my photos are going to improve. If you are looking for a performance point and shoot replacement you may want to consider sticking with a high end point and shot camera.The size and weight of the camera is quite satisfactory to me, for what it is capable of.The biggest complaint I have is not the camera but the manual. If you are not already familiar with the terms and functions it offers, minimal help is found in the manual. In fact if you are familiar with the operation of a digital SLR you may find the manual even less useful than I have. It touches on most or all of the features, but if you experience difficulty using a feature much of the time it leaves you hanging on what to do to correct whatever the issue is. It forces you to jump around from place to place in the manual, uses some acronyms that don't seem to have an explanation anywhere in the manual and does not answer your concerns. You may find, as I have the need to search outside the manual which is not always an easy task. Needless to say I think the manual need a serious rewrite.There are two features that could stand a design change. The plastic slide in contact protector for the external flash and the slide on plastic light shield for the optical viewfinder are both items that are very likely to become lost or misplaced. It would be very nice if they were designed to be moved into or out of position without having to completely remove them from the camera thus reducing the chance of loss.However, all in all the E-620 is a very capable and nice camera and I would recommend it to anyone who is sure they want to step away from a point and shoot. One additional consideration, which many professionals suggest, is you may want to consider higher grade lenses than the lenses that come packaged with the camera as a kit.

I started cheap with the e-410, upgraded to the e-510, and when this one with the swivel screen came out I moved to it. The line of ED lenses were excellent and I took some great shots, always looking for the next \"E\" model camera to see what improvements were made - but, the \"E\" line died with the E620 along with the four-thirds format. Some other brands had moved into that format but dropped it as well.Now we have the \"Micro\" four-thirds digital SLRS of which some are slim and others more like a 35mm camera, and a slew of new lenses (both zoom and primary), which will not work on the \"E\" series (to the best of my searching ability). So, I'm stuck at the moment, but if I had a choice where to be stuck it would be with this camera and it's 12.3mp rather than something lower.I could go to the micro four-thirds cameras which will use my lenses, after I purchased an adapter for $160.

Besides the swivel door (which is great), the features themselves are good and while I've found the Flash to be lacking severely (it screws up more pictures than not)the camera is very good in low light, so I shoot exclusively w/o using the flash.

I use the camera with the 14-54 (mark I), the 14-42mm, and the 40-150mm, mostly for landscape photography.  I also use the doubler to get an entire room in the shot.  At least Oly makes adapters, so your lenses can still work with the new bodies.When new, this was the camera to have for outdoor shots.  It is lighter than its peers in the canikon world and the live view screen is really helpful.  The kit lenses are smaller and lighter than its peers.  I have lugged it in many national parks and various hikes without complaint.  I've beaten it and it is still mint condition.Here in 2012, if you have to carry around a camera hiking long miles, then just buy an Oly PEN or OM-D and forget about this camera.  If you shoot a ton of indoor candid photos (weddings), get something else.  Also, used lenses are expensive and harder to come by online.  Plus the real fast lenses are super expensive.  Note that all E-volt cameras are a crop factor of 2 so 14-42 is really 28-84mm.  That means if you're a wide angle buff, this is a terrible choice.  I had to buy the .4x adapter.  It works OK but I paid too much and there is too much distortion on the edges.  Having to buy multiple sets of filters to fit on all the varying lens sizes stinks!!  I have to carry around two sets of filters!But if you're a photo student, or looking for a good used value, I think this is right for you.  Battery life is OK, but excellent with live view turned off.  I spend two days in Zion national park on one battery charge!I use the bracketing a lot to get the best landscape shots.  It really helps get the dynamic range.  The 14-54 Mk1 is an excellent sharp lens.  Trouble is that only the newer Mark II has the live view hybrid focus... but for landscape photos, it's no issue.  Since I got it, I hardly ever get the 14-42 out of my bag.  The live view screen is very helpful, and the overlayed histogram is great.  I use it to help dial in my polarizer for those blue sky shots.  The times I've had trouble with the camera were in slot canyons, trying to deal with limited light and still get the shot to come out.  I use a knockoff remote and a Chinese issue carbon fiber tripod to help in these situations.  I was in one situation where the camera literally would not take a shot, due to lighting conditions.  I never shoot in auto mode and always in RAW.  Also because the sensor is smallish, there is more noise than the canikon competitors.  Again, I shoot outside so no problem here.

But as you'll see these two are also my main reasons for wanting to upgrade.I had an Olympus SP-570UZ 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom before this.  Needless to say the E-620 was superior on all counts.  Better pictures hands down.  And being able to buy bigger and/or better lenses was a great plus.  So that is the argument for buying a DSLR, but why did I choose Olympus?  I compared the E-620 with the Nikon D40.  The Olympus was just simply superior.  Higher resolution, articulating screen, even better (shocking I know) noise performance than the entry level Nikon camera.  Unfortunately the one camera store in my area still selling DSLR gear didn't carry a single Canon lens or camera.  So I was unable to test Canon hands-on.  Faced with Nikon vs Olympus, Oly won.

Even with upgraded lenses, the ISO performance just blows.  400 and higher and I start to worry about how much detail will be lost when I fix the noise in post.Another issue I had with this camera began when I wanted to upgrade away from the kit lenses.  While shopping for better lenses I became quite frustrated.  The biggest aperture auto-focus lens you can buy for the Olympus 4/3rds system maxes out at f/2.  f/2!  f/2 certainly does help in the ISO department, but not enough for some situations.On the subject of lenses, you can buy an adapter for the Nikon F mount, but not canon.  So I was able to use an old Nikon 50mm f/1.4 manual focus lens with this camera, but manual focusing is another problem.  Some of the E-system cameras are able to have the focus screen changed, but not the E-620.  So no split-screen focusing screens are available.  If your subject is still and you are on a tripod, you can use magnified live view to check the focus, which is great for studio work and landscapes.  But that is all the Nikon 50mm f/1.4 was good for on this camera.My last issue with this camera is the Olympus wireless flash system.  I bought an Olympus FL-36R flash to use off-camera with my camera.  I was delighted that I didn't need to buy triggers to get it off camera (unlike canon/nikon).  But I was disappointed about the method.  Olympus designed a way to program the off camera flash using the on camera flash.  Some short signal from the on camera flash tells the off camera flash how to fire.  Well this sounds ok in theory, but in reality, not so much.  The off camera flash must be \"facing\" the on camera flash, or have very little blocking it, as the on camera flash isn't powerful enough to reach around much.  So changing the flash from right to left you have to twist everything around to get the sensor on the FL-36R facing the camera.  Another problem is shooting anything with a reflective surface.  The timing of everything means that the light from the on-camera flash, while less than the off-camera flash, will still visible in any subject that is metallic or glassy.  I have compensated for this by covering the on camera flash with my hand, bouncing the light to the off-camera flash, but blocking the light toward the subject.  I am tired of using this system frankly.So, being stuck with lens options from 2 manufacturers (Olympus and Panasonic), and dreading low light conditions, and a disappointing flash system, I am faced with only one option... sell my entire kit and start over with Nikon or Canon.  Olympus simply hasn't updated their E-system line since 2010, and even then only the flagship.  This is very disheartening.  Canon and Nikon update their DSLR line every year.  And Olympus is focusing on compact cameras.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mediocre camera", "Author": "John Wong", "ReviewID": "RQC6UPY97RCZL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is out of production but I wanted to leave a review for it since others may use Amazon to research their purchase of an E-620. I had one and found it a mediocre camera for the following reasons:1) Image quality. All of the photos that I took lacked sharpness. Normally, I would use the jpeg files and the camera's processing is poor. Because of the poor jpeg files I also wrote files out to raw but those were slightly better but also not that great. The jpeg files from the default settings had a reddish cast. I think that's supposed to favor portraits but a good camera doesn't have to do that and wouldn't do that (see sample images from a Fuji X100 -- neutral but beautiful colors). Scenery taken with this camera also had a reddish cast which was annoying because you want the sky to be blue and foliage to be bright green. What typically goes into making a good looking image can be a number of factors and sometimes it's not easily definable. However, you know good imagery when you see it. The E-620 didn't produce good images for whatever reason. At the time I owned the E-620 I also had a Sony A230 and just got a Sony NEX-7 and so I could use them for side-by-side comparison of images.Besides the 14-42mm kit lens I also had the 9-18mm wide zoom and that was a terrible lens with very noticeable chromatic aberration and also lacked sharpness. It wasn't an expensive lens but it's wasn't that cheap either (current street price $600).In case the reader is thinking that I'm being overly critical because of its 12mp vs. the 24mp resolution of the NEX-7, that's not the case at all. I've taken very good and sharp pictures using a 10mp Panasonic P/S (with Leica lens) and a camera like the Panasonic LX7 (recently released with 10mp resolution) takes beautiful and sharp pictures. Compare the images for yourself on DPReview's website. One of the link's at the top of their web page is for sample images and it'll give you a whole page of sample images taken using a variety of cameras, including the E-620, and you can see for yourself.2) Size. It's four thirds mount camera but it wasn't that small. Set next to my Sony A230 it was only slightly smaller. It also wasn't that light. Overall, with the 9-18mm zoom in the camera bag it didn't give me any size or weight advantage over the Sony A230 with its kit lens plus a Tokina wide angle zoom lens.3) Slow live view. The screen that could swing out and pivot was great but using it for live view slowed the camera down so that it was no longer usable for moving objects (e.g. pets).The camera was well made and I wanted to like it but ultimately it didn't have it where it counted, image quality.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "P.

Moreover, I had started out in photography in the 70's with the Olympus OM series cameras (which I still own), so I have a soft spot in my heart for Olympus cameras.But, regrettably, this camera has performed below par.  It routinely fails to focus properly (instead focusing just ahead or behind the intended target).  And even with a pretty expensive lens with a good reputation -- the 14-60mm f/2.8-4 -- it does not yield particularly good images.This camera has been a disappointment for me.

Rather, I'm an amateur travel photo enthusiast who enjoys recording my trips.  With that said, during a recent trip to Europe, I shot excellent day, night, dusk, and indoor flash-less shots with this camera--all of which turned out marvelous.  I really need some photography education, but even without any, I figured out how to shoot some proud photos with this easy-to-use camera.The camera design is excellent, the construction is sturdy, and the 2 lenses fill all my needs.  Any criticisms I might include would be a slightly unresponsive Menu button (sometimes after being depressed, the screen only lights for a moment, requiring a 2nd push.  A 2 GB memory card held about 600 photos taken at full file size (no complaints, I'd never exceed that on a trip).  Battery life was not a problem.  After about 300 shots, it required re-charging, but only because I took so many trial photos with the flash.  The art filters are fun, too.  Don't even bother with the software, that always sucks, and you don't need it anyways to upload the photos to your computer.  I have no regrets with buying this camera.  Should it go south on me, I'll revise this review.  Good luck!Revised on 07/16/2010:  I don't like this camera after all.  In SO MANY lighting situations, such as in an afternoon living room and anything darker, this camera refuses to take photos.  Yes, I'm an amateur, but the camera should at least take a crappy photograph rather than nothing at all!  I do the same thing with my friend's new Nikon D5000, and the camera take the photo & functions flawlessly.  This stupid Olympus constantly flickers (the light meter) when I depress the shoot button, and then refuses the photo.  My little old Kodak point & shoot will even take photos in no light situations, while this finicky piece of junk wants to dictate the conditions.  Avoid this product.Revised on 03-05-12: Okay, I eat humble pie and concede that all along, it's mostly been me.  I underestimated how much there is to learn about digital photography to become an acceptable photographer with an SLR.  Fellow Amazonians have helped me better my skills, especially with a book I bought here on Amazon (Complete Digital Photography, 6th edition).  This book rocks and is great for getting frustrated amateurs like me taking decent photos.  I have so much more to learn, so keep those comments coming!  Oh and by the way, I've adjusted my rating of this camera to 4 stars.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "A mid entry camera ready for a semi professional level photography", "Author": "Abhijit Bhowmick \"AB photography\"", "ReviewID": "R27NSVLJM10RQC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I researched 4-5 cameras alongwith E620 before I purchased it. Pretty much every review that I read was pointing towards Olympus E620 as being a most bang for money product. So I purchased it and after using it for close to 9 months I realised that the reviews were not biased. Olympus surely is a great bang for money since with 2 kit lens I get the most compared to D5000 or Xsi. The kit lens are not only good, if someone starts capturing with RAW format you will have better control when you do post processing.PROS:Weight - Since E620 is a 4/3rd sensor camera, it gets the advantage of using smaller diameter lens. My friend using D5000 was surprised to see the size of the lens. Reason 4/3rds gives you 2x magnification on a 35mm sensor (full frame format). One more aspect is Zuiko lenses runs with firmware. So if there is some enhancements that needs to be done on the lens functionality all you need to do is download the latest firmware on the lens and it works accordingly. Which means these lens can have longer life and utility since upgrade is through the firmware and not the lens body.Build - Seriously compare D5000 and Canon Xsi with E620, the build is more compact and don't have plastic feeling. All buttons are positioned in a way where you can reach them with your fingers while keeping your eye on the eye hole. For people with large hands, the camera might feel small due to it's compact size, but shutter is still at a convenient place. If this camera had a dust or water protection feature, that would be a mid entry level camera killer.Colors: I have to mention this, the colors are coming out better than I expected. Specially Blue and orange. If you love to shoot landscapes, then sky color will turn out great. I am not mentioning other colors, sicne I have recently clicked some fall colors and they have come out crisp and sharp.Useability: Camera navigation is easy, may be I am used to it, but I really do feel they were constructed intelligently. Think about it the D5000 has a swivel screen at the bottom of the camera, why ??? Olympus pulled it off by having it on the side. It helps swivel the LCD anyway you want at difficult camera positions, however with Nikon there are some positions that's not possible with the swivel coming down. It may not matter to many people, but on 3 differnt occassions I was like thank god I had this on the side. Since the camera is light it can be carried seamlessly without much neck pain all around. Autobracketing is nice and useful you need to shoot HDR pictures. 3 frames per second is not too bad but again this can be a con to some professionals who covers sports or racing eventsFeatures: I personally do not use filters since I shoot everything in RAw format and they are great. It gives me more power while doing post processing. First time users will find these filters useful in creating great out of cam jpegs and honestly they turn out extremely good. Image stabiliation is built in body which means you will get stability upto 2-3 f-stops. Which menas compared to D5000 you will be able to get no-blur picture at lower aperture values. Helped me so far, I struggled to click a low light picture using D5000 at 5.6 aperture value, whereas at same a-value I could click without a blur.CONS:1. Autobracketing on/off should have been more easy. Everytime I have to go from AB to none AB, I have to go through some configurations. Since I shoot HDR photos, hence it is important for me to have this, but may not be important to most people.2. Under low light the lens keeps on metering nd infact you have to struggle a bit to get the shot going without flash. So I increase the IOS to 800 and up. What happens is at high ISOs the photos get noise in them. This is a concern for me since at large photo dimensions these noises will be too obvious and may disrupt the overall quality of the photo. D5000 outperforms everyone else in this field. This is an issue with all 4/3rd sensor cameras though. I hope in their next upgrade they come up with better noise reduction technique. This is a concern but not a worrying point since most of my pics are shot in lighted areas.3. Oly lenses are expensive too. I though since these lenses don't have to include IS in their lens as the canonikons do, these would be cheap, but wrong. The camera body with kit lens is cheap (good bang for money) but when you buy good aperture'd telephoto lenses those are expensive.4. Some distortion at corners when clicked at wide angle of some object or scenario. This can be fixed in the software though5. all mid-entry level cameras have video, both canon and nikon have. E620 does not have. This is one thing I was bit bothered about, sicne the future is with still and video photogrpahy in one device.CONCLUSION:----------------In the end if you are buying your first camera then go for E620 as it will help you in your learning curve and ofcoursw the good bang for money. But if you are for an upgrade from 520 or want to switch camera brand and you are at an advanced stage (professional level), then you may as well look out for D7000 (which is always a better option than D5000 and E620).============================================================================================Ok after using it for 9 months I have to change my outlook to Olympus cameras. While i was travelling cross-country, I had to capture the rural parts of the country. I could not shoot any pictures. Why ? my stupid E620 LCD screen doe snot show any picture. All I see is green and orange lines. The shutter button is not clicking pictures in non-live view mode either. All in all a crap camera form a crap company. the camera stops working within warranty period. Service centre doesn't know what has happened and told me to wait before they examine it and that would take some time. So DISAPPOINTING-----------------------------------------------------Modified review: Leaving the bad customer support experience, I moved on and hence decided to increase the stars.
