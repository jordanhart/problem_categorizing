I assume this was an invitation to double my investment. So eventually I did and had to pay the shipping again.When the item did arrive and was integrated into our system the color transfer across balun was disappointing. I have a balun setup which is powered (not passive) like this one and it yields better results.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best solution for runs over 25 ft!", "Author": "Ryan P. Cunningham", "ReviewID": "RVZKDHKQ7IVRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are the best solution for any S-Video run over 25 ft. Cat5e cable is cheap and is easy to run and terminate.These have been installed in a system that require S-Video feeds from a camera. We used to run a dual mini coax cable and then terminate the two cables into one S-Video plug. That was a tedious and time consuming process. It required someone with a medium to high skill level in soldering. These systems are installed across the country with some installers being first-time volunteers. Now anyone can be taught how to terminate into an 8P8C ( RJ45 ). The cost of this adapter compared to bulk or pre-built S-Video cables is far outweighed by it's value in ease of installation and termination. Video quality over a long length (100-200 ft) is the same as a quality 25ft pre made cable.These are now a standard item in our purchasing requirements for our ASL Control system.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001DPX5TE"}}
