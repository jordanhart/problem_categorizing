I wanted a small digital camera that had some manual controls. The camera also had to feel sturdy and have a menu system that was intuitive for me. The C50 won out over my other choices hands down (Minolta F100 and Nikon CP4500). Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and can live with the little quirks I've read about with this camera. The remote comes in handy when displaying your pictures on TV. Also, the battery life on this little guy is quite good -- much better than the Kodak I had. Olympus could have done a better job on the printed manual. The manual on CD is much better and they should have just printed out that manual in the appropriate language for the countries they ship to.", "Date": "May 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Chock full of features in a compact design.", "Author": "M. J. Mincey \"Electronics Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RPYC6J2L4B722", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a big fan of Olympus from day one.  I've been using digital cameras for a few years but have never owned one until now, so I wanted to make sure I got the most bang for my buck.  I was looking at this camera and the Canon S45 which has just hit the shelves.  I opted for this camera over the Canon, despite it's few shortcomings.  Let me explain...To start off with, I'll give you the downside.  You can't record audio in movie mode (so, just get a video camera if you want to record videos).  Low lighting shooting can be difficult since there is no infrared sensor top assist with the shots.  Disappointing.  Finally, there is no manual focus, which could actually assist with the low light shooting, but alas, it was not included.  This is why I give it 4 stars.On the positive side, pictures are fantastic!  I take this camera with me everywhere and barely have to make any adjustments for my picture taking.  Also, the camera allows you to rotate the pictures and crop WITHIN the camera itself!!!  So, for those of you that take lots of portrait shots, like me, have that capability before downloading to your computer.  Such a time saver.The xD-picture card that it utilizes is the size of a postage stamp.  The card has a current capacity of 128 mb with the 256 mb card due by the end of this month.  In another year or so, the capacity will theoretically reach almost 8 gb!  That's an insane amount of pictures, but it's what you need on those vacations.Plus, the battery life is excellent.  I've used this thing like a workhorse and have taken pictures to fill up my 128 mb card, downloaded the pictures, and started taking more and still didn't have to recharge the battery.  I'm getting a backup just so I don't ever have to take my charger with me.Bottom line is this 5-megapixel camera has all of the bells and whistles you come to expect from Olympus and then some.  For a camera this small that I can pop in my pocket and forget about it, I think the money spent is well worth it, even with the 3 shortcomings I mentioned above.  I highly recommend it!", "Date": "January 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "decent camera but loses out to competition", "Author": "jemaerca", "ReviewID": "R3F5ZSX0WQNQ3P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "pros:- 5MP resolution in a small, well-designed metal body.- allows a great deal of manual control.- good color reproduction.- higher than expected contrast from tonal balance.- low image noise with moderate shutter speeds.- spot metering.- shooting priority play mode (double press of quick view button).- good night exposures with automatic noise reduction.- solid build quality.- bright, high resolution LCD monitor with anti-reflective coating.- included Infrared remote control.- decent battery life (but i'd still recommend getting a spare).- compact dimensions 3.9 x 2.3 x 1.7 in, weighing 8.0 oz.cons:- some purple fringing / chromatic aberrations.- noisy images, \"jaggies\" visible.- limited adjustment on image parameters.- no manual white balance.- no manual focus.- some blue cast using the flash.- no AF illuminator.- high redeye occurrence.- poor movie mode when compared to competition.- manual is on CD.- LCD not very useful in very low light.- glacial write times for TIFFs.- slow image write times.- RAW format not supported.- you can't slide the lens cover to turn the camera on and off when mounted on a tripod nor can you change the battery or xD card.- poor macro ability.- fastest continuous shooting speed is only 1 fps.- no histogram display in record or play mode.- the supplied 32MB xD card is inadequate. be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for more memory.- the batteries supplied are proprietary so add a few bucks to your budget for a spare.the c-50z is a decent camera with 5MP resolution in a compact package.  but there is no manual white balance and no manual focus plus the images compare unfavorably against its competition.  at this price point, check out the canon s50.i hope this helps you in your buying decision. peace.", "Date": "September 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent Features and Performance in a Tiny Package", "Author": "Mad Dog \"maddog6969\"", "ReviewID": "R7LJAN0Z1N2ZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "4.5 StarsThis was the 5th digital camera I've bought and the second with a 5 MB image size.  I've been shopping for a small camera for well over a year and the features of the C-50 finally pushed me over the brink.  A year ago, we chose the Sony DSC-F707 for it's excellent optics and large image size.  Consumer digital has always had inferior image quality compared to even mediocre 35mm film cameras, but the 707 has been an excellent compromise.  The 707 is far too bulky to be a camera one could take anywhere, anytime, thus the search for something more compact.  The C-50 fits these requirements well.We also needed the small camera to be tough.  My wife plans to carry it in her purse nearly all the time and I want to use it on long rock climbs and for mountaineering.  The metal body of the C-50 protects the lens well when not in use and the whole camera has a rugged feel.  Considering how tough Olympus cameras have proven over the years, I expect this one to hold up well.It's trivial to learn to use the C-50, with most of the knobs and buttons having symbols that make sense and allow for intuitive learning.  The user's manual is adequate for learning the fine points.  The flexibility of opeartion is excellent and includes full manual exposure and spot metering, a real plus for capturing a high quality image when the ambient illumination is difficult.Just for fun, I compared the optical quality of the C-50 to our Sony F707, using both a professional copy stand and also using outdoor light while hand held.  In all cases, the Sony provided superior image quality, but the Olympus did very well in comparison, particularly at its widest angle setting.  Excellent wide angle performance has always been a hallmark for Olympus digital cameras, but remember that the Sony F707 costs 1.5 times what the C-50 does, so if you want a small camera with excellent image quality, the C-50 may be the best option currently available.", "Date": "December 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "Olympus C-50 Zoom - Initial Use", "Author": "T. MacVey", "ReviewID": "R1TR3OI6JYVSCN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having previously owned and shot Kodak and Nikon digital cams (2.2 to 5.0 MP) as well as a few Olympus point-and-shoot 35mm with the same form factor as the C-50, I looked forward to picking up this powerful ultra-compact cam.  The size and power of this camera is very impressive - you can almost wrap your hand around it and it easily fits in your pants pocket.I hate to say it, but I am bit disappointed with the C-50, specifically with the surprisingly high level of red eye that crops up in inside/low-light portrait shots (even with using the on-board red-eye reduction and/or customizing settings).  I've not yet used it for outdoor shots and hope to be pleasantly surprised.One other minor note - one thing that initially bugged me was Olympus's use of the Fuji/Olympus XD-Picture Card format.  I'm used to CF and was not crazy about another format but have been impressed by the XD format.  The recycle rate between shots is hands-down the best I've seen yet in a digital cam of any price.  Shooting using the SHQ quality (5.0 MP, high-quality JPEG), my best guess is 2-3 seconds between shots, which, as compared to my experience with CF devices, seems at least 50% faster.  The result is outstanding battery life.  Olympus makes a CF adapter that allows you to insert XD cards into the adapter, thereby creating a CF card that can be used by any CF-compliant input/output device.

With so many makes and models to choose from, I embarked on a year of research not only to compare features and prices, but to figure out at what point in the technological turnover could I purchase the camera that will not be a paperweight in 6 months, but rather be one that will be cheap enough, but carry enough megapixel/zoom/storage power to withstand the scourge of obsolesence.I was set on buying a 3.5 to 4.0 megapixel camera and actually picked a different model.  But when I came across the C-50 zoom, I was floored.  I had made the judgement that I was completely shut out from the 5.0 megapixel class of cameras obviously because of price.Considering that I was willing to part with [money]to purchase a different model that had way less features sounds idiotic to me now.  The C-50's compact footprint compared to most other models' 5 mp cameras is probably it's most substantial advantage.  It's ease of use and straight-forward design is welcome to the technologically -challenged.  featuring 12 exposure modes, 3x digital and up to 12x optical zoom, this camera delivers unbelievably clear pictures.  Excellent as a point and shoot in auto mode, it also gives you the creativity to shape your images to your liking.  I particularly like the portrait and lanscape modes well as 2 modes of spot metering the apperture/shutter priority modes.  One feature that I haven't seen in any model is the \"Mymode\" which lets you program your own favorite settings an can be accessed in the mode dial in the back of the camera.It's on board menu's are easy to navigate and the XD picture cards are easy to swap and manage.  With the supplied USB cable, the C-50 effortlessly docks with any PC or MAC.  It also comes with the Cam media software for either platform.

Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3INJQ022O7XR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending days and days surfing the internet and reading review after review, some good and some not so good regarding this camera, I went forward with the purchasing of one about three months ago.  All hesitation and concern has since subsided and I have to say that this camera is really quite excellent.  Is there a learning curve?  Sure.  However that is NOT to say that the 'auto' feature is insufficient and won't take great shots.  What it does mean is that with a few minutes of investigation and time, you can work with all of the many different settings (that I've not seen on other similarly priced cameras) and take even better pictures.I came to this Olympus from a Fuji (2 MP - Finepix 2400 zoom) and I always thought that my Fuji took brilliant pictures and that it couldn't be beat.  Boy was I wrong.  I can't say enough about the differences.  My Fuji was a great camera, however whenever I take a look at my older pictures taken from my Fuji, they are WAY too bright and in retrospect look quite horrible.  This Olympus' pictures are much softer and easy to look at, more true to life.  In the three months that I've had this camera I've come to realize that this camera really does take fabulous pictures, both in manual and auto mode.  I just can't say enough about the picture quality.One other factor for me was being able to print 4x6 photos on my HP printer.  I've been doing this now for a while and in many cases you're hard pressed to tell the difference.  I've also printed a couple of black and white 8x10's and they look great.  Each full resolution picture takes approximately 2-3 megabytes so make sure you have the disk space for these photos.Overall this camera is excellent.  I was hesitant to spend this much but I've really wanted a 5 MP and believe me it's worth it.  You can zoom and zoom in on a picture and the resolution doesn't change, thus making it easier to zoom in and crop for printing purposes.Buy it..you will NOT be disappointed.", "Date": "June 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "As good as 35mm", "Author": "Bruce Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R3UQRUHT1PQNCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been a serious amateur photographer for years, I was very skeptical that a small snapshot size camera could effectively compete with film.

These vibrant 8 by 10's have all the accuity and impact of 35mm film. This is not true of a 3.2 megapixel camera we own.  It cannot produce professional quality 8 by 10's.

Its sturdy frame invites confidence for the wear-and-tear of daily jean-pocket abuse (my girlfriend, playing with the camera, somehow managed to jammed the head, upon which I actually had to physically nudged it for it to retract).  But since she is capable of breaking anything, such incident should not be held against the quality of the camera.  And what quality!  Whatever I shot turned out wonderously.  Especially still-lifes.  The out-puts, from an Epson 1280,are simply life like and vivid.  Granted, the Canon S-40 and G-2 took even better pictures and would probably have also created great print-outs at 13X19.  But since that I rarely take pictures in dark-settings nor do I need the superior response of the G-2, the differences between the quality of Olympus C-50 and the Canons are indiscernable.  Size, thus the real chance of regular usage makes all the difference.  The C-50 is the total package.P.S.  The battery-life is good enough to last through the 128MB card, just remember to turn the camera off between use.  The horror of saving in the TIFF mode has been greatly exaggerated.  It can take over 10 to 15 seconds at the optimal mode especially when the battery is low.

I was looking for a C5050 and the store I was at didn't carry it, but he suggested that I give the C-50 a try, and that I could return it if I wasn't satisfied.I tried it for a few days, and while it is a decent camera, I felt like it was too expensive for what is essentially a point and shoot camera. So I returned it and have ordered an Olympus D560, which isd only a 3MP camera, but sells for about half the price of the C50.That being said, I don't think this is necessarily a bad camera if you want a 5MP camera in a very compact form factor. I've had an Olympus D460 for a couple years and was reasonably happy with it. The C-50 is very small and compact and offers several improvements over the earlier models. First of all, it is very small and compact. Also, it has a magnesium outer case, which I believe will hold up better than the plastic case of the D460 did. Also, the LCD screen is very bright and easy to see. The menus are easy to see and very intuitive, something that has led me to stay with Olympus.This camera uses the new XD card, which promises faster write times, and it does in fact deliver. I found that the write time for highest resolution images was about a second (informally). This is much better than what I experienced with the D460, which when I added a 128mb card, had save times of about 5 seconds, which was really a pain. I was a little put out to find that Oly had switched card formats, but now that I see the performance improvements, I can see why. The XD cards are also supposed to be much lower power consumers.The battery in this camera appears to be undersized. I found that it only lasted for about 50 pix. And it uses a proprietary Li-ion battery, so you can't just pop another pair of off-the-shelf AA Ni-mH's in it. The battery is very small though, most likely in an effort to save space and weight. It's a trade-off.

You can crop-in alot and still produce high quality pictures.  It is fast if you pre-focus by pressing the shoot button halfway, then is takes about 1/2 second.  If you dont do this, a picture takes about 3 seconds which (with small children) means a lost shot.The flash is amazing and at times can be too bright, causing wash-out.  The \"my settings\" option allows you to dim the flash and I do that for night photos.In low light, however, it has real problems.  The focus does not work at all, so make sure your subjects are about 10-12 ft away (the default focus?)  Anyone 20ft+ will be fuzzy.  Turn on a light and this problem goes away.The unit is very resilient.  It dropped ~2ft a couple times and still works fine.  I even let my 4yo shoot her own pictures occasionally.Easy-to-use:It needs no special software to use with your PC (XP & NT) just plug it in and the PC recognizes it as a drive.  you can then drag&drop; your photos.  The small camera size is very handy and allows me to take it anywhere.  I kept it in my jacket all winter! The battery holds its charge for a typical day, even with heavy use (150+) shots.  But, you still need a second battery to alternate between because it charges outside the camera & date-time will be lost if the battery is out for a few minutes.

But the cable that connects the camera to your USB port is slightly different, so you won't be able to use that.Also, the C-60 can take memory cards of up to 512 MB!  This is pretty impressive (on the highest-quality setting, for example, this will allow you to take about 120 picutres; on the lowest-quality setting, over 6200!), although that's a pretty expensive little card.

The picture quality is quite good. The camera packs a handy 12x zoom (3x optical and 4x digital) and will take pictures at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels! In this review we will take a look at how easy it is to control the cameras advanced and not so advanced features, the quality of images produced, the movie capture mode, some very advanced technical specifications and, naturally, talk about how this camera stands out from the rest.

I found one  and bid  and won it.  When it arrived, i was immediately disapointed.  The door slid open but slanted to the side.  The door was very worn and did not activate the camera as it should have.  I contacted the seller and  he said I needed to buy a memory card as it would not work with out a memory card(so he sent it not working). He did not tell me what kind of memory card so I went to wallmart photo department to buy a card. The worker looked it up and told which one fit the camera.  Upon buying a card  and inserting it, it still would not format the card.  At this point I am throwing my hands up. I  messaged the seller again and he said  it was working when he sent it to me.  As the battery was getting low and the card did not work and  he was not alot of help I asked for my money back.  I sent the camera back and I have still not been reimbersed my money  for the camera.

After 7 years, I still own it; unfortunately, I could of taken better care of it and will have to get a replacement in the next year.  But I believe that this is a testiment of this camera's durability; it's been dropped a couple of times and consistantly thrown in my backpack or purse without it's protective bag.  The features I enjoy using on the Olympus are the variety of camera shooting settings i.e. manual, landscape, portrait, night, action, etc.  The bulky camera size and small screen makes the camera look a little outdated.  The original Li-ion battery lasted approx. 5 years before getting a replacement.  The only problems I have encountered was 5 years later: the lens cover falling off the track (which I had fixed under warranty), the lens doesn't always extend the first time pushing back the cover, I have to press the shutter button down several of minutes before the camera shoots the picture, and the flash doesn't always go off.Pros:*picture settings*pamarama option in the screen menu*continuous shooting with manual setting*multiple flash modes (slow, redeye reduction, slow & redeye reduction, auto flash, and no flash)*long battery life between charges*durabilityCons:*small LCD screen*bulky camera body*15 second quicktime movies (no sound)*32MB card hold approx. 12 pictures at highest resolutionI'm discovering its difficult to find another point and shoot camera that offers similar or better features as a replacement; in addition to letting go of my constant traveling companion.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Takes nice pictures, but very very slow", "Author": "A. Cheng", "ReviewID": "R2YUFUU7TU0FYA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not an avid photographer, but I do like my photos to resemble the colors and shapes that they are in real life, which was not happening with my old Kodak Easyshare. It sufficed for photographing things to sell on Ebay and/or Craigslist, but not much more.I received the Olympus C-50 as a hand-me-down from my aunt, who wanted to upgrade. She used the camera for a trip to Italy (and is the very definition of enthusiastic P&S; photographer), and it took gorgeous photos so I had high hopes.It does take very nice pictures. I wouldn't know a chromatic aberration unless it was pointed to me, but the colors and shapes are true. You can play with the exposure time, which is nice. Flash is a must when taking indoor shots, and it can overexpose in this way. You also have to use the LCD over the viewfinder, because it's the only way to ensure the focus is correct. But for the most part, I'm very pleased with the photos.What is making me want to upgrade is the on/off mechanism, as well as its speed (or lack thereof). I have promised myself never to buy a camera with a sliding door as the power switch, because it has been spontaneously shutting itself off even if I'm very careful in not touching it. Also, it takes about 30 seconds to fully start up, from the moment the door opens to when you can actually take a picture. Probably okay if you're taking pictures of things that don't move, but definitely not a camera you want to take to the zoo, or a party.Also, the flap that covers the USB port is a flimsy sort of rubber, and was open and flapping away when I got it from my aunt. Same with the power port.To conclude, it takes nice pictures, but is so slow it probably doesn't suit most people's needs.", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "POOR SHELF LIFE", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R34QONJTWLN5UH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My husband purchased this camera for me a few years ago. I didn't use the camera very much. As a matter of fact, it still has the original stickers on it. Many add-ons were purchased at the time, some of which I have never used and are still in their factory sealed packages. After the waranty was up I started experiencing problems with the retractable lens; it would not extend out when I opened the sliding door. I have tried to get the sensor part required to fix the problem, from Olypus, but they say the only thing I can buy is a new battery cover. I told them that I was recently advised that poor sensors is a common problem with their retractractable lenses and replacements should be made available. The representative said I could send the camera in to them and they would fix the problem for $125.00 What nerve!

We got our nephew an Olympus C-40 when he and his wife had a baby, and they loved it. So, for her birthday this year, I went to get my wife one, only to find out the C-40 Zoom was no longer made, but the C-50 was even better (the new lithium-ion battery has longer life, and the XD Picture Cards are smaller and faster). She brings this camera everywhere, and besides the travel / family picts, she's now starting to take some artistic pictures, as the camera is always with her. If you can afford it, it's a great camera. Only drawback we've seen so far is the 3x optical zoom, and no ability to add an extender - but, I basically knew that going in, so I shouldn't complain!", "Date": "June 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Red eye in almost every picture.

I thought it would be an improvement over my 3 MP Kodak DX 3900, which took excellent pictures. I brought it home, took pictures and was disappointed to realize about 80 percent of the pictures had redeye, even when on the redeye reduction setting. And some of the pictures were blurry. Very disappointing for a $400 camera. It gave me a greater appreciation for my Kodak, which hardly ever had redeye.So I took it back and got another one thinking I'd gotten some lemon. But yet again I had the same problem.Don't get me wrong, when there's no redeye the pictures can be stunning and very sharp but having to get rid of redeye in photoshop on every picture wasn't an option.I gave up, took it back and got the Canon sureshot s-50. What a difference. Get redeye only about 10 percent of the time and the quality is excellent. And it uses Compact Flash which is ALOT cheaper than the xd picture card.Well, hope this helps those of you trying to decide amongst 5 megapixel cameras.

Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.  Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD such as the C-5050 (drools over it).
