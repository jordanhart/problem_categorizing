I have trouble keeping a computer with a conventional webcam alive when I'm not there, so this was a great solution since it plugs straight into the router and functions without a computer. I find the picture quality to be good as long as there is adequate lighting. Actually, you can see quite a bit even in low light. I haven't been able to figure out how to put the video feed onto a separate web page, otherwise I would give the camera five stars. Programming the router for remote access via your ISP is not all that easy, but it can be done with a little understanding of IP addressing and networks.

Miner", "ReviewID": "RDRL60GFP0QS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this model camera a few years ago, and have just bought another.  I'm not an IT person, but with the help of the Users Guide, and a very helpful tech support person, it's working well.  The camera comes with a Quick Start Guide, but there is additional documentation available from the Trendnet web site - the Users Guide, FAQs and one on remote web access, all as pdf docs.  It's worth taking the time to read everything and understand the steps to get it working.  Even if you don't understand the ins and outs of network configuration, you can get it going by just carefully following their instructions.  The difficult part is making the camera visible via the Internet, because there is a lot of variability in how each local network connects to the Internet.With the older camera, I could view the video with Safari, but could not control pan and tilt.  Worked OK using ActiveX with IE (running in XP as a virtual machine on my Mac).  But the preset position settings did not work at all.  That's when I emailed Trendnet tech support, who recommended a firmware upgrade (to version 3.36).  That process was trickier than the original setup, but I got it done.  The user interface looks quite different from the older version (version 3.17).  But the really good news is that I can now control the camera from both Windows IE and Mac's Safari, including configuring and using preset positions.I can't view the video on my iphone, as it requires java.  However, I did find an app called Cam Viewer that works.  I don't see video in real time, but as a series of still images with a user-settable refresh rate.  Good enough to accomplish what I wanted.I was impressed with the Trendnet tech support - I got a prompt response to my email, the person was knowledgeable, and stuck with me through several questions until I got it all working.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expert setup needed", "Author": "Criminologist", "ReviewID": "R2EVA1BLNSELTO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This webcam works reliably for me and does what I bought it for, but the network setup was certainly challenging. To be fair it's the same situation with other similar internet camera products, but I would definitely not recommend that anyone new to networking take this on without expert help. The setup is complex, the manual is sketchy, and there are some bugs to overcome. Once you get past the initial installation and setup, it's easy to connect remotely and see what's going on in the vicinity of the camera (silently though, there's no microphone). I can connect successfully from my WinXP notebook (Firefox), my Nokia N800 linux tablet, or my Windows Mobile cell phone.

Everything below is still true, but there are better options outthere unless this camera is found for VERY cheap.]]I purchased this camera after having owned the TV-IP110W (an excellent camera for the price, also reviewed by me elsewhere.) I went into it expecting it to be a pan/tilt version of the same unit. I discovered after the fact, which I would have learned had I read other reviews before buying it, that despite having a higher model number, it is actually an older camera with older technology. I learned this by calling tech support to determine why the picture on this one looked like I was viewing it through a sandstorm while my TV-IP110W was clear in 1/2 the light. Sooo... on to the summary:Pros:* Easy to setup and install. No issues getting it setup.* Reliable. Some people have reported having to reboot it every few weeks, but I really have only had it crash once in over a year. Maybe I'm just lucky.* Easy to use interface, though not mobile friendly (See below.)Cons:* As mentioned, quality is fairly poor, even for a camera of this price range. Picture is usable with daylight streaming in from a glass slider on one side of the room and bay window on the other side AND numerous overhead bulbs, but I wouldn't say much more than usable. The TV-IP110W is much clearer with 1 small window and a single low powered CF bulb.* A little sluggish on the movement, but not bad* Interface is not very mobile friendly, but there are work-arounds available if you are html-handy and ambitious.See: [...]  for a detail of the protocol used to control the interface via standard put/get commands. Not as clean as the ActiveX control, but it works.Overall, its a decent camera that gets the job done, but don't expect to be overwhelmed.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you're a Mac user, stay awaw", "Author": "L.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R1U9MKL0MNAHWE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera because the product description stated that it allowed \"users to access the camera anywhere in the world by using a Web browser.\" In my work, we are doing a lot of video, audio conferencing using packages such as NetMeeting, SharedView, Communicator and son on. I, naively, assumed that a product making such a claim, would be easily set up in a way that allowed me to see what was going on in my living room while I was at work, on the road or on vacation. What follows, is my story.One clarification: I am not a geek, but I am not technologically dumb either. For example, I have some understanding of DHCP, DNS, IP, firewalls, routers and 802.11 but I'd rather not mess up with them.I did not encounter too many problems setting up the camera for local use/control. The manual on the disk is a .pdf file in English but I could not say that it was well-written. After about half an hour to one hour of installing the 2 software items and unnecessarily messing with my wireless router, the camera began sending some video to my computer. By the way, the manual seems to be incorrectly stating that you must connect through a wire to your wireless router and gives some very confusing and sometimes misleading advice on how to set up the camera's IP address. In my case, connecting the camera through a wire to my Linksys router PREVENTED the configuration utility to complete. The setup eventually completed but only AFTER I removed the wire.The pictures sent to the computer are of a poor quality - and I am a bit generous stating this. The maximum resolution is a poor 640x480. There is a noticeable delay, 1+ seconds in transmission, even when the camera is on a local loop. Control is possible but response is slow. The 'zoom' button does not do anything.One other problem seems to be the way this camera works with DHCP. Even though the camera has a unique MAC address, every time the router's DHCP assigns it a new IP address, the software thinks that it sees a new camera. What this means is that you may end up with an undetermined number of 'cameras' in the software interface running on your computer, all attempting to control the same device and you will have to guess which one is the one that actually can connect to the camera, every time you reset either your camera or your router.Now... to the \"access the camera from anywhere in the world\" part. It is VERY DIFFICULT to set it up because the vendor does not provide the software and the IP support needed and expects the end-user to go to 'third parties' for that - which is fine but is not mentioned in the 'product description', on the box or in the manuals that come with the camera. Like someone else who reviewed this device, I had to call the tech support. After some 10-15 minutes of elevator music, someone in India picked up the phone and asked for my phone number, email address, type of camera, date of birth, marital status, favorite food (just kidding). After she was satisfied with my answers she told me that someone was going to call me back later and she hung up. Someone never did. I called again and, to my surprise, the guy in India picked up the phone immediately. I wish I could say that he offered some competent advice, but he didn't. He did suggest that, to make the camera work over the Net, I had to open an account with some independent outfit that allows you to get a DNS name for your device and, therefore, at least in theory, be able to access the camera over the net. It's a cumbersome process and, in my case, it did not work very well. It involves getting and setting up a DNS name for your camera, punching holes into your firewall, regularly running some utility on your computer and updating your information on that site... too complicated and, in the end, not worth the effort.To be fair, I believe that this camera COULD be set up to be accessed and controlled over the Internet IF you could afford a dedicated, permanent IP address to it and you properly set up your router and firewall.The product gets 2 stars because someone COULD make it work. It's not a defective product. It's just very hard to make it do what it claims that it can do and the vendor's tech support or the provided documentation are not helping.I can see how a good market for this product would be those technical schools where the students learn how to set up and troubleshoot these things.I titled my review 'Incomplete' because of the several things missing in this package: a usable manual, competent technical support and support for a DNS name so that the camera can be accessed from the Web when a dedicated IP is not a practical option.", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "OK product, horrible service", "Author": "Michael Spector", "ReviewID": "R3U9YEKEGMKL24", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The product works fine and links into my home wireless network fine.
