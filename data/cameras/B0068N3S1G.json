{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Raistlin", "ReviewID": "R3DXP7YQYKGY3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great portable magnifying camera. It will take a bit of practice at first to start getting better images because the capture button is a bit of a pain to push while holding the camera still, but the images are worth it. You can get some amazing detailed photos with this camera.The only problems with it are the capture button position and workings. Other than that it is top notch. I would buy again.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great gadget that is very useful", "Author": "Charles W. Long", "ReviewID": "R2W7LI6NJXCK2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Digital Mobile Microscope/Magnifier and Camera is amazing. Having had it for a whole day now, I have only begun to explore its capabilities, but in that time I have seen that the instrument is a lot more than I had expected.My interest in doing macro photography has cost me a lot of bucks for lenses, lights and other stuff to hang on to my SLR camera so that I can get close and personal with objects I become interested in. This little mobile microscope camera adds a great extension to my ability to explore all those tiny things I want to see, and does it at a small fraction of the cost of an expensive macro lens which can't do things this camera does. Don't get me wrong, the macro lens is great for the things it can do; what I am trying to say is that this gadget, which lacks the capabilities of a macro lens, does permit you to clearly see and capture views that the you cannot see or capture with the lens on your SLR camera.The thing comes with a cable for connecting to a computer. I was pleased to learn that I could bypass this inconvenience by simply ejecting the SD card from the camera and inserting it into the slot on my computer. All the shots could be downloaded to my computer, and the photos could then be erased, providing a clean card for your next batch of shots. By the way, if you can save a few bucks by getting one with a SD card with less than 16GB, do so.This product is well worth the price, and I am confident that my 5-star rating is justified.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LCD Digital Microscope is a unique device that replaces the traditional eyepiece with a high resolution 2.7\" LCD display.
