{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mediocre Performance on Vacation", "Author": "J. Klein", "ReviewID": "R2I12UXF83MMUN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We recently took two waterproof cameras on a week long vacation that involved many hours of swimming in pools and in the ocean: the Vivitar VF526 (~$50) and the Kodak Sport C123 (~$70).  The Kodak C123 outperformed the Vivitar VF526 in almost every way and was easily worth the additional ~$20.Disclaimer: We are not photography experts and may have achieved better results if we knew how to properly adjust settings on either camera.  These results are based on factory settings for each camera  after confirming that picture quality was increased to the maximum setting (14MP for Vivitar VF526, 12MP for Kodak C123).*Vivitar VF526*Purchased: 04/2013Settings: 14MP (4320x3240), dynamic exposure (ISO 50 to ISO 400), focal 8.5 mm, O EV, f/2.8, dynamic exposure (1/4 to 1/500 seconds)Picture Count: 146Batteries Used: 2 AAA (Alkaline)Batteries Consumed: 4 AAA (replaced batteries once)Waterproof Performance: No problem at 1 meter, Salt Water and Chlorinated WaterUnderwater Photo Quality: 4/5 (very clear)Time: The date/time is LOST (reset to 01/01/2012 12:00 AM) each time the cover is opened to access batteries or memory card.Default Image Quality: 2MP (defaults to lowest image quality, be sure to change to 14MP)*Kodak Sport C123*Purchased: 08/2011Settings: 12MP (4000x3000), fixed exposure (ISO 80), focal 6.3 mm, 0 EV, f/4.5, dynamic exposure (1/8 to 1/1250 seconds)Picture Count: 628Batteries Used: 2 AA (Rechargeable Sanyo Eneloop)Batteries Consumed: 2 AA (did not have to replace or charge batteries during entire trip)Waterproof Performance: No problem at 1 meter, Salt Water and Chlorinated WaterUnderwater Photo Quality: 3/5 (slightly cloudy)Time: The date/time is MAINTAINED each time the cover is opened to access batteries or memory card.Default Image Quality: 12MP (defaults to maximum image quality)Comparison in various lighting conditions:Pictures taken in direct sunlight at noon: the Kodak C123 captures faces with light shadows while the Vivitar VF526 captures faces with VERY DARK shadows.  The Kodak C123 pictures are very good compared to the Vivitar VF526 pictures.Pictures taken 30 minutes prior to sunset: the Kodak C123 sunset pictures looked good while the Vivitar VF526 sunset pictures were fairly dark.  The sun appeared yellow or orange in the Kodak C123 pictures and green in the Vivitar VF526 pictures.Pictures taken less than 5 minutes prior to sunset: the pictures from both cameras looked good.  The sun appeared red in pictures from both cameras.Pictures taken 20 minutes after sunset: the pictures from the Kodak C123 were brighter and contained more detail than the pictures from the Vivitar VF526.Pictures taken in dark at night: neither camera was able to capture pictures in dark settings at night.  Pictures from both cameras were very dark with almost no detail.Overall, the picture quality from the Kodak C123 were much better than similar pictures from the Vivitar VF526 except for those taken underwater.  The Vivitar VF526 seemed to take slightly better/clearer underwater pictures.  Of the two cameras, I would recommend the Kodak C123 (or possibly the newer C135).  The quality of the Vivitar pictures was mediocre at best and the need to reset the date and time after opening the battery cover is ridiculous!", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vivitar F526 worked better than expected", "Author": "Melissa N", "ReviewID": "R1D1RLACYNY2R5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went on a cruise and wanted an underwater camera that was inexpensive for at least 1 days of snorkeling. I bought this camera after reading some bad reviews, and planned for the negative issues in the comments.  It had a bad review for battery usage.  It does go through them quickly.  I put fresh batteries in it before using it.  By the end if each day the battery was low.  I just brought extra batteries in case.  It had bad reviews for low light.  I didn't intend to use it for anything other than day time in the sun and the pictures were great.  I also read that it leaks.  I bought a waterproof sd card just in case.  I ended up using the camera in the water for 5 days and 2 of those days it was underwater for at least 2 hours snorkeling. It never leaked, and the pictures were great for the price.  After each use I did open it up and remove the batteries to make sure it was completely dry.  It is still working after the trip, and I plan on taking it with me on the next one.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14.1MP Image Sensor\nFixed 8.5mm f/2.8 Lens\nFront 1.8\" + Rear 2.7\" LCD Monitor\n5x Digital Zoom\nCaptures 640x480 Video with Sound", "Name": "Vivitar Dual Screen Digital Camera VF 526 Waterproof Orange", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iKCXj4NUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CICREDO"}}
