Main post office is in opposite direction from town or work and about 10-15 miles away.  I work 9 hour days and the post office has crazy hours.  Couldn't get there to pick it up.  Was told by seller that I needed to go there to get it or go there and get the name of the post office worker if they said package was not there...  I PAID to have this delivered to MY HOUSE.  It is the SELLER's responsibility to make sure it gets to MY HOUSE.  They refused to assist.  I am still waiting for this to be resolved and it has been 3 months!!!  Do not use this seller!!!", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yayyyyy!!", "Author": "Angela Jones", "ReviewID": "RP84SRD5RD1UJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I take pictures and i wanted a different stap for my camera its totally awesome and more comfortable than the one you get with your dslr camera ....love it", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Granddaughter was pleased", "Author": "Libra Sun-Libra Moon \"Libra Sun-Libra Moon\"", "ReviewID": "R35TDCR3N4FFFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this strap to go with camera I gave my granddaughter at Xmas.
