Look no further!", "Author": "Bill Sydnes", "ReviewID": "R1WU0Y5QORTBVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well you\u2019ve gotten this far, now look to your top right press add to cart and click proceed to checkout! I\u2019ve spent the better part of two months reading reviews, product reviews, and articles, about this camera, and my conclusion is this is a great buy. I\u2019ve had great luck buying refurbished products, and generally speaking you save 30-50% over new retail. However these refurbished models go through three or four times the testing than do New ones. You can\u2019t tell that this is refurbished at all. The two lenses that come in this kit are also refurbished but I\u2019ve snapped well over 1000 pics in four days, all in all of the auto modes, effects and scenes, and quite frankly I\u2019m impressed. Making the switch from point and shoot to DSLR seems very complicated but with YouTube videos and books you will never look back at making the switch. You WILL NEED A TRI-POD! Also buy a GOOD NIKON camera bag as well, PROTECT your investment! Don\u2019t buy a cheap one. The tripod makes taking macro close ups of insects, bees, and butterfly\u2019s come out like a pro even on Auto settings! You and your friends will be amazed at the clarity of your photographic compositions! In conclusion, if you have a son or daughter, or even for yourself who is taking Intro to Photography in College this is a camera they can grow into before moving two steps up from this one to a professional Nikon camera yet still retain Professional results.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD PRODUCT", "Author": "RAUL BARANANO", "ReviewID": "R21YWEJOHQ3OPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I RECEIVED ALL THE PRODUCT I BUY IN PERFECT CONDITIONS.I AM VERY HAPPY , BECAUSE I NEED FOR WORKING ON MY AUDIOVISUAL INGENIERY COURSE", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 3 PRODUCTS -- All Items Include Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D5100 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens - Factory Refurbished +\n<2> Nikon 55-200mm VR DX AF-S Lens +\n<3> Microfiber Cleaning Cloth", "Name": "Nikon D5100 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S with 55-200mm VR DX AF-S ED Zoom-Nikkor Lens (Refurbished By Nikon USA)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xE6H3d0dL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAX2P8U"}}
