{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GE A1255 good deal, but not for beginners", "Author": "hha", "ReviewID": "R3LWCLJSIBIY11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only paid $49.99 at Office Depot. For me the camera presented the challenge to bring home better  pictures with almost zero investment than my friends with Canon 5D and $1000 lenses.  Over the past month I have taken over 500 pictures with it, including some side-by-side comparison shots with my Nikon D40, a Panasonic TZ4 and a Canon S90. The picture quality is actually very good if you stay below iso200. There is no in-camera sharpening (like the TZ4), which is good if you know PhotoShop and unsharp masking: 20% with a 2 pixel radius is about right. Above iso100 the image don't get more noise than TZ4, but the colors desaturate much more and red bleeds terrible.  The D40 at iso1600 is better than the A1255 at iso200. The camera does not have OIS, the stabilization which they claim simply increases the ISO to about 800. The camera could be used by a beginner in the AUTO mode, but has a lot of flexibility, maybe way too much for a beginner.  As others have noted, the camera is not the most user friendly, and if you don't know what you are doing, you can create a mess. In the right hands or with the right guidance this camera has great potential.  \"Manual Mode\" is not manual but Program Mode with a histogram, white balance selection (including custom), a life histogram, spot focus, spot exposure metering and a display of the shutter speed and aperture which can be controlled by changing the EV compensation. The most impressive part about he A1255 is that it focuses reliably if not too fast(the red box at the center of the LCD screen turns green and beep beep sounds) much closer than the TZ4 or the S90 without having to be put into macro mode. Least impressive is the shutter delay. With Eneloop NiMH batties I get 250 shots per charge. Not bad.Update after 900 shots:I agree with one of the reviewers that the LCD appears to be harder to read in bright sunlight than my TZ4.With regards to some reviewers who are very unhappy with the performance of this camera, I stand by my earlier assessment. I can only guess that the quality control by GE is poor and they got a lemon. I tested the camera as soon as I walked out of the store, ready to return it immediately if I found a problem, I then tested it some more at home compared to my other cameras, but found no problems. If you take side-by-side shots at iso100 with my TZ4 and inspect them digitally at 100%, you will see some noise suppression artifacts in both of them, but not with normal use.hha", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific for price", "Author": "Rick Wise", "ReviewID": "R3VXHR3DHCH7YS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am most impressed with this little point-and-shoot camera. (I've only used it for stills so cannot comment on the video performance) Beginners will do well using the automatic mode. More advanced shooters will enjoy using some of the controls. It takes a while to figure them out -- something another reviewer raged about -- but worth the efforts.It does chew through ordinary AA batteries. However, I purchased a set of low-discharge SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries and those last a long, long time.In good light, the pictures have fantastically sharp details -- the skin of a grape, wood grain, etc. The LCD screen unfortunately is very hard to see in bright sunlight, but otherwise viewing is excellent.Although this unit is \"made\" by GE (no doubt made in China) and not by one of the reputable camera companies, it's an excellent buy.Four stars instead of 5 because: hard to view in sunlight and menu system difficult to figure out.Update: After playing with the video mode I have reduced the rating from 4 stars to 3. In video record this camera is inconsistent and weak. Sometimes it records properly, and often it does not and you cannot play back what you shot. You cannot tell whether your recording was usable until you download it to the computer. I cannot find any reasons as to why. As long as you use the camera strictly for still pix, I find it provides a very large bang for the buck.

I guess if this is your very first camera, you might think it's satisfactory, but since I was looking for an upgrade, this camera was a huge disappointment. To make matters worse, I jumped the gun and sold my old camera, so when I return this one, I'll be camera-less until I buy another one. I do a lot of comparison shopping before I commit to purchasing, but I wanted to be loyal to the brand because I had a good experience with my old GE camera.

I've posted a number of unedited shots taken in the first few days, with little understanding of the settings, other than I turned the wheel to find what appeared to be an auto-focus mode that flashes and another one that doesn't.Indoor with lamp light and no flash produced some yellowish tinted shots, but colors looked natural when using the flash and/or plenty of overhead light.  The closer you can get with the flash, the better, but slightly darker shots can be easily brightened up a little with editing software like Photoscape.  (See notes below on Stabilization mode as a possible alternative to using flash.)  You may notice some barrel distortion at the widest angle - a bit of zoom should cure it.  12 MP is nice, in that you can magnify the photos a lot on your computer screen and they still look clear.Outdoor photos seemed pretty decent, in afternoon shadows or noon sun, with fairly accurate focus and colors.  Of course, the sunny shots are best, especially if you go beyond optical zoom into digital.  The video is SD (640x480), not fantastic, but should work okay in a pinch.  Maybe it's about as good as my old DXG-571V SD camcorder, other than the audio seems rather weak on the GE and low-light may not be as good.  (I have a better HD camcorder now, anyway, so the GE A1255 will be mainly for pictures.)  You only have access to digital zoom while filming, and that degrades the quality if you use much of it.  Better to set the optical zoom as desired before starting the video, and don't use the digital.My first cat pictures had no red-eye, but I did get some of this later with the dog.  In looking through the manual, it appears I may not have used the same flash mode for both, or perhaps the lighting conditions were different.  The in-camera red-eye correction available during the review process didn't seem to help much.  So, I tried again with the flash + red-eye correction mode on the dog.  This gave no red, yet there was some flash glare.  Next, I tried image stabilization with no flash, and this gave a surprisingly bright photo for a low light scene, but without the eye issues caused by a flash, and without the yellowing another non-flash setting gave.  Basically, I just need to keep experimenting to get the best quality from the camera under varying situations.Using Tenergy Centura AA Low Self-Discharge (LSD) NiMH Rechargeable Batteries, 1 Card 4xAA, I got less than 100 shots on the first try, but most of those were using flash and a slow SD card.  The batteries may have also drained some while connected by USB to my computer, doing file transfers - it's likely preferable to just pull the SD card out and plug it directly into the computer's card reader.In another test on fresh batteries, with a faster Class 4 memory card, I snapped about 30 photos and then pointed the camera toward a TV and began filming.  34:23 later, the battery indicator was down by less than 1/3 and my 4GB card was full.  After briefly checking the video, I deleted it and started another, only changing the lighting a bit and running some sound tests.  (The mic did pick up my acoustic guitar from two feet away and also musicians on TV when turned up loud, but not too impressively, and there was some mild hiss or static if you listened closely.  Maybe at a concert that seems way too loud, it would come out about right, though I'll likely never try it out for that.)  I noticed the battery indicator had jumped back to near the full charge status for the 2nd clip.  35 more minutes and the card was full again, with maybe 80 percent battery life supposedly still left.  Round 3 - 34:18 and the indicator shows not much charge left.  Waited awhile before the expected final clip, and the charge started out reading 2/3 full, but dropped quickly after filming started.  12:38 later and the batteries were finally dead.  So, overall the camera got almost two hours of not so demanding video, plus a few photos, using the Tenergy AAs.  Just get a 16GB card if you plan to film a lot.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Tammi B.", "ReviewID": "R1OW1J2FD169X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic little camera!

Most of the complaints were about blurred pictures or a difficult to navigate menu; however, I would say get your heads out of the clouds (or wherever you keep them). The menu is a little difficult until you learn the layout, then it's just fine (the only problem I have with it is that all digital cameras have tiny buttons and I have chubby \"button\" thumbs, so that's a little difficult, but not the camera's problem). As for blurred pictures, like any camera if you are all shaky then the pictures are shaky; it's common sense. Try using a vintage film camera (that's what I like, but developing got too expensive), if you are moving then so are the pictures. Small cameras are harder to hold stable, so you just need to get some steadier hands (new hands are available on Amazon.com, and easily interchangeable with your current set). You have to buy some rechargeable batteries and a decent memory card, so add about $15-20 to the price, but it is still very cheap. It's got lots of great features, the only thing I would have liked to see is a higher fp.This camera is good for a handy, cheap camera to just have around; you don't have to be super protective about it because it is so inexpensive. If you are not a professional photographer you don't need a professional camera. This one is great for anyone who is not super stuck-up about their photos, who doesn't shoot thousands of useless photos that no one wants to look at but instead thinks a few great photos is worth far more, who wants to capture the essence of the scene, and who remembers that a camera is a Tool which you have to use and not a machine that does it for you.A few more things, don't plug it directly into your computer with the cable, I think that really chews through the batteries, but I'm not absolutely sure. The pictures are big, so if you don't need 12mp for printing, turn it down to 8 or 5. It feels solid and fairly well-built. Photoshop is great if you have it and know how to use it, just for some slight adjustments.However, I did just notice that the price jumped to $63, when I bought it from Amazon it was only $37.
