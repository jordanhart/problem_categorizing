On par or better than canon sd870.Easy to navigate menus.Best shots feature is useful.Con:LCD preview display could be enhanced. The preview display quality seems to be of much poorer quality compared to Canons.

A camera has to be small enough to carry in your pocket or you just won't take it with you.

Miller \"Casio HATER\"", "ReviewID": "R13KOF3UC2ZCW7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "4 months ago I purchased a new Casio EX-Z1080 from Amazon.com. Everything was great with it until around Halloween time when I started having problems. Keep in mind I babyed this camera, never dropped or bannged it once, purchased a special, padded hard case for it and it was in like NEW condition with not a scratch on it.One day I was taking a picture and then switching mode to view and the screen went black and the camera shut off, lens still out. After that the power button was non responsive. I took the battery out and put it back in and at that time, the lens retracted and it came back on.Now about 2 weeks ago the same exact problem happened, however no matter what I did, the camera would not respond. The lens was out but nothing would happen.I called Casio customer support and they gave me instructions on sending the camera in for repair under warrenty. I paid out of pocket to have the camera sent to their repair facility. 4 days later I get an e-mail saying it would cost me $140 to repair the camera.Yep, for a 4 month old camera. I called and the customer service lady told me the technician said there was evidence of the camera being misued or dropped. Which is complete baloney. I never dropped the camera once.Then she said her supervisor would call me in 24-48 hours to discuss the issue with me and its 4 days later and I never received a call.Now, I have to pay another $8 for them to send it back to me broken.I will never ever buy a Casio again and I can't wait to tell everyone I know what a crummy company Casio is.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fine Little Camera", "Author": "G. Brink", "ReviewID": "R112T5IPYUO3MD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little camera is amazing. It is the 4th small digital that I have tried out in 4 months. I was interested in a fast shutter speed for taking photos of small grandchildren who move constantly. I would rate it highly especially for a camera of this size. The images have come out very clear.... even better than I had expected. The most exciting feature of the camera is that is very easy to use but when there is a question in using it , the 800 telephone number that is available to call, has smart tech supporters that are extremely knowledgable and helpful. I would recommend this camera to all.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very crisp pictures", "Author": "J. Branham", "ReviewID": "RFMF4O5WJU5HP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera just prior to a vacation with the family.  It has performed very well.  The battery lasts for several days with out recharging, the pictures are amazingly clean and sharp, the pictures can be enlarged a great deal with no pixelation, the controls are logical and easy to use, and the camera is quite rugged (it has been dropped from 2-3 feet onto moderately hard surfaces a couple of times).I purchased this with the waterproof housing and have been very impressed.  I have been on ten dives with the camera and case and have been pleased with the pictures.  The flash is very well underwater when you are up close.  I have not had any leaks nor problems with humidity.  Definitely worth buying.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "Chris Selland \"Chris\"", "ReviewID": "R1HY5X5NBH76YW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a terrific little camera - fast, great battery life, lots of features, and outstanding picture quality.

Insanely blurry and shaky pictures come from a steady hand with the MAXIMUM anti-shake setting turned on. Even in proper lighting conditions this feature simply falls short....very, very short.10.1 MP? Yes...in studio quality lighting. In anything else, you're looking at the rainbow speckled, grainy mess that typically come from cameras with a much lower price tag.And what on earth was casio thinking making a camera that has to have the battery REMOVED and charged in a wall-outlet charger? Not only is this feature annoying and inconvenient, but the battery life of the included lithium ion battery is simply dissapointing.In conclusion, this camera is slow to respond, has inconvenient accessory requirements, plus a total lack of user friendliness. I'm no camera dummy and even I have been having my share of troubles with this one. So...while well designed, sleek, and useful at times, for the price tag, this camera is simply--not worth it.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10.1-Megapixel, up to 3648x2736 still resolution, 848x480 at 30 fps H.264 / AVC high-quality MOV movie clips with mono WAV audio\n11.4MB internal storage - We recommend purchasing a 2GB SD or SDHC Memory Card for practical usage\n3x optical zoom, 4x digital zoom lens 7.9 - 23.7 mm (38 - 114 35 mm equiv)\n2.6 Bright widescreen TFT color LCD 115K Monitor\nJPEG Exif v2.2File formats", "Name": "10.1MP Camera with 3X Optical Zoom and 2.8\" Wide-format LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IvvfnAAOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000VZN94I"}}
