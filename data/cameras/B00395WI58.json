Wanted a point and shoot that was pocket sized and took good pictures. I was going to get a Canon Powershot but then started looking at Panasonic. I feel like I got more for my money. Maybe because Panasonic is not yet a household name in cameras. A few clicks online will reveal they are \"joined at the hips\" with Leica.Using the iA mode delivered great pictures everytime. Did not take a bad picture yet, the smarts built-in really work! Focusing time is short, but you have to let the camera focus before pressing all the way. Zoom is great for such a small package, but image stabilization is a must without tripod. Also has wide angle lens which is a plus, not readily available in competing models. Have not played with any of the scene modes, I let iA handle that. And when I'll need the manual modes, I'll be reaching for the dSLR where I can play with buttons.Played briefly with the video mode and was happily surprised. It is not a camcorder replacement, but it is better than expected. Sreen is large and bright under all experienced conditions so far. It does have a mode that adjusts LCD brightness to ambient light automatically. I do miss the viewfinder but I would trade a bigger LCD for a poor viewfinder anytime. Great point and shoot camera so far, good optics, it does what it should. Will probably look for a second battery soon, but I am a little confused at moment on which one to buy.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "HOLY SMOKES!! THIS CAMERA!!!", "Author": "Mountainman", "ReviewID": "R1AKBUT3LOW22O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off. I'm not a professional photographer. I'm an average joe that loves to take pictures.Before I left on my trip to Jackson Hole Wyoming I knew I wanted a point and shoot camera. So, being a Nikon man, I looked at the Coolpix but when I started reading all of the great reviews on the FH20, I decided to give it a shot. The battery life, the 8x optical zoom, intelligent auto, 14 megapixel all make this camera remarkable. But it's the ease of use (I never opened the manual) and the fact that there is abosolutely no shutter delay.I shot with this camera 10 to 12 hours per day and still had juice left at the end of the day. To give it to you in a nutshell.This little camera that I carried around in the front pocket of my trek pants for 6 days, packs one hellava wallup!!!...Panasonic has done it!! And the FH20 is by far top of the line in point and shoot. I'm completely sold. Get this camera and I promise you will come back here and rave about it!! I just wish that I could somehow attach a couple of pics that I shot with this camera so as to show you just how stunning your pics will be.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Moderately Satisfied", "Author": "WayfarerK", "ReviewID": "R2PR1BHJML3EC6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are a lot of good things about this litte camera.1. It's little. I purchased this for a hiking trip to California, so I needed it to be easily stowable. It is.2. Ease of use. My previous camera was a Cannon, and I did not find there was any learning curve in adapting to a different menu set-up.  I love the quick menu- it is incredibly convenient.3. Ability to switch between file sizes easily. All on the quick menu.4. Very good picture quality. I've been spoiled by Cannon, but Panasonic did OK.My biggest complaint: the zoom.  I wanted to upgrade my zoom from the 4x I had on my Cannon to something with a little more...Ooomph.  I figured the 8x would be great.  Except for the fact that this camera can't seem to be able to focus between 3x and 6x.  If I'm set to one extreme or the other (either zoomed all the way back or all the way in), it's fine.  But as I zoom in the camera can't seem to find a spot to focus on.  I've tried pushing down the button slightly, getting the zoom box and trying to show the camera where I wanted it to focus on, but that doesn't work either. I've tried other cameras with high zoom and have not run into the same issue.  As the camera zooms, the focus stays true.  The FH20 starts off focused, gets blurry, and then focuses again.  Pretty disappointing performance when you're trying to shoot landscapes, and everything seems to be in that middle range.All in all this camera was an OK purchase. I like the burst shooting and the video recording, although I think it would have been better to add the video feature to the quick menu.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only just the best compact camera on the market for me", "Author": "Doris C.

My original Canon was slowly giving out.  Did research and checked out the FH1,FH3, FP8 and the FH20 along with the Canon 790. Received this camera several days ago, this FH20 rocks. Pictures are really very, very good.  I couldn't believe it.  The size is great, ease of use is beyond belief.  I'm an artist and use my camera to take pictures of lighthouses, old barns and interesting buildings.  This camera gives me what I'm looking for and more.  So glad I took the plunge.

Little only in size.  I have been a loyal Canon owner, and have several point and shoots as well as a Rebel D SLR.  I wanted a new camera for a wedding and graduations and this camera caught my eye..mainly because it was red.This zoom is amazing, the scene modes give the user many options, from beach to snow.  The low light option  was what I really wanted since I have not found any P and S camera that can handle low light situations.  This camera can!!  No lie. The pictures are crisp and clear.I love the ease of the functions, I think this camera is \"goof proof\".  Very user friendly without sacrificing the high end features.I bought an extra battery, and a faster level 4 SD card which does make a difference with start up and rapid photography.Enjoy this camera!!", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R1UJW8XHIH7K9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a pro in photography for more than a decade. Although I mainly shoot with Slr, I do own few compact cameras handy when I am not too serious about getting that perfect shoot. Of all small cameras that I own, this one is the only one that didn't disappoint me. Most other digtal cameras have few problem such as high iso noise, low image quaility, loud zooming sound, too big, start up too slow and etc.This one is perfect: Start up is fast & quite; image quailty is great (see photos I have uploaded); HD video quailty is great; control is simple; lens is best (it is sharp and does 8x optical zoom); outside looks great, fashionable, stylistic, price is cheap. In short, this fh20 is a great camera.This camera can deliver dslr like image quailty, but only if you know what you are doing. As a pro in photograph, I saw a lot of photo getting bad image using high-end dslr, so photography is a skill and art, and a camera is merely a tool. For me, this is a great tool. Although it lacks controls such as changing the aperture or shutter speed manually, you can still get great result if you know how this camera react to different situation such as lighting in a particularly enviromental. It is more than pressing the shutter release to take a picture; Photograhy is all about lighting. A camera that can take Hd video is great. Still the same point, it can record clear sharp video in a controlled eniroment. Don't expect to take great video in a sunny day where the harsh light shining everywhere.I got a 8gb class 4 sd card for $15 that works fawlessly and a great deal. I can record about 10min of HD video because max. file side per-file is 2 gb, so a 8gb card can record 40 mins of HD video. And 8gb can take 1600+ highest 14 mp photos. I use photoshop and premiere pro to edit my photo and video.== update after some use ==-Still some lagging, about 1.5 second for start up(the lens needs that time to come out), about 6 seconds for 8X zoom.-Image quality drops dramatically from ISO 200-1600; ISO100 is a acceptable, but I will stay in ISO 80 all the time if possible.-This camera is no good for light low photography.-Changing the modes is a little painful because I change modes very often. It is complicated compared to a simple switch. Simplicity is very important experience.-It is not easy to change the ISO which is something that I do very often as well.-100% correct light metering hasn't invented yet, but the light meter of this camera tends to over-exposed for about 1Ev in movie mode, so I alway use -1 Ev compensation for movie, but in picture mode, I need to adjust compensation according to the scene.-There is no auto-focus in movie mode.-Just got a third battery 1000mah battery cheaply from ebay. Battery indicator is still full after one day of use. If you buy this camera, I would highly recommend that you get this battery as well.-Finally, just a little personal thought, it is a little gay for a guy to have this red tiny camera. If all of your friends owns some big black camera with a huge lens, and you are using this comparatively small red camera, you will be looking a little small and gay when shooting pictures with them. It is totally like the scenario of having a small pistol or a big shotgun in the field.Still a 5 stars pistol.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera - from an experienced photographer", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R1URQ1DSCM5BAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used both Nikon and Canon SLRs and P&S; cameras for years, but was looking to replace my little Canon P&S; with something that stores larger files, has better zoom, good quality, ease of operation, decent batter life, and reasonable cost. I am absolutely blown away by this camera. The image stabilization is phenomenal, the macro works beautifully, the color renditions are superb, and I was delighted to learn that I could actually INCREASE the optical zoom capability by reducing the picture file size. What a wonderful idea.I took movies and photos of a Penn State womens' volleyball game from nearly the top of the stand at PSU's Rec Hall (perhaps 100 feet from the action) and they (team and photos) are outstanding. The movies are clear and stable, while the photos with the sports preset (no flash, of course) are amazing, considering the distance and level of zoom I was using. The automatic ISO setting work great - unlike Nikon and Canon. We tried the sunset photos last night and they are sharp as a tack with great color and very little grain. Portraits are as good as my SLR, and the exposures are spot on. The controls are amazingly user friendly for a camera with so many options. This is one well thought-out piece of equipment.The test, in my opinion, is how the photographs print. So far I have printed ten 8x10s - half of them are scenes, one quarter are portraits, and one quarter are still life (some done with zoom macro). They are outstanding. I would have no hesitation framing them and submitting for judging in an art show.A downside I see to this camera is that it doesn't look like a serious camera. Make it bigger, heavier, and more expensive and it will still sell like hotcakes. The other downside is that the photo handling software included with the camera is practically useless. The only thing I can find that's useful is the fairly complete properties information, though some is missing. Jeez, Panasonic, you would think you could do good software with such a great camera.The FH20 is the first Panasonic camera I have ever owned, but I like it so much I bought an ZS-5.

I saw this camera (FH20) on digitalcamera-hq.com where they rated it as the best consumer camera for the year. I figured I might as well look into it a little. I was impressed with the specs, features, and ultimately the price! I bought mine as a used model but in mint condition so it only cost me $131 but it's brand new!As for the actual camera, I LOVE IT! It takes pretty good pictures for a camera in this price range and size. It's shutter lag time is virtually nothing. It takes under a second to focus, and when you press down the shutter button the rest of the way, it takes the photo instantly.It also has a burst mode that takes low quality shots very fast, over one a second, for as long as you want! It's iA or intelligant auto mode seems to somewhat work. It doesn't always pick the right scene so I prefer to just select my scene manually. That way I can be very picky because there are many scenes to choose from. It also has a nice my scene feature where when you press the iA button twice, it goes to your selected mode. The only problem with this is that there is no video mode or picture mode button, so I usually have to use the my scene mode for video or just for normal picture mode. That's kind of annoying!Another nice feature is it's 8x zoom. It zooms in really far and has very good stabalization, so the 8x zoom pictures actually come out clear!The video quality may say HD, but its more like standard definition in a widescreen format, but that's not a surprise since its a point and shoot camera. So far the regular picture quality is very good for the price range. It's outdoor shots and still shots are excellant. Pictures get a tad blury if people are moving or if its getting dark, but that's expected with a point and shoot.Overall, it's a great camera for anyone looking for a inexpensive point and shoot to carry around.

I increased the brightness to just over 1, set the photos at 5MP, installed a 2GB high speed SD card, and then set the iA button for Night Portrait. I am a real estate appraiser. My mission is to get through a house as thoroughly and efficiently as possible as well as to snap photos at 30+ mph of homes set back 100' off the road way without holding up traffic and be able to take photos of paint peeling at five stories up... This does it all and does it well.By having the \"alternate photo\" button on the top of the camera, you can quickly go from point and shoot mode to one style that you set up. In my case, I found the point and shoot great for everything, including 50mph drivebys, but the quick switch over to the alternate photo as Night Portrait and I am taking crystal clear photos of basements, bathrooms, hallways, and, especially, attics WITH NO LIGHTS ON and NO BLUR! The quick click photo review lever allows for a quick look back if the review time on the photo runs out too quickly. I got 400 photos on it after charging the first time and there was room to spare before heading out again. The battery added about 100 photos worth of charge in 20 minutes. The batteries are expensive so I opted for a second camera and I alternate the battery out of the charger with one camera, while I keep the spare camera in the car without a battery (after smashing my camera from slipping on a moss-covered rock). The battery door seemed unfamiliar at first, but the logic behind being able to quickly access the SD card without disrupting the battery is great. My last camera powered off when you accessed the SD card, which was sometimes a pain. The build quality is better IMHO than both four-letter major camera brands that start with S and F. This thing is hot at 14MP and the ability to read SDXC cards in the future.UPDATE 02/13/13: 2-300 photos x 5 days a week for two plus years. Same battery. Same battery life. Same quality.

We were taking photos and after our third photo it just turned itself off and never would turn back on. Camera repair place wanted to charge is 250.00 to fix it!! HA! We then bought an Olympus Stylus 7030. It was the WORST camera I have ever owned.(i reviewed it too if you go to my profile and look for the review) After a month we sent it back. Then we bought this camera. We love this camera!!!The pro's:* the size is small but not too small. Fits in my hand just right. Also this camera is in no way bulky.* the shutter speed is GREAT! I am loving not having to wait forever to take multiple shots in a row like Cannon and Olympus cameras.* I chose this model verses the newest one because I didn't need all the many extra modes and I am not a professional or nothing. Just want to take photos of my kids.* The battery lasts us about a week or two with taking many photos a day of the kids. I have taken about 200 photos and have only charged the battery once.* I love the option of multi delete... very convenient when it takes 10 photos in a row to get one good photo of my kids with eyes open and not making a goofy face :)* The shutter speed is GREAT. I is about half the time it took on our Cannon and Olympus models.* Favorite color is red... nuff said on that :)* The weight is perfect. Not to heavy, and not to light.* Flash works great even at long distant shots* I like the placement of the flash, buttons, zoom and all. All easy to navigate.* Very user friendly... still have yet to look at the owners manual* The auto mode is pretty good* I love all the modes... I have played around with alot of them and they are all great at their designed functions. I never had fireworks come out so well in a photograph.The Cons:* The flash is good but there is some room for improvement. Some photos come out a little dark if the object is more than 4 feet away in a very dark room.* Once you are recording a video you cannot zoom in or out. So if you start close to your childs face or something better hope they stay put because you will not be able to zoom out!* The microphone is right next to your face so you sound like a train coming verses the person you are trying to capture.* Panasonic customer service - my camera was sent defective. I contacted Panasonic and they verified through trouble shooting that it was not working properly. So they said I had to send it back and they would repair it. I explained that I had a newborn and Christmas was in three weeks and I did not want to be without a camera more than a few days. They said it could take many weeks!!! When I told them I was not willing to be without a camera for that long especially being Christmas was right around the corner and I didn't want to buy another camera just to get my kids Christmas photos and pictures of our babies precious newborn period they told me that they could not help me out. I even spoke to a manager! He actually laughed when I told him I would not buy another Panasonic product! I then called Amazon... they mailed me a brand new camera and package to send the broken one back. THANK YOU AMAZON, SHAME ON YOU PANASONIC CUSTOMER CARE! If the camera was not so awesome I would sent it back and keep searching for a good camera.. but I really really like this camera!UPDATE 6/2011After owning this camera for many many months now I have more cons that pros.The Cons:1. the biggest con is the customer service... after sitting on hold for 30 minutes they quickly tell you that they will not or cannot help you. They are also very rude and short.2. The year warranty is only for interior components, so if you drop your camera or crack the lense, or break the batter/SD card cover off (which I did)then it is not covered!3. The battery/SD card cover is nothing but a thin slice of plastic that with very little pressure will break right off. Due to the way it was built there is not way in H*** you can fix this. You will not have the tool or parts to even attempt.4. Auto mode is great until you see the pictures blow up to a 4x6 or bigger. They are all fuzzy. I have used auto/intelligent mode a million times over the last 9 months and it never got it right. It would be night and in our dark bedroom without any lights but the TV on and it would not use the flash, or it would use the flash during the day in direct sunlight, or if anyone even slightly moved it would blur them right out.5. There is no function on your photo viewing on the camera to edit the photos in any way like my old cannon, such as removing red eye and such. This wasn't a huge deal until I bought my little portable printer for photos... I no longer need upload the photos on my computer so I am no longer fixing red eyes there.6. The battery life only gets shorter as the months go by.7. lastly... I REALLY REALLY HATE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE!UPDATE UPDATE 9/23/11The camera just stopped focusing today! What gives? It just turns on and then tries and tries to focus then tells me to turn it off. Instead of even trying to call customer service I did one better... I took the camera that I have owned less than a year and threw it in the trash!

She has some nice macro shots of water drops on flowers, pictures of her dog in black and white mode, small video recording and of course pics of Mom and Dad. They are all pretty good shots- I tip my hat as I have a 10 mp dslr and it is often hard to get easily the quality pics that she got with minimal knowledge and experience with this camera.

And when you click, that is the picture you get. With all my other cameras I would take a hundred pictures and maybe get 2 or 3 good ones out of it.

For the money this is an excellent camera - it has a super zoom which allows you to photograph things from far away, which will be great for my stepsister taking photos of her horses in the pasture, and it is absolutely tiny, which is great for my brother as he likes to stuff everything (ipod, books, you name it) into the pockets of his cargo pants. It takes wonderful photos and makes it really easy to grab a quick home movie on the fly. The controls are nicely balanced, if you just want to get a snapshot without thinking about it too hard it is easy to use in idiot mode, and if you want to have more input into what your picture looks like there are plenty of serious-photographer options for you to choose from, although there is no manual focus. And it comes in variety of fun colours - I chose a red one for my stepsister and a black one for my brother.Unlike my older Lumix - a DMC TZ3 - this one does not come with a Leica lens, it has an 8x optical zoom rather than a 10x optical zoom, and it is manufactured in China rather than Japan. But then again it costs less than half the price I paid for my old DMC TZ3, and it is about half the size. If you want a Leica-lensed more serious Lumix you can still buy one, they make new models with the Leica lens, loads more options and a price to match - this one, the DMC ZS7 looks pretty awesome Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black).

Picture quality was identical I felt.  In the long run, decided to keep this Lumix - preferred the 8x zoom (Sony only was 4x), and the shooting speed was much much faster. Would also though highly recommend the DSC-W350 though - both are equally great cameras at a similar price... and that has a nice panoramic feature and is even smaller and lighter.

Another thing I hated about other makes was the fact that they all used the AA batteries. This was a big part of the decision making because those AA batteries only lasted for about 10-20 minutes when put into the camera so was constantly changing them.  So I started researching and reading hundred of reviews. After all was said and done, I went for the Panasonic Lumix FH-20. I got it out of the box and was pleasantly surprised at how compact and small it was and how very definitely these are VERY user friendly. I am so happy I don't have to carry a case of AA batteries with me anymore. The battery in this camera is awesome and lasts forever (well, you do have to charge it).

I am a sculptor of miniature fairies and needed a high-res camera for extreme macro shots. But I only had $180 in my budget. I paid quite a bit less than that for this Lumix. With a little learning curve, I am able to change exposure times, white settings, lighting, focus, etc. I'm getting professional-looking photos and, in my opinion, they are every bit as good as the ones the experts online are using with $3,000 cameras. Not kidding.I am also a landscape pastel painter and am getting incredible nature shots. The colors are true and closeups and wide angle shots are high resolution with little effort. I've also taken family portraits and used the \"burst\" mode for multiple shots of my pets with great results.It's small and the parts seem well-made. I dropped it on the hardwood floor when my dog went flying by and it still works like a charm. The battery lasts ALMOST as long as my old Kodak EasyShare DX7630 (which has a GREAT battery life and is a GREAT camera and you can buy it cheaply now. It just didn't have quite the res at macro levels I needed).I have not played with the video mode too much, but did get a clearer picture than I expected.There are three things that may deter a potential buyer or the Lumix DMC-FH20: 1. There IS a bit of a learning curve. You have to be willing to play with it for a few hours. 2. The manual is practically useless. Also, there is very little instruction available online. I plan on posting a few instructions based on my experience soon. 3. Without changing the white settings each time, or adjusting the \"modes\" the photos tend to be a tad too yellow/orange. This is easily solved by adjusting the camera; you just have to figure it out first.

Eventually I just decided to buy it, and I am extremely happy about my decision. It works great! The pictures it takes are beautiful, and such high quality. Both my brother and sister, who use SLRs, are impressed with the picture quality. Landscapes shots are beautiful! And you can also capture things moving quickly. I was at Glacier National Park and a herd of Big Horned Sheep ran across the path, and I was able to capture them! I have an extremely shaky hand, and this takes the clearest pictures. And close ups with Macro zoom are incredible. I had fun taking pictures of flowers, praying mantis, and my vegetable garden. And the flash doesn't wash out everything when pictures are taken inside.Movies are good also. You cannot zoom in once you are in movie mood, but who wants digital zoom anyway?! Just be aware of software problems, because I have not been able to upload my movies yet.My one complaint is that it is not compatible with a MAC.

I mainly bought it for my wife who needs something totally uncomplicated, point and shoot.  When I received it, I played with it and it took fantastic pictures and was extremely happy.  I gave it to my wife for Christmas and she could actually work it well do to the IA feature that sets everything.  Really fantastic.  Problem with it is that in certain indoor pictures with the flash, the pictures have a really yellow tinge.  I've tried all kinds of things to fix it.  I change settings, the Auto White Balance, using the IA, NOT using the IA.  Thing is, sometimes it will take a good picture with great tones, I immediately take another picture with the EXACT same settings and the picture comes out yellow.  The best luck I've had is just not to use the flash.  It takes great low light pictures but then you have to change settings to turn the auto flash off and my wife won't/can't do it.  She'll take a flash picture with our old Cannon 35mm camera and the tones are way better.  So pretty much, it seems I bought myself this camera.  I called their customer service.  At least I did get a real person... half way around the world who could barely understand English let alone speak it.  He then started to READ the manual to me.  That was helpful.In defense of the camera, the particular room that we are trying to shoot the pictures in has fluorescent lamps at a 35 kelvin color range which is the \"warm\" look AND the ceiling is aged pine and the floors are a tan color.  I haven't noticed this yellowed picture problem in my office where I took indoor pictures with the flash.  I have halogen bulbs in some of the fixtures and 41K fluorescent lamps.I'm disappointed that my wife doesn't like my gift I gave her but I would still recommend this camera to most anyone and would buy another one.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "Gretchen Montgomery \"avid reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2IQMWNCB0EYE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera rather quickly after my Kodak Easyshare V1253 died.

My first impulse was a Canon, but the reviews indicated that the \"improved\" models had problems not there in previous models.  I read reviews for Nikon's model, but all the reviews I read indicated that the Lumix DMC-FH20 by Panasonic had the others beat in every way, and cost less to boot.  Amazon had the best price by far, so I ordered the camera, a case, and two backup batteries and charger from Wasabi.  The camera is great.  I'm not the family picture taker, but I know all shots are easy to take for my wife, the picture quality is incredible, and it shots so much faster than the Kodak digital we bought 5 years ago that I've never regreted my purchase.UNTIL YESTERDAY.  While camping recently my wife read an onscreen message that the battery power was gone.  I put in the Wasabi backup battery, a simple task, and she was good to go.  We recharged the spent Panasonic battery when we got home, and I put the Wasabi in the charger and the Panasonic back into the camera.  A message came across the screen: \"No Battery Power Remains.\"  Put it back into the charger, but the light was instantly green, indicating a fully charged battery.  Reinserted the battery and got the same message, and the battery icon showed no life in the battery.  Put the Wasabi back in, and the camera works great once more.  Clearly the battery is not really recharged or it is sending an incorrect message to the camera.  In either case the battery is not functioning after just one use--admittedly a very long use from Xmas 2010 until June of 2011 on a single charge.  Called Amazon, but kind of suspected I needed to be calling Panasonic support.  Amazon, in its usual polite and helpful manner, gave me a number and confirmed that the time since purchase took it out of their hands.  My call to Panasonic support was cold and fairly brief.  Support explained that the battery had a 90 day warranty only, and the fact that it was malfunctioning after just one charge didn't enter into the picture.  There were absolutely no contingencies, though I vowed to the support tech that despite numerous Panasonic products in my home and in my history (I'm 63), I would never buy another Panasonic product again if going over his head with a letter got me no further than my conversation with him.I wrote an explanatory letter to Joseph Taylor who, to the best of my google searching ability is the chairman and CEO of Panasonic, and found there seems to be no way to find an address for Mr. Taylor's office.  I sent it to Panasonic's North American headquarters in Seacaucus, NJ and hoped for the best.  I was amazed to read a string of horridly critical letters on a Panasonic website about their lack of satisfactory customer support, and many vows to never buy again worded much more crudely than mine!  If Mr. Taylor or someone above the status of the support tech, agrees that a Panasonic rechargeable battery ought to last more than a single charge and agrees to replace it at their cost instead of mine, I will be happy to amend this review.  Until that happens, I am very disappointed in the manner in which Panasonic backs up their expensive and highly advertised products--and I will make good on my vow until the day I die!ADDITION:  Got two phone calls from Panasonic apologizing for the overzealous techie who told me I would have to buy a new battery myself.  My letter to Mr. Taylor got a response in less than a weak and the aforementioned caller promised to send me a new battery in 5 to 7 days.  My faith in Panasonic's good name has been restored!

The battery life is great. It is light. The zoom is excellent.  It does OK in low light.  My only real beef is the battery.  You have a separate battery charger to charge this thing on, and the replacement batteries aren't cheap. So if you take a lot of pictures and you burn through your batteries you  can't charge it on the fly, and you can't stop in a buy batteries at a convenience store.  Also the charger is one extra piece you can loose.  There are some pretty nice Nickel Metal AA and AAA batteries out there that would have worked great for this application.

I am a young man, not super serious about photography, but I don't want to make garbage either. This camera gives you the flexibility to take professional looking photographs when you want to, and packs the capabilities in a small and mobile package. When I ordered my camera, it did not come with a case, however, I advise ordering one. They're cheap and will protect your investment. Perhaps the only slight inconvenience with this camera is that you cannot zoom the lens while recording video; you must first zoom in and then start recording video. If you start recording, then decide to zoom, you must stop recording, then zoom, then go back to recording. The designers may have made this decision to avoid the camera recording a loud \"ZZZZZZ\" noise as the electric motor moves the lens. This does not affect me and my photography style. I have made a couple videos with this camera, and the near HD quality is quite satisfactory to me. With an 8gb flash card, I have more space than I know to do with. I recommended this camera to my brother, and got him a 16gb card. I have no idea what he's going to do with all the space.

Personally, i like Sony cameras but even they didn't provide this feature ! I am emphasizing on this feature because to me, the zoom capacity is one of the utmost important feature in a digital camera. The body color (red) is enchanting and unique.

But I will tell you my opinion from the perspective of a 20-year-old college student.What I like about this camera:-Most bang for the buck you'll find. The 8x optical zoom feature was really important for me.-Vivid red color. Outside does not scratch easily (I have yet to find a scratch/imperfection, and I leave it in my purse on long day trips all the time.) Nice shape. Perfect size (smaller is not always better) for my hands-Large LCD screen, easy to use buttons.-Very, very nice HD video quality. The sound quality is surprisingly good too. I have used it to record live a capella singing. Amazing! Get a large memory card and you'll be using this camera as a camcorder.-Battery charges very quickly and lasts through 300+ pictures on average.-Really clear colorful crisp pictures in the sun. Better than my old Canon camera most of the time.-Lots of settings. Can take very impressive pictures of night scenery. Unexpected and impressive!What I don't like:-Some pictures taken inside may appear a tiny bit grainy at times in certain settings. This may be due to the fact that I'm still not completely familiar with all the settings yet... there are just so many!I can't even think of anything else! I would say image quality can be better, but that is unrealistic for a point-and-shoot. If you want something with the BEST image quality, get a SLR instead.

And there are things I like about it, but when it comes to the bottom line, which for me is 4x6 photo quality, it left me angry and frustrated. I had a chance to take indoor shots in my home and have them developed before I went to see my family in St. Louis for the holidays. Those first shots were very nice, although I had to use the \"enhance\" color adjustment on the machine at Walgreen's on ALL of them to get prints that had enough contrast. In my parents' home I encountered weird coloration on the LCD screen in many scenes where I was taking two photos of the same scene in a row. Not rapid fire. One pic would look like the correct color on the LCD screen and the next would be markedly orange-ish. In one group shot of four adults, the first shot was fine, but the second (with enough time in between shots for us to change places) had a gray blob in the middle of my sister's dark green shirt.

We haven'g bought a new camera for at least 5 years or more. My wife is very particular and I was somewhat reluctant to buy her anything she did not see in person. I could not pass up the deal Amazon was giving. Free Overnight shipping and a price I could not resist.I read about 25 of the reviews and decided to take the chance. I ordered it. I've been shopping with Amazon for a long time and I knew that an exchange, credit or refund was simple.Well, the camera was on my door step that afternoon. She was in the kitchen when I came in with the package. I gave it to her with a \"Merry Christmas.\" When she opened it and saw that is was a camera and a Red one, I knew I had done the right thing.This screen was bigger than her Old one and when I showed her the features it had, she just loved it.We needed to charge the battery and get to the family's house for Christmas eve. We just needed to be able to take pictures and then check on all the features the camera had. We set it on the IA mode and off we went. Well, the pictures were superb. She is pleased so far and so am I.

It is not a prosumer camera.  It has almost no manual features, and the ones it has are very crippled by software (such as limiting exposure speeds to 1/4 in normal mode).  The menu layout is rather confusing as well, with a hoard of \"scenes\" that are all but useless.I got this camera as a gift to supplement my dSLR.  I wanted something that was well rounded and would be easy to just grab and shoot.  This works great if you leave it all on auto.  However, I've gotten where I prefer shooting without a flash.  This camera is more than capable of doing so.  ISO800 has quite low levels of noise, coupled with the optical stabilizer and some steady hands, you could get some pretty decent shots.  However, the only way to get such shots is to hope some scene mode has a shutter speed within the range you need.  VERY annoying.Oh, another little tidbit about this camera...  There's no aperture setting.  I guess I'm just too used to higher end cameras.  Basically it's whatever the lens is zoomed to.  There is no diaphragm in the camera.

Keen \"elligirl\"", "ReviewID": "RIZJ2YDKOO7MS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really excited about this camera because of the reviews I read about it from the professionals; however, it was nothing but a pain to use.  I bought it to have a point and shoot with video that would work in the dark at Disney World. Yeah, it must be that I'm not a professional photographer and could not set the settings right because I could not reproduce almost all of the cool abilities that the reviews covered which made this camera sound awesome. My low light pictures are not that great, unless I used the flash. I had it set to Auto and AI almost the entire time. It worked better if I set the settings manually, which you can imagine is not that easy at Disney World. I tried the Fireworks setting and it just made squiggly lines. On auto before going we took a picture of a friend who was sitting on a table he kicked his foot out at the exact moment we snapped the picture and it made him look like an amputee. The entire time since the first day trying to take a picture has been a nightmare. If I push the button, sometimes it takes a picture and sometimes it doesn't and I have to keep trying. It's like there's a sensor and you have to push just right to get it to focus and take a picture or else you have to keep trying over and over for it to take the picture. My husband and child have the exact same problem. The pictures in perfect lighting, without movement, in which we pushed the button just right turned out great!  But I think I would love to just return the camera and get a refund or trade-in for a cannon or something else. I don't know if that's even possible. It's just disappointing.  However, the battery life was awesome! It lasted all day and then we switched out late at night with the backup battery I purchased.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": "Z X Turbo \"Z X Turbo\"", "ReviewID": "R17KGCYGAYG2A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cannot comment until after the Christmas holiday as the camera is purchased for a gift.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Useless", "Author": "Janice Boone", "ReviewID": "R2IEMZQNZNDHWO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I could not load this camera to my PC.
