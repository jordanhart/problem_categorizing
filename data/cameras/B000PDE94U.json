Awesome camera!  Mine was stolen recently so I'm buying another one of the same kind because this is such a good camera!  Compact size is great for travel and still takes fantastic pictures!  Even has a micro lens feature that can take pictures of the smallest bugs.  I use the MP3 player feature on long plane flights.  Battery lasts a really long time.  The only problem I experienced with the camera was when the lens cover wouldn't close.  I could of sent it in, but I realized that it was some little particle blocking the cover.  So I blew into the lens and voila!  It closed.  Also, like all Samsung products, the interface is very user friendly.  Highly recommended!", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "To me, completelly dissapointing", "Author": "G. F.

I really think one of her acquaintances stole it.  I then bought the NV4, which is essentially the same camera with a little higher resolution.  This is a lot like an iPod that takes pics and videos.  A way cool camera that I think Samsung has discontinued...", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000PDE94U"}}
