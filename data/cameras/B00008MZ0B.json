{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely Fantastic Camera!", "Author": "\"intyboy\"", "ReviewID": "R3CO0KFBARLAPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This P-52 Cybershot camera is an incredible value, and I couldn't be happier with it. I've compared this camera with 2003 Canon, Fuji, HP photosmart and Kodak models, and the Sony wins hands down. Except in the case of the Canon, the Sony P-52 is far superior. There are almost too many pros to even list. =====PROS=====-The most advanced \"Super H.A.D. CCD\" exclusive to Sony.-CCD is  2x as sensitive as any other company's CCD, & 6 dB less digital noise!-beautiful, accurate colour-extremely versatile lens takes perfect pics from 3 inches away-very fast autofocus (1/2 a second)-autofocus illuminator light for taking pics in the dark-extremely fast start-up. Around 1.5 seconds!-very fast LCD: almost no lapse time from real life to LCD.-LCD has 6 settings for good viewing indoors or out.-Aperture stays open up to 2 full seconds in dark. Anything longer can damage the CCD, or let in too many unwanted artifacts-full array of manual functions (aperture [ev], focus & ISO)-snow mode keeps the detail of the white snow-beach mode captures the perfect blue of the water-up to 1 GIG of memory - supports memory stick Pro!-5 pic size settings - VGA, 1.2 mp, 2.0 mp 2.8 mp & 3.1 mp-2.8 mp is \"3:2 ratio\" for perfect 4 x 6 photos-cool multi-burst mode. Takes 2 pictures in a row, under 1 second. 16-shot option as well.-smart flash. Even when taking picture in daylight, will sense if it is needed, and come on appropriately.-Smart Zoom. Not a digital zoom. Picture quality does not degrade like standard digital zooms.-very long battery life. 2 Ni-mh \"Stamina\" AA batteries last 67% longer than 2002 batteries.-metal threads for tripod. Most other companies use plastic. Bad idea!-menus are beautiful: incredibly easy to understand and navigate.-prints at \"photo quality\" up to 8x10. After that, starts to lose some quality, but 11x14 still looks excellent.-USB 2.0-fun modes like Sepia, B&W;, Solarize and Negative Art.-voice function: records audio for 5 seconds after taking a picture. (40 sec. option available too)-instant \"review\" button of last pic taken, when the LCD screen is off.=====Mpeg Movie=====-film mpegs with sound, limited only by the size of the memory. Example - 128 mb memory stick = 6 minutes of 640x480 or 1.5 hours of \"email\" quality (160x112)-filmed at 16 frames per second, although after filming, camera info states that it was filmed at 25 fps.=====CONS=====-flash is off too far to the side of the lens. It makes big shadows on the left side of your subject.-Snow mode seems to overexpose the shot a little.-Optical viewfinder only shows roughly 80% of actual picture area. Use the LCD.-only 2x optical zoom. The standard seems to be 3x. Sony needs to catch up here.-zoom only works before you start filming. Can't change the zoom during filming.-flash will charge slowly if batteries are running low.=====CONCLUSION=====An absolutely perfect and versatile camera. Only a professional photographer would, or could, find fault with it. But a professional would likely be using an SLR style camera worth at least double what this camera is worth.That being said, the price is great and Sony has really found a winner here.This is a very fast camera in all respects, and that is important. Takes fast (and accurate) pictures, and saves info almost instantly. There are  no load times for pictures or movie files, like the Hewlett Packard camera line.5 stars all the way.", "Date": "January 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "This is a GEM!", "Author": "Beach Queen \"Dawn\"", "ReviewID": "R23BGNPT2G72IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great gem for the price and offers great versatility. The camera is very good quality (sturdy) and can take a few bumps and scratches, unlike many other flimsy cameras in this price range. I have owned digital cameras before and many of the typical problems are solved with the P52. I take a lot of pictures at family events, and vacations. Its a great take along camera.PROS -- The camera turns on super fast, like in 2-3 seconds it is ready to take a shot. (this is an annoying problem with many digital cameras) And it also saves the pictures to the memory card is very fast, less than 1 second and its ready again to shoot.- The battery useage is excellent. Even with regular alkaline batteries I've been able to take pictures for several hours, at 2Mpix Normal setting. With the included rechargeable Sony batteries it is superb on battery life.- Camera menu is very extensive IF you want to use it. If not you can leave it on \"Auto\" and the pictures turn out great, most of the time.- Can take pictures in COMPLETE DARKNESS. This I have done many times using the flash on red-eye reduction setting, it works in a regular size room (10 x 14). Great for sneaking up on sleeping family members and taking funny pictures. The flash is very powerful up to about 9-10 feet.CONS- The pictures tend to have redish atifacts in them, particularly when taking very close up shots of people.- Pictures taken out doors can sometimes look too bright, almost washed out. You can make some adjustments to the ISO to fix this problem.- Movie mode eats up the memory stick quickly, so I had to upgrade to a 256MB Memory Stick Pro ($65 at [...]) and now its great.- Marco mode ...forget it, not good on this camera. So if you plan on taking close up shots of flowers or something, choose another camera.Overall this a gem of a camera for any regular picture taking, and can even be used by kids without having to fiddle with a lot of controls. Just press the power button and you are ready to take pictures. It really takes the hassle out of digital photography.", "Date": "May 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Last yr's lens, this yr's electronics.", "Author": "superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"", "ReviewID": "RPWYS9L67ORJV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As you would expect from a Sony camera, it has good picture quality in daylight.

World charger and NiMH batteries are included.Check out the specs of this model carefully, its different from P72/P32. This one is 2in thick, has old & slow 2x zoom lens and is bulky.

I took the pics for my friend's daughter's birthday party and almost all were blurry. The flash does not work properly anymore either. Mostly I just need more than 3mp to take decent pics.CONS:* The flash is too far from the lens and casts a large shadow behind the object* the ends of the camera are curved - good luck taking vertical timer pics, it tips over!*it is clunky and oddly-shapedPROS:* It does take a good movie, in two sizes (10 seconds in high setting is the max for my email capabilities)* The memory stick plugs into my Sony TV so I can view, edit, and play movies on my TV.

We bought the camera because of the wide range of features, the competitive price, and the Sony name (to which I'm admittedly partial).  A big selling point was the fact that with the expanded memory stick (a separate purchase) you can shoot up to 90 minutes of video - nothing else on the market in this price range even compares to that!

Smart zoom corrects that without losing resolution and/or you can clean it up on the PC if need be any way.  The movie feature is fun to play with, and the overall features are very user-friendly and intuitive.  You'd have to be a moron not to love this camera.

However, read my other reviews, and you'll see that I am no stranger to bad luck. I suspect there are always a couple of lemons out ther, or perhaps these people are extremely careless with it, or possibly use it in locations which are sandy. A few grains of sand will destroy a camera.I also do not understand why people do not use their Warranty. This camera comes with a ONE YEAR warranty, so there are no excuses for saying \"Sony sucks, my camera broke after 6 months and they won't fix it!\" All Sony products come with a minimum 1 year warranty in Canada. Can someone please let me know if the warranties are less in the U.S.?I have dropped my Sony on numerous occasions. I might even go so far as to say I've \"abused\" it, and have three (3) half-inch dents in the metal piece surrounding the lens to prove that.

Myself, I am no kind of expert in either cameras or photography, and not even much of an enthusiast. I got this camera in a fit of exasperation at a series of mishaps with my 35mm effort, and I can only say that as an unadventurous amateur I have been absolutely delighted with it and I don't grudge one penny of what I paid for it.I chose it at random, and the only comparisons I'm able to make with other digital cameras are with those I've seen my friends use. This one is certainly on the big side - it doesn't fit comfortably into a coat pocket, for instance, but it can still be carried there. When taking photos there has occasionally been more restriction than I might have liked as regards width, but that could well be because I have not troubled to find out all the options it gives me. In fact I have left everything at the default settings, as I have seen no reason to change these. Now and again the occasional photo comes out a little darker than I wanted, but that is easily edited with good p/c software - I use PSP8.  Otherwise I have to record complete customer satisfaction. Battery life is excellent (I prefer to use disposables), and the camera switches itself off after a short idle period. The memory stick no longer has to be a proprietary Sony one, as it seems that this technology has been standardised. Above all, the photographs have pleased not just me but everyone else with an interest in them, and that I can assure you is not because I am any great photographer. Others who have used the camera include complete strangers and very un-technical friends. Their photos have turned out as well as my own have, and no elaborate instructions have been needed for anyone. No special software is required if you have a Sony p/c, and the delayed-action when used with the Sony tripod works a dream too.Obviously more ambitious users than I am will set more exacting standards. For a humble amateur like myself who wants only simplicity, reliability and good-quality output this little machine leaves little or nothing to be desired.

Second is the memory. Unfortunately hereit's impossible to buy memory (128 Mb = $255), soi had to stick with the 16 MB. It doesn't hurt, and it'snot really a downside, because of the fact that anyone couldspend a few more $$$ on some extra memory, that isn'tvery expencive.What i enjoy of using this camera is the rechargeables.

I'd previously used a Minolta Dynax SLR, but this Sony was my first digital camera and I've never looked back since.I've divided this review into segments:EASE OF USE:Using the camera is child's play.  I only read the manual briefly, but I quickly became accustomed to the controls.  The large LCD display makes taking decent photos a piece of cake.  It's very easy to navigate your way through the functions.ERGONOMICS:The camera fits nicely in the hand and feels quite sturdy.  It may seem a little brick-like by today's standards, but it means that camera shake is kept to a minimum.QUALITY OF PHOTOS:The quality of the photos is superb.  I've taken hundreds of photos - holidays, weddings, portraits of family and friends.  There are limitations, however. The shutter speed isn't particularly fast, so don't expect spectacular results if your subject moves quickly.  I intend to invest in a digital SLR in the future to address this problem.PIXELS:Even though this camera is capable of taking 3.2M photos, I rarely using this setting.  For one, it uses an enormous amount of memory stick space.  For enlargements up to A4, 2M pixels is more than adequateVALUE:Overall, the camera is good value for money.  I would invest in either a 64mb or, better still, a 128mb memory stick as the 16mb specimen provided is fairly useless.WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?I most certainly would, but it depends what you intend to use if for.

About the only thing I do like about it is that you can take stills and video.  At least when it was new it did take great photographs, however you had to wait forever to be able to actually snap the picture as it's auto-focusing is very slow.  Now it won't even take good pics.

So to buy a new no brand camera for around 40 dollars I may as well opted to purchase this sony used camera for around the nsame price. The camera came with all original accesories is looks a litle used but works fine. Sincerely I amnot too entusiastic with the Sony brand I rather go with a Cannon (which is what I own) but for the price and the usage that is going to be used for is a good deal besides the \u00a8carls zeiss\u00a8lenses are something worth as that is one of the best advantages that Sony has put into this camera. Function wise it has all the normal function any entry level camera has and it works very fine, the lcd screen is a bit too small for my liking but apart from that i definitely would recomended for a kid as a first camera.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony DSCP52", "Author": "J.

Camera design is not so comfortable. When you grip the camera, if feels like it might slip out becuase of the unbalanced weight (lens is on one side)2. Pictures are HAZY. I mean that. They're not the best quality. I would say that if you are into photography, this is not the camera you want to buy (I know this sounds weird).3. LCD does not come with a plastic cover. IT IS SO EASY TO SCRACH IT. I already have 3 or four big scratches, and maybe it's because the LCD monitor didn't come with a thin plastic cover??? I was really disappointed at Sony, for not taking the time to put a dumb cover on it.4. HARDLY ANY ZOOM. There's at least 2x.. but it's not going to get you too far. Maybe about 2 yards at the most. This camera also has a feature where you can zoom up to 7x. BUT- this feature is TERRIBLE.OVERALL, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY HAZY AND HAS SOME BAD QUALITY PICTUERS.THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER CHOICES OUT THERE.
