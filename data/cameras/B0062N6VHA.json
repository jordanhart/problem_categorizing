Description of kit appears expansive, \" 4 lenses!!!\" but it's mostly uselfess filler. You only get two actual lenses, the other two are cheap lens expanders. The wide angle one doesn't work well as it encroaches on the field of view, rounding off the corners so the picture looks like taken through tunnel. The mini tripod is a joke, might hold up lens cap  but not the camera. The camera bag won't fit the camera with lens attached so is useless. So if you are tempted by \"all the stuff\" you get, you will be disappointed.Otherwise, the camera itself and the the two actual Cannon lenses work fine. Better get best price on items separately and get quality rather than quantity.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Adequate for a beginner.", "Author": "The Don Vito \"[OFFICIAL]\"", "ReviewID": "R21VK064T93NY5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this T3i camera and this is the kit I used to purchase it.

The Canon lenses are great. However, like one buyer said the other \"lenses\" haven't really proved useful to me yet. I liked the \"telephoto\" lens because it gave a neat effect on some of the pictures, but that's about as useful as it got. The mini table size tripod is absolutely useless, though. Lol. It held up my Kodak Z5010 with no problems, but it didn't stand a chance with the Canon. Of course it's only included because it comes with the cleaning kit. The case hasn't given me any problems just yet. I can fit almost everything except one of the lenses in it at one time. One reviewer said that you couldn't even fit the camera with one of the lenses attached in the case. I'm not sure what case they got, but the one I got definitely let me fit the camera with a lens attached inside of it. Like I said I can fit almost everything except for one lens in the case at once.As the title of this review says, even though some of the add-ons aren't very useful the price is unbeatable. I priced this camera with the kit lens and an extra lens at Wal-Mart, and they wanted over $800. I don't remember if the other lens was a better lens or not, but I love this bundle. I feel like most of the lower-rated reviews were just overly nitpicky. This kit is definitely worth the price.
