The second time pictures were copied from camera to computer a green line appeared on the lcd screen, it does not appear in the pictures but is in the way when previewing on the camera.The description of this camera lists it as taking 3 AAA batteries, it doesn't. It uses a Li-Ion battery pack. Not very impressed with this seller's (Timothy B. Swick) description. Doesn't seem like he knows much about what he's selling.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vivitar Camera", "Author": "paintedactors", "ReviewID": "R1MX3C6QO8SJV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi Guys, I love this camera.
