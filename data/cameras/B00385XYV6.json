Not the BRIGHT glaring silver, just the regular brushed polished silver with a tint of light green on the words.  I was bored of the regular standard bright silver and wanted something unique but not glaring bright pink or red.  So I took a chance with the green and loved the color.Amazon was terrific and hassle free when I returned it because it was defective.  I wanted a replacement but Amazon was no longer selling it at $299 so I couldn't get a replacement.  The price has since gone up to over $300.I re-ordered this camera through another vendor that was selling it for $299.  Bravo to Amazon for their hassle-free return policy!*~*~*~*~*~*~ Revised Review - Added July 9, 2010 *~*~*~*~*~*~*I've played with this camera for a few weeks and the SHUTTER SPEED IS SUPER FAST!  Even in a dark environment the shutter speed is faster than my Sony Cybershot W-70 and my Nikon DSLR-90.  Sure the picture gets a little grainy but so does all other digital cameras.  But grainy is better than blurry any day.  I'm very happy with my purchase, so here's my pros and cons.PROS:* Super Fast Shutter Speed, in dim or lighted settings* Water proof!  So it can take great underwater snorkeling pictures!* Ultra Slim.  Can fit in jean pocket like a smart phone.* Lowering the lens shield automatically turns on the camera* Cameras powers on SUPER quick!  Wow!* Touch Screen menu is user-friendly and easy to use* SUPERB colors in dim-lighting!  (See sample photo in Amazon description of my daughter next to a military transporter.)* Powerful flash* LOVE the HD video ability ... although it's not as crisp compared to an official Flip or Vado camcorder.CONS:* Battery life is really short.  Like 2 hours with continuous use.  So I had to buy a spare.* Closing the lid is a little tricky.  It has to be super secure so water doesn't get in.  It's not as easy to close as a regular Sony Cybershot.  I had a error message pop up on my camera saying the lid wasn't closed securely when I didn't even open it.  Oh well, better safe than sorry.* The delete pictures function is sensitive so be careful not to choose \"delete all\".  Those with big fingers should delete carefully.  The buttons are spaced a little close together, in my opinion.  It's a touch screen so they could have easily spread some buttons further apart or made them bigger.* Since it's ultra slim, it takes some practice to hold the camera while taking pictures without blurring the shots, especially when the flash is off.* The flash is fairly intense, so I don't use it indoors because it washes out the faces in pictures.  But the bright flash can come in handy in night-time settings.* Speakers on this camera is weak compared to previous Sony Cybershot models, but that's probably because of its thin build.  When I play the same video file on the computer the sound is fine.  So don't be surprised if you can't hear much sound in your video files when you replay it on the camera.I know it looks like my cons are longer that's because my cons also have some pros in them.  The weak points of this camera are mostly caused by the Cybershot's thin build, in my opinion.  But considering it's ultra compact, has lightening fast shutter speed, and its versatility in different environments this camera will keep me satisfied for many years.  But there's always room for improvement!  I would give it a 4.5 stars if I could!*~*~*~*~*~*~ End of revised review July 9, 2010 *~*~*~*~*~*~*", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "A water and beach godsend!", "Author": "D.

I have to say that the camera performed very very well.  For the size of camera...seemingly much smaller in person...it took great pictures in low-light, sunset, action shots and most importantly in and around the waterslide (Carnival Dream - which doesn't get 5 stars but I digress), pool and beach.We have a 5 year old son...parents will appreciate this....instead of recoiling in fear everytime he grabbed, still dripping wet, for the camera I comfortably handed it to him.  He even took to recording a movie of himself going down the super fast water slide...very funny.The only thing to keep in mind is that the time between shots can be lengthy however, I'm of the opinion that this has more to do with the class of SD card.  As such, I'm comfortable giving this camera 5 stars.  It is no DSLR but, I've yet to find a reasonably priced DSLR that will allow me to take high quality underwater movies of a stingray while swimming in the ocean...which I did with results far better than I expected!A happy customerDavid Coryer", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy to use and fits in pocket nicely.", "Author": "M.

This one fits that bill.  Not only is it small and light enough to fit in my pocket but it take really nice low light photos.  The video is sharp and the sound is good.  As an extra, I wanted to be able to take panoramic photos at our family reunion that is coming up in a few weeks.  I am having trouble with this feature but that is just me because my son takes great panoramic photos with it.  He says that I move too slow.  I will keep trying.

The camera stopped the motion of the drops splashing back with no blur.  I was also able to use the fast motion feature to take pictures of hummingbirds in mid flight and while riding in a car out the side window.My only problems were the view screen was hard to see in bright sunlight (all view screens are this way) and after changing batteries the check door and memory card message would come up the first couple of times it was turned on.My friend brought her digital camera and only took a few pictures while I was able to get well over 300 shots of our vacation because of the versatility of this camera.

I was fairly happy with the W90, but found that I was growing more and more frustrated with the slower focusing and the poor performance in low light. I also found that when I took it out hiking, I was worried because the lens was constantly exposed and it seemed like it would break or scratch easily.The TX5 is awesome! I love that the lens is always covered unless you are shooting, and the small size is great. The camera is also really fast, I was impressed by it's low light abilities and the awesome panoramic sweep feature. It's a really fun camera and will be my only compact camera, not just for underwater and outdoor activities. I wanted something that was both rugged, but had good image quality all around.

Always liked Canon compacts, but gave mine away, so shopped, read reviews.  Wanted underwater for scuba/snorkel/pool.  Landed on the TX5 and then discovered all the nifty stuff it does, and with admirable image quality.  The Intelligent-Auto setting works well in almost all situations (even in the no-flash setting I prefer), and will give you two images back-to-back sometimes, adjusting for exposure when it deems it necessary.  The panoramic shots are so amazing...get those Mendocino coastline shots, or the crowd at the table.  The underwater setting corrects nicely in the pool and I've gotten some very fun results; haven't had the chance to use in salt water yet. So far all seals are solid.Also has movie, anti-motion, handheld twilight, scenes...lots of features packed into a tiny package. Case strongly recommended (I used an old phone case) as screen is uncovered. Battery life not bad; recharger is small, handy and quick.  All in all this was an excellent choice for me - now I know those shots that appear when my \"real\" camera isn't around will not be lost.UPDATE NOV 2010:  Battery life a little more disappointing now that I've used it more, but not enough for me to change my 5 stars -- it's still a sweet camera, and recharge is fast.

It's compact, so it's very portable and lightweight, perfect for traveling. It's also very intuitive and easy to use (I'm not particularly good with gadgets or techie stuff). The only complaint I have is that occasionally my thumb or another finger will accidentally touch something on the screen and it will switch from photo mode to movie mode, but that's only a minor inconvenience (and probably something that wouldn't happen if I paid more attention).

We finally took the camera to the pool before we head out on vacation in a few weeks. The camera says waterproof to 10ft. We had it in the shallow end under maybe 2ft of water for about 10 sec and it went dead. Other than this the camera was great for a point and shoot. We were very happy until today.Update 9/15/11. Returned the camera to Sony for repair or replacement under warranty. Sony Laredo said due to internal corrosion the camera repair is not covered. I asked why a waterproof camera would not be covered by corrosion as the corrosion most likely occurred somehow due to the waterproof feature of the camera failing. I was told there is nothing they can do. Then I was told, \"Sony would like to make you an incredible offer with a discount of a replacement DSC-TX10 for only $279!\" Hmmm... another $300+ (tax+shipping) for another Sony \"Waterproof\" camera which brings my grand total to around $600 for a waterproof camera.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Travel Camera", "Author": "Super Max", "ReviewID": "R3K4FS149JH9PD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really wanted a small camera with an optical viewfinder, but sadly none are left now that Canon has discontinued the ELPH SD780 and SD1200. I did a fair amount of research and decided to try this Sony as a rugged camera for travel and outdoor activities. The LCD brightness can be increased so that it's somewhat viewable in bright sun, but not as good as an optical viewfinder. The camera is a quality build, the touchscreen and menus are very useable, and the absence of pushbuttons isn't missed. It's pretty much meet or exceeded my expectations for it's intended use.Now, I wanted to comment on the waterproofness of the camera. I'm a longtime scuba diver and well acquainted with waterproof cameras, lights, and other dive gear. Any camera that is designed to go in the water will have O-rings that have to be serviced and maintained. This Sony is no different. If you expect it to be waterproof the O-rings on the battery compartment doors have to be serviced from day one. You need to remove the O-rings with a brass O-ring pick (or toothpick), clean the O-ring channel with a q-tip and alcohol, apply fresh silicon paste to the O-ring and reseat it in the channel. And you need to repeat this service at regular intervals if the camera goes in the water. There is no way around this. If you want the camera to be waterproof then you must service it accordingly, just like any other piece of dive gear.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprised at picture quality given the good reviews", "Author": "R.

Yes the battery door was closed, it even has a notice after you turn it on after it being open. Sony's support is horrible!! Outsourced to people who barely speak English and when they come to a wall they say sorry about your luck. I bought the camera well within the 1yr mark, the camera wasn't even made a year ago and they wont do anything without the bill of sale. Yes I should of kept it but over time things get lost.
