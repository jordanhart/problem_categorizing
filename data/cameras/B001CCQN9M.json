{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great slim take-anywhere point and shoot!", "Author": "R. Raymundo \"NikonBob\"", "ReviewID": "R2PG42B4M2JTSY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got my Sony DSC-T77 here in asia where it's been out for a couple of weeks and would just like to give this little slim point and shoot a thumbs up!I used to own the Sony DSC-T70 which was an OK camera in my opinion.  As an upgrade, the T77 is really a much better camera.Pros:-Great image quality in good light.  Compared to the T70, the T77 is produces better images in good light.  The photos are pin sharp and more noticeable are fine details.  When I take portraits with the T77, I now see pores and individual eyelashes!-Slimmer and lighter than the T70, the T77 really is a pocketable camera that you'd want to take with you all the time.  It's so unobtrusive I sometimes forget I have it with me!-Dynamic Range Optimizer helps recover shadow details without losing highlights.-A barrage of other features like smile shutter, face detection, anti-blink function, and image stabilization helps make taking pictures more fun.Cons:-I wished Sony had separate controls for saturation, sharpness, and contrast like all the Canons have.  There are times I want to get more saturated colors.  While it does have a vivid setting which boosts up the saturation, it also boosts up the contrast which results in harsh-looking photos (most of the time anyway).-I think it's safe to say that this camera takes better picture in good light.  The quality definitely goes down as the light levels go down.  I think the problem with such a small sensor and lens is that in lower light levels, the camera compensates by choosing higher ISOs which results in more noise and more noise reduction which produces photos that are less sharp and less detailed.All in all, I really like this camera, and at this small/slim size, I think this is as good as it gets.  If you're looking for the smallest and slimmest camera that takes quality photos, then give the Sony DSC-T77 a try.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera.  - Review from a non-professional.", "Author": "J.

It took me some real long hours researching the details before I found it here.

Buy a memory stick!What you find in the box:  * Cyber-shot DSC-T77 camera  * NP-BD1 rechargeable lithium-ion battery  * Battery charger  * Station plate (for the optional camera dock)  * Paint pen  * Wrist strap  * USB + A/V cable  * CD-ROM featuring Cyber-shot software, Cyber-shot Handbook and Step-up Guide  * 55 page basic manual (printed) plus 171 page full manual (on CD-ROM)Now for the review: Realize that this has a very small lens physically. The amount of light that can come into that lens when shooting is a good deal less than a 35mm DSLR camera. That being said there are those that argue that this is not a \"true\" 10 megapixel camera. All I can say is that the photos are excellent. You may have to use the flash a bit more than with a standard 35mm camera due to the smaller lens size.The uploading is very easy. Its a Sony so the included software is very well made. Easy to use and intuitive.All in all a very nice pocket camera to take everywhere with you on your vacations.Thank you for reading my review.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Choco Guy", "ReviewID": "R260UKZQ07CKQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Still new but have used quite a bit.

I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone. Rather than repeat what many reviews here already say, I will just highlight some of the pros and cons....Pros:- Very small! Easily fits in pocket- Not slow at all-Easy to use and figure out- Works best in bright natural lightCons:- Lens is in upper right hand corner (not center) , so if someone not familiar with the camera is taking the pic, you usually get a pic of their finger.- Proprietary battery and memory stick are a major drawback since you must buy from Sony. Would prefer the more universal SD card.-Pics not so great in low light- When you do need the flash it is blinding.- Slide lens opener is a bit awkward since the camera is small.Overall all though, I'm just nitpicking.

In fact, I can usually find a few things I really don't like about most digital cameras that I've used but that's just not the case with this terrific little device.  That said, no gadget is 100% perfect and there are a few things I wish were different.Here's how the Sony DSC-T77 breaks down:PROS:- Unbelievable build quality, the T77 has a truly solid metal case all the way around.  You won't be breaking this baby any time soon.- Very small size, is actually much smaller than it looks in the pictures.- The touch screen works great for navigating and activating features.- Menu layout has the typical Sony complexity but follows their standard structure.  If you know Sony's digital camera menus, you're good here.- Very bright flash.  Incredible flash power especially for the size of the camera.- Good color saturation and nice widescreen pictures.  I keep mine in 16x9 mode and the shots are great, clear, and highly detailed given the 10.1MP, one after the other.- The smile detection mode is fantastic.  You essentially give control over picture taking to the audience once you go into this mode.  Smile sensitivity can be adjusted and people are always amazed the camera can sense smiles and take shots automatically.- In-camera touch-ups are easy as can be, including adding smiles and removing red-eye.- Rear LCD preview screen is large and roomy, covering the entire rear of the camera.- Battery life is excellent despite the large rear preview screen, powerful flash, and other battery draining features.- The T77 has a generous array of accessories available.  You can get an underwater camera housing, a variety of good cases, new batteries, extra storage, a digital dock and more.- Works great with 3rd party PictBridge printers and the T77 printed directly to my Polaroid portable printer with no issues.- I've had no issues with the zoom control.  Some have reported it as being too small but I find that it's just fine and I've never had a problem.- Auto-orientation is one of the handiest features of this camera.  Never have to rotate a picture again after downloading it to your PC or uploading it online.  Sony isn't clear on how this is done but it must use a built-in accelerometer since it's pretty much 100% accurate.  A big time saver since rotating lots of 10MP photos can really take time and was one of the big pains in picture processing workflow with older digital cameras.CONS:- The biggest problem by far is that the camera is so small it makes taking stable shots difficult sometimes. I often find that shake created while pressing the shoot button creates blurry pictures.  You do have to *concentrate* not to shake the little T77 as you take pictures.- The slide down camera cover on the front is hard to slide down sometimes, especially in cold weather.  It's not that it sticks, it just requires some serious pressing and pulling.  The mechanism seems quite firm and is very rugged feeling so I don't worry about it wearing out due to the repeated stress however.- The on-screen menu stays on too long after initiating picture playing and I often have people stare quizzically at the screen when I hit the play button and show them the camera.  A minor quibble but it comes up all the time.I can't stress enough how well built this thing is and what a joy it is to use. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat and is one of the best point-and-shoots available today in my opinion.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Save your money", "Author": "mom of 2", "ReviewID": "RSVV3OEGE2VUA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is our third Cybershot to own in the past 5 years.  We have loved them in the past and were impressed with all the features.  The zoom is horrible on this camera.  Pictures come out grainy when using the zoom.  Outside the pictures are great, but life happens in both.  We returned it after one week and are still searching for a good camera in this price range.  We own a Digital SLR (Pentax) and love taking pictures.  My husband is into messing with all the settings.  Our previous cybershot took better pictures at a fraction of the cost.  No matter what setting we used, the pictures were dark and grainy inside with the zoom.  We had to get right up on the subject to get a clear picture.

Unfortunately Sony has made a critical error in design and when using the flash many pictures have white circles in random locations on the image.  At first we thought the camera was defective but we purchased five of them for business and after three of them had the same problem we called Sony. The tech support rep had me reset the camera etc. they finally told me that white spots are perfectly normal because \"the flash sometimes reflects on dust\".  This of course seems funny because after owning many cameras I have never had one that reflects dust particles which ruins pictures.  After doing some research I have found many other people have the same complaint.  It seems like maybe the lens is too close to the flash and does have some time of reflection problem.  I would strongly recommend for the same money to buy a Canon even though they are not as small or stylish.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!!", "Author": "Doctor Dan", "ReviewID": "R12RYYBAT9ZXNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera and I've been having so much fun with it for almost five months now that I felt I should 'review' it. It's truly worthy of my 'FIVE STAR' rating.Unlike most digital cameras, it's actually made IN Japan(except for the lens optics which are sourced from the 'world-class' Zeiss factory) Lots of METAL not plastic, and a build-quality that's top notch. It's really a pocket-sized wonder capable of stunning image quality - I just had a couple of 13.5\" x 24.0\" custom prints made from a High Defintion 16 x 9 ratio image that's simply stunning. It's hard to believe that it came out of such a small camera(and speaks well for Sony's choice of the Zeiss optics)!I should mention a couple VERY important things right off. One, it's NOT a 'toy' but rather a very complex and 'precision' instrument. It's delicate and not designed to be dropped, submerged or abused. Use the wrist strap ALWAYS! And the big 3\" LCD touch-screen is delicate so keep your right hand thumbnail cut short so you don't 'gouge' the screen when holding the camera. Perhaps a flexible screen protector would help, but I feel it would affect the screen's sensitivity, so I haven't installed one and use Sony's 'paint pen'(the little plastic paddle-thingie that you install on the wrist strap). It only takes a VERY light touch to use it on the screen - don't use it like a ball-point pen on multi-part carbonless paperwork where people are accustomed to 'bearing down' hard to make an impression through all the copies! Easy does it!And get a really good case to keep it in to give your investment a chance for a long life. I liked the Case Logic UNZB-2, a padded neoprene model with extra padding on one side to give a little extra 'protection' to the big LCD touch screen. I replaced the case's little metal hanging loop with a carabiner(?sp.) clip(available at hardware stores and some sporting goods shops) to allow me to quickly latch the camera case to a belt loop on my jeans so I can always have the camera with me and not miss those wonderful photo 'ops' that always seem to happen when you don't have your camera with you!Besides buying another Sony #NP-FD1 battery so I always have 'power', I also purchased Sony's #VMC-MHC1 HD Output adapter cable which is NOT the same as the cable that comes with the camera. The difference is the ability to connect to an HDTV's composite video inputs for true HD quality(I only wish Sony made this cable longer than the 1.5 meter length)Hint, hint Sony!And, of course, buy a quality 'high speed' Memory Stick Pro Duo as the internal 15MB memory won't go far at all(maybe a few HD-size images at the most). A 1 GB for still images, and more if you want to capture motion.The specs and reviews from many others will tell you the rest so I won't repeat it all.

Inspired by its looks and size. Ans considering the price difference and more pixels I was expecting better quality than my previous W50. But I must say I am disappointed with its picture quality. It cannot compare with the sharpness and rich color result of W50 even though it is supposed to have tons of features (as Sony claims) to improve picture quality.The AI in fully automatic mode is not smart either. At times, none of the pictures of an entire event can be considered perfect, in fact most pictures are blurry or out of focus.

Every person in all the photos had red-eye which I was able to remove using my photo editing\\management software.- The pictures did not look natural. My guess is the T77 needs good light. I have a Kodak 5.1 mp camera and the photos are much more natural looking under varying light conditions.- The battery life is not all that great.

I currently use a Canon SD750 when I am on the go, and a Canon Digital Rebel (1st generation), when I do not mind carrying the heavier gear.Since purchasing my Sony T77, I have done side by side image comparisons of identical photos. There is no comparison. The T77's colors are more accurate than BOTH the SD750 and the Digital Rebel. In addition, the Sony's images were sharper than either Canon's.Get one! You will not be disappointed. The diminutive size is only another plus for getting this unit. Its photos are the best that I have seen from a compact digital...Having tried many cases for the camera, I also recommend the Tamrac, Model 5680...It is cheap, well made, protects the camera well, and looks and fits as if it were custom designed for the T77.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is the camera to buy!", "Author": "ambYtious \"Love is all we need :)\"", "ReviewID": "ROFFHO31OG4R0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

My current need was a digital camera that was small and light (something I could put in my shirt pocket or throw in a briefcase) to document images when the need arose. After much research and review, I finally decided on the Sony DSC-T77 - and it meets my needs spectacularly. Besides making decent photos, it is rather intuitive and easy to use. I was particularly drawn to the bold and beefy lens cover and the fact that the telescoping, although limited in range, is all internal to the camera. Other cameras I compared the Sony to have delicate-looking lens-cover leaves  and the telescoping lenses protruded like a bad zit on prom night (both of which would seem more prone to damage and malfunction). The touch screen responds well to my normal fingers.I've read mixed reviews on this camera - the bad ones seems to want this camera to be more than it is. It is not a DSLR - nor will it ever be.

It's small, it takes decent quality pictures. I got it because it was slim, I care about portability. When I bought it, it was broken already. The camera works but the battery door is broken and the battery pops out randomly. I went on Sony's website and told them on their online support, they said they'd replace/fix it. So I called them up, did the whole RMA thing, paid to send them the camera. Waited a week or so, it came back - not fixed. I called them up and told them they said they'd fix it -- I didn't break it, it was already like that. I even kept screenshots and logs of the chat with them and showed them it. They refused to service their product even after they said they would. $320 down the drain.This would cost them at most $20 to fix, I even offered to pay to fix it and they refused! No, I didn't offer $20, I just asked how much they would charge to fix it and they said they won't fix it. Horrible company. They don't do their own support, they pay another company to do it, so there is no way to get them to do anything.Good camera, crappy support. Don't buy it. I stopped buying Sony products.

However, I returned it after playing around with it and having no tolerance for the touchscreen interface.Cons:-- Touchscreen was difficult to use and annoying.  It would not always register when I tried selecting something, so I would often have to touch the screen more than once.  It requires going through so many clicks and menus to do simple tasks, which made my older Canon camera with normal buttons seem much faster in comparison.  I also did not want to carry around the pen for the touchscreen, and using my fingers would leave fingerprints and be even less effective.-- The lens does not seem properly protected from my fingers when holding the camera so that it is easy to put fingerprints on the lens, which I would assume could decrease the quality of photos.-- The 3 inch LCD screen includes wasted space since it is widescreen and it doesn't make sense for everyone to shoot in widescreen.  Therefore, the point of the touchscreen to free up more space for the LCD display is meaningless for most, as there are black bars on each side of the photo.-- Need to purchase separate cable to view HD quality photos on tv.-- Tiny zoom lever.Pros:-- Easy to understand manual-- Small and thin.  A true ultracompact.-- Auto scene selection mode seems like a useful feature.The cons listed above, combined with further research I found giving other compact cameras better marks, made me return this.
