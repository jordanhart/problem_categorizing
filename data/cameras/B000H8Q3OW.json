You would be much better off getting a 35mm with film than using this.  Every time the batteries come out, whether they run out which happens quickly or fall out which happens easily, you lose all the memory.The inclusion of software was nice, but cheap and not as good an much of the freeware out there.  I would suggest downloading Google's Picasa if you would like a good free picture filing and editing program.All in all, I didn't want to waste the money to ship this back, but I should have.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$29.99", "Features": "Digitrex Funstyle FS-1350Y 640x480 Digital Camera General Features: Orange and silver design\nDigital camera PC camera 1.3 megapixel interpolated resolution\nImage resolution: 640 x 480 pixels (VGA), 1280 x 960 pixels (SXGA)\nBuilt-in memory: 8 MB SDRAM 1 MB ROM\nMemory Capacity:26 high resolution or 104 low resolution pictures", "Name": "Digitrex Funstyle FS-1350Y 640x480 Digital Camera (Orange)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wc44ZaBZL.jpg", "ProductID": "B000H8Q3OW"}}
