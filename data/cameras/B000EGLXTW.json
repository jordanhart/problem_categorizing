You can take it everywhere and get very good pictures.  But it's not that expensive, so there's no reason not to take it everywhere (except maybe that kayak trip).If you're wondering whether to get the W30 or the W50 (especially given the lack of reviews on the W30) - go with the W50.  The W50 is a little smaller and lighter, and even with the bigger screen has lower power consumption than the W30 - so you don't have to worry that having the big screen will cut your shooting time.  The W50 also comes with a combination computer / TV cable.The S600 is somewhat interesting at the price, but a step down in LCD size and features and a little bulkier - as noted below for most people you can get plenty of battery life and a smaller size with the proprietary battery cameras.In general, you'll also get better pictures with a W50 than with credit-card type cameras that have a tiny lens system - optics will always make a difference.If you've used an older generation camera, you may have some misconceptions about battery life.  Many newer cameras have sharply reduced power consumption, so the powerful proprietary battery can get you through a day of shooting hundreds of shots with no problem.  (Be a little wise about turning it off when you're not using it!)  So a lot of the conventional wisdom about batteries is wrong - you probably don't need a second battery, unless you're going into the woods for a while, and you don't need to mess with AA rechargeables.  Also, lithium ion batteries don't have a memory effect, so don't worry about partial recharging.  Just charge the battery each night.  So - before getting a second battery, try it for a while and see if you need it.But a case is a good idea - see the LCS-WF, or LCS-WE, or LCS-CSG maybe - there are a lot of cases out there.Get a Memory Stick Pro Duo card - Pro cards are faster, and you need the smaller Duo size with this camera.  Get at least 512MB, and maybe 1-2GB, especially if you plan to travel for more than a week, or use the video mode - which is surprisingly good, if set to fine, but uses enormous amounts of storage at that setting.I've been using the Sony DSC-P200 for over a year now.  Reviewers generally rated it as the best of the compact cameras.  The W50 can't match it in some respects - the P200 has a bigger sensor and a bigger lens, both a fundamental to picture quality.  But any reasonable person will be very happy with the pictures from the W50, given the size of it.And the controls, menus and interface on the W50 have definitely been improved - for example, the W50 has easier access to the various scene modes (twilight, etc), with some explanation on the screen of what those mysterious little icons mean (so you might actually use them). Try the High ISO mode in low light no-flash situations - for nit pickers the picture quality suffers, but most people will find it useful.  And again, if you need that often, no ultra-compact camera will work really well - think about something with a bigger lens and bigger sensor.But the W50 still offers enough control (through the scene modes and the Program mode) to allow a fair amount of control over the pictures, for an automatic camera.The build quality seems fine to me.By the way, it uses essentially the same cable as the DSC-P200 for the USB/AV cable.The charger is fairly compact and rated 100-240V, so while you'll need a plug adapter overseas you won't need a voltage converter.My only real complaint so far - the battery charger is a little slow, though probably OK. Sony isn't doing itself any good on customer satisfaction by not including the (optional) fast, compact charger to go with the fast, compact camera.A few common problems and easy fixes:- All of these cameras will focus on what's in the center when you press the shutter halfway down.  If the center of the shot you want to take is background, and not subject, you'll get the background in focus.  So aim at the subject, hold the shutter halfway down to fix the focus and exposure, then compose the picture and press the rest of the way down.- Flash pictures rarely look really good on most cameras.  The W50 is pretty good, but you might have even better luck using the P mode and setting the flash to the - setting, especially for closer shots (across a table, for example).  Or, use the + mode if you're in a big room.- Try using the P mode and putting the ISO setting to something very high if you want to force a fast shutter time (for example, for action shots).But of course good light always gives the best pictures with any camera.  There are limits to what you can currently expect from any ultracompact camera.Most of the complaints are from people expecting a camera to do everything. Be a little smart about it, and don't expect the (currently) impossible - and you'll be surprised at how many good pictures a camera like this can get for you.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great price for the best portable camera", "Author": "S. Wong", "ReviewID": "RVL1MBUUVNG8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did much research before buying a portable digital camera.I looked at the Canon sd450 and several others in the same style and size.  I had many criterias and most cameras fell short of it except the Sony dscw50.My criterias were :1. pocket portable (comparable to the canon)2. a viewfinder (to take pictures on very sunny days)3. large lcd screen (so I can view pictures taken with good detail.)4. very good battery life (battery last nice and long, plus it has an icon to indicate battery life).5. 3x optical zoom6. very good macro  .74\" (It's great for shots very up close in very good detail. Much better than most cameras. I can take pictures of fine text in books, you can even take pictures of dust.)7.  High ISO (For those night scenes and indoor shots without flash.  So far I am very happy.  Indoor shots are fantastic.I don't use the ISO function because it is grainy, but this camera can take really good indoor photos in regular mode with an iso setting of 200.)8. Adjustable flash - works very good indoors and outdoors. You can adjust the intensity.  Flash is adjustable so it's not too overwhelming, or set to really light up a room, which is great for such a small camera.)9. Intuitive layout - I like the layout of the controls and menus.  You are usually one to three steps to adjust settings.  It's easy to switch between viewfinder mode and lcd mode.This camera excelled in almost every category compared to the other portable cameras.  I haven't use the video function much so I can't comment on that. It's good for people who just need a point and shoot camera, but have enough manual controls to satisfy someone more advanced.I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Don't let the size fool you!!!", "Author": "E.

After owning this camera for a week, I think I've found it!This is one very slick little camera. It's the size of a deck of playing cards. Startup is quick, the menu is pretty easy to navigate (even with little or no instruction), and the size is such that you can slide it in your front pocket and forget it's even there. The 2.5-inch LCD screen on the back is really sweet. I haven't had time to even really scratch the surface as far as all the other features of this baby. But I can tell you that if you're like me and are not a complete camera or photo guru, yet still appreciate quality, ease of use, and convenience, this is one you should consider. I found the best price ($[...] delivered) through Amazon from Ace Digital Club. I ordered it Sunday night and had it Wednesday. I also got the Sony LCS-CST case (PERFECT for this camera, $[...] delivered) through Amazon from Continental Trading Co., and a 1GB stick of the new Sony Memory Stick Duo Pro High Speed memory for $[...] delivered from Ebay. For right around $[...] total, I've got one sweet camera, more memory than I'll probably ever need, and good protection to keep this baby safe! Well worth every penny if you ask me.", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great price.", "Author": "DeShaun \"DAC\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZZZ950MNRZ0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to own a DSC-P52. After a lot of good service, a few months ago, it died on me (camera shutter cover gave out). I was looking to find something with as much functionality, and a comparable price.When I got the P52 in 2003, it was $249. Three years later, the W50, at the same price, is VERY much worth every penny.For starters, there is the size. It's comparable to Canon's ELPH series, but there are notable differences. For one thing, the LCD screen is a comfortable 2.5 inches. Not only that, but it's got a hard plastic layer over it, which makes wiping off smudges and fingerprints really easy.It's got an optical zoom, and the Smart Zoom feature is a nice touch. The design of the camera is sleek, it's really close to the 8.1mp DSC-N1.The macro is great for a camera of this size and price range. I took a quick picture of the keys on my keyboard, and it was crystal clear. The manual says you can get as close as 2cm. That's just under an inch from the subject. I find that to be great.The fact that you can increase to 1000 ISO is nice, but higher ISO always means more image noise, and though Sony has made some efforts to reduce that, using the max ISO is going to lower your image quality. It pays to use a tripod or lean against a stable object whenever possible, over just using high ISO.The histogram is a nice touch too. It really helps you adjust the exposure of the camera to get something that has good contrast.Also, the extra color modes -rich and natural- are nice little touches; rich boosts the color saturation, while natural lowers the saturation a bit. I was surprised that two modes that my P52 had were NOT on the W50 -Solarized, and Photo Negative. I don't mind much, though.The internal memory is only 32mb, so please do yourself a favor and get a Memory Stick Duo PRO. For a camera of 6.1mp, it would be a bit of an injustice to not take advantage of the extra quality. Getting 64 or even 128mb would be limiting yourself to mostly VGA quality images, and if you're planning to print your pictures and not just share them, a larger stick is a good investment. I have a 1gb, and I can take a few hundered pictures at the maximum setting.There's a port to plug in an adapter (which you'd have to get separately) so you can just run off of AC power, nice touch.If you are considering the W30 or W40 models, the difference between those two, and this one, is that you have the 2.5 inch screen as opposed to just 2. Also, the W50 has a different connector. W30/W40 both use the standard USB cable, whereas the W50 has this nice Universal Cable. You can use the SAME cable to connect to your computer, your television, and your printer.The interface is nice, since the icons now give a temporary text readout of what they mean. I don't need it, but it makes the camera very easy to pick up and use. You don't have to press something and then wonder what you've done.The lcd is clear and bright, and the viewfinder is in a decent spot now (I hated when they were off center).I was actually debating between this, and Panasonic's DMC-TZ1, and honestly, the Panasonic model is $100 more, has NO viewfinder, and even though it's got an amazing 10x optical zoom and image stabilization (and it's a small camera, check it out), I didn't find it to be worth the extra $100.The only gripe I have -and it's mostly impatience on my part- is that Sony has released the camera in other colors overseas (check it out on Amazon.ca). I would've loved to get this in black, but we only have silver at the moment.Great bang for your buck.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Take the time to learn and use the features", "Author": "Jennifer Suarez", "ReviewID": "R1Y25NOQRNM4B9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband bought me this camera as an early Christmas gift. At first I wasn't in love with it. I was disappointed because I wanted a camera that had image stablization. This camera instead boasted about its ISO sensitivity settings and fast shutter speed. (They claimed it was similar to image stablization) When I first tried it out I was in a very low light setting and was experiencing some blur in my images which was exactly what I was trying to avoid in a new camera!I almost traded this one in for something different (A cheaper priced olympus with IS) but thankfully I gave the camera another chance first and decided to play around with all the manual settings. There are a lot of them in the menus so you can fine tune it like you wouldn't believe. This ability to change its setup is what made me stick with the Sony.However, I wouldn't say this camera is ideal for very low light situations. The two preset choices of shooting a low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience a tiny bit of camera shake. But again, it goes back to the adjustments in the menus, you can make manual adjustments and get pretty decent pictures with minumal (or no) blur. But you have to take the time to find and set the right ISO and light settings. I highly suggest using the histogram that you can pop-up onto the screen for help. Unless you are willing to spend about $200 more on a camera, you won't find one that will perform great in very low light anyway. And like my husband said... \"really... how often are you taking shots in the dark honey?\" Hey, there's Halloween trick-or-treating and fouth of July fireworks and other night time events I retorted, but he's right. There really isn't a lot of real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using a flash.I know lots of people (me included) like to try and figure out all the menu options and settings on their own before reading a manual... but this one, if you really want super amazing shots, reading the manual will give you A LOT of insight on how powerful a camera it really is. For people that always read the manual this is probably a big \"DUUUH\"! But if you are like me and like to try and rush through and figure it out, you are missing out on a ton of nice options.Some great features:The camera doubles as a video camera and it is only limited to recording up to the amt of space available in your memory stick. Other cameras will only let you record a pre-set maximum number of minutes.I also like the Burst modes which allow you to take shots in fast succession. Great for action shots. But take note, when using a burst mode you cannot use the flash. (Again, watch out for low light!)I have a 3 year old daughter and the fast shutter speed (and burst) works great in a well lit situation. Just the other day I caught shots of her running around and jumping up and down that came out crystal clear. No blur at all. Every flying and bouncing hair on her head came out perfectly frozen in time. Quite neat!I gave this camera 4 stars because the camera performs wonderfully in every situation except very low light. But for the price, you can't do much better anyway. Its a great buy and I think just about anyone would be pleased to receive it as a gift.****EDIT FEB. 20th 2007 ******I wanted to update my review to tell you that I have recently had problems with my camera. The flash started acting strange. It would either under expose or over expose the picture. I'm not sure if the flash strength was quirky or if it was the timing of the flash to the shutter speed. Regardless SONY was very helpful and is currently fixing the product free of charge. I owned the camera for about 4 months so it is still covered under their manufacter warrenty. Once again, SONY proves to be a worry free buy! If there is a problem they are quick to correct it.***EDIT March 2nd 2007****The camera already came back from SONY and is fixed and working like new! No charge to have it repaired other than shipping costs ([...] bucks). They stated that the flash board was replaced. Still loving this camera and glad SONY fixed it super fast and for free!", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "When You Need something Fast", "Author": "Jason E. Justian", "ReviewID": "R1W7I57KAMRNEQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Sony S75 for three years.  That camera took excellent pictures, but as my children grew from babies into fast-moving toddlers and preschoolers, the S75's two-second shutter lag started to become a problem.  Sure, I could pre-meter a shot by holding the shutter button halfway down, but in the two seconds it took for the camera to auto-focus and get the right exposure settings, my subject had already moved--usually several feet toward the camera with little hands outstretched.So I spent tons of time looking for something fast.  That was really my primary criterion.  Size was also a factor, and unfortunately that ruled out more capable cameras with large lenses and lots of manual settings.The W50 is fast.  Its lens extends and it's ready to shoot within about a second after turning it on.  In decent light, it takes the picture when you push the shutter button... none of that sitting around thinking while the subject toddles away.Now, I was a bit disappointed that Sony discontinued the DSC-P200.  But the feature set of the W50 is quite similar.  There are a few things that I wish the W50 had in common with the P200: the P200 has a metal body, while the W50's body is plastic.  The P200 uses standard Sony Memory Sticks, while the W50 uses the harder-to-find Memory Stick Duo.  Also, the P200 is 7 megapixels, although the difference between 6 and 7 megapixels is beyond my untrained eye.The 2.5-inch LCD is nice.  I never felt that such a large LCD was necessary to take pictures, but it's nice for showing pictures to others; it's like showing people pictures in your wallet.The camera, like all modern digitals, contains a clock that keeps the current time and date.  Prior Sony models displayed the time on the splash page when the camera booted up.  The W50 just says \"Cyber-shot\" and then goes about its business.  This is a small detail, but I don't usually wear a watch, and it was nice to be able to quickly check the time by turning on my camera.  Sony, what gives? :)The camera comes with some software.  Usually I wouldn't bother with software included with a camera; the camera is recognized by modern operating systems as a mass storage device, so you can just hook it up and drag pictures to your My Pictures folder, or whatever.  But the Cyber-shot viewer that comes with the W50 is worth a look.  It organizes pictures with a calendar that zooms in and out as you select things.  It's a great way to look at pictures, a lot of fun.Overall, I'm quite pleased with the little W50.  If your favorite photographic subjects are small children, the W50 will be up to the challenge of matching their pace.  And the image quality is more than acceptable for 4x6 prints.", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "This is a Best Buy", "Author": "Sam M.

I was nervous about buying my first digital camera so I took my time and did my homework - I read Consumer Reports, which never has steered me wrong, the online customer reviews at Amazon, editorial/pro reviews on Crutchfield, I went to the stores to look at cameras and ask questions. Everything told me I would love this camera. When I held it in my hand, it felt perfect. I am a small person so I wanted something small, something I could carry in my purse. I also wanted something that wouldn't require me to carry the manual at all times. The DSCW50 fit the bill. Onscreen prompts tell you what settings are being used and an easy to move wheel changes the settings so dummies like me can shoot fantastic-looking shots regardless of lighting conditions and subject. For those who are more savvy than I am, the camera lets you manually adjust settings, too, so you can get just the right shot. I love the short delay between next shot - just one second! Though the delay between button depression and shutter snap on the first shot can be slow, it's a speedy shooter.This camera takes wonderful photos! Crisp, clear, even in bright sunlight. The large viewscreen lets you see more clearly what your photo will look like, something I like because other cameras I tried had such small or low resolution screens that I couldn't tell what I was getting.The camera comes nearly complete - the USB cable included lets me load photos right to my - or anyone's-computer- within seconds. No special software is required; Jasco, Adobe Photoshop, Dell Photo, Microsoft all work. The camera does come with photo software in case you don't have any. The battery charger folds flat for easy portability and the included battery holds a charge for a loooonnng time.

I went to Amazon and it said it was out of stock but would be back in a month but I received mine a WEEK after ordering it!

It is fairly small and the battery life is amazing.  It takes pretty good pictures indoors and even better ones outdoors.The ISO that can go up to 1000 is misleading.  It'll go up that high but the pictures are barely usable for prints.  It also takes way too long between shots indoors (but we might be spoiled by using a more advanced camera for so long).Camera is well built and mostly aluminum (2 plastic doors are a drag).  The battery/Memory Stick door keeps popping open on me.  Thankfully the battery and Memory Stick are \"locked\" in and do not fly out when the door opens.I do not like the fact that Sony has to use their own Memory Card format as I already own many SD and Compact Flash cards.  I don't see any purpose for this other than Sony making more money.  There is no benefit to Mmeory Sticks as far as I can see.The screen is big but the picture quality is not the best.  And it scratched kind of easily after a few days of ownership.  The cables use Sony connections so a standard USB cable cannot be used here to connect to a TV or computer like on all of my other digital cameras.  So you must always have teh Sony cables with you.  It also takes quite a bit of time to charge the batteries.  On my Canon that takes rechargable AA's, I'm up and running in 15 minutes, not 6 hours.  But I don't know of any ulracompact that uses AA's so I can't really blame Sony.Now that I complained a little, let me get to why I bought the camera.  As mentioned, it is small and pretty light.  It fits in my pocket and I hardly know its there.  It takes good pictures and using a 1GB Memory Stick I can store more than enough shots for a days worth of shooting which coincides with battery life at abut 390 shots.What I really like although it was not wy I bought the camera, is that you can shoot video until you fill the memory card.  My other cameras are limited to 15 or 35 seconds worth of shooting.

Otherwise, hit or miss", "Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "R12ULUJP3U9INC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from a large retail chain about 3 years ago (yes, the model is that old).  First thing I must say: The price here is ridiculous for this camera.  Its not worth $388, or whatever they have it listed for.  That said, onto the pros and cons:PROS- Takes EXCELLENT pictures in any type of daylight (even mostly cloudy skies), including beautiful sunrise and sunset pictures (so long as its not too far along).  Great clarity, excellent color, and wonderful balance.  Can't beat this camera there.- The movie setting is quite good.  Not HD, but it doesn't have a limit on the video length (like many point-and-shoots do).  If you have the memory, you can take as long a video as you want.On that same note, the mic on this is actually quite good!  Excellent for recording convos or even concerts (as long as you aren't standing right in front of the speakers).- The camera does have a lot of settings, and the ability to create a 'custom' setting too by moving around ISO, flash, zoom, balance, and other settings.- Macro mode is nice for up close shots- The battery lasts FOREVER!  On one charge, I've gotten 250 pics and a couple 2 minute videos while using the preview screen quite generously (still had some life too).  Use a couple of the power save options, and I have no doubts you could easily hit 350-400 pictures on one charge.- Turn it on, and a second later you can take a picture.  Another second, and you can take another picture.  Very quick turnaround.- ISO setting isn't terrible (not great either) at taking low light pics w/o flash.  Pics tend to be grainy though.- Great, clear lens and a decent optical zoom (the digital zoom is fine, but I find using it tends to make it difficult to get a non-blurry shot).CONS- The root of many of this camera's problems: NO image stabilization feature!  Be prepared to delete or re-take half of your pictures because of this, unless you have nerve and stability of an army sniper.  W/o the flash in anything but direct sunlight, you are in trouble.  Even with the flash, you need to hold the camera as still as possible. This wouldn't be as a big an issue, but...- The 2.5 inch LCD is decent sized, but its difficult to see how good the picture actually is UNTIL you see it on your computer.  So, you may take 10 pictures and think you have 10 winners, but turns out only 2 or 3 are keepers.- The click/rotating wheel that has chooses one of the 10 modes of the camera is very easily turned by accident.  Thus, you get the perfect shot, click the shutter...and find out that the camera was actually on video mode.  Shot missed.  Disappointment abounds.- These 10 functions are also...shall we say...questionable as to there actual operation.  Let me say this: Out of the 10 modes, I use just 3 of them (Auto, Landscape, and Video) 98% of the time.  The others are pretty specific to certain scenarios, and I question if a couple of them actually do anything special (one setting is for beach shots, and it reportedly 'accentuates' the blue color.  Compared to an auto beach shot, I can see no difference between the two).- The flash has a 'groove zone', which I have found is about 4 to 6 feet away.  Anywhere outside of that zone, and the flash does not perform as well. Closer and people look like they are bio-luminescent.  Further away, and things start getting shadowy.  There's also no options to change the flash intensity (fill, close, etc).  So, you get the same flash each time.  Red Eye is tough to avoid too.  The flash indicator/RE light helps SOMETIMES (70% of the time), but the slow-synchro flash option is only effective maybe 15% of the time.- Taking shots at night is the worst.  Blurry without the flash, and the flash is usually too weak to make the shot look good regardless.  The 'twilight modes' are also useless, as the lack of image stabilization comes back into play.- Small quips: In video mode, you can't zoom at all while recording.  You can only stop, zoom, and restart.  Settings and features are not intuitive, but a quick read of the manual usually suffices.  Cyber-shot software is awful.  It runs EXTREMELY slow, doesn't offer many features compared to EasyShare, and its red eye fix (arguably the most used aspect of basic editing software) makes eyes look gray, dead, and unnatural.This camera isn't bad, and has some nice features.

Came home and some days later downloaded pictures and realized 75 percent were blurry and or had a white/ greenish blur in spots so the majority of vacation pictures were lost.I called customer service at Sony 15 days after purchase and they said to send to Precision Camera repair because replacement warranty is only for 14 days. I wrote a letter documenting the call and the problem and sent the camera off.They repaired per say and sent back. I took pictures over Easter and same problem 75 percent were bad. I called Sony 1-800-222-7669 asked for a Supervisor and they put me over to a JohnCQV8 on 4-9-07. I explained I would like the defective camera replaced this time with a new one and not repaired as I gave them a chance to repair and it did not work; I just wanted what I paid for a new camera that works. I was told they would note in the system and to send to Precision Camera again and they can replace. This time however they would pay for shipping as last time I had too and he would send me a shipping label. So another letter written documenting the call and the request to replace and the camera is sent again.Precision Camera received the camera 3 days ago and I called yesterday and they said \"no\" they will not replace they will repair up to 4 times and it does not matter if there is a note in the system.I called Sony and asked for upper level customer service which I got and after a lengthy hold they said sorry, our policy is to repair and that's what we pay Precision Camera for and if they did not fix it the first time they need to get it fixed. I explained my position that I could care less about their contract that I just wanted a new camera that works because that's what I paid for and not a camera twice taken apart and put back together in essence a refurbished camera.Well my twice repaired/refurbished camera shipped today and this time they replaced the lens, CCD, and associated items.Today is 4-20-07, I bought the camera on 3-09-07 lost 75 percent of my vacation pictures, 75 percent of the Easter holiday family pictures and still don't have a working camera. It's on its way back and lets see if it works this time.I bought from the Sony Style corporate store to eliminate any issues if problems did occur. This has been the worst customer service and I will never buy anything from their stores again. If they want to get their money from Precision have them fix until they get it right and sell when they are done as refurbished.

Bright glowing red eyes. I tried it with red eye reduction both on and off, and either way, it did not help.I did some research online and I found out that this is a very common problem with this model of camera. Even if I sent it back to Sony, I'm sure I'd have the same problem with a brand new one. It's unfortunately just the way this camera is designed. The store I bought it from told me that red eye is a common problem with these new SMALL cameras because the lens is so close to the flash.I did end up keeping this camera and but I had to remove hundreds of red-eyes using Photoshop and Shutterfly.The reason I still gave this 3 stars is because other than the red eye, I did really love everything else about this camera. I used it for about 1 year (before I dropped it and broke the LCD).If you buy this, definitely get a big 1 gig (or bigger) card so you can hold lots of pictures and video. Also I would recommend a 2nd battery so when 1 is charging in the wall, you can be using the other one.PROS- Small and compact- Good menu navigation- Good photo quality, especially outdoors- I love the Lithium Batteries - Great battery life- Decent Zoom- Good video capabilities - you can trim the photos, which I love! You can't in my newer model (DSC-W90) which is very annoying. :(CONS- Major red-eye issues- No red-eye removal system like the newer models- Blurry photos with flash off (no image stabilizer system or face detection)- The video mic is in such a stupid spot - on the top right where your left finger sits - so if you don't think so move it, the sound on the video is muffled.- The menu wheel drove me CRAZY on this thing because it ALWAYS moved when the camera was in it's case or in my pocket/purse. Sometimes I would go to snap a photo and the wheel had moved to video mode or some other wacky mode and I would miss a great shot. Very annoying!PS I now have a SONY Cybershot DSC-W90. It also had red-eye problems for indoor pics with the flash, but you can remove them right on the camera which is great. It works about 80% of the time. I really do love Sony's.

It's a fabulous little machine, takes super-fast pictures, is wonderfully compact yet functional, and I hardly ever need to use the flash which saves me on constant battery charging.  It has everything going for it... except the fact that it has now broken twice in the same way.When you turn on the camera, the lens moves in and out of its own accord, and the screen stays blank with only the word \"Access\".  Nothing you press has any effect, except possibly to conjure up the message \"Turn camera off and on again\" which never ever works.  This is not fun.It seems to have happened around the same time each of these past two years, which is incredibly frustrating.  The first time, it was still under warranty so I paid for shipping and Sony fixed it for me, which was fine.  But the second time was the last straw.  I'm currently studying abroad, and like to take lots of pictures to remember my trip by, but after talking to Sony's online customer support (which was as helpful as they could be, I suppose) I realized that the only way to fix it was to send it in, AGAIN.

I always took them on the 6mp setting, so as long as you didn't zoom the picture in it looked nice.  Adjustable flash was helpful in eliminating some of the over-exposure night time shots.  However, the one reason I'm getting a Canon for my next camera is because of the long time it took the Sony to focus.  My friends' Canons would have already taken a picture in say, a park at night, while my infrared light would still be flashing.  that said, a comparable Canon was more than $100 more expensive that the Sony was when I bought it about 8 months ago.All in all, I'd say the Sony is good for the price, but if you're willing to pay a premium then go for the Canon.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "true to thier product", "Author": "change", "ReviewID": "RAR3CHLWGQQUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this camera i m very very happy  and i will recommend this to anybody .That why i gave them 5star and they r true to their product for the price i pay thank u.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Second Camera", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "R3R0GRNGRITJM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera actually replaced an identical one I owned before that quit working.

I got it as an anniversary gift nearly three years ago, and I've had absolutely NO problems with it until today when it dropped very hard on concrete and I knew it would break, anything would have on that fall.  I found the exact same camera online with Amazon.  I wanted the same camera because the features are so simple for anyone to understand.  The quality of the pictures that are printed from this camera come out superb for a point and shoot.  Like I said, I love this camera and I'll swear by it.  I am glad to see that I was able to find another exact camera online.  I would have been extremely disappointed if I didn't.

I am planning to upgrade to a Canon Powershot XS10IS soon and that's much more camera for virtually the same amount of money.That being said, the Sony is a nice basic P&S; for the average user.  I really love the macro feature and have taken a lot of great macro shots...even sold a few!  I love using the B&W; and sepia features as well.  It shoots nicely without a tripod in sunlight and daylight, but when the sun starts going down you're going to need the flash or a tripod.  I recommend getting a tripod.  I always use the Program Auto setting so I can manually adjust the settings.

I have missed a lot of shots because of that.It takes OK video.  If you want a camera that will take great shots at your kid's concert, THIS IS NOT THAT CAMERA.  Get something with more zoom.  The beach and snow settings are useful.  It's the perfect size to stick in your pocket and go.Now to the problem...after two+years of use, this camera has developed some kind of spots INSIDE the lens.  I have never spilled anything on it, so I can't figure out what has caused this.  They are like glass bubbles, but if they had always been there, they would have shown up in pictures before now.  This is why I have decided it's time to upgrade...that and I want a camera with lots of zoom for shooting wildlife and distance shots.It's been a good camera and I will continue to use it for some things after I upgrade, but if you've got $400 to spend I'm sure you could find something that's higher quality.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good camera, resistant and long lasting battery", "Author": "Daniella Amaral Diniz Silva \"danielladiniz\"", "ReviewID": "R7WD01TXDV9QU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera through amazon.com two years ago, and I still use it a lot.

I have tried it in every light setting, indoors and outdoors, and 90% of the pics are out of focus. Since I travel the world alone this camara has absolutely no value to me.2) The self timer has to be manually activated after every shot. This means that you physically have to pick up the camara after every shot if you want to repeat photos and re-set the self timer.3) There is no option for viewing photos taken with the self timer meaning that if you want to review your photos you have to pick up the camara, go to image review and then back to the photo shoot mode. Most digital camaras give you a 2 or 5 or 10 second review option.4) The camara on its short side is not level making it almost impossible to stand up the camara and take your own vertical pics with the self-timer.If you are a solo traveler like me and end up taking most of your own pics alone then this camara is not for you. I will be putting this Cybershot on Ebay and will be going back to Cannon which I had previously.

I just realized that might be the red eye reduction which does seem to work fairly well most of the time to some degree but it's tough on kids.- No date stamp.

I was so excited to finally get it and let me tell you that it didn't let me down one bit. I had high expectations for this camera and it brightens up my day!The minute I got the camera out I charged the battery. I let it charge for 2 hours and then put the battery in the camera (I was in a rush to turn it on and test it out!). The battery was only charged for 2 hours and the battery life was still awesome! I used the camera for about an hour and the battery meter didn't even drop. Amazing battery life!The whole layout of the camera is perfect. Everything is very easy to access and use. There are tons of different shooting modes and settings, it'll take me a while to finally use them all. The picture quality is outstanding!The movie mode was something that I was very excited about. Other digital cameras in the past took very dark and grainy video. Not this camera! The video is crystal clear and the audio is so natural, it's stunning!As for being portable and light, very true. The camera is very slim and sleek. It can be easily hidden in a pocket or purse. People have said that the mode dial on the front is easily turned in a pocket, but it hasn't happened to me. The whole camera is very sturdy and that makes me feel at ease. I know that it is strong and durable.Overall, the DSC-W50 is an outstanding camera! For only $200 you get so much! The pictures are beautiful, the videos and audio are clear and natural, and the battery life is amazing. The camera is light and compact.

This is an okay camera. It takes good pictures outdoors, indoors are okay. Macro function is pretty useless. All those pictures come out blurry. If you use the flash the pics come out with major red eye and washed out. We've had some problems with this camera though. This is our second one, Sony had to replace the first one (can't remember why though). This second one had to be sent in to them to be repaired. The flash stopped working properly. All the pictures would come out brown unless you had the flash off. That was about a year ago. Now over the last few months a new problem has arose. The piece that holds the USB cable has become unstable. When you connect it to your computer you have to hold the cable and camera together and keep your hand perfectly still. If you move, it loses the connection with the computer. Today it's not connecting at all, no matter how still I hold it.

Unfortunately he buys on a whim and doesn't do the weeks of research I do before buying something. Had I done the research I would have skipped this camera. I have an older Olympus Camdedia which I paid and arm and a leg for 4 years ago and I love it.  However, it is big and bulky and I hated carrying it around on our numerous family vacations.  I wanted something I could grab, slide into my purse and go without weighing me down.  I was very excited when I opened the camera and saw how small and nice it looked.  I also liked that you can also buy an optional telephoto lens to use with it, which is unheard of in this class of cameras.But then I started taking pictures of my children opening their presents.  I had to delete at least 7 out of every 10 pictures because they were blurry!  Yes it was a lower light situation in our living room at 5am, but these were really bad!  My Olympus took excellent low light pics with sharp detail and wonderful color.  Ok, I thought, I just got the camera and was probably not using it on the correct settings.  I tried EVERY setting with the same results and horrible red-eye!Then I took it to where my children were doing indoor rock climbing.  The room was very well lit with natural sunlight due to the huge windows all over the room.  I would not have even needed a flash with my Olympus.  However, almost every picture was blurry and all the kids had red eyes.I am so unhappy with this camera.  I guess I will be forced to lug my bulky Camdedia around with me still.

I bought this camera from Amazon just 2 weeks back and started using it just 2 days back when I got to Hawaii for my year end vacation. This is my 1st time here and I thought I will get the best of pictures with this portable and nice looking camera. I had not even taken 150 pictures when I had a problem with it. I was watching hula dances last night and took several pictures with the camera. Then put the camera in my pocket (which is one of its benefits in being a thin camera). 5 mins later, I took the camera out and turned it on and got a message on the screen \"Access\" and then several beeps with the message \" Turn camera off and then on\" on the LCD screen. I thought this was because the battery was dying. Came to the room at night and put the battery on charging. Got up at 2 am (as I was to leave for a 38 mile bike ride down the Haleakala trail down hill), put the battery in, turned on the camera and lo.. the same 2 messages. My heart sank right then.I called customer support when I got back telling them the situation and the term \"customer support\" really had no meaning anymore. They were obstinate and all they said was buy a disposable camera and send the camera back for repair when you get back from Hawaii. No compensation. Believe me ... its not easy to get stuff cheap in Hawaii. So I have no option but to go and buy another digital camera from Walmart (couple hrs drive from my hotel). Then get back home and send this one for repairs.Irony is that I bought this camera from Amazon after reading the 52 good reviews on this site before mine.
