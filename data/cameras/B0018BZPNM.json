{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great little camera, but with a few minor issues", "Author": "ARH", "ReviewID": "RYDINCZK3ET92", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this is a great option for someone looking for a quality point and shoot camera.  Its 7.2 mega pixels provides enough resolution to produce photos that can be enlarged quite a bit before pixelation becomes an issue.  The camera is small, light, and easy to pack along on any outing.The camera has a variety of options, including a video option that is fun.  The operation is largely intuitive, with power, shutter control, and photo option wheel all on the top of the camera.  There are enough built in post-photo image manuplation options that they should keep most casual photographers satisfied.The camera uses 2 AA batteries and an SD card.  Images can be easily uploaded to a computer via a USB cord or directly from the SD card.So, if it's got all that going for it, why not 5 stars instead of 4?  Well, call me old school, but even in point and shoot cameras I prefer to be able to use either the LCD screen or a viewfinder and this camera lacks the view finder.  I also find that even when you use the anti-vibration option, there is a tendency for images to be blurred under marginal light conditions.  That can be a pain if you ever want/need to take photos under moderate lighting conditions, but where you cannot use the flash.All in all, this is a great little camera, and with a little tweeking it could have been a 5-star product.  And, if the things I mentioned are not an issue for you, then it may well be a 5-star option for you.I hope this helped!Solid 4-stars.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Defective", "Author": "MyPenName", "ReviewID": "R1DYKP404XKZZ5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this in a bundle from another merchant, but thought I would take the time to write a review here, as well.The camera was obviously seriously defective. I have heard that it is common with this model. Of course I learned this after buying and returning it!For us, the lens would not go back into place after use. The shutter would stay closed, when it should open and close to take a picture. The batteries died after literally 3-4 pictures!It was a horrible experience and I guess it serves me right because it was one of very, very few purchases that I made without researching first. I was at the store and new I had wanted to purchase a camera for my daughter, saw the price and bundle and felt it was a good deal. It was the camera, rechargeable batteries, an SD card and a carry case for $100 plus tax. To me, it seemed like a good deal. Unfortunately that wasn't the case since the camera had a mind of it's own and did not want to co operate.Of course this doesn't mean that every single one of these cameras will be defective, but it is definitely something to keep in mind, especially since I have read many similar experiences on online reviews.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "ian d.", "ReviewID": "R3GR8M5GFMMGG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA SO MUCH IVE MADE SOME LEGO VIDEOS AND THEY WERE PERFECT I AM NEVER GOING TO GET RID OF THIS CAMERA I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Okay camera for price...", "Author": "JennaLee", "ReviewID": "R4C0KMKYEDJ33", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I too agree,the photo quality is awesome but it is kinda a let down. My family being very pale people it would pale us out even more. My sister has bright red hair and it would pick up her hair and make it goregous but pale her out. It is a great camera for outside photos. Just don't introduce it to extreme weather. For example the camera got use to humid weather(LA) and then it decided to snow,it threw the camera for a loop. Plus I dropped it twice and it just died.I know what you are saying...YOU DROPPED IT, of course it is going to die. I dropped my Kodak camera multiple times and it didn't die. My LCD screen doesn't work anymore,but it still takes photos. Seeing how there is no view finder I am just kinda guessing at photos until I can get a better camera. I wouldn't pay the full price,but a refurb at 70 is decent.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Quality vs. Quality", "Author": "N. Kovacs \"Starwinged\"", "ReviewID": "R3PFIBC49E4C2L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As far as pictures, this camera was above average. So, probably four stars for that. It may not have the most megapixels, but the lens itself is larger, so the pictures are higher quality. It takes fast, adjusts well in different lights, and doesn't distort colors badly. Again, good for the price, which was about 80 dollars last year.The flash is very bright, and can bleach out very close range items. It also is rather finicky about focus, usually going for subject matter that is farther away than closer if you're trying to capture something within arm reach.Unfortunately, the big problem, as mentioned, is the habit of breaking every few months. Hence a two star rating. I've had this camera for almost a year, the standard length of the included warranty, and it has broken three times. All three times I sent it in to Samsung without a problem, and they fixed it. All three times it was because the lens did not retract all the way and the pictures became blurry. Very blurry - like looking through tissue paper.So, good if you need a temporary camera for a trip or something similar, but not for the long run. I was hoping to keep it for a few years,but once it breaks and the warranty runs out I might as well buy a new one.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do not buy - will quit working", "Author": "L.
