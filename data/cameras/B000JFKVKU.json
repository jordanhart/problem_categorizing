The photo quality was poor, blurry, and not even as good as my cell phone.  Maybe it is because of 3.1 pixel.  Anyhow returned and ordered a Canon 7.1 which is great.  Still used Amazon because of their wonderful customer service.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Robert W.

Therefore I suggest it as a TOY only.Store it right beside the hollow plastic 'fake' cell phone for the 'tots'.  It has all the features of a real camera including lights.Just do not plan on taking any usable photos.For instance--If you take a photo of a stop sign; you can tell by it's shape and color what the sign is--but you can not make out the word \"Stop\".  -TOO BLURRY-Press the shutter button...2 seconds later it flashes--seriously..Press the 10 second timer feature...1 second later it flashes--seriously..I even mounted it on a tripod and tested.  Still the photo quality was that of a moving object all though all was stationary.With no flash, all is too dark to identify; with flash, all is solid white--so much so that you cannot identify the target object.I once had a 35mm camera that cost $1.50 new, that used film.  It made better photos than this camera!For that matter, get a card board box, poke a hole in it--put some film into the box; place an object in front of the hole...you have a better camera than this one!!PS.  I did not return this camera.. The return shipping cost 1/2 as much as the product.  The product came in a sealed plastic pegboard envelope--the kind you have to destroy with scissors to get the product out of; meaning you might not get a refund by returning it without it's packaging!!Mitigate your losses and just send me 1/2 the cost in cash.  That way you only lose 50% instead of the whole price plus shipping.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "yo yo well", "ReviewID": "RE7Y8CB15HGCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is in good condition but I can't get it to work while the SD card is inserted.
