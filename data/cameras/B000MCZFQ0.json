Shaffer \"shmopsi\"", "ReviewID": "R9SMXB4NW3BZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This a great camera among a field of choices from other manufacturers like Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Olympus and Casio. The Fuji has a number of unique features that set it apart from this field, the CCD size being one of the main features. Fuji uses a 1/1.6 Super HR CCD which is the largest CCD in the field. The only others that come close (and they are not Super HR) is the Canon SD900 at 1/1.8 (this is 10 MP) and then Casio at 1/1.75 (also 10 MP). If you do the math you will discover that the Fuji's CCD is the largest and this provides you with sensational pictures with fine detail and richly saturated natural colors and there was no detectable difference with the number of megapixels. I had occasion to compare both the Fuji and the Canon SD900 and the differences in the photos was quite noticeable. They both produced great results, but when I compared the pictures together, the Fuji produced a much better photo with more accurate color rendition and better contrast (particularly in low light conditions). The Canon was also $100 more (it does have a titanium case and 10 MP), slightly thicker and no battery life indicator. Some of the other features are SD card AND xD card capability, it can take a flash and no flash picture at the same time, face detecction focusing (which worked faster and more accurately than the Canon SD900), fast start-up and a plethora of scene modes from which to choose. I found mine at Costco for $269.99 and I'm quite happy with it.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing Perfromance for its Class", "Author": "Thomas E. Tweedel", "ReviewID": "RJKWNSNTTUXQ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I was looking to get a new Point and Shoot digital camera I went into the store looking for a Fuji F30/F31 for its manual controls, low light and seemingly infinite battery life. They didn't have the F31 but the salesman convinced me to get the F40fd instead. So far I would have to say \"wow\" this is an amazing little camera. From standards of performance its not quite an SLR of the 6-8mp generation but its closer to those than other PNS.Over a year ago I bought an Olympus Stylus 720SW. Amazingly durable, can go where other cameras fear to tread but I was not impressed with its other aspects. It still had three shortcomings of other PNS cameras I've used. Slow, low light issues and poor battery life. I could live with that for fact that you can go swimming with it. But for those times when a dip in the pool wasn't on the agenda but the SLR was overkill I wanted something more. So that left me going home from the camera store with the Fuji.OverviewIts got tech specs out the wazoo, so lets focus on the highlights. Its an 8 mp camera, you can reduce image size to 4mp and .3MP (VGA). At the 8MP setting it has two compression settings for its JPGS, the higher setting (more compression, more pictures) seems just fine. That gives you somewhere in the neighborhood of 500/shots per Gig of card space.Its got a number of different shooting modes, most of them access from a command wheel in the upper right hand corner. There is a lot here to choose from and its nice because it mostly eliminates the need to go menu diving to get what you want.So lets take a trip around the dial. It starts with Auto which is the classic don't think, just shoot. It has the \"image stabilization\" mode which is just and ISO boost. It decreases shutter speed but at a cost of picture quality.Then there is the Natural Light function. This is nice because it's a quick means of turning off the flash and bumping up the ISO to the appropriate levels that you would have to do to get a good ambient light photo.Then there is SP1, SP2 which are similar to the \"scene\" modes found on other cameras. Once you've got into SP1/2 you'll do a little menu diving to get the \"scene\" you want (night shot/landscape/fireworks etc). But once its done it remembers and with two SP settings you can switch back and forth between them.Then there is the natural light with flash. I cute feature takes two shots in rapid succession, one with flash one without. Not sure if it looks better with flash or ambient? Use this and take both.Then there is the \"Manual\" setting. On this you can set your ISO and white balance to fine tune your look if you know what your doing.There is the Movie mode 640x480 at 30FPS. Eats a Gig in about 15 minutes, it's a .AVI file. Can't zoom while shooting the movie. Decent quality though.Other controls include the play button and the usual 4 way rocker pad. There is also the \"Fuji\" button that gives you access to the a couple of controls in manual mode as well as the \"IRSimple\" which lets you exchange data via IR with other equipped Fuji cameras. Maybe in camera photo sharing is big in Japan but it left me asking \"why\".UPDATE- My mom got a Fuji F40FD, so I got to try out the IRSimple Mode. You put both cameras in that mode, set one to send, one to receive and they transfer a picture in a second or two. PRetty quick and easy. However it only works ONE picture at a time and doesn't work for movies. So much for sharing your photos instantly after the trip..It is what it is, I don't find it very useful though.There is a button to enable/disable face detection. Kind of cool feature, it detects faces and locks onto them as the focal point. When it works it looks like you've locked a missile onto your target. It works ok as long as there pretty much looking straight at you. Off angle it isn't much help.Finally there is a disp button that controls what info goes up on the LCD and a few other things.Overall the controls seem reasonably well laid out, a lot of real estate goes to some not commonly used functions but the command wheel makes up for it.The F40fd can take either XD memory cards or SD memory cards. That's great because XD is proprietary format used by Fuji/Olympus and it sucks compared to other formats (its slow and expensive). But there is a gotcha. It can only handle SD cards up to 2 gigs in size. Still an SD card is half to 2/3 the cost of an XD. I still use XD because of my Olympus. I use a Type M 2G card and it works fine, full video, no hangups.UPDATE 2-15-08Fuji released a firmware update (1.01) which will presuambly ship with all new units. It allows you to use SDHC cards up to 4G in size. So you can now use XD (2g tops) SD (2g tops) or SDHC (4g tops)The screen (2.5 inch LCD) is really nice. Its got excellent off angle viewing. You can be off to the side and still frame your shot. The pictures look in play mode. One gripe with that is that the zoom in play mode (where you zoom up to see detail) is rather slow.Ok, enough of that, how does it shoot. For a point and shoot its amazing. To be fair I shoot most of my stuff with a Nikon D-70 and I have not extensively used with current generation Nikon/Canon PNS cameras. But from what I have seen the Fuji is in another class.One of the dreaded features of a PNS camera is the shutter lag. You push the button and then wait, and wait, and wait for it to take the picture. By then the kids moved and the shot is wasted. The Fuji is a LOT faster than others I've used. Not quite SLR speed but in the same neighborhood. It very quickly focuses (or not). The AF system is reasonably accurate. Its not perfect, expect some out of focus shots, but with the faster speed you'll have a higher % of keepers. Switching to the continuous autofocus may help, haven't tried that yet. But the speed is amazing for that class of camera.Another big claim to fame for this is its ablility to handle low(er) light conditions than others of its class. It does this by increasing the ISO. This makes the sensor more sensitive but also adds \"noise\" which degrades image quality. The Fuji can go from ISO 100 to ISO 2000. ISO 2000 is insane for little cameras. Of course just because you can doesn't mean you should.Generally speaking its pretty good up to ISO 800. 100-200-400 are fine, no real gripes in image quality. I've seen some ISO 100-200 images that are \"wow\" quality. Sharp, smooth and looking as good as they would have out of my SLR. ISO 400 for the most part is pretty good, if you look you'll find flaws but not at a glance. ISO 800 is Ok. When used in combination with the flash (which it does frequently) they look great. By themselves in natural light things can start to de-rez. At ISO 1600 things start to fall apart. A good chunk of those images are \"well I guess its better than nothing\". At ISO 2000 it falls off a cliff. They suck. Its an image.Something unique (that I've seen) to the Fuji is the character of the noise. Normally noise looks like TV static that congeals into ugly blotches. The noise on the Fuji is different. When the noise builds its like the picture De-rezzes into some impressionistic watercolor. Its more of a dithering pattern than static. It some ways it makes the image more pleasing (or rather less objectionable) but it also makes the image softer, faster.Still for a camera of this class the ISO performance is phenomenal. Most PNS cameras are pretty ugly at ISO 400.So to recapPro's-Fast - Fasted picture taker I've ever seen in this classGood Low Light - Best in class performanceImage Quality - A cut above what I'd expectBattery Life - Rated at 300, I got about 350 with a lot of playing around.Cons -Image stabilization - Really just an ISO boost, costs quality, doesn't help when your already at high ISO.Slow Zoom in Playback mode - No real biggieConclusion-This is a GREAT point and shoot camera. Its got a lot going for it and no serious issues for a camera of this class. It really is an advancement in terms of speed and image quality at a very reasonable price. If your looking for a something to capture life's little moments this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fuji F40fd fastest P&S; camera!", "Author": "newjourney2006 \"newjourney2006\"", "ReviewID": "R2V525XUE03SKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm Finepix F40fd (F45fd) is the fastest low light P&S; camera I can buy at this time (Nov 20,2007). Before I review, let me say a THANK YOU, to all who do post their reviews, because I have read them ALL, and a really big THANK YOU to Steves-Digicams and the CNET staff, who test and provide shutter speeds with flash. Since October I have been researching to find the fastest (for fast moving small kids) low light (for evening indoor pictures) P&S; camera. I also know 99.9% of my prints will be 4x6 or 5x7, never bigger. And I want the red-eye reduction to work! I refuse to do touch-ups.I have visited all local stores (BestBuy, CircuitCity, Target, Sears, Frys, Wolf, Office Depot & Max, Staples) multi-times to play with all cameras. Yes, I am retired and have the time. Plus I reviewed all CNET P&S; reviews from 1/25/07 to 11/15/07. I documented speeds of low contrast shutter and shot 2 shot with flash. From my research, the final candidates, based on low light speeds, were Fuji F40fd, Canon SD 800, 850, 870(*).* Interesting the Canon SD870 specs say it should be as fast as the 850, but comparing 850 vs 870 under store lights, at 2 different BB stores, the 850s were noticeable faster. I even had the salesperson swap the batteries, between the two, just to be sure.I purchased the Fuji F45fd and Canon SD850(later returned). I borrowed a CanonSD800 and had my Canon A610. Without question the Fuji was the fastest for evening indoors pictures. The Fuji was also the fastest for flash recharge. The Canons 800 & 850 did missed some small kids indoors action shots. All cameras had the same brand 2Gb 150x SD. After a week I printed all the shots, as 4x6s, from the same store, as different orders with different names, to ensure no pictures were mixed.The Canon SD800 had too many red-eyes. My old A610 was to slow for evening indoor shots. For outdoor daylight shots, all 4 cameras had the same speed results.Overall the 4x6s quality was the same between the Fuji F45 & Canon SD850. Comparing two very similar pictures, sometimes one would be a slight plus over the other, when you looked close up, then on another picture the other camera would be a slight better, but no real difference. The Fuji was set to 4M(2304x1728 pixels) A5 size, approx. 980Kb files. The Canon SD850 was set to M2(2048x1536 pixles) A5 size, with medium(fine) compression, approx. 893Kb files.The Canons do have a better long range zoom, at MAX zoom. If your need is for enlarge crops, the Canon AUTO pictures are taken at lower ISO, then the Fuji, see comparison below. I also tested the Canon SD850 with different ISOs in low light conditions. It was at the manual ISO 1600, that the Canon was as fast as the Fuji AUTO(ISO800), but the Canon(1600) pictures had higher noise.Here are the ISO results, taken with AUTO mode. I believe this to be very important to understand the results. The listed numbers will first be Fuji F40(F45) then Canon SD850.AUTO mode:Evening indoors F@800, C@200Outdoors 10pm Christmas Lights F@800, C@250Outdoors bright sun, at min zoom F@100, C@80Outdoors bright sun, at max zoom F@100, C@160Outdoors cloudy F@200, C@80Conclusion:NO one camera is perfect for all people or all conditions!!!!!Fuji F40/F45 is for those who want a fast, low light, small simple P&S; camera, whose prints will usually be normal size(4x6,5x7). It is the BEST P&S; available today, to capture fast moving kids indoors. I also appreciate the battery indicator.Canon SD850 is a great P&S; choice for more outdoors(vs indoors) or indoor adults (vs kids) pictures, or if you usually print pictures bigger then normal size.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "NICE CAMERA WHICH TAKES SHARP 8MP PICTURES", "Author": "T. Lin \"rlin83\"", "ReviewID": "R36AQ8ZPQNPVSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many people who gave negative reviews on this camera have unrealistic expectations - this is a $190 camera which will NOT perform miracles under dim light situation without flash.  Its DOES NOT have wide angle, IS, manual mode, or super zoom.  However, it is compact and takes very sharp, colorful, and detailed pictures with usable ISO up to 800.  It also takes excellent MACRO shots.  It will give you better pictures than most other $190 cameras on the market as long as you learn how to use this camera and know its limitations.PROS- Takes colorful, very sharp, and detailed pictures - if your picture is not sharp you probably have a defective camera.- Fast focus with minimal shutter lag- Usable ISO up to 800 - at ISO 800 it beats most of the small compact cameras on the market except Fuji's own F20/30/31FD.- ISO 1600 and ISO 2000 are reserved for emergency use only but I have a few shots that are usable even at those ISO settings- Takes EXCELLENT macro shots, even with flash - I have not found any Canon that can take flash macro as good as this one.  Great for taking pictures for Ebay.- Beautiful 2.5 inch high resolution LCD, usable even under bright sunny days.- In contrast to some other reviewers, for me the Face Detection works very well and really optimizes the exposure on human faces (not animals)- Compact in size yet easy to hold steady with two hands, unlike some smaller SONY cameras I have tried.CONS- No real image stabilization (IS) - then again there are many cameras under $200 do not have IS either.  Fortunately this camera is easy to hold steady.- DO NOT TRUST THE AUTO MODE - it has the tendency to push ISO past ISO800, resulting in noisy shots.  Instead, use the M mode, set Auto ISO at 400 or 800, picture quality at 8MP FINE.  Or use the PORTRAIT mode which automatically sets Auto ISO at 400.- Little slow writing to SD card.- Limits to 2 pictures continuously- Some tendency to underexpose at times - learn to dial +1/3 exposure compensation at times- No live histogram- Some very faint noise at low ISO especially when you blow up the picture to view at 1:1 pixel level - then again why would you want to view your picture at pixel level anyway?Overall, for the price of $190 this is a very good camera especially for social settings because of its face detection optimizes exposure to human faces - for optimal result use the M mode and set Auto ISO at 400 or 800 or just use the Portrait Mode (Auto ISO 400).  Finally, set picture quality at 8MP FINE.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Probably the ONLY compact cameras with good ISO 400 shooting", "Author": "Hafharhrhr Amalmahay \"guitar guy\"", "ReviewID": "RN7L09J32DA54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is one overriding fact: The Fuji F-series is the only compact camera series that you can use at anything over ISO 100 and expect good results. People don't realize that even ISO 200 on pretty much ANY other small camera is pretty bad. With the F40fd, ISO 400 looks quite decent and even 800 isn't too bad. This is EXTREMELY important and rare, and overshadows any other failings a camera may have - which in this case are few.The F41fd is also quite a bargain. It is not an SLR, you are simply not going to get that kind of control and image quality in a small moderately priced camera right now. But it's about as close as you can get.Also, at this point this lesser model may still be a better choice than the newer F51 and F100.These newer cameras went up to a ridiculous 12 megapixels. This simply makes no sense on a camera and lens system this small and inexpensive. (My new SLR is only 10mp!) Much better to stay with a lower pixel count (larger pixel size) for better ISO performance. The F40fd hits a very good compromise with 8mp. Also, unlike the earlier F30 or F31, it takes SD cards rather than silly xD cards.Now, don't be that tempted by the later models just because of image stabilization. I would rather just have good high ISO first and foremost. My SLR has built in IS, but guess what: people still move a little bit and get blurry, and IS is not going to help that. High ISO will allow a faster shutter speed that WILL help. So camera makers would be well advised to pour a lot more effort into high ISO performance rather than IS.The screen is lovely, and the video mode is actually pretty usable. The battery, true, is a little lower capacity than previous F series, but it's still a big battery and much better than a lot of other compact cameras.At this point, for me at least, I believe the F40fd is probably the best point and shoot you can buy, regardless of cost, simply because it's the best blend of resolution, high ISO performance, and good performance and features in a camera this size.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Camera... overall", "Author": "H.

Indoors under normal lighting it will default to 800, when 200 or 400 will do just fine. Outdoors it'll default to 200 when 100 is fine. The higher the ISO, the less light you need, but in general the quality goes down as you get higher. It's a testament to Fuji's technology that you can still get good pictures at ISO 800 or even 1600. Most top compact cameras won't give you good pictures above ISO 200! As a result, this is a great camera to use to take indoor pictures in low light. Also, the flash recycle time is fast (*coughCanoncough*), another bonus when taking indoor shots.What about situations when the lighting is fine? In these cases, the Auto mode produces worse pictures than you can otherwise get. In these situations, I highly recommend changing the ISO settings to Auto(400)--this means it automatically sets the ISO but doesn't go higher than 400--or 100 for outdoor settings. Then you'll get good pictures.For those intimidated by ISO settings, don't worry. I was too, but this camera is so easy to use! You don't have to go through a gazillion menus to change settings. Really, don't be intimidated by the fact that you'll need to set the ISO yourself to get the best pictures. The camera makes it super-simple. It's also a great way to learn about ISO's and test out different ones to see what works best. When you review the pictures, it gives you the ISO information right on the screen.The scene settings are quite good. The portrait setting, for instance, automatically lowers the default ISO and adds nice colors to your subjects' faces. It's easy to set a scene setting because they're all spelled out in plain English rather than icons. This is a good alternative for people who want to take better pictures than they would in Auto mode without fiddling around with the ISO and color settings.Other tips:1. If you're taking pictures of people, make sure the face detection mode is on. There's a button for it on the camera, so you don't have to go through any menus. Turning face detection on makes a big difference, in my experience.2. I like saturated colors and slight pinkish tones when photographing people. Therefore I like to have the camera set to Chrome Color when taking pictures of people.3. There's a setting under Power Management that lets you auto-focus more quickly (this is different from the Auto mode; all pictures on this camera use auto-focus). It uses more battery, but if you have someone take your picture for you, you should use this setting. In my experience, people tend to just press the button without waiting for it to focus. If you use this setting, it'll focus more quickly, so it's likely to be focused by the time the button goes all the way down. It's best, of course, to tell the person to press the button halfway to let it focus before pressing it all the way.4. Choose to have your picture numbers renewed. I find it annoying for a picture number to jump from 20 to 38 when I download it on my computer because I deleted 17 pictures. With this setting, it re-numbers the pictures when you delete one after taking it.Conclusion: If you take pictures indoors or in low light, especially without flash (such as taking pics of a baby), then this is a good camera for you. It's also a nice camera in general for indoor shots, but for well-lit indoor shots and all daytime outdoor shots, I suggest using the scene settings or setting the ISO yourself because the default will be too high. That might sound scary, but the camera is so user-friendly (everything spelled out in plain English rather than weird icons, no intimidating button-overload, no having to go through a bunch of menus to do things) that you'll get the hang of it right away!EDIT: After trying a Canon PowerShot A710 IS, I appreciate the F40fd so much more. The A710 takes better outdoor shots, no doubt. The A710 also has much better image stabilization ,which is very useful for me because I don't have steady hands. (The F40fd doesn't have \"real\" image stabilization built into the camera.) The F40fd pictures tend to turn out fuzzy unless I use a tripod, but my father, who has steady hands, tried it and the pictures turned out fine.But the F40fd's flash blows the A710 away. Its range is far longer--21.3 feet versus 11 feet! The F40fd flash is also more balanced. With the A710, the object/person right in front of you is overexposed, while everything else is dark. I tried several settings based on advice from the manual and internet and got the same result. I couldn't believe that the F40fd's flash didn't overpower or overexpose the least bit given its power. Also, the F40fd's flash recycle time is about 5 times faster than the A710's, so you can take shot after shot with flash.The F40fd's unmatched performance at high ISO's makes it even better for indoor shots, and the colors are less stark than the A710's. I cannot think of a better camera to take to a dinner or party. It's small (about the same size as the Canon SD series) and takes spectacular indoor shots. If you want to take primarily outdoor shots, however, you could do better.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "An affordable pocket backup when you don't want to hawl DSLR around", "Author": "Gang Wu \"Newswolf\"", "ReviewID": "RT93LWT4PHBVN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Digital camera-wise, I started with a Fuji S304 seven years ago after a couple years with a DSL camera Canon 50E.

But thank goodness, it's these \"backup\" little cams that helped me record most of the candit street shots in the everything-can-happen New York City.You'll have a better idea what a Fuji F40fd performans if I compare it to other cameras I've used.Warning: Don't compare it to any DSLR, the small CCD can never be on par with its big brothers. A F40's ISO 400 is only close to a Nikon D40's iso1600. Also, don't expect much from a lens small like the pocket cameras', the worst DSLR lens (including Sigma's or Tamron's) is much better than a point-and-shoot's.Compared with its earlier version, F20, the F40 has advanced in everything but iso performance.1. thinner body. Now it really feels like a pocket cam, as the F20 is still a little bit too thick.2. Larger and better LCD. I don't want to talk about numbers, but the F40 has a larger LCD. And most importantly, the number of pixels is much more than the F20's, and the view angle is much wider. Result, no more low-definition picture like that on a F20, and you can chimp from all angles now.3. Faster response in starting, focusing and reviewing pictures. You just feel it's a lighter and swifter camera.4. At last, the cons. ISO performance is a full stop lower than F20. I tested them side by side with the same settings, and the F40 with more mega-pixels (which I hate, I don't need that many pixels crammed into such a small CCD) just showed more grains and noises. F40's iso 800 is close to F20's iso 1600. This is the biggest disppointment for me, because at first I was exited to see F40 be equipped with Auto ISO 800 and 1600 (F20 only has Auto iso limit on either 400 or 1600, missing the 800 step that I consider the best compromising spot between speed and picture quality)Anyway, though F40 is not as good as F20 in ISO, it's still better than many cameras of other brands, including Canon and Nikon. My friends' Canon SD870 and SD1000 show worse noises on high iso.Conclusion: good colors consistent of Fuji taste, relatively good iso, an affordable foolproof pocket camera for candit shots. But if you are serious with photography, try any entry-level DSLR of Canon, Nikon, Olympus or Sony, you'll see a difference wider than from heaven to earth.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Pro Inspiron", "ReviewID": "RDLTWJ5KB1EEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on this camera before the purchase and was not sure which is better between Canon SD1000 and this one.

Seems as though this preference has been transferred to its digital world.Other reviewers have commented on the difficulty of working/learning the camera.  I actually found it to be quite intuitive and didn't mind the lack of a view finder.  My main fear was that it's so slim I was afraid of accidentally dropping it so I made sure the strap was securely on my wrist before taking it out of the case.  Battery is pretty strong and lasted for a whole day of shooting.  As a precaution I brought a spare and simply recharged at nite.I would not recommend this camera for outdoor shots (although enough experience allowed me to take a few decent ones with it but I still missed my Canon) and certainly not distance shots (obviously). Take another camera with you that can handle those because after all, there's only so much that can be crammed into small packages regardless of the adage of how it's used vs size.  However, if you must only take one camera due to weight/packing considerations, I'd suggest a possible compensation by maxing out the quality for photos taken which seemed to help me even though it decreased my 2 gig memory card capability to only 800 some odd photos.I'd advise a purchasing not only a spare battery but a spare memory card in this case.Overall, I'm really glad I got this.

The image is significantly better than my old Canon A520 (4 megapixel) under low light.  However, the Canon produced better images under good outdoor lighting.  The button interface on the Fuji camera is easy to use (I prefer it over Canon's), but Fuji' software for downloading photos from the camera to a PC is amazingly dumb.  During each download, Fuji's software creates a single new folder named with the date that you are downloading the photos (by contrast, Canon's software creates multiple new folders named with the dates that the photos were taken).  Fuji's software then downloads ALL photos on the camera into this single folder, regardless of whether certain photos have previously been downloaded or not.  You cannot select which photos to download; it's all-or-nothing.  To prevent the camera from repeatedly downloading the same photos, you must either delete these photos from the camera after each download or manually force the download into a previous folder that already contains these photos (the software will not download a picture if it sees the the same picture already exists in the download folder).  After being accustomed to using Canon's software in the past, I'm amazed that Fuji's software is so backward.

The controls are easier to use, looking at recently taken photographs is done with the touch of a button instead of the tedious flip of a switch, reviewing photos is much nicer, and the ability to look at photographs by date taken is very nice. There's even a slideshow feature for when you show your pictures to others before you have downloaded them to your PC.Speaking of downloading pictures, this is one place where I feel disappointed. My biggest complaint is that I am not allowed to organize my photographs the way I want to on the computer. I am forced to use Fuji's folder structure and naming convention. If I choose otherwise I will have the same photographs being downloaded twice: once where I moved them initially, and a second time where the software wants them to go (again!).

The features were incredible, more than I thought I could afford. Came home and after doing a little digging found out that the P40fd and P45fd were the same camera, just packaged for different markets. The P40fd has so many great features such as face recognition that truly helps make your pics better. The flower setting has helped me take pics of my garden that will be even more appreciated in Jan and Feb. And, even though the dogs run away when they see me with the camera, I can still get great shots of them! There is a setting that takes 2 pics at once, one with flash and one without. You make the call as to which is the best. You can change ISO settings, which I learned thru another review can make a big difference in how your pics turn out. The instruction manual looks intimidating at first (it's chunky), but everything is laid out so that even the \"instruction challenged\" can follow along easily (there are illustrations, too). Ordering on Amazon was, as usual, awesome. I got a free 2G SD card when I ordered, and I saved over $80 on this purchase (price of camera, no tax, no shipping, free SD card) I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for great value, a great camera, and lots of good times taking pictures.

Most of my photos are very sharp with accurate color.  The flash is a good, strong (intelligent) flash... I think quite strong for a small camera.  This might also be the reason I have not noticed any red-eye in my flash photos.3) Uses SD memory cards as well as XD cards (like my Fuji S700).4) Battery life is very good and the camera has a battery-life indicator.5) The speed in taking a photo is .6 (or 6/10) of a second without prefocus and .1 (or 1/10) of a second when prefocused - Tested the camera on shooting-digital's online test page.The only thing I regret about this camera is the lack of an optical viewfinder. At times, it would be helpful when taking photos in bright sunlight, but this camera has so many pluses, I can live without it.

The main reason to go with f40 was low light capability. I regret I bought this camera. It doesn't mean that it awfully bad, but it is not up to any my expectations.The Good:Camera is light and relatively small. Image quality at first time looks OK. Battery life is OK. Speed is just OK. Low light performance is better that other small cameras, but not significant.The Bad:At low light picture quality became really bad, starting at ISO800, do not expect any miracles here. So basically this camera give me advantage of one stop over other cameras via ISO, but if you would use competitor's camera with good Image Stabilizing (3 stop for instance in Canon systems) you will get advantage in 2 stops over f40fd at low light. So one stop advantage of F40FD benefit me only in case of shooting sport event only, when high speed is needed and extra step in ISO can help.But what is really bad in this camera it is processing artifacts. If you look at picture at good quality monitor, you will see that colors are not smooth at all. The sky looks dirty. If you magnify picture you will understand why. Color is not smooth, but has multiple angular artifacts. If you apply any sharpening, picture became just plain ugly. Sharpening makes artifacts really sharp, and they pop up. If you print only small pictures, it will not be a problem for you, but if you are watching pictures on monitor, it is a big issue.Another huge issue (for me) it is dust on sensor. I already had dust on sensor and it was fixed under warranty. I have it again. I keep my camera in a pocket (this is pocket camera by definition) and small dust particles get inside of camera via power and USB port (even they closed by robber). The camera has open gaps over these ports, so any dust gets here easily. What is stupid design and total disaster for me.

As a graphic designer I'm a stickler for picture quality. Initially the  photos seemed a little soft but as I continued to use the camera, the quality got better. Maybe a bit of a break in period is necessary, but now I am very pleased with color, clarity, shadow detail and sharpness. Actually this camera takes better pictures than my $1000 Nikon, especially in low light situations without flash. Hard to believe but true. Build quality and ease of use are excellent. The only negative is shooting in the sun without a viewfinder. Although the large LCD is bright and clear, sunlight on the surface makes it very hard to see your subject.This is a camera you can carry with you most of the time and trust to give you good to excellent on-the-fly results.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to all the hype and I just returned it.8.3MP? Where are they?Biggest problem:The photos are definitely not sharp, my old 2.1MP Fujifilm F401 took photos with better exposure, better color, and seemingly better resolution. So what gives? I have absolutely no idea. I've read reviews saying how sharp the photos are from this camera. I definitely do not see it. Even with the camera on a flat surface taking a photo in the timer mode with flash, so you know the camera is not moving and has enough light.The F-series apparently has some special type of dithering it does to the photos (If you zoom in you can see this) that makes it where you can't sharpen them after the fact, because when you try, the sharpening doesn't make any difference, and actually makes the photos worse.With the old F401 it worked great, cuz it made sharp 2.1MP photos and the dithering didn't matter because you didn't have to sharpen the photos. Unfortunately with the F40fd, not only are the 8.3MP photos not as sharp as the old 2.1MP F401 photos, they still have that same dithering pattern so you can't sharpen them. You just get lots of extra pixels of useless data. I wonder if there are just serious problems with this new high-megapixel sensors. They are lower quality, but Fuji has no choice since nobody would buy a camera with the better, lower megapixel sensor??Yeah, I guess this camera has great sensitivity for low-light photos, but if the flash and outdoor photos are horrible; what's the point unless you feel like lugging around two cameras!The old F401 exposed perfectly and the color always looked great. Flash photos on the F40fd have a yellowish hue and are always overexposed. (At a relatively close distance -- say 6 ft away which is for me a normal distance for flash photos of people). Yeah, I tried putting it in manual and lowering exposure compensation; then they were too dark and grainy! My old 2.1MP F401 never had any problems like this.The highly touted \"face-detection\" doesn't work most of the time; it seemed relatively useless to me. If the face is well lit and looking right at you it MIGHT work, but since it is so unreliable, 90% of the time it's useless!In trying to solve the problem of over and underexposed photos, I tried the manual mode with the spot setting for exposure; it did nothing as if it was still on the non-working multi exposure mode.Also, you can't zoom while making a video and the M-JPEG makes larger files than cameras offering MP4 videos.Lots of hype, but nothing delivered. Why can't we get high-resolution photos that are sharp? I think the people reviewing this camera have never used one of the older lower resolution cameras that took such better photos.The other day I was looking at some old 1930's photos that were taken on slides and converted to JPG files. It blew my mind how much better these old photos looked compared to photos taken on the Fujifilm Finepix F40fd. You'd think photo quality would have come along in 75 years, but I have to honestly say, the photo quality of the 1930's photos BLOWS away any from this camera.What a disappointment.
