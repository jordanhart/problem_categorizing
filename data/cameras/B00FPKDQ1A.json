Fuji appear to have used an even smaller, new battery (NP-48) in the XQ1! However, there are no additional batteries available for purchase anywhere which suggests this product may have been rushed to market.* Flimsy plastic cover for micro USB port. There is no external battery charger provided so you have to charge batteries in-camera and open a flimsy plastic cover on the side of the camera to connect the charger cable provided. Given the poor battery life I am concerned this cover will not stand repeated use. As for additional batteries, there are no external chargers yet available for the new NP-48 battery so you have no choice but to use in-camera charging.* Memory Card Read Errors with in-camera Playback. I bought a brand new SD card (for the benefit of the person who asked in the comments whether this was an \"el-cheapo\" card, it was not: Transcend 16GB UHS-1 600X Ultimate), formatted this in the XQ1 and could not playback pictures on the camera, instead I received a memory card error. A different memory card (also not \"el-cheapo\" - a SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro) worked fine for a few pictures then repeatedly came up with a read error when I attempted to playback pictures in camera. Posts in fuji camera forums show others have reported similar memory card read errors with Fuji cameras. I may have just been unlucky, and others may not have this experience, but I did not want to run the risk that even with repeated reformatting or new cards this problem would appear again so returned the XQ1.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better pictures for near-similar-footprint as the Canon s120.", "Author": "Ynotw84me2day", "ReviewID": "R1213VMGINLLJO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A brief review of the XQ1 coming from a previous ownership of Canon s120.The larger sensor truly helps in color rendition and details.  I've shot the XQ1 indoors at night w/ 60w lightbulb, as the only light source, and it simply maintains color clarity and noise control at its recommended ISO 800 (or lower) setup (during Aperture Mode).My old canon s120 was nosier/grainer at the same iso.  I'm thinking the XQ1's absence of the AA filter also helps (though I'm not an expert on this).Other features that I also liked:  Panorama on-the-fly (closest to flawless function behind Sony's cameras), fast focus, and multishot trick for lowlite clarity.  All of which (in my opinion) works much better than the Canon s120.Negatives (compared to the s120):Touchscreen, button assignment for on-the-fly Custom White Balance, and battery power.  I sometimes tapped the screen thinking that I could direct the focus square without having to go through the menu (tracking focus), only to realize that the XQ1 does not do touchscreen!Just like the tracking focus feature located in the XQ1's submenu system, the Custom White Balance is also arranged the same way.  Why Fuji couldn't include a (E-FN) button assignment to SPECIFICALLY snap a Custom White Balance shot, similar to Canon s120, is beyond my comprehension.  The E-FN function button can't even assign a category for custom white balance!  You have to push the menu button, browse through folder selection for white balance, then choose Custom White Balance to take a picture of your white (or grey) card.Last but not least:  The battery DOES NOT LAST very long.  The Canon s120's stamina is lasts longer than the XQ1's battery storage.Regardless of the bumps I mentioned above (and they are significant bumps)... The picture quality that it spits out is a TRUE UPGRADE from my s120.  And picture quality (video too) was my main reason for choosing (and keeping) the XQ1.  My decision was also enforced by the $400 price tag (purchased from Cameraland through ebay) which was much lower than the manufacturer's overpriced figure.Until, of course, a better point-n-shoot comes out, that does not break the bank like the RX100 series.

I got it for my wife and we went out shooting yesterday around town, and the results were absolutely amazing. The WiFi also works great, where we were able to look at the images on our high resolution tablet while having coffee with no need for cables or any other devices. The battery charging mechanism also is great, since you can use a computer if you don't have your charger with you.The image quality, dynamic range, bracketing options, included filters and film simulation modes make it a great fun camera to learn the basics of photography in a very small package.I highly recommend it if it is within your budget range.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "Matt Eye \"Matthew\"", "ReviewID": "R31P1K4HVYG4TR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*** Some comparisons mentioned regarding Sony RX100 and Nikon P7700/P7800 in this review. ***The Fujifilm XQ1 does not compare to Sony RX100 (after all, the CyberShot is quite a bit pricier--good for the price and compact). However, it has phase detection + contract detection autofocus for the photography, but the video quality and performance is a different story, why the product given four out of five stars. Image quality is close to the Nikon P7700 (have the P7800 and sold the predecessor recently). However, at base ISO, in good outdoor lighting conditions; Nikon's out of camera JPEG images look cleaner (not 'jagged') and thus better detail through ISO 800, something that Fuji's X-Trans sensor without the optical low-pass filter proves more hype than actuality. Autofocus has a tendency to fail when lighting is too even (especially placed on a table indoors, when shooting through a window, etc.). An icon appears on the screen, followed by a beep, where the camera warns the autofocus is not phasing properly (the red square in the middle of the display).Yes, videos look noisy and plagued with triangular-style dithering compression (hey, that's my eyes), and the zoom motor gives an unwanted scratchy motor noise. Sound quality is good in general.Controls and features. Menu system is average, similar to Nikon. It has only two internal microphones, HDMI socket on bottom next to battery/memory card compartment, and USB socket on right of camera. On top of camera, dedicated movie record button (you can shoot one decent still in video mode but will not be at full-resolution; not several as you can with RX100). Shutter button has two levels--press down to focus, and down further to take the shot. Most of the body (camera made in China) is of metal (at least the silver model, which I bought mine on eBay through Adorama Camera). The buttons (except mode dial--made of metal) and battery cover are made of plastic. Not as flimsy as reviewers commonly say about this model, and Sony CyberShot.I think that there could be a firmware update should correct the autofocus issue (does hunt a lot in video). Everything else seems fine.Perhaps Adobe CC (Creative Cloud) should open the RAF (RAW) files other than the software bundled with the camera.For the price, this camera is good for typical photography of parties and families, and is a bit more compact than the RX100. Even though the XQ1 is (still) quite a rare compact camera to feature phase detection, where it outdoes the Sony with low-light photography, and the F1.8 lens is so bright that even nighttime photographs look a bit overexposed. This may help with performance, but ISO 800 at night looks like ISO 6400 with noise reduction set to -2 on the Sony RX100.That said, XQ1 pales in comparison to Sony for photo and video quality, although for still a rather larger-than-average sensor in a pocket-friendly body for a couple of hundred dollars less, the XQ1 is good for its price, features, and quality. Yes, what I mean by that is the build is on par with other compacts of today, but this, if used as a photography tool, is easily better image quality than Panasonic's DSC-ZS series, but if you are more interested in small-medium prints at low-ish ISO and very good video at this price point, the Panasonic is a better option. Overall, Sony is the best of both worlds--photos and videos--but without even knowing that you might find that high-end RX100 a bit of sticker shock.Pros: Good image quality at base ISO, maybe ISO 200 (indoor photography is OK but incandescent lighting--see cons). Well made. More responsive menu navigation than Sony. Internal memory (66 MB) that RX100 has none. Good for the money.Cons: Weak video quality. Erratic auto white balance (RX100 does not have any problem with indoor lighting without the flash; XQ1 with a yellow cast when photographing a computer monitor--on--in typical office lighting, for instance). Sometimes cross-type focus point cannot focus in some conditions (phase detection is faster but less accurate that contrast). Noisy zoom unlike Sony. Battery life is short--not even 20 minutes of video can be recorded before battery exhausted, and camera becomes very warm. Slow writing to internal memory but all camera I have used with internal memory are this way, so this con is very common.Recommended? It depends on your needs as told above. Even though I do like the XQ1, it would be better if Fujifilm releases a firmware update.

Time to fire somebody for being unable to evalute consumer needs and RX100 position", "Author": "uzevla", "ReviewID": "R3D0QVUSBT9UCN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am interested in a fast shooter for indoor/outdoor kids pictures when DSLR is not an option.RX100 comes as a natural choice here. But, once you start using it, you realize its not quite working well. Why? Capturing the right moment needs a) really fast autofocus b) quick burst so you can choose the best shoot c) ability to compose your picture quickly.a) XQ1 offers much better AF experience than RX100 but the AF has bugs. XQ1 sometimes misses to lock the focus if it cannot do it in a very short time. You can see there is something buggy in the AF engine as it sometimes fails to lock in very bright conditions. Fortunately, your camera at least fires so even without the AF lock you got your picture and the camera is ready for the next picture again. It all happens so fast that I can't say I ever missed to make the picture I wanted.b) Quick bursts ? Like 10 or 12fps ?  These are all bogus specs when it comes to indoor pics. There you need fast flash recycle speed and RX100 fails badly there. 7 sec for full recycle and 3-5 for regular recycle. This is ridiculous. Your special moment is long gone by the time RX100 flash is ready for another shoot. In contrast, XQ1 really excels here.c) Quick composition. Two important things there for me: Zoom speed and ability to shoot into the sun. Zoom speed on XQ1 is far more usable than on RX100. Shooting into the sun: Well, ability to use the flash at 1/4000 shutter speed is a killer feature. XQ1 nails it here. I just learned RX100 can do 1/2000 and that's not in the specs. Didn't know about that while I had so I could try it...Some \"less\" important features (at least when talking about shooting pictures of kids running around):d) picture quality or e) software usability when you are not in auto moded) Unfortunately, I am just not sure if XQ1 is a buy when it comes to the picture quality. Whether it's the sensor or the glass I don't know (or I got a lemon). The pictures am I getting are just not good enough to justify 450$ price tag. So much smudging of the fine details, the lack of dynamic range and many other issues. I saw some XQ1 sample images and was very impressed. That's why I bought it. Sometimes my XQ1 will take a good picture on auto mode but very rarely. And it's just a good picture, never an excellent one.RX100 being 4xx$ these days I am just not sure if I should get RX100 once again and settle with it. Taking kids pictures is not all I do after all. HDR, much better dynamic range and much better video really work in favor of RX100.e) Software. XQ1 doesn't have a single good feature you'll find in RX100, Nex, Canon S, or Fuji XF1/X100/X-E1. Pure miss when it comes to having good control over your pictures in just about any mode. Granted, RX100 is even worse but XQ1 is a newer camera so they could have copied those few good SW choices from RX100.One important detail: DSLR-like performance this camera offers means lots of pictures so you can choose few good ones. 3.6mWh battery is a complete miss. 2nd battery is around 30$ while it's 10$ for other cameras. Also, I don't want to carry a really small camera and then to carry more stuff with it. What Fuji could have done is to increase the body length by 1-2mm to fit a larger battery. Or they could have designed the camera better:  RX100 and Canon S110 seem much heavier in respect to their body volume so I would say there is some wasted space in XQ1.Fuji should fire somebody in the marketing department. That person should have know they cannot take on general population and sway them away from RX100: It's 1\" 20Mpix sensor they compete against and the outcome of this attempt is known in advance. It would be much better for Fuji if they tried to keep all the photo enthusiast by simply trying to pack X20 into the smaller package: Excellent and fast lens with 3x zoom only, no viewfinder and a few of Fn buttons. On top of that, they had enough room to make camera a bit bigger but more capable - RX100 is already substantially bigger and people call it pocketable. LX7 is also much thicker and people don't complaint as it brings in an excellent lens.By making XQ1 to look and feel like just another P&S; camera but with much higher price tag Fuji will loose to Sony, Canon and others. Amazingly stupid...Two things that still keeps me away from going back to RX100 is it's flash recycle speed and the same crappy lens quality/speed on the zoom end", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.95", "Features": "12.0 MP 2/3\" X-Trans II CMOS Sensor with Phase Detection and EXR Processor II\nBright Fujinon 4x F1.8-4.9 Optical Zoom Lens (25-100mm)\n3.0\" 920K-dot TFT color LCD\nWi-Fi\nFull HD Movies @ 60fps", "Name": "Fujifilm XQ1 12MP Digital Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wFzRMgl5L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FPKDQ1A"}}
