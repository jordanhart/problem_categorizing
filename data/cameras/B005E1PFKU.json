It's an alright camera, but once you start zooming, pictures become so grainy, even outdoors. If you don't zoom and you're inside, the pictures are still grainy.

I have to go back to where I bought it to see if a young tech savvy clerk can help explain what I need to know.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to use little camera", "Author": "Joanne Marble", "ReviewID": "RW4LFAY7H85YQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Such an easy to use camera.
