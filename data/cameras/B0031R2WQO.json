{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for Pictures, Bad for Action (GoPro) Video (Too Shaky along shaft axis!)", "Author": "Jonathan Lea", "ReviewID": "R3FVJISROG7O84", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A little background first.  The Pocket Xshot is the 3rd retractable monopod I've tried to use with my GoPro HD camera.  The first one I used was some cheap \"vidpro\" and the second being the \"quikpod compod\".  They both had the same issue of the shaft being able to rotate freely around itself.  This caused a huge problem when trying to record video while snowboarding, as the weight of the GoPro would often cause the camera to rotate along the shaft (yes I know you can record upside down but I personally do not like to do that).Enter the Pocket Xshot.  I was quite excited to see that the Pocket Xshot has these \"Channels\" running through the entire length of the telescoping shaft.  This prevents the shaft from rotating on axis!  However, the unfortunate thing about this, is that there is a bit of play along the that \"channel\", as well as a bit of play in the plastic head that's mounted in the shaft.  Now this bit of play can get quite annoying with videos, as it looks like the camera is being shaken on axis many times a second.  This isn't as apparent in 60fps mode, because the image is more smooth, but it is VERY obvious in any 30fps filming modes.This would be fine for taking pictures, as you would only need one frame for a picture.  However, if you plan on using this to record any action video, the bit of play will be too shaky for some.Note 1:  The play in the shaft will increase over time, I've noticed these \"channels\" have gotten looser over the course of the last year (from vibrating back and forth) and now the play is even more excessiveNote 2:  I ordered another new xshot, to compare the amount of free play between a new one and a used one.  The new one still has excessive play in the main joint where the plastic pivot head is connected to the metal shaftNote 3:  the small cover on the handle-end had popped off my original one.  I needed to put a self-tapping screw into the shaft to hold that cover in place.Note 4:  Seems that the company noticed that small cover popped off on the earlier models, so they are using a different cover on the newer models.  Still didn't solve the issue of the shaft having free play =(Please, if anyone can make a better suggestion on a telescoping monopod, that 1 - does not rotate along the shaft,  2 - no free play in the shaft and/or joints to prevent shaking (by use of locking joints or anything!),  3 - can fit in a pocket when retracted... PLEASE let me know.  I've been looking for one for the last 2 years and still have not found a suitable product.  The only ones I can find that have the locking shaft are regular sized monopods (minimum of 20\") which are not pocket sized!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pocket Xshot", "Author": "Karen Ann Osborne", "ReviewID": "R28VS7H05TD3JJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Anyone who owns a compact camera should own a Pocket Xshot. The features of the Pocket Xshot are already listed in Amazon's blurb so here are a few things they forgot to mention. First, this thing really works! You don't need a mirror to place yourself in the shot, just look in the lens. My husband, father-in-law, and 12 year old daughter all took well centered photos after one or two attempts.There are two groves, one on each side, of the telescoping metal of the Pocket Xshot. The groves serve to keep the device stable and prevent your camera from turning upside down as you get ready for your shot. My brother's camera extender did not perform as well.The Pocket Xshot is so small it fits easily in my purse attached to my camera. It is so light weight anyone can hold the camera upright for as long as it takes to get the perfect shot.The best thing about the Pocket Xshot is that it keeps unwanted people out of your photos. Stand in front of your chosen background and extend your camera on the Xshot. Pedestrian traffic will naturally flow around you and your camera. The Pocket Xshot eliminates the need to wait forever or ask people to stand back while you get the perfect shot.Since receiving my Pocket Xshot, I have ordered two more as gifts. You know the people who are never in the picture because they are always taking the picture? There seems to be one in every family. The ones in my family will be losing their excuse very soon. I unreservedly give this product five stars.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Go easy with it.", "Author": "Superdave", "ReviewID": "R2A9L9UFP31Y5D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First day I got it I could not wait to put it on my new GoPro...I guess I pulled on it a little too hard because it came apart in the middle.It was hard to get back together but I did.(now I know better)Now it works great.

Based on other reviews and other websites, I expected the sturdiness of this product to be marginal.  I also expected it to be feather light.  The product has some density to it, because it is made out of VERY sturdy metal.  I applied pressure to see how easy it is to bend and was unable to bend it.  Even at the narrow end, it is very wisely constructed.  Each piece is circular in shape, but has divots which add structural support.  The camera mount itself is very nice, it attaches easily without having to fumble with a coin or screwdriver like many tripods.  The angle of the camera in relation to the metal arm is also adjusable from 0 degrees to 130 degrees.  The lanyard is very nice if you just want it to dangle from your wrist like many people do with their point and shoot camera.Now the usability.  This product does exactly what it is designed to do.  It is simple to install the camera on it without using extra tools.  When ready, it extends to full length.  The until I bought is the 30\" unit.  I am about 6 feet tall, so this is pretty short, but collapsed it measures less than 6 inches, which makes it functional and discreet.  Another use of the product is that it makes a great handle for the camera.  If you are like me and occasionally (accidentally) thumb over the flash, use this device in the collapsed position as a handle.I usually travel alone, so this certainly beats having to ask random strangers for help taking a picture.  It also alleviates the risk of handing your camera to someone and having it stolen.  It took my two tries to get it to work to my desire, and the majority of the struggle was with my camera!Even if you don't travel alone, this is great for the person who is always behind the camera and never in the picture.

Because of this it will not work at all with any of my cameras (I only have Canon cameras, but am surprised that it works with other cameras since the mounting screw size is pretty much universal). I have several other tripods and monopods and all work perfectly with my cameras, but the xshot obviously uses a different thread pitch than normal and thus will not screw into the camera at all. Interestingly enough though is that the bottom hole on the xshot (which you can use to attach the xshot itself to a tripod) seems to use the standard thread pitching as I can attach the xshot itself to my existing tripod with no problem.This seems to be a great product if I could actually mount a camera to it... because of this significant flaw it is useless to me and will be going back.UPDATE: I also tried this device with a Sony HX7V camera and the screw is also the wrong size for that camera.

This is a feature others don't have which makes the XShot superior.The first one I ordered came loose and all footage got rattly. I informed Xshot and though they were not able to replace it, they did give me a complete refund with shipping both ways. I then just repurchased another one again from Amazon and it's been working well. Glue may have fixed the old one and I'll probably do that with this second one if the bracket ever comes loose again. For the time being it's working well.I use this on my Kodak Play Sport ZX3. A great matching product to the XShot is a mini fisheye wide angle lens designed for flip cams and mobile phones. Highly recommended.WHY I BOUGHT THE XSHOT:I already mentioned why I got this one specifically. I purchased this type of product for action shots while riding on a recumbent tricycle. I wanted to be able to get close shots and others at weird angles. This camera extension does the trick.HOW I USE IT:Extending it facing away, I can ride alongside other riders and get very close shots of their trike's components. I wouldn't be able to reach over and do this otherwise. I can also use this with the camera facing myself for shots this gizmo was intended for. I can also use it to extend upwards and get shots downward of crowds. People will always look up and smile wondering what that thing is!TIPS:1. Yes, it fits in the back of a cycling jersey.2. Match your camera with a neck strap and you'll have it ready to go and still be handsfree in the meantime.3. Get the fish eye lens to go with it.4. Mount the camera at an angle to the length of the extension pole and you can avoid getting your arm in the shot.

No amount of tightening would fix that.  I had to take it apart and superglue one of the pieces so it would not jiggle.  That fixed the problem.On my first outing kitesurfing, the strap ripped out, along with the stopper piece at the bottom.  Fortunately, I was in shallow water.  It's just flimsy, there is no screws holding in the stopper, its just pressed in.  Any amount of pull, and it will come out.This device is not meant for the rigors of kitesurfing.

This would have eventually led to the camera falling off the mount - not good.I was able to fix the weak mount by using slightly larger screws, and so far it seems to work OK.Now while the Nikon P7000 is a larger and heavier compact camera - it is still a compact camera, and weighs in at 12oz.  In comparison, I have a Nikon S570 that weighs 5oz, and an Olympus Tough 8010 that is 8oz.

The design was exactly what I was looking for, a colapseable pole I could use with my Gopro for snowboarding and fit in my pocket when not in use.When it arrived at my house the first thing I noticed is that the XShot felt rather flimsy and there is a good deal of play in the shaft when extended, even under the light weight of a Gopro. The metal used in the pole seems a little thin and this is likely the cause of the flimsy feeling.  By thickening the sidewalls of the pole they could make the product much sturdier without increasing its size significantly.Also, the XShot Pocket comes with an adjustable hinge on the end of the pole allowing you to adjust the camera angle up and down.  This would be a nice feature with other cameras, but the Gopro tripod mount (which must be used to attach the Gopro) does the same thing.  Having two hinges adds to the overall length of the pole, making it harder to fit in your pocket, and adds to the slop in the pole. Making this hinge removeable would have been a nice feature.  The material this hinge is made of is a lightweight plastic, and it cracked within the first day of use just under the weight of the camera (no drops or falls).  With some epoxy the XShot was again useable, but the crack continued to spread and required regluing.The third day of using the polecam two sections of the pole broke apart in my hand while I was snowboarding (again just riding, no jumps, falls, or drops).  This seems to go back to the thin metal used in the shaft.  After having this product for less than a week and having it break in two seperate instances with no abuse I was a little frustrated.Again, the concept of the product is great.  With a couple of small tweaks to the design and improving the quality of materials XShot would have a perfect product on their hands at a reasonable price.

I immediately enjoyed its ability to collapse and extend when needed, so that makes it very portable on the slopes.  However, after some use, the plastic area holding the threaded screw mount & thumb wheel developed a slight play in it.  As a result, this slight play/wobble is causing shakiness in my GoPro shots and videos.  To be fair I'm sure this is made for a less rugged and agressive use like casual point-and-shoot camera during travel trips, but just a heads-up for those of you thinking of buying this for your GoPro like I did.Update: the rubberized pad where the camera sits came off, and now I see that there are 2 screws keeping the top plastic and tightening nut together.  Now this explains where the slight play I noted above was coming from.  Over time, the weight of the camera rocking on the mount causes the plastic piece to wear away against the screws, thus the play.  There is a fix for this which is to tighten the screws yourself, or buy longer screws if the threads on the plastics are shot.  However, the design flaw (IMO) here is that the screws should have been a bolt-and-nut setup vs. just screws. Now that I know they are screws, I WILL NOT use it for my expensive cameras again as they can fail anytime.

The grip and wrist strap are great too.HOWEVER, the head is flimsy and junk.  Lots of play even out of the box.  The forward and back AND rotating play is really bad while bumping around on skis.  If you are just going to stand still and video, then no play.  The rubber piece that is supposed to lock down the female screw-on camera to the male screw of the monopod WILL fall off on you, leaving a loose connection.  You can try to rig up some concoction in place of the rubber part, but just know the head will have a lot of play no matter what you do.  It looks like the play is due to little gears that provide stops from going out of the range of motion, but the play occurs within the range of motion.  It's like the effect you get from a child-safe prescription bottle cap - it will have play with a side-to-side twist and you can move it up and down, but its on there pretty good.With that said, I am never afraid of the camera separating from the monopod while skiing with my GoPro (a big fear among all of us).  Also, the Xshot fits in my ski pants pocket great, with the GoPro camera zipped on the outside.  After bumping around, jumping, and skiing hard, the camera stayed in my pocket all day, although sometimes annoying me when my elbow collided with it.

of the two joining plastic molds that \"snapped\" apart (something INSIDE the mold kept the two parts JOINED) causing your camera to wiggle therefore causing \"shaky\" photos and/or videos.1. Great concept.2. Poorly manufactured.Over time (about 50 hours of use), the black handle came off the chrome/metal. I ALMOST lost my ContourHD camera in the ocean! As I lengthen the pole, the black handle separated from the chrome pipe. I could not put the handle back securely. The other major issue was the two plastic molds where the tripod screwed came out of - SEE VIDEO. This is a MAJOR problem and do not recommend this pole/stick because the molds joining is poorly manufactured and unable to sustain normal stress causing the joined structure to separate and your camera to wiggle at the end of the pole.

It's really cool because you can get some great angles with it, and especially if your camera shoots hd video, all of a sudden you can shoot great movies-- well, at least they entertain me..So, to get to the review, it fits in your pocket nicely, it extends to about 2 feet(guessing- I forgot to read the specs before I started writing), the sections are nice and snug so it won't collapse on you once it's open. It threads 1/4 twenty female adapters, so it should fit most cameras. I have a Canon Powershot SD940 IS and it works great with it. I also have a Drift 170 Stealth videocamera which I use for mounting on my motorcycle, and it works with that as well, and that's a bulkier camera. No problems holding it. I will say though, that the mounting fixture on the end is only plastic, which scares me a bit as far as durability. i don't know if I'll mount this to my motorcycle adapter, I'd be scared it couldn't take the high speed force. I could be wrong. Maybe in the future they could modify it with more metal parts, but that would make a heavier product to carry around.I will say that I noticed some audio noise from the movement of the plastic parts- there's some slight play between the metal sleeve and where the plastic inserts into it. My videocamera picked up the noise pretty clearly so it killed any audio dialogue I was hoping for, but I didn't hear it when I shot HD with my still camera. Could be where the mics are mounted, but I still wish it fit more snugly together.As far as the positioning, there are only two options- the hinged locking pin lets you move the camera forward and backward, and depending on which way you tighten down your camera, you can get the other angles you need. The only thing that could be scary is that the rubber shoe that butts up to the bottom of your camera is only a rectangular shape of about 1/2 inch wide by 1 1/4 inch long. Looks like it was designed to only sit long-ways under your camera, so if you turned it sideways you wouldn't have as much support. It still works but I'd be careful. Do some testing before you stick it out over the Grand Canyon!That's about all I can say right now. I'll keep messing with it and report more if I find any faults, but I'd say for the money it's a great buy that allows you many possibilities and options for fans of photography and film making.Hope this helped you, enjoy!", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Luv it...", "Author": "CycleBabe", "ReviewID": "R2JHXYK4IO003Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Pocket Xspot & tried it in my camera it was so cool & can't wait to start using it especially this coming summer for our road trip & hikings ;-)", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Handy, but a leeeetle flimsy", "Author": "M.

It also is capable of supporting my Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 35mm film point and shoot camera (weight with roll of 24 exposure film: 7.8 oz or 221g).I would probably not expect it to carry a full-sized digital camcorder or a big SLR camera, but I did not test the XShot's camera weight limit.I have also used the XShot as a monopod, to help me steady low-light shots.  It's not going to replace a heavy duty monopod that doubles as, say, a hiking staff, but in a pinch in has helped me take less-shaky, slow aperture shots.Of course, the best thing about carrying this XShot is that I don't have to wait for someone to take a photo with me in it.The photos do tend to be more \"extreme close-up\" than those taken from four feet away by another person, but they are much better than the \"super-extreme close-up\" photos taken with only one's arm extended.
