The main selling point of this camera is the ease of use. And this is a very easy camera to use, anyone can probably master this camera within minutes after reading the Pentax's paltry instruction booklet. They even have a dial marker that would almost make this camera into one of them ancient Kodak Instamatic!! (Anyone remembered those??)Since Amazon have provided the specifications, I would go on to the camera's performances.Sad to say, this is a pretty average camera. Everything about it is, average in terms of image quality, autofocus speed, and other stuffs that layman photographers usually looks for. The 2.5 inch LCD is nice but pretty average in performance, big enough to look but fades in the sunlight. At 200 ISO, there were some noises which I thought shouldn't be there. The features are pretty average, nothing truly exceptional about this camera outside of the ease of use.There are some downsides to this camera as well. The ISO rating goes only up to 200 ISO. That kind of limit the camera a bit for indoor shots. To make the matter worst, the built-in flash for this camera is pretty pathetic. The flash proves to be weak and rather short ranged. Almost useless unless you are firing away at point blank range. I was also disappointed that this camera could not accept CRV3 battery like the Optio 30 can.This would be a hard camera to recommend to any body out there reading this. I think there's a better camera around this price range somewhere out there. I recommended you keep looking.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "It has voice recording!!!", "Author": "Gerald Balmes \"Jerry B\"", "ReviewID": "R3HVZH9UCL7668", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Features : The Pentax Optio 50L related to the Optio50 model, and shares the same lens, imager, and most other functionality of that camera.Ease of use.  simple enough and not to complex; NO optical Viewfinder.

Low light pictures without the flash take long to focus and look like orange film was used. Many times it won't focus taking regular pictures. And will blur a whole range if you don't use manual focus or change focus setting. Otherwise it works like an average camera.
