LOL Ya and I can save some money this year and bag the proctologist and just lube it up and take a look for myself, NOT just kidding, but you could.. but not recommended I'm sure...LOL oh boy!!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Cynthia M Simpson", "ReviewID": "RB3TK8JP4BSN9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Thought would be nice tool to have ,but for 79$ and it works two three times before all u get is blank screen and a picture now and again when u move it right.
