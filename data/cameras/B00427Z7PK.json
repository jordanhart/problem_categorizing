This camera is great. I could go on and on, but I'll just say that I am very happy with this purchase. It takes great pictures and is easy to use.I would also like to point out that Pentax technical support is amazing. They are not just a bunch of yahoos in a call center reading off of the screen. They employ their own call center staff and have offices in North America so you won't run into the language barrier that many other electronics manufacturers have.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR at a great price!!", "Author": "Shelley Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1GKZ4ZP7N73NL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a year and I have no complaints.  I am able to take professional looking pictures without knowing much about SLR Cameras.  This camera is also very well made, heavy and expensive looking. Everywhere I go I get compliments on this camera and people with more expensive cameras want to look at it and compare the features.  Most of the time they walk away knowing that they spent way too much for their camera.  I had a film Pentax SLR for years and loved it, so this digital SLR was a perfect upgrade for me and I was able to use my lenses from my film camera with no problems.  This camera will even take video which is a nice feature to have on a DSLR.  I take thousands of pictures and do not baby my camera at all and this one has held up nicely with no problems.  My 8 year old and 15 year old use this camera often and without any problems. I love the white body on the camera and get many compliments on it, not to mention that I can spot my camera easily when it is left on a table with other cameras at karate class or in my child's classroom.  The high speed continuous mode is wonderful for sporting events and I have been able to capture a lot of perfect shots with this camera because it is so dependable and easy to use!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Kevin B. Tripp", "ReviewID": "R3JEFL1L0AEUXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about three weeks ago and it has blown past my expectations! Out of the box, it just feels good in my hand. The pictures taken with the 18-55mm and older 80-320mm were sharp and well exposed. Even an old Sima soft-focus lens that I've had for 30 years works perfectly. It's too bad that Pentax doesn't advertise it's cameras because this is a gem!", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent transition from film SLR to DSLR", "Author": "D. Cumpian", "ReviewID": "R2QX79YSN7OXUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always disliked DSLR cameras because I was not satisfied with the quality of the images, specifically in regards to color and contrast. However, the newer DSLR have rectified this issue and have a much more film-like quality to the images. It has been very easy to adjust to this camera after using Pentax SLR cameras for many years. I'm sure the next generation will be even better, but I'm very happy with the quality I'm getting from this new camera.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pentax K-r", "Author": "Nome", "ReviewID": "R1TB7IJ2Z2462T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before I bought this camera, and I'm very happy with it.  I started out looking for a digital SLR that would fit some old 35mm Pentax lenses I have, so that was my main concern.  Other manufacturers put stuff like autofocus and anti-shake in the lenses, so I was very happy to discover the K-r has both of these functions in the camera body.  Put any old lens on there and you still get anti-shake (autofocus requires lenses that support that function, but the motor is in the camera body, which makes the lenses less expensive).  In my research I seemed to come across a lot of people complaining about the \"loud\" shutter.  The K-r I received has a shutter no louder than any other SLR I've used.Pros:Compatibility with all old Pentax lenses - Autofocus & Anti-shake in camera body - better than normal light sensitivity (for shooting at night) - Easy-to-use menus and settings - takes some nice pictures, I have to say!Cons:Need to buy an adapter separately to use AA batteries", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "great purchase", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R2VXFT83R6G6QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this used item, to test whether if I want to buy a new one. Nice camera, still trying to learn how to operate it. It's noisy though, I think I like those cameras that don't make a sound or click every time you push the shutter. Otherwise, its great, I think. The look of it is great, everyone notices the white color. I specifically wanted a white camera and this one fits perfectly. I can think of some design improvements I'd add to newer models, but they won't ask me.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lightning fast Storm Trooper!", "Author": "marc campbell", "ReviewID": "R25KOY9319HGVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't planning on giving this camera a five star review. In fact, I wasn't planning on reviewing it at all. However, Pentax has just really been impressing me!This is their entry level DSLR\u2026yet it is so professional. I bought it as a back-up to my other camera. My first impression as of just having received it (3 hrs ago) is that it is the fastest camera I have ever held!I have extensive photography experience and this is an excellent entry level DSLR. I can go from nill to turning it on, auto-focusing and getting the shot, in 3 seconds. No start up delay, auto focus is phase detection, and I'm pretty good, but I can't get 3 seconds with my other cameras. I can't wait for Pentax to enter the pro-DSLR market!!!ANYONE looking to buy this - its light weight, easy to use and did I mention it's FAST?!?Love it!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pentax K-r 12.4 MP Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (White)", "Author": "KiD", "ReviewID": "R1ZLVXXGG7XZ31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The shipping is fast.
