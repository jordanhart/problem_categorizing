I like these so much better than the exposed sensors on my other property.  Only problem was the metal weatherstrip on my exterior doors was difficult to work around these sensors, but I could not downgrade the sensor for that.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great with Vista 20P and VeraLite.  Easy to install.", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R3DCQ7OXS7BYKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Easy to install with a cordless drill.Visually unintrusive once installed.Battery lasts for years; uses a standard AAA.Works great for both security and home automation.Cons:The piece that holds the electronics in the plastic case is fairly soft and will break if you're not careful (I haven't broken any - yet).The little rubber piece that holds the electronics in tightly comes out and could be lost.Notes:I use these for both security and home automation.  I have six of them so far - four in exterior doors and two in interior doors (basement and garage).  They work very well and can be physically installed easily.  Programming the Vista (or other Honeywell-based system like ADT) is impossible without the installer code and difficult if you're not used to it.I have my Vista hooked up to my VeraLite home automation controller and use these for scenes - for example, turn on the basement lights when the door is opened - and they work well for that, also.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "5818 Honeywell Door Transmitter", "Author": "Guy", "ReviewID": "R109H8HOVPD3R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to replace the existing one because a portion of it broke (the part that locks & holds the transmitter INSIDE of the tube). The actual original transmitter was fine, but since the plastic housing broke, I had to purchase the entire package. I wish the plastic tube assembly was available for purchase, but unfortunately it is not. Anyway, this is working as it should and hopefully the plastic housing will not break again.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001649CBC"}}
