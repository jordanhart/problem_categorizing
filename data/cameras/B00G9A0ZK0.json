The Sony A7 is pretty amazing to go with all my canon lenses(with adapter) and some legacy lens.  Only took me a couple hours to tumbling through the menu and have it setup and now I just take pictures :)  coming from long time using canon, I still wish the shutter button is a bit more forward or directly above the front dial but that probably don't bother others.So far I am very happy with this purchase but as the title suggested that in my package I got everything except that I only received 1 memory card instead of 2.  I didn't bother to complain about this because I pay the price that would have been the cost of the camera if I have bought this with Amazon (as vendor) body only.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G9A0ZK0"}}
