I intend to use it for snapshots and I'm evaluating it as such.The main reason I'm writing this review is to share some information about its video capabilities:- The camera can record audio but does not have a speaker, so in-camera playback will not have audio.- This camera does not include an XD memory card, and to store anything beyond the pathetic internal memory you will need to purchase one. XD cards can be type M, M+, or H. Type M has an access time too slow to let the highest-quality video write to the card, so you can only record 10 seconds of video in this case. I contacted Olympus and they confirmed that the M+ and H type cards circumvent this problem, allowing you to fill the entire XD card with movie data if you wish to.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Olympus Digital Camera Review", "Author": "Hadley Jane", "ReviewID": "R28M8NGZ9VT048", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great buy! Everything you need comes in the package, except you'll have to buy an additional memory card (about $16 for 2GB).  It works great and takes good pictures at night, in action, or for everyday use. It's small to fit in your pocket and has a new, sleek look.  The settings are advanced and allow for every type of shooting.  As a college student, this is a perfect camera. I have had no problems with it thus far.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Olympus digital camera", "Author": "EFD \"French teach\"", "ReviewID": "R1TFRQAUZ3OX7R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera, very easy to use, very large screen.

The lack of sound on video is also an irritation.  As someone else said, the picture quality isn't really that good; one shouldn't need to have the camera on the highest resolution possible to get just passable picture quality.Positives: Lightweight; compact; more than reasonable software bundle and easy to use.  Good zoom and image stabilization.  Easy to navigate menu.Negatives: Poor picture quality; non-standard memory card (have to mess with an adapter).  Preferred shooting mode does not seem to save; every time you power on, you are back to the default. No sound on video.  Poor battery life (it should not die from a full charge after shooting just 6 minutes of video).I persevered with this camera for a couple of months.  The bottom line for me was that the picture quality was much poorer than cameras very much older and far less expensive.  This is probably the first and last Olympus camera that I will ever own.I have since bought a Sony DSC-T90 and really, I could not be happier.  I just wished that I hadn't wasted money on the Olympus FE-3010.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Meh.", "Author": "MD", "ReviewID": "R37TPT6AHM0HMJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Honestly my iPhone takes better pictures. I can't really recommend this to anyone, but it is pretty simple to use. I figured out every option in about 20 minutes, so it seems intuitive.

The pictures were very good; but the lens stopped retracting after 4 months of irregular use (my daughter took at most 150 pictures with the camera).  I sent it in for warranty (at the cost of $30.00) and was told the warranty was null and void due to tampering.  Olympus wants $72.00 to fix the camera.  My husband was with my daughter when it stopped working.  No one tampered with the product.  I'm not going to throw more money at this firm and I will never purchase a camera from this company again.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Image stabilization does not seem automatic", "Author": "D. Berg", "ReviewID": "R2UWYY5W457UL1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to bring on a SCUBA diving vacation.  I bought the PT-046 waterproof housing to go with the camera.  I wanted a point and shoot camera.  This isn't a hard camera to use, but isn't really easy.  When this camera is turned on, it always starts in the auto snapshot mode.  Even in bright mid day sun, the shutter does not seem fast enough to capture a steady picture.  I have not had issues getting steady pictures with other cameras I've used.  If I remember to switch to the stabilzation mode, the pictures come out fine.  In macro mode, the issue is worse.  In super macro mode, I have difficulty getting a steady picture even if the camera is on a tripod.The flash works fairly well for 5-10 foot photos.  Beyond that, it seems to have trouble lighting the picture.  When diving, most pictures are taken in a macro mode.  I've found the flash to be too bright for close subjects, even with the diffuser built into the waterpfoof housing.The FE-3010 does take better pictures than my old Nikon Coolpix L3.  If this had not been able to beat a 3 year old camera (that disappointed me when it was new), I would have given this a 1 star rating.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures", "Author": "Lisa L.

I wanted something that was, basically, point and shoot. It doesn't need an Olympus-only memory card. I didn't need anything fancy. This camera is so very easy to operate! The instructions were very straight-forward. I like the self timer and the pictures are sharp and colorful. I used the video to capture the sounds of a bunch of sheep baaing and it's one of my favorite images. I feel it was a great value and the pinkish color makes it fun!", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "get what you pay for", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R139Q366JIDU5H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when it was just out. It was cheap even then and that should have been a hint. To its credit, it is quite a sleek and small design which makes it really easy to carry around in a pocket. I used it to take a video of my boyfriend's band's gig. Didn't expect it to perform at all but you can actually make out the songs - not great quality, obviously - and the band members pretty clearly. Nothing amazing but good enough for YouTube.Unfortunately, for the couple of things this camera does well, it does many other things quite poorly. It takes so long to take a photo. You think it's taken and go to move your hand but it turns out it hasn't. Then you get a blurry shot and have to take it again. The auto and normal picture modes are alright, if somewhat overexposed. Try taking a photo of anything moving and you will get a lot of movement in the photo - as in I took a photo of my boyfriend playing guitar and he ended up with about 8 fingers on one hand. Unless you have an extremely steady hand it's likely you will get a blurry photo, as well. There is an image stabilisation mode but all of the photos in this turn out weird and unnatural looking.You have to take the battery out and put it in a little charger to recharge. This is kind of hit and miss as sometimes the charger doesn't recognise there's a battery in it and will need to be fiddled with. This can be annoying if you just leave it to charge before you need to use it. Also concerning the battery, the little spring which pops the battery in and out when you press it in has broken so it now only pops out. This is probably something unique to my camera. It might have gotten impacted although I'm not sure how as I'm fairly careful with it. However, it's just a point to consider that it's not the most rugged of cameras, either. It still works when you shut the door even though the battery doesn't click in correctly. Again, just annoying.If you don't care what your photos look like and don't mind having to take and retake them to get a good picture, I guess you could buy this. But as I said, you get what you pay for, which for me = annoying.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "not the best...", "Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "R31UEIULW5ZHT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The amount of time it takes for it to take its first picture after turning it on is way too long.

I've had it for a few weeks, and so far it's a decent camera. I bought it to replace my 4 year old Nikon Coolpix L4 (4 MP, 3x zoom), and the Olympus 3010 does a great job. The pictures are crisp and clear. It did take a bit more time to figure out what worked best in what type of setting on the Olympus than on my Nikon camera, but that's mainly because there are so many more options to get the perfect picture on the Olympus.The battery does seem to drain a bit faster on this camera than the batteries I used for my Nikon, but it's not that big of a difference. If you plan on taking any camera out for several hours, it's always a good idea to have back-up batteries, anyway.The size is what really makes me happy, though. This camera is very slim, and it easily fits into the cell phone pouch in all of my purses. It also doesn't weigh that much, which is nice because I love taking my camera everywhere with me, and I hated how heavy my old camera made my purse.Truth be told, I was very skeptical when I first thought about purchasing this camera, but now I love it. Overall, I would say that this would be a great camera for a first time buyer, or a person who just enjoys taking pictures, but isn't a serious photographer.

When I tried to take pictures in other modes than iAuto (which by the way every time you turn on the camera you have to manually set, very inconvenient), it gets busy from picture to picture so you can't take picture one after the other because you need to wait for the camera to stabilize again.I used the camera this weekend with some friends. It took beautiful pictures. I showed to a friend, put the camera in its case away (in a basket at home) and the next day I grabbed it to take a picture and found out that the monitor was cracked, like it fell down, but the outside was brand new. It looks like its inside the camera, half the screen is white and black and I can see just a little of what the lens is seeing (say 1/4 of the monitor). No body has access to this camera other than me. And I am sure I didn't break it. I just put it away in its case! and out of nowhere the LCD is broken?I called the repair number and I need to send it for repair, but I don't think the warranty is going to cover it. They will clearly state that it was dropped and was broken on impact, to can't proof otherwise!FRUSTRATING! $150 in the trash in a month! and I can't do anything about it!
