This camera is a piece of crap. E18 errors which means your lens extends and wont go back in or the reverse. Canon is ignoring the problem and thier customers. This usually happens when out of warranty, 2.5 years. They say it is due to it being droped, sand in the lens, the moon in retrograde, whatever. My camera was well cared for never dropped looks like new and the problem occured. If you buy this camera its like a throw of the dice that it will happen to you so prepare for another 150 bucks to fix the problem, or buy a brand that stands behind thier product. I heard that there are a couple of class actions in the works over this issue, I hope they succeed, I am going to see if I can join the class and get my money back. And if you think it is random, my friend had the same problem with one of the A models. Its not, it hapens to most canon cameras. do a google search for E18 before you buy this hunk of junk", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Super Canon", "Author": "Roy \"Roycontrol\"", "ReviewID": "R2JQVRAX82EZZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Into the cameras below from 5MP, this canon is great for everything, any place and any time. It's 4MP are enough for everybody. I use it for parties, social and family events, job issues, etc, and is really good for me. Good video recording with sound.

It's very easy to use - very intuitive and all the buttons, etc. are located in an easy-to-use way.  The BIG problem I've had with this camera is that the shutter speed has become slower and slower.  Now I miss all the good shots because after pressing the button it takes almost SIX seconds to actually capture the shot.  With kids, dogs, or any kind of event, really, it's just impossible to capture a moment as it happens.  My poor kids are tired of hearing me say \"Smile and hold it..... hold it.... hold it... hold it... wait....okay there's the picture\"  I loved the camera until this happened so I'm upgrading to a new Canon, the IS870.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a while.", "Author": "C", "ReviewID": "R2I23E9PDDIWJY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera back when it first came out -- when digital cameras were $$$$$.Served me well over the first 2 years, then it started having problems:1) retracting its lens & turning itself off.  Fickle but I could work around it.2) there was a recording problem.  The memory card would just get corrupted again and again and the only way to get the photos off the card was to use the cable and transfer it to a PC.  Annoying but I could work around it. (This is a problem Canon will fix for free)3)This past summer at the ripe old age of 2.5yrs it simply refused to show me anything on the screeen or record anything or turn on.You can get a decent camera in the $130 range today.  This $130 is the fee (plus S & H + insurance) you have to pay just to send it in for Canon to look at it.  Anything that needs to be done to it is extra.So, I have all the accessories, extra batteries and it did take some decent quality photos and the $89.99 price is a steal compared to the $$$ I originally paid for it in the first week it was out.  I had thought I just had a lemon.  But now reading all the reviews online.  I'll just ebay the accessories and get a different one for that 130.While it was working, one of my peeves with this camera was its slow shutter speed.  Sports, pet, baby pictures not possible with this camera.  However, it did take excellent photos above and underwater (in the Canon Housing).", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0002YF2LQ"}}
