{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Kit for this Rookie Photographer!", "Author": "T. Turcato", "ReviewID": "R1WB10F6PLYMI6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera kit for my family and our trip to NYC.  We used the camera extensively on our trip and everyone loved the beautiful pictures it took.  The Canon T3i is a fantastic camera and pairing it with the Sigma 18-200 makes it a great all around camera without the need to switch out lenses all the time.  The camera will take a rookie (such as myself) a while to learn all the settings, but out of the box a person can set the camera and lens on auto and you will be amazed of the simplicity and quality.  No more missing my children's candid shots!  This kit is by far the best deal you can get with the 18-200 lens; Purchasing these items separately would not be as cost effective as ordering them in this kit.  I did realized that although the bag was very handy on my trip, it fell apart very quickly.  I will be ordering a new bag on Amazon today because the straps are cheap and broke off within a few days of use. The tripod is also a bit flimsy but for my use it will work fine and was a bonus item for me anyway.  All in all this kit is still a great deal for someone getting started in using higher end DSLR cameras.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Luis H", "ReviewID": "R1Z59VBOGNHJR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched all Canon camera kits here on Amazon. This is by far the best buy. Everything arrived perfectly packed and in perfect condition. The Rebel T3i met all my expectations. The 18-200 lens is perfect for most cases.
