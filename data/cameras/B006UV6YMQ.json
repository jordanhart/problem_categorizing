{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not perfect, but closest thing I've found to my ideal camera", "Author": "brian", "ReviewID": "R1ZZHO1L7FZ1T5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have an X-pro1 with the 35mm/f1.4 lens. (I live in Canada, and ordered it from Japan.)Here are my overall first impressions:If I had to sum it up, I'd say it's not perfect, but for me it's the closest thing to the ideal camera that I've found.THE GOOD- Image quality is beyond reproach - in terms of colour rendering, highlight/shadow detail, sharpness, quality of the bokeh.- Feels very solid; excellent build quality- It looks better in person than in the pictures I had seen of it- Controls are big and easy to operate, even with gloves on- Shutter sound is very soft & quiet- Viewfinder is fantasticOVERALL PERFORMANCE & SIZE- In terms of performance, I'll compare it to the Panasonic GF1 /w 20mm pancake, as it's a camera I'm very familiar with. While the camera isn't aimed at exactly the same market, both cameras fit into a similar category - they're both alternatives to DSLRs that aim at providing excellent image quality and handling, with less bulk and weight. And many photographers fell in love with the GF1 / 20mm combo.- Focus speed: In my experience, the X-Pro1 autofocus speed and reliability is very similar to the the GF1. While I haven't done millisecond timing to compare them, I can say that they feel about the same in autofocus performance. So, while a good DSLR can outperform both cameras for fast action focussing, the autofocus performance is more than adequate for most other types of photography.- Operational speed: No major issues here - startup time is definitely less than a second, and I haven't even turned on the \"quick start\" mode. You can shoot quickly, and there's no delay before you can take more shots in either single or burst modes. Again, very similar to the GF1.- Size and weight: The X-Pro1 is obviously bigger than the GF1. I'd describe it as somewhere between the GF1 and a DSLR in size. In terms of subjective impression, the X-Pro1 isn't quite as small and innocent looking as the GF1. Depending on who you are, this may be a good thing or a bad thing. The GF1 has the edge if you want the camera to be small, discrete and non-intimidating, while the X-Pro1 is a little more substantial in keeping with its professional target market. But what really matters when it comes to always having the camera with you, is its weight. The X-Pro1 manages to feel solid, while not feeling overly heavy. Unlike a DSLR, I wouldn't hesitate to carry the X-Pro1 around all day, although the GF1 still has the edge in portability and ability to tuck it into a jacket pocket. From my brief experience with the X100, I'd put it somewhere between the two in this regard, but closer to the GF1.- Manual focus: Very similar to the manual focus-by-wire of the GF1 / 20mm combo. It's not ridiculously slow as I've heard the X100 was, but I'd still prefer direct mechanical manual focus.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED- If there's just one thing I'd ask for in a firmware update, it would be a central magnified area to aid manual focus. While you can magnify the whole screen by pressing the \"command dial\", this is an extra step, and awkwardly takes you away from seeing the overall composition. Panasonic has gotten this right in some of their recent mirrorless cameras. I know some people like Sony's focus peaking, and while that too would do the job, I find it ugly and suspect that Sony's patents might make it hard for Fujifilm to copy this.- While aperture ring has a great feel to it, actual aperture adjustment lags. This is manifest when viewing the aperture number through the viewfinder while turning the dial, and in terms of actual aperture adjustment in DOF preview mode- Autofocus, while not loud, also isn't silent as I'd wish it would be.- There is no option to visually preview exposure when setting shutter speed manually- I like the film simulation bracketing, as an option to record both a colour and black-and-white version, for easy comparison of black-and-white vs colour shots right off the bat on the computer. This mode allows you to choose which 3 film simulations you want to record, but it has a couple drawbacks. One is that it will always give you 3 versions - no options for just 2 for instance. Also, unlike single or burst mode, the camera locks up and doesn't let you take another shot until it finishes writing.- Exposure compensation dial does nothing after you've engaged AE lock.- It would be nice to have some confirmation that the exposure compensation dial is centered. Ideally, there would be something to let you tell physically, perhaps with a bump/indent on the dial, and different feeling to the click when it returns to the 0-location, so that you can confirm without looking.  Also, it would be nice if the exposure compensation indicator in the viewfinder changed color when centered, to again let you quicly confirm when it's centered.- The \"command dial\" does nothing when in the menus and other situations where it would be nice to have an alternative to pressing the arrow buttons.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has Impeccable image quality but also operational quirks.", "Author": "Parka", "ReviewID": "REE07BXLW9GP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 27 Sep 2012: I've to rewrite a big portion of the review because firmware 2.0 is a rather significant improvement.The image quality on this camera is sublime. The colours are absolutely gorgeous, mesmerizing.It has the best image quality compared to previous cameras I've used, namely Canon 7D (sold), GF1, GH2 and X100. 7D is quite good, except in high ISO, relatively speaking. X-Pro1 is significantly better in image quality than the GH2, which I use frequently for videos. I've also borrowed an Olympus OM-D E-M5 to try out and the Olympus camera is close but the X-Pro1 is still one notch better. I've read that many say that E-M5 is as good as X-Pro1, but you really need to have used both to see the difference.I don't post-edit much with the X-Pro1 because the jpeg quality is just too good. That's just JPEG. Since I don't need to do post editing, I guess I'll be shooting just JPEGs from now. I've read many complaints regarding the RAW files and photo software being unable to process them to the best of their potential. I can't comment much since I don't shoot a lot of RAW.After a series of firmware updates, latest being 2.0, AF speed for the three prime lens have improved. The AF speed is now more satisfactory, although still not as fast as DSLR or Micro Four Thirds. I've two tips on even fast AF. Turn Power Save Mode off to have faster OVF AF speed. Another tip is not to pre-focus and hit the shutter all the way - the camera will get the focus most of the time.The AF speed could be a source of frustration and potential deal breaker for many. But it comes down to what type of photography you're into. This is not a sports camera, that's for sure. So it's not that suitable for shooting subjects moving faster than walking speed. It's definitely not a general purpose do-it-all camera. Depending on what you shoot, you might actually need another camera. It's also not a beginner's camera, although if you're willing to learn, you'll learn a lot. I'm learning a lot.Speed is quite subjective. For example on the GF1 & X100, I expected them to be slow, so their speed is satisfactory. I expected X-Pro1 to have faster AF speed, so it's slightly unsatisfactory in that sense. But since I'm already used to the X100 speed, this again becomes satisfactory. When you consider the price, it becomes borderline satisfactory. It's all about expectations.Manual focus is responsive to the turn of the focus wheel. The 3x magnified view is useful as it's large enough to see the subject clearly, but not too large as to have the subject move too much, such as when you're using a long telephoto lens. The overall focus-by-wire implementation has improved a lot, way better than X100, almost as good as Micro Four Thirds.Handling is excellent. All the things you need to shoot are there: the aperture ring, shutter speed dial and exposure dial. It's taking photos at its simplest form, with no need to go into menus.After using the camera since March 2012, I've had a lot of people telling me they really like the design of the camera. The design may not be as discreet as I thought. Most people are so used to seeing DSLR and P&S; cameras that this rangefinder-shaped camera actually stands out as a result! I've also noticed that people are generally less guarded when being pointed with this camera than with big DSLRs.So to buy or not?In my opinion, if you're coming from the best Micro Four Thirds camera, you're gaining high ISO performance, colour rendition and a huge step in image quality.If you're coming from a heavy DSLR camera, you're gaining high ISO performance and a lot of weight advantage.This is a camera that challenges expectations, in the most literal sense. You'll either love it, or hate it. I like it very much. There are still some quirks but Fujifilm has shown themselves to being able to listen to customers and release the appropriate firmwares.5 out of 5 stars for image quality and handling.4 out of 5 stars for everything else.+ Excellent build quality+ Nice weight for body (450g) and lens+ Discreet just-a-piece-of-black design+ Lens have aperture rings+ Rubber hand grip works well enough+ Exposure dial is tighter, less prone to accidental hits+ Buttons have nice tactile feel+ Hybrid viewfinder (OVF and EVF) works nicely+ Sharp 3-inch LCD+ Shutter dial has a lock at A+ Shutter sound is soft, blends with ambient noise+ Impeccable image quality+ Legendary high ISO performance+ Amazing quality JPEG at default setting+ Auto White Balance is almost always correct+ AF speed is satisfactory+ Able to focus in extreme low light, although it takes more time+ AF accuracy seems slightly improved over X100.+ Manual focus is responsive+ Start up is fast+ Menus have tabs that show everything in plain sight+ Writes as fast as your SD card can write+ Average to good battery life. Get an extra battery.- OVF is smaller than X100- Not sealed. I've dust inside my EVF (not OVF) after 1 week.- No way to adjust diopter- Triangle rings causes lug wear. The ring is more durable than the lug.- 18mm lens framelines covers less than 100%. Your photos will cover more.- Drastic parallax adjustment for 60mm lens in OVF for closeup subjects- Battery lid feels filmsy and placement is bad- Shutter dial lock is not necessary - Yes, I contradict myself- Still has slight tendency to back-focus (Shooting with EVF reduces that)- Strangely, OVF focuses slower than EVF- No ability to set minimum shutter speed in AutoISO- Lacking in video settings and lens aren't optimized for video.- No manual aperture control during video recording- No digital zoom during video mode (compared to X100)- Moire effect is easy to create in video- Video is only 24fpsFIRMWARE REQUEST- Have the ability to set minimal shutter speed- Ability to turn the arrow buttons into function buttons- Ability to turn on depth of field preview ALL THE TIME. E.g. When I turn to f/8, the aperture should close down.Update 24 April 2012:Firmware 1.01 removed the noise from chattering aperture bladesUpdate 8 June 2012:Firmware 1.1 makes manual focus easier. Images are sharper in OVF/LCD during manual focus zoom in mode.Update 27 Sep 2012:EVF no longer freezes while the lens autofocus. MF lag is almost gone now. The focus-by-wire MF has improved significantly and is now more responsive to the turn. A 3x magnification mode during MF is added to the original 10x and the magnified view is more useful now. Autofocus speed has improved for the three lens after the lens firmware. Auto ISO at 6400 has been added but there's still no ability to set minimum shutter speed. Write speed has also improved.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "How Fuji stole my heart and money", "Author": "Vinay K. Sharma", "ReviewID": "R8SVUUZUMQ5B3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHY WHAT WHOI chose to write this review because the reviews on Amazon are so polarizing and sometimes downright pushy, so much so that they made me buy this camera to judge it for myself. I have to admit that it has been a long time since I had to defend my spending to myself. I am sure many must have faced the same internal struggle. Let me admit that this camera is a keeper for me. The decision came after a long search for a discrete both in use and appearance camera with a image quality worth taking prints and blowups of. I didn't personally own too many of micro four thirds, DSLRS and compacts but have friends who shared fair and clear opinion about the equipment they own(ed).What this camera is? It's a collection of wishes in a very ambitious package and just like any other ambitious technology firsts, suffers from lack of polished user interface as well as competition. Some might find it downright offensive but X-Pro1 does not really have a competitor and for those who own M8 and M9s you know that you are eventually going to hit that buy button on your shopping cart sooner or later. You may say what about NEX7 and O-MD? I must say, to me NEX7 seems like a very light and compact laptop running Microsoft XL to take pictures, that is to say extremely flexible, configurable and fast but requires you to dedicate your brain, hands, fingers and eyes behind a thick software interface. Hardly photography for me since it would be so hard to make mistakes both unintentional and deliberate. I haven't touched O-MD so can't say much about it. And then there is the IQ, yeh well.. Fuji Xs can make any photography lover's eye go all watery but X-Ppro1 IQ can really grab on and hold on to a photographer's soul, especially when you get it going past its many issues. Although to be fair all issues are under MY limits of acceptable.Who is this for? I understand why the reviews are so heavily opinionated since people have different photographic needs and have certain expectations from a camera especially an expensive one like this. If you:Do landscape photography: You'd love it.Do portraits: You'd love it.Do street photography: You'd love it.Do kids photography: You'd hate it.Do sports photography: No way, this camera is not so sporty. You'd hate it.Do low light action photography: You'd hate it.Do want your camera to do photography for you: You'd hate it.Want to show off your new toy to friends: You'd hate it. It would be hard to justify the cost to them in the 10 mins they hold the camera and the red dot owners would think that you don't know squat about photography.So why would you go the distance to buy this camera? Just look at the images in flickr. Also it's truly an enjoyable experience to shoot with this camera. Here are my reason why I choose to keep this camera:THE VIEWFINDERThe OVF is not complete by itself, it's the combination of OVF and EVF on a flick of a switch that makes this camera probably the best tool to compose great images. The bright lines and a little extra of the world that you see around them makes you think in terms of a `photograph' you are going to take not a `scene' you are going to capture. If you think that's a subtle difference, just try making a frame with your hand in front of your face and see it for yourself how a frame helps you compose when you can also see around it. One suggestion is to enable the parallax adjust focus frames, so that you can avoid about 10 mins of frustration when you think that the camera can't focus correctly. The frame lines are a bit tighter than the actual image that comes out but hopefully a fix to it is just a firmware update away. I have a 35 f1.4 and if I need to get a DOF preview, instead of enabling the function button to do that, I find it easier to switch to EVF and half press the shutter button. Needless to say my camera stays with OVF most of the time. One truly amazing thing is that OVF lets you compose your multiple exposure images, which may as well be a gimmick but is never the less very awesome to experience. The manual override to the magnifier is also sometimes useful like when I am taking images for a panoramic image. Yes I don't like the in camera panoramic composition, I would rather use a desktop software do it.AUTO FOCUSI think since it is almost fashionable to say that the camera has a slow autofocus, it is possibly the reason, I am almost glad that it's not as bad as I thought it would be. In bright situation it's just as fast as your run of the mill SLR. It does hunt in the dark and so does MOST of the cameras. It needs high contrast objects to allow it to focus in dim light. Now I am almost encroaching on the domain of Captain Obvious. One thing that I have already mentioned that you need to enable the parallax adjusted focus frames to correctly relate to what the camera is focusing at. I don't understand why Fuji didn't choose to enable it by default. Some people suggested that you use the continuous autofocus to work around the so called slow autofocus but I found it rather annoying but it's just my opinion and I DON't think AF is terribly slow on this camera or even slow enough to be even considered a limitation of the camera system although I wouldn't mind a firmware fix which can make it faster. Then there is accuracy. I have to admit that I don't spend a lot on modern cameras and I still love my MF Film SLRs but the 35mm 1.4 with AF can cause serious burn in issues on my plasma TV if I ever chose to render the images 1:1 on it. No, but really you get, very very accurate focusing and extraordinarily sharp images.SENSOR AND IQDoes it gets rid of moire without an AA filter?, my test says not completely but you won't see it on 99% of your images. Are the images sharp? Please check out full size images on Flickr. The noise performance is stellar. Someone mentioned on one of the forums (need to look up the link) that due to the modified sensor design Fujifilm will have to do excessive color NR which would result green or red patches on dark low contrast portions of the image and I was able to find a few of those patches but, I am guessing that can as well be a limitation of the in camera JPEG engine and possibly can be fixed with firmware updates but overall the IQ is just down right fantastic. The patches are not very obvious unless you know what you are looking for.The film simulation modes are really what they say they are. Velvia just takes you back to those Fujifilm colors without the noise of course. As for me I don't think I am going to miss the lack of RAW support in Lightroom but on the other hand would LOVE to have it.LOOK AND FEELThe camera looks stunning, even better in real than it ever looked to me in all the images on the internet. People say its not as heavy as the money they have paid for it but I really don't intend to use it for self defence like I would if I had Leica M9 in my hand (and I would need its self defence capabilities if I had M9 in my hand). On the less humorous side, I feel the weight is perfect, does not tire me out and I feel that strap is redundant since I can carry it in my hand the whole day. Just get one of those beautiful Gordy's straps and you are good to go.I live near NYC on the waterfront in a little infamous place called Jersey City and the boardwalk is very touristy and I often exchange looks of people looking at what camera equipment you are carrying. I noticed that people don't even look at my X-Pro1, which is awesome. I am sure the number of camera buffs / intersection is much higher in NYC and I might get caught but I am yet to test my theory.The real dials to adjust aperture and shutter speed is a blessing. The shutter speed dial is a bit stiff but does have an excellent feel to it. The aperture dial feels a little too easy to turn but then you realise that you can change it with a single finger without taking your eye off the viewfinder and you catch yourself saying `damn Fuji'. Don't know if it is luck or its by design but it's perfect.7 configurable settings and one Q menu to control them all, brilliant user interface, thank you Fujifilm!The display is really good as long as you are not directly under the sun. Some say its the best in the industry but I wouldn't know.I have big hands so even though the camera is big and chunky, I think the grip might help.DEAR FUJIHere is a list of things that I would like the Fuji engineers or anyone who has some influence on them to consider when they start giving firmware updates:1. Get rid of power save mode - this mode only makes users unhappy, instead try to reduce the cost of the spare battery.2. Make the fly by wire manual focus logarithmic, so that I can get to the focusing distance quickly and do the finer adjustments with slower turns of the focusing ring.3. Keep the focus detection algorithm running in manual focus mode and highlight the focus rectangles on the parts of the frame as they get in focus. Kind of like focus peaking in NEX7 but on the OVF as well. My old EOS 20D used to do it for about 30 seconds when you switch from automatic to manual focus. You may choose to run the algorithm only with the half press of shutter to save on battery life.4. Focus confirmation with the magnifier with the loupe only partially covering the frame like in many micro four thirds and point and shoots like S90/95/100 etc.5. When the camera is in completely manual mode, i.e. user set shutter speed, user set aperture, user set focus and user set ISO, DONT think, just take the picture.6. More accurate framing lines on the OVF.7. Histogram on the image preview in EVF.8. Faster autofocus.9. Ultrasonic motor on the future lenses.10. I would like to have more configurability of the buttons on the camera but i am not sure if that would make it another NEX clone.I know that is a big wish list BUT again the camera is still very good and to me its a keeper. More than anything this is the camera that inspires me to take pictures, play with different settings and be creative. At this point I am totally enjoying this camera and I hope things get better or at least stay the same with the future updates from Fujifilm.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "X-Pro1: A Camera that I wear around my neck everyday like jewelry", "Author": "C. Brown \"Ideas that speak volumes\"", "ReviewID": "R2SPC29ZOGZUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photojournalist, A documentary, studio, and sometimes wedding photographer. Previously I have owned a number of DSLRs and Point and Shoots. Right now I have a Canon EOS 5D Mark II and a Canon EOS 7D. Both are great cameras for what they allow me to do professionally. However, neither made much sense to carry around on a daily basis. So I decided later to purchase a Canon G series camera, the Canon PowerShot G9. It was great to carry around, but it was horrible in low light and Bokeh was non-existent.On my birthday I decided to start a 365 project where I take and upload at least one image per day. The project was fun, but towards the end I realized that over 50% of the images were being taken with my cell phone because I had it handy more than any other camera and it worked decently in low light. Better than my P&S; (Go figure). After noticing that my cell phone had become my main camera, I began to look at other options that would give me better image quality. The Fuji X100 was the first thing to hit my radar.The X100 seemed like an obvious choice, but I was a little turned off by the fact that I would be stuck with the one 35mm focal length. Of course I had the same issue with my cell phone, so it was something that I was thinking I could live with. That is of course, until rumors began to surface about Fuji releasing an interchangeable lens X series camera. I decided to wait it out.The X-Pro 1 was announced and I was one of the first people in the Amazon pre-order line to grab one. It was released pretty late out here in the U.S. which gave me time to read a lot about the camera prior to buying it. I read about all of its quirks and issues with slow auto focus. None of the quirks bothered me. I had been able to get some amazing images with a cell phone prior to this so I figured this would be wonderful, but it was actually much better than I expected.I wont discuss all of its quirks because those are all well documented here and on DPReview.com. What I will say is this.... This camera, for me, is what all those gold chains were for Mr. T back in the 80s. It's something you see around my neck whenever you see me. In class...? I have my X-Pro1. At the mall....? I have my X-Pro1. Driving down the street....? I have my X-Pro1! Due to this fact I can snap off shots anywhere and start new projects that will not include any cell phone images.In the first week of owning this camera I have captured some outstanding images. The image quality is outstanding. In fact I am willing to put the out of camera JPGs up against my 5D Mark II and state that the IQ of the Fuji tops that of the images from my 5DMKII. The sharpness of the Fuji XF 35mm F1.4 R bests that of my Canon L series zooms quite easily and at the very least, matches the sharpness of the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM which is considered, by many, to be Canon's sharpest L prime lens.The low light capabilities are also better than my 5DMKII, making it more useful in near darkness.For me there is no reason to carry around a DSLR unless I need the focus and FPS speed. That is the only time that I bring the DSLRs out anymore. That and if I need to shoot video, as the video on the Fuji just wont match the awesomeness of the 5DMKII. But other than that, The Fuji has become my go to camera. The others have to come off the bench when the Fuji gets tired or fouls out....Overall, I would recommend this camera to photojournalists, street photographers, wedding photographers(as a second to a DSLR), studio photographers( I was amazed by the images I got with the studio strobes), Landscape photographers, and people who want an everyday carry around camera.The Fuji X-Pro1 has easily become my favorite camera because of it's amazing image quality, portability, and it's ability to make me want to shoot more and have a lot more fun in doing so.I am giving it the ultimate 5 star rating because there is no 4.5 and 4 stars just wouldn't be fair. The 0.5 taken off would be for the Focus system. To me that is its only Achilles heel.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "Edward Huang \"Edward Huang\"", "ReviewID": "R30ZVQGB1KEV5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To start off, I would like to say that I sold a Panasonic GH2 + 14mm f/2.5 and a Nikon 55-200mm DX lens before purchasing the X-Pro1 + 35mm. I kept the Nikon 50mm f/1.4 that I was using on the GH2 because it's a great lens and used on the X-Pro1, gives me 75mm equivalent, close enough to 85mm full frame macro for my use. While I loved the GH2 (especially for its video), I decided to sell it for the X-Pro1 because I want to focus primarily on stills now. In short, during the 1 month that I've had the camera, I think the camera is amazing. It shoots AMAZING pictures. Seriously, I'm repeatedly amazed at how sharp and vivid the pictures are (when you grab the right focus, hehe) and how little post-processing I need to do. To make sure this review stays objective and that I don't get flack for being a fanboy, I'd like to address the drawbacks to this camera first:-Slow autofocus & lens chatter (though the chatter has primarily been fixed by the new firmware)-Unless you're using zone focusing (which I've now grown accustomed to using), it's hard to get shots in focus in time for proper street photography-The throw for the focus ring is too long. It takes wayy too many turns to change the focus from zero to infinity!-Autofocus is limited to only one location on the screen, instead of automatically adjusting to where the camera believes it should be focused (e.g. a face). In AF-S or AF-C mode, you can manually change where you want the focus point/area to be, but that takes too long for real-life shooting unless you are shooting landscapes/very still objects.So I'm sure you're wondering why I like the camera so much despite the above limitations! It really boils down to one concept: while the above limitations are frustrating, IT'S POSSIBLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THEM if you know what you are doing. Here are my own personal methods of working around each of the above bullet points:-I lied. You can't really increase the autofocus speed without changes in firmware, etc. But one workaround is to shoot in higher f-stops (primarily f/5.6 or f/8+) so even if you miss the precise focus point you were looking for, that area will still be *mostly* in focus. If you really like shooting as wide as possible, then I recommend one of three things: 1) Don't half-press the shutter button. Imagine that the camera is a point-and-shoot and just fire the shutter button without waiting for the focus confirmation from the half-press. It gives you just a bit more speed to get that split second you need to get the shot off before the scene changes. 2) Use the drive mode! This camera can shoot 6 fps. Use it to your advantage! If you're worried or frustrated that you're not getting the right shot because it's taking too long for you get the right exposure, then just fire off 6 frames per second with the exposure bracketing! If you have the right exposure already and are just worried about focus, then just fire the camera and you're bound to get at least one great picture out of 12 or so duds. 3) Even if that doesn't work for you, then start figuring out how far away your subjects are. This is actually what I do most of the time, which sounds REALLY HARD (and believe me, it was REALLY HARD when I first started doing this), but with a lot of practice, you eventually can get good approximations of how far away something is, and as long as you're not using too wide of an aperture (I only use f/1.4 on rare occasions, and prefer the look of f/2 or f/2.8), you can just manually adjust the focus really quickly to a designated distance, quickly press the DOF preview button (I manually programmed it to the Fn button on the top) to confirm focus, and then fire the shutter. It sounds like a lot of work, but this is actually one of the reasons I like the camera - IT FORCES ME TO GET BETTER. I've never had to think more about my exposure and how I'm going to shoot it properly than with this camera. It makes me understand more and try more advanced techniques, which in the end makes me a better photographer. Too many cameras these days do too much of the work for you (which I understand appeals to most of the general population), but I like the fact that this camera makes me work for my shot; it makes it that much more satisfying when I'm looking in the LCD after firing the shutter and I see a perfect shot.-As for the note about street photography, it is indeed tough with the Fuji lens because the throw of the focus ring is so long. It takes too long to adjust your focus for a person walking in front of you. My suggestions: 1) Get an M adapter and an M lens. The manual focusing on those lenses is much superior and you even have dials that calculate your hyperfocal distance ranges for a given aperture, which is HUGE for street photography. That being said, I don't have the money for M lenses, so I resort to 2) Zone Focusing. I had to brush up on this technique (and even estimate the circle of confusion for the Fuji 35mm) but once I estimated the hyperfocal distance to be around 3.8 meters away, I just set my aperture to f/8-16 based on available sunlight and started firing away. It's great because it's so much easier to shoot from the hip with this method. People in the city (I live in Chicago) still fear a camera being pointed at them, so being able to do it discreetly without you having to look at them through the viewfinder is great. All you do is look at the LCD to confirm your shot and fire away!-There are two workarounds to the focus ring throw problem and they've both been mentioned already. You can: 1) start estimating distances of your subjects to pre-focus your shot or 2) buy M-mount lenses. I guess you could buy old Canon FD and Nikon F lenses with mechanical focus rings too..-Having the autofocus point fixed to one place at all times is a bit annoying, but there's a simple way to get around this. What I do is fix the autofocus to the middle of the frame at all times, put the camera in AF-C mode (it's a bit faster than AF-S, I've found), half-press the shutter with your subject in the middle of your frame, recompose the image by moving the camera around until your subject is in your desired location in the frame, and then fire the shutter. It won't be 100% accurate (especially with objects very close to you) because the DOF (the area in front of you that's in focus) changes slightly when you move the camera around, but it's about 95-98% accurate, which is more than good enough for my purposes.Now with those suggested workarounds in place, now I'd like to tell everybody the MAJOR reasons why I love this camera and why it makes my life way easier! Here are the key ones:-The handling. I had a GH2 and it was actually too small for me. I don't have large hands (about 7.5 or 8 inches from bottom of palm to the end of my middle finger), but when I was using the GH2, I found that I was getting a lot of camera shake because the camera was too small to fit snugly in my right hand and was too light for me to keep it sturdy out in a windy day or cold day. I mention a cold day because shivering kills a shot when the camera is too light to keep sturdy. I feel the X-Pro1 is a perfect size. Many professional photographers actually prefer larger bodies because they are typically sturdier, more durable, and more ergonomic, and while I don't consider myself in that group (I'm not a professional and I have small hands so I still prefer smaller cameras), I feel the X-Pro1 is almost the perfect size. It's not too large for you to have trouble hitting the important buttons while composing in the viewfinder, and it's not too small for you to have camera shake problems. Moreover, the weight of the camera is phenomenal - I can carry it around for an entire day with no arm/shoulder soreness at all! IT IS too large for you to put in most jacket pockets and will never fit in one of my jeans pockets unless I start wearing huge baggy jeans, but it's more than small enough for me to fit 3-4 prime lenses with it in my Crumpler 5 Million Dollar camera bag (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TIQW4K/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i01).-The hybrid viewfinder. This thing is wicked versatile and useful as h*ll. When you're shooting low-light, use the optical viewfinder so you can actually see in front of you! When you're shooting a landscape and you want to confirm your frame lines, use the electronic one! Then, when you're using the optical viewfinder to wait for a dog, a car, or a raging alcoholic to come into your frame, quickly flip to the electronic viewfinder (with the DOF preview button or the flip switch on the front of the camera) to confirm focus!-The image quality. Holy mother of God. This thing spits out incredible pictures. I've never had so much fun with a camera because THE IMAGES ARE SO FRICKIN GOOD. Even when something looks bad or bland on the LCD, it can look amazing on a 27\" monitor or a large print. Simply put, I've never had to do so little post-processing in my life.-The High-ISO capabilities. Just put this thing on Auto ISO 3200, and start shooting. If it allowed you to go as high as Auto ISO 6400, I'd use that instead. ISO 6400 has the right amount of grain to make the picture look like slightly like film, so even that's usable. But don't ever go above 6400, you'll regret it. Either way, having nearly noise-free images at ISO 3200 is a technological marvel (and no full-frame w/ 16MP jammed inside, mind you!) that you wouldn't have gotten 4 years ago unless you were shelling over $3000 for a D700 (which is full frame AND only has 12MP, so the sensor dots/pixels are larger and produce less noise!)-This is usually overlooked, but I'd like to mention how good Fuji's in-camera white balance and JPEG processing is. THIS SAVES SO MUCH TIME. The auto-white balance on the X-Pro1 is pretty much spot on in all but the most extreme conditions, so I pretty much NEVER adjust the white balance/temperature of the photo in Lightroom/Photoshop! Moreover, they coupled it with an amazing in-camera JPEG processor (as good as Olympus', IMO), so if you're shooting JPEGs you can just avoid post-processing all-together! So many people talk about how they shoot RAW, how RAW is better, how a real photographer knows how to post-process, but screw them! Why not just get the picture right the first time and then go straight to printing/publishing??? This is a hugely underrated aspect of this camera, and it's perhaps the greatest thing about the camera because IT ALLOWS YOU TO JUST TAKE PICTURES ALL THE TIME. Never has photography been so simple for me. I never worry about getting the tones of the colors right anymore and I never worry about spending too much time in post-processing anymore. The last album I published to Flickr had 17 photos in it. The pictures were taken from a BBQ I had hosted where I took 19 shots total. All 17 photos published to my Flickr were OUT OF CAMERA JPEGS. I did absolutely no post-processing. I thought about cropping one photo, but eventually decided against it. The two photos I left out of the album were because the subjects in those photos didn't look too attractive (I was publishing to Facebook too, and you know how women are when you post unattractive pictures of them online..) as I was shooting candidly and just caught them in an unattractive pose.-The manual controls. (FYI I shoot about 50% aperture priority, 40% manual, and 10% shutter priority) Do you know how refreshing it is to have a mechanical, and not electronic, shutter dial on my camera again? Do you know how refreshing it is to have an aperture dial again on my lens? Do you know how great it is for that aperture dial to have 1/3 stop increments? Do you know how refreshing it is to have a manual exposure comp dial again instead of having to dig for it through menus? Well, imagine having all of that back in one camera. Yes, it's the Olympus OM-D EM-5...LOL jk. While the EM-5 certainly does have most of those features, it lacks in fast primes and image quality IMO. Plus it's MFT..you're not going to get that glorious bokeh you want on an EM-5 because you're limited by the sensor size. Full frame > APS-C > MFT, period (if you're talking about bokeh =D). Anyways, you get the picture here..the X-Pro1 has all of the aforementioned manual controls and they're bokehlicious.-The preset color modes/filters. The simulated Velvia mode is great for landscapes, and the Black & White Yellow filter is great for street photography. One more thing that slims post-processing time.As a final note, I'd like to mention that this camera is not for beginners. You really need to know what you're doing and you really need to understand photographic concepts to be able to think around problems, because the camera is quirky. If you're a beginner, you're going to have a hard time working around the camera's limitations. That being said, a beginner can totally pick up some photography books like Bryan Peterson's Understanding Exposure and figure out all the kinks and idiosyncrasies of the X-Pro1 for his/her own benefit. But it will be challenging, IMO. If you're an intermediate/enthusiast, I think you'll enjoy the challenges the camera poses to you that will force you to become a better photographer. If you're an expert, well..you're an expert so you shouldn't have a problem with the camera.All in all, the final rating I'm giving this camera represents one thing: how good the images are and how well it facilitates you taking good images. I believe camera reviews should focus on that instead of high-ISO pixel peeping tests and megapizel/DXOmark sensor comparisons. All I care about is the end result and how easy it was to get that end result. While the camera has its nuances and limitations, I have to give it 5 stars because, like I mentioned before, the image quality is just PHENOMENAL, and the in-camera auto-white balance, color modes/filters, and JPEG processing just makes it SO EASY to take pictures and go straight to publishing. Other cameras may shoot more frames per second, may have a faster buffer, may have more megapixels, and may have faster autofocus ALONG WITH image stabilization and weather sealing. But NO OTHER CAMERA (outside of a Leica) makes photography so fun again and optimizes your time outside in the field actually SHOOTING (rather than in front of a computer screen).Yes, the focusing is a bit slow. Yes, the camera is expensive. Yes, I wish there were wide angle lenses available for this camera. But damn did Fujifilm make a darn good camera this time around.(P.S. credit the bespoke X-Trans CMOS sensor)Edit: One more note. Buy an extra battery or two (you can find them for super cheap on eBay) for this camera and don't look back. It'll let you get through an entire day of shooting.

I loved my 5dM2 and the pictures it made, but I found myself leaving the camera bag at home more than not because of heft.  I had to be planning a \"photo day\" or it was left at home.  The X-Pro 1 has really helped in this respect.  I am a 50/50 shooter in that I do about 50% paying jobs and about 50% personal hobby work.  I have already done a couple of paying jobs with the X-Pro 1 and have been nothing but impressed.  I am currently using the 35mm f/1.4 and 60mm f/2.4.  I am considering the 18mm f/2.0 but may wait for the 14m f/2.8.Of course the biggest qualms thus far from everyone have been with the AF.  I must say that it is slower than a DSLR in amost every application, but coming from a 5dM2 it is not that much slower.  I have found that it may actually be more accurate or at least equal in accuracy.  The important thing to remember is that you are not going into this with a top notch AF.  With that in mind and knowing what kind of photography is more applicable, this camera does not disappoint.Ok just a few key points that I want to emphasize:+Image quality is undeniably excellent+Color accuracy is best I have ever seen+Tonal range is incredible+Bokeh rendering is smooth and pleasing 90% of the time+Feel/heft is very positive for me+Both OVF and EVF are very useful in my opinion+35mm lens is the best lens I have owned thus far (Only lens comparable is the Canon 135mm f/2 IMO)+60mm Macro is great and consisten but with slightly slower AF but GREAT for portraits+Film simulations are fun to use and the Velvia really makes the colors \"pop\"+Quality feels great in my opinion+Aperture control on the lens makes me feel \"involved\" with the picture and allows more video control+ISO performance is like nothing I have ever seen+Customers have commented on the \"feel\" of the pictures being excellent+I do not mind carrying it with me everywhere I go-AF can hunt at times but is manageable-Aperture chattering can be distracting, but to be honest I barely notice it now-Would like a few more customizeable buttons (Firmware fixable)-RAW Processing (Will be fixed soon)-Battery life (HAve always carried multiple batteries anyways)-MF is a unique and not particularly pleasant experience (but I am getting used to it)-Would like IS but understand somewhat the omission and I think lens will have later-Would like a 23mm (35mm equivalent)-Still somewhat unsure of the utility of AE-L/AF-L button and placementSo as you can tell, I believe the positives far far outweigh the negatives.  I loved my Canon 5dM2 and I am in love with the X-Pro 1.  The camera has gotten me to taking more pictures and really enjoying my photography again.  I will continue to expand this review as my experience with this camera grows but in my truthful and honest opinion, I think that this is a great camera.  It is important to know the negatives when purchasing this camera but if you understand what this camera is for and that fits you then you will absolutely LOVE this camera.Good luck and please feel free to post any comment or questions!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tries to do everything, good at only a few thiings", "Author": "Geeky Tom", "ReviewID": "RUTIGX6GDMXK8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Some background: I have been an avid photographer for 35 years.  My days shooting film are still fondly remembered.  I've owned nearly every Canon and Nikon DSLR ever made.  I am (was?) a Nikon shooter and a Leica rangefinder shooter, but decided about 6 months ago to give mirrorless systems a try.  My first was a Sony NEX-5N and then a Sony NEX-7.  Both do well, but are very \"digital.\"  My hopes for the X-Pro1 were that it would be a \"Leica with digital on the side.\"It isn't.  Unfortunately, it does neither \"digital\" well nor \"analog\" well.On the digital side, the autofocus is ... bad.  I returned a Sigma SD-1 for similar reasons.  It can't focus in all but the best light.  When the light gets poor, it hunts.The hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder is a nice idea in theory.  But Fuji blew it.  The EVF has far too slow a refresh rate.  So what you see when you press the shutter isn't what you're going to get at the end.  Furthermore, the optical finder's display goes strangely cloudy/foggy when the brightlines are illuminated.  This is worse in the dark.The digital side some more: the central control dial is, as Amadou Diallo said on his dpreview \"First impressions,\" \"strangely under-utilized.\"  I can't agree more.  In most modes, the control dial does nothing.  Also, the \"Q\" menu is a nice idea, but it only goes away if you press the \"Q\" again.  If you press the shutter half way, it does not go away.  That's not the usual and expected behavior.  This would be like having the central PRNDL in a car replaced with DRPLN or somesuch.  In general, there are many UI features that have this kind of \"hey, that didn't do what I expected\" kind of quirkiness.The eye detection for the OVF/EVF is not well executed, sadly.  I wear glasses.  It doesn't do the right thing and enable the OVF/EVF half of the time.  I resorted to switching it to viewfinder only.  The annoyance there is that when the preview of a shot pops up after the exposure, it only does so in the viewfinder and not the larger monitor.The build quality.  Yes, it's \"good,\" but this is not an extremely solid camera.  I was expecting something with a more solid feel.  Each of the NEX-7, D7000, Epson R-D1 or even Panasonic GF1 felt more solid in the hand than this. It's metal clad, yes, but feels less dense than it should.  The shutter speed dial is cheaper feeling than it should be.  I was shocked, picking this up, that for a $1700 camera the quality wasn't better.  Some might say \"hey, why are you complaining the camera is too light, isn't that a good thing?\"  I would tend to agree.  Here there's something missing that even added weight wouldn't fix.  The plastic leatherite coating is too slippery.  The hand grip is too slight.  I could go on.  This is my opinion, but again, I've used a LOT of cameras.  'Nuff said.The focus and aperture are \"by wire.\"  What that means is when you turn the aperture ring, the camera has a lag before it changes the aperture.  Similarly, and frustratingly for manual focus, the focus ring has the same lag.About manual focus: you must use the EVF in magnify mode to get critical focus, and that has its own slow refresh rate issues.  The quandary for practical shooting is that the autofocus is lacking and the manual focus is slow due to the EVF.  In low light, this leaves you with few if any options besides \"hope I get it right.\"  Not really what I'd want in a camera.  The NEX-7 does a much better job here and, as others have pointed out, includes the Focus Peaking feature to add another focusing aid.  That's strangely not implemented in the X-Pro 1.The metering in the camera frequently stops down the lens to get a reading, and then opens it back up.  So what you hear when you use the camera is a lot of clicking.  It's actually quite audible because the body is so un-dense that it doesn't damp the noise.  My subjects commented on this strange noise and wondered what it was.  Bad for candids, to say the least.All in all, that adds up to a lot of annoyances.  This camera was killed by many small cuts for me.The image quality is great, no question.  But--and here's the rub-- it is only great when you can get the focus, etc, right.  So having such a cool sensor in such a crippled body is a shame.  It's like a beautiful woman with chronic bad breath.  You have to hold your nose to enjoy it.What did I do?  I returned it to Amazon.  I'm going to wait for the Olympus OM-D E-M5 to see if it satisfies my yearning for a \"mostly analog\" digital camera.  Meanwhile, I'm doing OK with the Sony NEX-7.  As for the X-Pro 1, for me, it doesn't do it.  Your mileage may vary.  Fanbois, don't flame me.  This is an opinion.

Great for Landscapes, Streets, and Models.", "Author": "Andrionni Ribo \"Amateur Critical Analyst\"", "ReviewID": "R4F4YR558A7V5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "-Photographer Background & Introduction-I'm an amateur photographer that sometimes gets paid for what I do (therefore making me a part time professional [I guess]). My last camera body is a Canon 5D Mark II and own a variety of L glass zooms and good quality Canon primes. I enjoy shooting landscapes, nature, street, and event work. I was looking for a camera that's lighter than my 5D Mark II to utilize for travel and doesn't short in image quality. I'm pretty passionate in the art of photography.At the time of this review, the current cameras in the mirrorless market for me was this camera, the Sony NEX-7, and the Olympus OM-D E-M5. All of these cameras have pros and cons and I played the game debating which camera system is best to invest in. I eventually went with the Fujifilm X-Pro 1 and am quite satisfied.  This reviews covers my thoughts on it.Update (4/2013): I've been shooting with this camera for over a year. I've updated parts of my review. Still a solid entry in the market.-PROS-1. Image Sensor:This is probably the biggest reason why I enjoy this camera so much. This bold take on the APS-C-sized image sensor design is pretty legit. When the ISO is cranked up to 3200, there's absolutely zero color noise (or any noise) and images look pretty sharp. The dynamic range is impressive with a good amount of detail brought on in darks and shadows and good control over blowout on the high end. Colors are typically spot on unless it's red. JPG file output are screaming quality. Daytime photos look great. Nighttime photos look great. Still a lot of flex with my Lightroom workflow. The image quality is just as good as the RAW output on the 5DMkII.2. Prime Lens Library:Prime lenses typically equate to high quality photos, and Fujifilm went and released prime lenses for the general range. I went and picked up the 18mm f/2, 35mm f/1.4, and 60mm lenses f/2.4. This translates for 35mm full-frame users to a near-28mm (for landscape work), near-50mm (for the normal-angle style), and near-85mm focal length (great for portrait). The glass for all 3 of these lenses are sharp and contrasty  and have performed wonderfully in my use. The bokeh quality for all these lenses is creamy, however, depth of field isn't as shallow as full-frame, as expected, but should be noted.Update (4/2013): Focus has been sped up for many lenses thanks to Fujifilm's constant dedication to pushing through updated firmware. Another firmware will be coming up when they release the new telephoto zoom. I just picked up their 14mm prime and love the performance and build.3. Hybrid Viewfinder:I'm loving the hybrid viewfinder. Want to shoot SLR style? Hit the switch and you get the Electronic Viewfinder. It's a bit sluggish but gets the job done in low light stills regardless.(Update 4/2013) It's faster, needs focus peaking like the competition.The optical viewfinder is great if you don't want lose that moment with the click. There are electronic frame lines in the optical view finder to help frame composition and it's nice to see them adjust with the quality of light available.  The frame lines also adjust for parallax effect as you adjust the focal length which is pretty intriguing and implemented pretty well.One thing I truly enjoy with this camera's viewfinder is the hyperfocal distance meter integrated in the manual focus bar. When the camera is set at a certain aperture and focal length, (which is great when shooting street or group) the camera gives you an idea what's in focus. Pair that with the image sensor capabilities and you get a pretty lethal combination when out on the streets.4. Weight/Portability/Style:It looks like a vintage-style rangefinder camera. It's light. It's black. It doesn't fit in my pocket, but slings around my body with no problem. I picked up a Street Strap - 46\" Soft Round Camera Strap for Leica, Micro 4/3, Fuji Cameras with Round Rings and like how low-profile (black rope), durable, and functional it is and feel it pairs well with the camera.-CONS-1. Auto-Focus/Manual-Focus:(Update 4/2013) Thanks to Fuji's attention to complaints, the autofocus has been drastically improved for all the lenses. It's quite responsive, but will never replace phase detect focusing that's integrated to other cameras. Here's hoping this is introduced in the X-Pro2.2. Quirky Firmware:(Update 4/2013) It doesn't really crash or perform funny anymore. It's either I've adapted, or they squashed all the quirks through the firmware updates.3. RAW Support:(Update 4/2013) Adobe and Apple now have RAW support. No longer an issue.4. Battery Life:I took it to an Occupy protest with some heavy use.  I ran through 2 batteries in a quarter of a day. I have to further study how much of what drains the battery. At other times, the battery goes a good part of the day.5. It's Not Weather-Sealed.-ADAPTATION-This camera doesn't shoot like an SLR. There's a curve to learning how to harness the camera and the operation manual is a valuable resource in helping use this thing.  Please be mindful.As discussed in other reviews, once you get its quirks. The thing is capable of outputting some seriously quality imagery.-CONCLUSION-(Update 4/2013) After over a year of use. The only other camera that has my attention is the Fujifilm X100S, and it's mainly because of its upgrades to focusing and that built-in 35mm equiv focal length lens (have to wait for end of the year for the 35mm equiv prime from what it looks like now). The image quality of this camera continues to impress. Its focus... not so much, however it's much much better than what it was before. It's my workhorse and companion. It goes with me everywhere, I'm looking forward to where Fujifilm is going in the future with this flagship camera and cameras to come.This camera is ideal for photographers that are familiar with cameras already and understand histograms and have a good grasp in manual control.It's great for street photography, low light stills, model photography, travel photography, wedding photography, and landscape work. It's not so great for sports and maybe fast kids. Rangefinders aren't typically ideal for sports anyway, yes? Crank the aperture and ISO and prefocus when working with kids.Comments, criticisms, and questions welcome.I've included some example images and a optical viewfinder example and further discussion of it in the user-submitted photos of this camera.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Using the X-Pro 1 with Leica M lenses", "Author": "Nam de Ploom", "ReviewID": "R3MUZAAQFO1Q9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting with the XP1 for a month. I'm a Leica M shooter, one accustomed to film and manual focus, and who has no plans on getting an M9p any time soon (I have used one, but it's too pricey at 9K for me; and I do own, use, and appreciate my Canon MKII 5D; and I have tried a Nex7 with my M's, too, so I'm not a digital illiterate). I ordered an M adaptor ring from eBay and have been shooting with Leica glass on the Fuji for a week, mostly a 35mm F2 Summicron. This 2K lens on this 1.7K body produces images that are nothing short of wonderful. Yes, the crop sensor upconverts the lens to about 53mm, but the shots I'm getting are insane. You control aperture and iso; the camera controls shutter speed (or can). Outdoors, focus is not an issue when the lens is wide open: to infinity and beyond. Also, the manual focus is easy and clear. On the Fuji lenses it is, admittedly, both lame and largely purposeless, given that the autofocus, whether slow or not, is accurate (in my experience [and it's really not that slow, friends, unless you're shooting missile launches]). But manual focussing my M lenses is fast and accurate. If you have good eyesight and you have experience with a manual, you'll have no problems. My bottom line is this: if you have M-glass, the Fuji is a cheap body for *that* purpose -- the purpose of getting ridiculously gorgeous images instantly that have that Leica look and feel, crisp and creamy (and don't get me started on the bokeh, which is just crazy-pretty through this lens/sensor combo). From my standpoint, the only thing that Fuji could do to make me happier would be to add a mic input for the XP2.

Has enough weight to feel good in the hands and the size is perfect to moi -- not too big, but not overly tiny, as some cams being released of late. Ergonomically, the camera handles well - button placement is very good and the grip works well enough, although it could be a little bigger to offer a more secure one handed grip.The dials all have a solid feel to them as they move. Nothing lose fitting, etc.The viewfinder is a hybrid EVF / OVF -- There are both positive & negative points to using each option.For example, the OVF excels for seeing outside the frame, but you lose the ability to distinguish if you've secured focus on exactly what your're hoping to focus on.What's great is the fact that if you disable the image review function, (which brings up the image just taken for immediate review for either 1.5 or 3 secs), while in OVF mode, you will see the subject at the very moment the photo is taken without losing momentary sight of the subject, and rangefinder shooters will know what I'm referring to here.In DSLRs for example, the moment the mirror slaps/shutter closes, the screen blacks out for a split sec, and you don't get to see the exact point at which the photo was snapped -- the most critical point! You can of course bring up the image for review afterwards by pressing the play button. Again, the downside is that you don't know for sure if you've nailed the focus on the object of your intent.The OVF also great for a moving subject, as you don't see the lag from the EVF. It works (focuses) better on objects further away from you, say maybe from a 3 - 5 foot starting point. When you're get closer than about 3 feet to an object, I recommend switching to the EVF for more accurate focus ability.The OVF also gets a bit dim / dark to view through when the lighting is low. Additionally, the frame lines displayed do not exactly correspond to what the final outputted picture will be, and this can be a bit annoying if you don't know / expectant of this. (this is not a defect but a byproduct of parallex compensation)Now, the EVF gets you perfect framing, as you're looking through the lens. You can also see exactly what's being focused on and if you've hit your point of focus -- depth of field can be viewed as well. Brightness is quite good but the it does get a bit sluggish / laggy when viewed in dim light or panning the camera very fast.I would say the EVF is a small step below the VF2 on the olympus cams. I would like to see the EVF a bit bigger as far as the overall viewing frame -- the VF2 from olympus seems to offer a larger viewing area.AF has been noted in several reviews as piss poor, but I would have to strongly disagree with this -- especially after downloading the latest firmware. I have absolutely no issue with the autofocus -- focuses just fine with the 35mm 1.4 under most conditions -- you just have to understand the limitations of such a system of autofocus (contrast detection based) -- you might get a some hunting if your subject and background and of similar color / contrast, but otherwise, it does it's job properly. Might not be as fast as the latest Nikon DSLR, but is certainly comparable to something like a 5d.This camera's main attraction, and what makes it worthy of the large asking price, is the final image quality overall and also the quality of the image at higher ISOs.Overall image quality at low ISO (say 100 - 800) is indeed inspiring -- virtually noise free images from ISO 100- 400 -- the output from this sensor matches or outperforms nearly all of the creme de la creme of current crop sensors and arguably surpassing the whole lot of them -- I haven't discerned any camera, from any manufacturer, that produces a finer photo with this sensor size -- and I've compared LOTs of photos and peeped more pixels than I should ever be peering into. Fuji's claim that the photo quality can rival full frame sensors is not BS. In fact, upon comparision and in certain cases, this little Fuji outperforms the coveted Canon 5d, which admittedly has superb output.It also works wonders with high ISO (from the 1000 - 3200 range) -- It's output at ISO 3200 is as good or better than many full frame Canon or Nikons, save for the perhaps the very latest releases -- the newest & mightiest Nikon might beat it out by a tad, but the difference is very marginal and most likely only seen on larger sized prints.Compared to my micro 4/3 E-P2 (which I love dearly), I get cleaner photo's at ISO 3200 than I do with the E-P2 at ISO 800 -- same thing with my old Canon 50d -- ISO 800 on that Canon looks like ISO 2000 on this Fuji. With ISO 3200 images being relatively clean, you can confidently shoot a moderately fast lens (min F/2.0) in low light scenarios. Having such a usable high ISO, I feel this camera would make a wonderful night time cam without having to resort to flash.Lenes -- I'm only currently using this cam with the 35mm F1.4 fuji lens -- this is an excellent lens with wonderful optics, and is sharp even at its widest apeture -- light weight too & priced very nicely -- an excellent 35mm which rivals the Canon 35mm L in image quality, and that's saying something, as that Canon is a very popular lens and for good reason.Also, I have a few Voigtlander / Zeiss lens, and they performs very well on this cam -- I'm using a RainbowImaging adapter ($25.00) and it locks securely with no play. The output is pleasing (no excessive softness or light falloff/color casts) -- The two lens I've tried are the VC 35mm F/1.2 (VI) & the Zeiss 50mm F/2.0 Planar -- You can only view/compose through the EVF, but I hear Fuji is releasing a special M adapter that also alows use of the OVF as well for various focal lengths...pretty cool!Focusing with manual only lenses works well -- change the camera to manual focus and you have the ability to zoom in (10x zoomed view) to check critical focus. This whole process works very similar to the way it works on my E-p2. I would like to see Fuji add a focus peaking option, or the option to change the zoom magnification, added in a future firmware update.Battery life is not bad, but not overly great; I can about 400 photos -- maybe more if you use the OVF or a manual legacy lens as the battery isn't being drained by the auofocus.This camera can shoot a burst of 6 FPS which is fine for me in such a cam -- afterall, this isn't a super spec pro sport shooting SLR. Bracketing modes are a plenty. I like that you can set the camera to shoot film with the one touch function botton -- sorry, I haven't really had a chance to test the movie mode, but I'm more of a still shooter anyhow, so the video feature is a bit wasted on the likes of me.It has a great panorama feature which allows you to pan the camera in a horizontal line by taking multiple photos along the pan and then stitches them all together for the final panoramic image. Nice and easy to do, and the final images look great!I've rated the camera as 5 star, but it was tough coming to this conclusion -- the MAIN reason for that is the price point of $1700.00 for the body only, or $2,300.00 when you factor in the 35mm lens. A bit much, and you can get an older model full frame DSLR for about that amount, assuming you like or have a need for those big hefty power cams.There are two things that this camera does however, that in my opinion, make it worth the hefty price tag.First being the delivered image quality, at any ISO up to 3200; it's simply superb -- I cannot imagine someone being disappointed here -- easily at the top or near the top of a long list of good cameras.The other thing that I feel justifies the cost is simply the overall handling and experience you feel when shooting with this cam -- This cam is an absolute dream to shoot with -- It begs to be taken places and shot with -- the fine build quality, the weight, the way the dials work, and of course that most beautiful shutter sound (amongst the best I've heard!)- this cam just makes shooting a very emotional and enjoyable experience. This cam slows you down and allows you to concentrate on the basics of photography, so often forgotten in today's all too modern world; It draws the closest to matching the experience of shooting with a Leica rangefinder (for those of you who've had that privaledge). Oh, and consider a soft release -- makes a great addition to the handling of the camera.Recommended!", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Something in the eyes", "Author": "Andi Setiadi \"doyyy\"", "ReviewID": "R1CYLYGLZA7491", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer or even a great one, but I love photography and that one is true.

That is why I went for the Fuji X Pro1; Had to sell the Oly to fund the Fuji, damn expensive for me.Enough background talk. The reason I gave it 5 stars despite all the quirks that sometimes made me want to throw the camera is...the pictures.

It led me to believe that this camera is more intimate than any other camera I've used; It's not just an item, it's personal. It's the process of getting the pictures that made me love the Fuji.I am not blowing things up or simply a fanboy, but all the portraits that I got from this camera is different. Especially the eyes. If I look closely, Fuji captures the reflection in the eyes beautifully. Maybe it's my lack of skills when using all my previous cameras, but for me it is different. You have to really try and see it for yourself to really understand what I'm talking about. All the portraits that I took using the Fuji gave me emotions that speak to me.Well that is me, you have your own opinions. But don't believe all the reviews whether it is positive or negative, heck don't believe me, just grab one, shoot something and then see it for yourself.p.s: Get an additional battery.

I am not troubled by the auto-focus with the 35mm lens, it works well and is accurate. The camera is noticeably larger than my GF1 or for that matter the Sony \"competitors\" but the visual impact is far less than with a pro looking DSLR of similar size. It feels right and works like a camera should without touch screen silliness or other consumer friendly \"features\". Although it can certainly shoot video, it is a camera for shooting really nice still images and does not try to be everything for everyone. My brief experience with an Sony NEX-7 leaves me much preferring the Fuji. Although the specs on the electronic viewfinders would point to the Sony I prefer the electronic viewfinder on the Fuji and the option of optical really puts the two far apart.  I like the view finder, both the optical and electronic work well and allow framing of the shots with easy. It works well with manual lenses (Pentax screw mount so far but there is some Voightlander glass on the way)The only thing that could be significantly improved with this camera are the focusing tools for manual glass. The zoom function works ok but it isn't anywhere near as easy to use as a real range finder or manual slr camera. It seems like there must be some software based changes that could improve the function or enable the auto-focus check for manual lenses.The high ISO performance of the sensor is remarkable, that and the depth of field were major factors in my ditching micro four thirds. The small sensor size of m43 means that no matter what improvements are made it will still be inferior to a larger sensor in terms of shallow depth of field. The smaller crop factor of the APS-C sensor also means that legacy lenses are much more practical, sure full frame would be nice but this works really very well. I also like the Fuji dosen't pack too many pixels in there. 16M is more than enough, we don't need 24M in the same area.Yes it is expensive, a bit strange and has limited auto-focus lens options, but if you have some idea of what you are doing and want to make beautiful images this is a great camera. It is without doubt the best APS-C or smaller camera available for travel, landscape, street and other similar activities.

I was an early adopter of the micro four thirds camp with the Olympus E-P1 and Panasonic GF1 and before that, I owned cameras like Canon's G series, Panny LXs and even the Leica's equivalent to the LX. I even tried the Sigma DPs. Though the M43 cameras performed the best, I was still not sold on the small sensor. The quality is great - but by no means amazing (but the sigma dp sensor is quite amazing).Fast forward to today and I am THRILLED with the X-Pro1. Just like the x100, it's not the fastest camera around in terms of auto focus. But I never ever needed blazing fast AF. I don't shoot sports (why in the heck would you with these small systems)... and I definitely don't have any kids. I do have dogs but they're obedient enough to sit still for me to take a great photo.Street shots, not a problem. Travel photos - so far so darn good. This camera even handles really poor light well. Not sure dim light, but harsh lights and highlights. I attribute that to the nice dynamic range the camera offers.The only problem for me was the lens chatter. It didn't bother me but definitely bothered the people around me wondering what the heck the noise was. But it's gone now with the latest update so that's that.I own the 35mm and 18mm, the 18 being a birthday gift. I honestly thought I would use the 35 way more but I'm finding myself switching between the two quite often. The 35 is a stellar portrait lens for nice isolation and creamy bokeh, but the 18, while also producing nice bokeh, is a wondering focal length for environmental portraits - especially in travel.Anyway, I love the camera. I think it deserves 5 stars because of the reviews giving it 3 stars or less. This definitely does NOT DESERVE lower than 4. I suspect those rating it low, had no idea what they were doing when purchasing the camera. It's obviously not for them.And for the money, one can complain and compare about competing cameras.

With the firmware updated to 2.01 the focus performance is on par with most non-SLRs out there. It's still not great but again don't buy this camera if that is important to you. Coming from manual focus in the film days it really is not an issue that concerns me. The irony is that after the firmware update manual focus works so good that I am using it more and more.So even with the update, this is not suitable if your primary need is to shoot say sports or toddlers who can't keep still.

This is a complex instrument with an extensive array of settings; much thought went into it and it takes time to learn. I am comparing it with my Sony NEX 5n, which has the same size half-frame sensor, both 16 MP. (Yes, I realize that most people would think X-Pro should be compared with the Sony NEX 7 instead, but I found the 5n was a more desireable camera in the NEX line, smaller than the 7 and missing mainly the Electronic Viewfinder, which I tried but didn't like.) It also makes sense to compare it with a small DSLR like the new Nikon D3200, and I was able to get my hands on one of these temporarily. Finally I borrowed a new Nikon D800E to test Fuji's claim that their image quality was the equal of full-frame. This made for a very interesting direct comparison.IMAGE QUALITY. I compared images from all four cameras at two ISO values (3200 and 200), both JPG and RAW, all at the same focal length. (Of course the lenses were different - to minimize lens variance all were shot at f8.) I used Adobe Lightroom 4 to compare both the RAW and JPG images. Results: All four were excellent and as expected the Nikon D800E was best - but not by much. The surprise was that the XPRo1 images were creamy and smooth and distinctly superior, both in RAW and JPG to the other half-frame sensors and indeed came very close to the D800E, except of course in pixel density (16MP vs 36MP). It is impressive that the Fuji is able to come so close to full frame in image quality. After D800E and XPro1, Sony is next in line and the Nikon D3200 last, with the noisiest images at high ISO; of course it also costs 1/5 the D800 and 1/3 the Fuji price. In spite of these marginal differences in image quality, the Sony NEX and Nikon 3200 are both excellent and have much to be said for them on practical measures.SIZE. I like the size of the Fuji and find it comfortable, but it is much larger than the NEX 5n, which is pocketable, at least with certain lenses. The Fuji, while lightweight, has about the same bulk as the Nikon D3200, which has similar dimensions and weight. I would call the Fuji an innovative alternative for half-frame digital, with an emphasis on 'rangefinder retro' handling and fine optics, rather than a replacement for DSLR.VIEWFINDER. All technology design involves tradeoffs. By going mirrorless, the X mount lenses are able to work with an extremely short flange-to-sensor distance (18 mm, same as Sony NEX E-mount), which allows for superior optical performance not possible when a mirror must be accommodated (Nikon DSLR has 47mm). But DSLR is still a superior viewfinder for most purposes. The X-Pro compensates by offering three different ways to frame a photo; the LCD on the back (non-articulated), the eye level optical viewfinder, provided with internal moving optics to frame the available 18, 35 and 60 mm focal lengths, and the electronic viewfinder which sees what the mounted lens actually sees and can preview focus. Unfortunately none of these three are really satisfactory, nor in combination. There is a lot of buzz about electronic viewfinders but I don't like them; the image jumps around, has off colors, lacks detail, and has a tracking lag. The various frames of the XPro optical viewfinder I found just a distraction. None of this replaces the simplicity and speed of the SLR. Overall, the X-Pro viewfinders are difficult to use and reminded me why SLR replaced the Leica M fifty years ago. I would prefer a much simpler XPro body with no optical viewfinder and a larger, simpler EVF.MANUAL FOCUS AND AUTO FOCUS: Focus needs improvement. Manual focus is significant for X-Pro users in order to use non-Fuji lenses, specifically Leica M mount. Unfortunately, in practice manual focus is cumbersome and slow on the X-Pro. Whereas the NEX has a very helpful function built in to assist with manual focus called \"peaking\" - the infocus areas light up on the LCD with a red or yellow highlight - the Fuji has no such special assist and the magnified view works strangely. Even the native Fuji lenses do not themselves have a genuine mechanical manual focus; turning the ring on the lens just activates the \"focus by wire,\" and there is a lag. So Fuji can be used easily in autofocus mode only. But the Fuji autofocus is also challenged. It particularly doesn't work well with the 60mm lens in low light; hunts but does not find. Don't count on the Fuji in fast moving situations where a second's delay may lose you the photo. Focus, both manual and auto, are the most serious faulta of the X-Pro system.ODDITIES and LEARNING CURVE: Fuji is the camera maker with the most idiosyncratic style. One must love them for their innovations, and the courage to design and manufacture their own unique sensors. But they go their own way, and some of the quirky details are distracting. The Fuji has many choices and options in a maze of menus and Q panels and buttons and wheels. You can for example, set bracketing not only of exposure, but of ISO, or of rendering styles (different Fujifilm color film models). There are three possible ways to get at parameters such as ISO; menus, the Q panel, and the Fn button; why? Wouldn't it be much better to have fewer buttons and menus and levers and wheels and just choose one nice simple way to change each parameter? I find the Fuji interface far too complicated and the logic how it is all laid out far from obvious. There are puzzles. For example, a nice little thumbwheel / pushbutton installed on the back could be helpful for so many settings, but is barely utilized; in most cases where one would think to thumb this dial, it just does nothing. Expect to invest hours in experimenting and studying the manual, and still you will be frustrated by the convoluted thinking of the designers. Contrast the Sony 5n which is easy to learn; just some simple menus, and the Nikons, with their familiar interface. The DPReview website points out further anomalies of the XPro settings system, some which should never have been allowed to leave the factory. Half baked.COST: The Fuji body costs almost 3X the NEX 5n body, almost 50% more than the NEX 7, and three times the Nikon 3200 with kit lens. And you are going to be restricted to Fuji's line of proprietary lenses, which are expensive. All these cameras take high quality photos; if you care about cost, Fuji is not the system for you.CUTENESS: Let's face it, we love our fetish objects, and relating well to your camera's handling is a part of producing great photos. The NEX is slim and sleek and has that Sony precision magic. The Fuji is chunky and weird and endearing, and looks exactly like my old Yashica Electro 35GT rangefinder from 1970. It is built with high precision and quality, and makes intriguing clicking noises. I find the shape and size comfortable for easy handling. As a tactile toy, it is a pleasure to use. Irresistable. But it is clear that style and retro coolness were driving factors in the X-Pro design; also true for the X100, obviously designed under a bad case of Leica-envy. Fuji has hired an advertising and graphics firm to create the dramatic brochures, website, packaging, and product envelope. All this marketing and retro fashion makes me a little uncomfortable because it tells me the X-Pro is partly about style, not just photography, and of course that inflates the price tag. Emulating the Leica M3 optical viewfinder technology from 1954 - with all the same clumsiness today as back then - is taking nostalgia a little too far. As for the Nikon D3200, not cute, plastic lens mount, utilitarian. But I admire Nikon for making great photo results available to more people by keeping 'build quality' (and price) to the necessary minimum.DISCUSSION: The XPro is uneven. Fuji achieves beautiful JPEG's from a breakthrough sensor combined with designed-from-scratch lenses; comparable in smoothness and noise to the top of the line FULL FRAME digital SLR. The body and lenses are precision made and a joy to handle. The exposure system and white balance are excellent. Image quality and build are the best features. But overall, Fuji's offbeat character, immature design, and high price should give most ordinary people pause. It's a unique architecture rather than a direct competitor to anything else. It is quirky. A good user interface should be so intuitive that the manual is unnecessary, but that definitely is not the case here. Unlike designs such as the Nikon or Canon SLR or Leica rangefinder which have been refined over decades, the Fuji X approach is a work in progress, with years to go before the bugs are out. Expect several firmware updates and then a second generation X-Pro in a couple of years. After using the X-Pro a few weeks, I found myself wishing they had simply installed their lovely sensor in a simpler box with a mirrorless SLR type design and a single, higher resolution EVF viewfinder. (Fujifilm may yet come out with this.) In the meantime, the autofocus is a serious limitation. Where will you see the X-Pro1 being used? By some professional photographers who love the IQ. And probably around the necks of rich orthodontists at one of those big dental conventions in Maui ..SUMMARY: If cameras were women, Fuji X-Pro1 would be an exotic femme fatale who entrances with her stunning beauty but is demanding and difficult to live with, has expensive tastes, refuses to cook, and doesn't speak much English. She's perfect for a wealthy Sugar Daddy. The Sony NEX 5n is more like an educated modern girl - accommodating, quiet and easier to live with. And the Nikon D3200 of course is your comfortable old girlfriend, the one you keep coming back to; dependable but not flashy. The D800E Nikon is a flashy movie star - but not practical or realistic for most of us.I'm fascinated by the X-Pro and plan to keep it (I suppose you can guess my tastes in women) but it's not for everyone. For those who want a very compact camera, with a large sensor and better image quality than any point-and-shoot, the Sony 5n is easier to recommend - more reasonable pricetag, smaller, simpler to use, and with the ability to recycle lenses you may already own. And if it's photos you care about rather than stylish toys, and you are OK with the volume and weight of the X-Pro, and you're on a budget, consider the Nikon D3200 - about the same size, a quarter the price, also a very good sensor at all but the highest ISO, accepts endless lenses, and the bugs worked out a long time ago.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fabulous image quality, but frustrating to use", "Author": "Nathan D Jedinak", "ReviewID": "R3N64YS29EMB0B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was always intrigued by the Fujifilm X100, but never pulled the trigger due to early reports of bugs, slow focusing, and the lack of interchangeable lenses.  When the X-Pro 1 was announced with companion ~28/50/90 lenses, at a relatively affordable price, I thought the Almighty himself had made a camera just for me. As a longtime Leica fan, I've learned those 3 focal lengths alone re enough for a lifetime of photographic expression.  Since then, Fuji has announced a ~21, 35/1.4, and an 85/1.4...  A lens roadmap to make me drool with anticipation!  Add to that early reports which put the image quality on par with full frame DSLRs and the Leica M9.So how's the reality?  I won't beat around the bush--image quality is everything you'd hope, and fully satisfies in the same way my Leicas satisfy me. Every time I open files from the X-Pro 1 I'm astounded by the feelings, the moods, the images created...  But getting there is an extremely frustrating experience.I'm not a full time pro, and nowadays am too busy with work and family life to shoot anything but personal work.  Much of what I shoot is a byproduct of where I am in life; with a young child, I often capture the fleeting moments of childhood, reveling in the memories I myself have of my own childhood. I want a camera that gets out of my way and doesn't impede the creative process; something like a Leica M3 or any modern DSLR disappears from consciousness, really, and just allows focusing on the creation of your image. Not so the X-Pro 1.With the X-Pro 1, I often feel as if the camera is \"fighting me\" in a manner reminiscent of compact cameras of yore; autofocus is sometimes fairly quick, and certainly accurate when it locks on the intended target, but mostly the AF pretty pathetic. Capturing the \"decisive moment\" is often a real chore with this camera, and I find myself shooting whenever the darn thing acquires focus just to \"get the shot\" rather than capturing the moment I want...  Focusing on young children is a real chore, and I often result to prefocusing to a point on the ground and tripping the shutter when the subject crosses that point--like shooting my ancient M3.  But even then, sometimes the camera is \"thinking\" or trips over itself, and shutter lag causes you to miss the moment entirely. It's just a frustrating experience.  My prior DSLR, a Canon 5D Mark II, was leagues ahead of this camera in speed of use....  And that's not a particularly fast camera!If I had the luxury of traveling the world all the time, this is possibly a camera I'd take, as with anything but kids it has proven to be good enough, has absolutely gorgeous image quality, I have faith that Fuji will improve it over time, and digital sure is more convenient than film.  But to be honest I'm faster with and generate a higher keeper rate from my Leica M3, which is pretty pathetic for an expensive camera circa 2012.  Although the lenses are STELLAR, and render beautifully, I'd recommend waiting until the X-Pro 2 comes out, to be honest.

I shoot primarily with Nikon, even though I have a Leica system (M8.2, M9). While I get great shoots with the Nikon, I thoroughly enjoy shooting with the Leica.

The picture quality is wonderful.  The handling is nice. It is also nice to have a program feature on a rangefinder (Leica only does Aperture preferred).  While this is not a Leica, it is nevertheless a very good camera.  However, even with the hybrid finder, it is important to remember to treat this camera like a range finder.  This is a camera that forces you to slow down and to focus on the picture.  With the past problems in Lightroom and Aperture with reading and processing Fuji's raw file now essentially a thing of the past, this camera is a true pleasure to use.  Please note that it will not do videos with the same quality as a Canon; it does not the breadth of lenses that you find with a Nikon; it does not offer you all of the bells and whistles that you find on a Sony NEX or A7 series.  Yet, it feels right when you are using it.  You get the same feeling with Pro 1 that you get with a Leica M9. It is the right size; it handles well. Finally, I really, really like FujiFilm's approach.  Initially, when this camera was released, it was plagued by several problems. Over time, however, FujiFilm has been fast to release on a regular basis firmware updates.  They listen to their users and they respond; that is the final feature that makes this camera system notable.A great camera.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fuji X-Pro1 Review", "Author": "Michael Montalto", "ReviewID": "RFDAMOF4G1ZVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ultimate travel camera and a potential replacement for your dSLR's on some levels.The Fuji X-Pro1 is a camera that addresses quite a few needs within the market place at an affordable price point.  The lenses that you can purchase with the camera are some of the best that I've ever used.As a professional photographer, one of the things that I hate about my dSLR's is the bulk & weight that I have to sling around with me at all points in time.  The Fuji X-Pro1 resolves this issue with a fantastic footprint in a package that is worthy of the very best considerations.The camera is a pro level camera.  The sensor size is a cropped sensor (full sensor in the wings) and the image quality, even at high ISO's such as 3200 and 6400 are very usable.  When I'm going on vacation, or to travel, this camera is always with me.  Picking up an R-Strap to go along with it makes the camera feel like a perfect fit as you walk around whatever area it is that you are traveling to.The brilliant part about the X-Pro1 is that it offers you a level of quality and functionality at a price point that is very reasonable.The newest firmware has addressed several of the auto-focus issues of the camera.  While there is a little bit of a learning curve as compared to a dSLR, I can tell you that by far, this is my favorite camera.  Don't get me wrong, I adore my Canon 5D3 with my 70-200, but I would trade that in for a medium format back in a heartbeat if I could.In the end, if you purchase a used version of this camera body and a used lens from a reputable source, there is no reason to not fall in love with this camera.It's light, versatile, takes outstanding images on a truly professional level, is comfortable to use, has an outstanding display and \"feels right in the hand\".  Not to mention the \"retro\" design of the body itself.My only worry is that when a full frame version of the camera comes out, I will want it as a replacement for my previous dSLRs.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R3VN13GTZHCRUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've hesitated writing a review since reactions-if any-tend to be extreme.My background is I'm an amateur photographer and nobody anywhere has paid me anything other than an occasional rare complement for a photo.I work in software and travel internationally a lot.I have gone through various phases of mild to severe Leica Red Dot Syndrome. (Hereafter referred to as LRDS.)I bought my wife a D-lux 4 which she loves if anything for the beautiful Leica case that, of course, comes extra. (Yes I know it's a Panasonic with an extra year of warranty and a free copy of Lightroom for $300 more. Who said LRDS was rational?)My first memories of photography were my parents using their Polaroid Land Camera and doing the proverbial wait 60-seconds and peel version of instant in the 60's and 70's.For those of you that know these cameras, the sound those bulbs used to make when they went off is as clear to me today as are the smells from the newly peeled photographs.Fast forward to today and it feels like we are in a new golden age of photography.Everyone is a photographer as everyone uses their phone to instantly upload and share whatever is happening in their lives at any moment.With Facebook paying 1 billion for Instagram, Kodak is less valuable in comparison which, for me, feels sad.My struggle with what to use for myself ultimately lead me to a D700.The D700 is truly amazing and a privilege to own.I have the 50mm 1.4 and the 28-300mm which amazes me with the pictures it produces across such a large range.My challenge with my kit is simply size and weight.For me the ratio of usage is the inverse to size and weight.The bigger it gets the less it comes out to play.While many might bemoan the iPhone as a 'real' camera, the reality is it's probably the most used and popular camera today.This issue of size and weight has pulled me, like an orbit of a remote planet, to circle Leica dealers in search of any justification for paying more than my first car for a camera that does less than my D700.I love Leica, their history and craftsmanship but there is no way I could get budget committee approval-known as my better half-for an M9 and Summicron lens.So with an awesome D700 that comes out for big events-vaca, family get togethers, holidays, etc.-what to use that fits in my briefcase and travels easily so it gets used in lots of spontaneous moments?My hope was the Fuji X-Pro1 would be my 'poor man's Leica M9' to go everywhere.Having used the X-Pro1 for the past few days with the 35 and 18mm lenses, I am, much like my feelings for my first girlfriend, both excited and exasperated at the same time.This is probably being too candid but the D700 masked my faults with sheer engineering prowess to make beautiful photos in my amateur hands.The X-Pro1 simply does not suffer fools: me in particular.The form factor is perfect.The quality resonates in the hand.The 35mm 1.4 is a bargain if you know the prices of the cheapest used Leica lenses.Nothing works like I'm used to and everything is new again.My initial jpeg's have awesome color but half are not in focus or the focal point was not where I wanted it.Yes the blades chatter like the Leica X1 which I briefly owned and then sent to ebay heaven.The EVF/OVF is not intuitive but I love the idea, effort and engineering behind it.No it's not a real rangefinder which could be good or bad depending on your point of view.Yes there are better cameras for less money.Yes I could buy and download a song off iTunes before the AF focused in low light.No I am not sending it back for the following:I've taken it EVERYWHERE. Even to Olive Garden to pick-up a to go order so I could try out some low light interior shots. Yup mostly out of focus.The rangefinder style, for me, fits perfectly in the hand.If you've ever held any Leica M, the X-Pro1 feels just as natural.I'm shallow enough to admit that if I don't LOVE my camera I won't USE it.I'm also faced with the need to elevate my amateur skills so I can get better more consistent results.This is not an open the box put the battery in and start blasting away as the kids run around the room camera.This is a camera to raise your game, remember or learn for the first time what those dials do that say exposure, shutter time, etc.This is a camera that makes you pause and think about composition.To me, all this makes it follow, build upon and heir to-in spirit at least-the Leica M tradition.If none of that matters or resonates with you, there are other choices for less money that will work better for your style of shooting.The point is to keep shooting with whatever you have.As for me, I'll be the guy probably with a bit of scowl looking at the playback then fiddling with the dials and trying again to capture what I thought I saw in the first place.That's fun for me.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "For me - a great camera", "Author": "pjintheusa", "ReviewID": "RCUZ33JU7VQBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I see a lot of drivel written about this camera all over t'interweb.

The manual aperture ring, speed dial and exposure compensation dials are outstanding. You feel like you are using a camera instead of configuring a computer.The other reviews here spell out the pros and cons. AF speed is good - the 60mm is slow especially indoor and in macro.

As good as most anything out there.High ISO performance is phenomenal.  Flash is almost an option.The 35mm f1.4 lens is way sharp at any setting.The standard color balance is pleasing to the eye in almost all lighting conditions.  It is the most film-like digital camera I have seen.The dynamic range is way above average.Complaints about the autofocus are somewhat overstated, IMHO.  It's no DSLR, but for non-action, it's fast and accurate.I would like to be able to set a minimum shutter speed and let the ISO vary when needed.  This is not possible (it is possible to set a fixed shutter speed and let the ISO vary).Shutter lag is minimal--not DSLR-quick, but much faster than p&s; cameras.While it is nowhere as bulky as a pro DSLR, it's no pocket camera.  A Lowepro Apex 110 will barely fit the camera.Choice of lenses is limited now, but more selection, including zooms, is supposed to come next year.A couple of other notes:I was showing X-Pro 1 photos to some of my image-savvy (movie biz) friends.  They immediately commented on the quality of the images and asked what camera was used.If you upload photos to an i-pad, the i-pad will put some hidden text files on the SD card.  This will cause the X-Pro 1 to take around 15 seconds to power up.  Lock the SD card before attaching it to an i-pad (and unlock before putting it back in the camera).I have a Nikon pro DSLR but it is just too big to take on most trips.  The X-Pro 1 gives me equal image quality but lets me carry a much smaller package.  I have several p&s; cameras (mostly Lumix) and they are great for quick shots and big zooming ranges.

The Fuji if combined with a manual lens and the experience of having used manual lenses and aperture control, is not far behind that full manual speed experience.The camera isnt really lacking in anything, perhaps weather sealing would be nice, and a heavier shell, and focus confirmation in the optical finder.The design of this camera makes it completely operable by touch alone, having a real speed and compensation dial, and aperture ring if you decide to go with adapted lenses (which I did, and opted not to buy into Fuji's own line of AF lenses), then the camera is almost everything a Rangefinder is with exception to the actual rangefinder focus mechanism, which is substituted with an electronic version through the EVF in the form of a magnified view of either 10x or an edge enhanced 3x which works remarkably well despite my initial skepticism.Because I never went with the Fuji lenses (which I have borrowed and can say with certainty that optically these are pretty fantastic, certainly better then 99% of both the Nikon or Canon lens L grade line-up and are matched to the X-Pro 1 sensor so are dedicated to the sensor, unlike my Aspherical Leica M mount lenses which were designed for film use but still produce a sensually dimensional rendering though perhaps not as razor sharp as todays Zeiss ZM optics or the Fuji 18(28)/2 35(50)/1.4 or 60(90)/2.4 Macro lens offerings.Its reassuring to know that both Zeiss, Schneider and Fuji have committed further lenses down the line for this camera lens mount design, the XF.There are minor ergonomic issues, which are correctable by enhancements which is a little annoying considering how poorly designed the Fuji handgrip is both in terms of its comfort in the hand over a prolonged period and for use with heavier lenses, and the blindingly obvious flaw of having to remove the grip to replace a battery or memory card. Also the asking price is astronomical for what it is. There are alternatives coming which have improved design though not necessarily cheaper.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like the X100, but better!", "Author": "AJNaperville", "ReviewID": "R1M3B0JRZLMRXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the X-Pro1 for a couple weeks now to photograph my family (as well as everything else) and the images are just incredible.  I used to use the Fuji X100 and while its still a great camera I wanted a different focal length then the 35mm equivalent field of view provided by the X100.  Getting to have that, plus an option to change to other lenses (once I can afford them!) is another bonus.The camera has been reviewed all over the internet, but basically the only thing I don't care for is the lack of any real continuous autofocus, but I've also used the NEX-5N, E-P3, GH2 and GF1 mirrorless cameras and while their autofocus operations might be marginally faster at times they still also don't have a useable continuous autofocus - in fact the only mirrorless camera I'm aware of that does is the Nikon J1/V1.It handles great, I love having the option to choose between an optical viewfinder (OVF) and full electronic viewfinder (EVF).  Its much lighter than it looks and it travels very well.  People don't feel as intimidated in front of it - which also makes for great photos.I bought the X-Pro1 with the 35mm f/1.4 and 18mm f/2 but I ultimately returned the 18mm lens and picked up the EF-X20 flash (and pocketed the change).  The 18mm is a great lens, but I am just not thrilled with that focal length, its a personal thing, I'm just not a huge fan of the 28mm-35mm equivlent field of view, I like my wide angle images at or below a 24mm equivlent and my 'walkaround' images at or above a 50mm equivalent.  I'll probably wait for a wider angle lens to be released and maybe will supplement that with a telezoom that is in the pipeline for 2013 - the 60mm f/2.4, while not 'slow' in the typical sense is about 1 stop slower than I'd rather have in a non-zoom telephoto lens (a 60mm to 90mm f/1.8 is what I would want instead of the 60mm f/2.4).While you certainly don't 'need' a flash with this camera (and a f/1.4 lens) - it's not always about light gathering, sometimes it's about light shaping.  There are times, especially outdoors, that you have two options either have a photo of your kids look very dark with the 'backlit' area behind them very bright - or you can overexpose to get the kids looking good but whitewash the background.  Instead I use fill-flash with Fuji's awesome TTL-based flash and get a near-perfect exposure with a balance subject and backlight.  It might not be what you always want in an image, but more often than not, for me it is.  The X20 flash is small, durable, surprisingly powerful, and you can pair it with a Canon OC-E3 off-shoe cord to do flash bouncing in your home.I also added a link for the Street Strap which a great alternative to neck strap, its comfortable, good looking, yet not bulky and doesn't take up room when you don't want it too.  If you don't want it on your neck or shoulder you can quickly wrap it around your hand a couple times and you have an instant wrist strap.  Who would have known... ;)Lastly - the camera comes with no ability to provide vision diopter correction.  So if you need correction you will need to order a diopter lens.  The camera uses 'standard' 19mm round diopters such as the ones by Nikon for the FM2/FM cameras or the Zeiss Ikon Rangefinder camera (the latter I prefer as they have a nice rubber edge on them).Is the camera worth a small fortune?  Maybe not - but then again it makes images better than my Canon 5D Mark II - which still sells for $2200, and it has a hybrid viewfinder.  I can say that the lens is a steal, the XF 35mm f/1.4 is simply fantastic easily comparable to the 35mm f/1.4L from Canon, you can't miss with this lens.This is a new 'system' (the Fuji XF Mount) and just like NEX took 2-3 years to fully establish a workable system, its going to take time with Fuji.  If you don't think you can learn to live (and love) with only 1, 2, or 3 lenses then just wait it out and check back in the future.  Alot of early adopters are quick to criticize a system based on a lack of system components (i.e. lenses), its just not fair with a new release.Understand you will have autofocus that is probably only a 'notch' better than what you get on point and shoot and you will accept the only 'downside' of this camera.  The build quality, the image quality, and nearly every other aspect is simply amazing and I personally, wouldn't trade it for anything else.Fujifilm Lens X-Pro1 35mm F1.4 LensFujifilm Accessory EF-X20 Shoe Mount FlashAputure Pro-Grade E-TTL / E-TTL II Off-Camera Hot-Shoe Flash Sync Cable, Cord for Canon EOS 10D, 20D, 30D, 40D, 50D, 7D, 5D, 5D Mark II, 1D, 1Ds, Mark II, III, IV EOS Digital Rebel t1i, t2i, t3,t3i,xt, xti, xs, xsi 300d, 350d, 400d, 450d, 500d, 550d, 60...Street Strap - 46\" Soft Round Camera Strap for Leica, Micro 4/3, Fuji Cameras with Round Rings", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "As any thing coming from Fuji, this is awesome", "Author": "Roberto Watson-Garcia", "ReviewID": "R2HKG4D6PBE30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "More than fourty years been a documentary photographer, last therty mainly leica m photography and this has been the best thing ever since, including the now older Leica M9.Fujifilm firmware and optics makes this direct finder camera a joy to use and discover.

Plenty was said about those, so I should mention things that either require some attention, or limit the use of this camera.Quirks that should be taken into account:1. RAW conversion. This camera has unusual sensor layout that works very well with internal RAW to JPEG conversion (done when photo is taken as JPEG, or using camera to generate JPEGs from previously taken RAW), or bundled Raw File Converter software (really modified Silkypix). Unfortunately for fans of other converters, NOTHING other than those two currently supports this sensor with comparable quality. DCRaw and everything based on it has \"zipper\" artifacts, Adobe software has \"watercolor\" artifacts, and getting a clean, high quality image from those is a matter of luck. Camera-produced JPEGs are of very high quality, and Silkypix can produce both 8-bit/channel and 16-bit/channel TIFFs that can be easily used as a starting point for further editing, however feeding RAW file to any other piece of software -- even one that formally supports the format -- produces inferior results. If you need RAW processing, convert RAW (.RAF) file to TIFF in Silkypix, and consider it \"the new RAW\".2. Autofocus. Not being DSLR, camera uses contrast detection autofocus, and there are various quirks to its autofocus behavior. When it can't \"see\" a pattern of sufficient contrast along horizontal direction, it may go through a whole range of distances and fail to focus, irritating the photographer and wasting his time. To avoid this, make sure that focusing (half-pressing the shutter or pressing AF-L button in \"manual\" mode) is performed while the focus area is pointed at a texture with something other than just horizontal lines. Faces, eyes, brick walls, vertical edges of the buildings, poles, trees, backs of chairs -- but certainly not Venetian blinds, empty clotheslines or horizontal wires. It is sufficient to slightly tilt the camera while focusing to make \"bad\" textures work, but without that you will see focus moving back and forth for two second, and reporting no focus. Focus area can be moved within the frame, and its size can be changed -- what is important because if it covers multiple objects at different distances, the largest or object with highest contrast will get the \"priority\" because the criterion for focusing is the highest contrast in the whole area.Things that are missing or don't work well:1. Fast or continuous autofocus. As described above, autofocus has limitations, so it can't be expected to lock fast enough unless the photographer \"helps\" it by pointing at suitable texture before pressing the shutter. This adds a few seconds from the moment when photographer decided to take a picture while the camera is off, to the moment when picture is actually taken. For the same reason, tracking an object moving toward or away from the photographer, is nearly impossible -- it's better to focus on something at a certain distance, then wait for the object to reach that point. Continuous autofocus mode exists, but doesn't seem to tracks things very well.2. Video with autofocus. It works but depends on continuous autofocus, so expect painful re-focusing in the middle of a clip if anything moves to or from the camera.3. Microphone jack, or lack of one. Camera has built-in microphone but has no jack for the external one. While microphone itself is only relevant to video, that is not a strong point of this camera to begin with, it also means that there is no way to trigger the shutter remotely, save for mechanical shutter release cable. X-E1, a similar camera without optical viewfinder, has microphone jack that can be used for this purpose.4. Auto-ISO combined with aperture or exposure time priority. It works, but often produces unreasonable combinations, such as low ISO and wide open aperture or low ISO and long exposure. This is often contrary to the expected effect (low depth of field or blur with even relatively slow movement). When it happens, it's a good idea to set the formerly \"automatic\" parameter to something reasonable -- ISO will adjust to match it, and if it can't, an indicator in the viewfinder will show how far you are off.A photographer accustomed to deliberately setting parameters and planning in advance would find this camera great for his purposes, however someone accustomed to a camera immediately ready to take a picture within a second of taking the cover off the lens, would find it frustrating.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a photographer's camera", "Author": "ThatDenverDude", "ReviewID": "R3L7FNR5PLKYU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I considered buying this camera for a very long time.

It isn't perfect, and it isn't a dslr, but it's darn close and it's every bit better than the Canon 20d I owned about 6 years ago.What I like:The view finder option is a really cool feature.  You can choose between viewing through the lens or viewing through the view finder.  I wish more cameras had this feature.It's faster than I expected in normal light.  I read a lot of reviews that complained about focus in low light, focus accuracy, etc.  This camera is every bit as good in bright and low light as a Canon 5D MK IIPicture quality is awesome.  There is very little noise in the images.  When you do you part, the images are amazing.  I absolutely LOVE the Velvia and Provia film styles and I've received multiple comments that images resemble those of slide film.  It absolutely rocks and noise levels are minimal in low light.The 35mm f/1.4 lens is sharp.  Tack sharp.The 18mm f/2 lens is soft in the corners when wide open.  Stop it down, and you'll be fine.  Outside, there is no need to shoot at f/2I love the panorama feature...but I also don't like it.What I don't like:Fuji messed up with relation to which knob locks.  They put a locking feature on the shutter speed knob.  It would have been better placed on the exposure compensation knob.  The shutter speed knob isn't in a spot that you can easily bump - the exposure compensation knob is.The battery slot doesn't automatically lock.  Maybe I got a defective version?  Rather than closing the hatch and having it lock, I have to slide the lock shut manually.The 18mm lens has soft corners :-)With relation to the panorama feature, I don't like the fact that the image size is limited.  My thoughts are if you use 5 images in the panorama, you should be able to have the equivalent of 5 photos for the size.The thing that I absolutely love about this camera is it forces you to slow down.  There is no \"spray and pray\" with this camera.  You set the aperture, you set the shutter speed, you make sure you haven't bumped the exposure compensation knob, and you shoot.  You can adjust focus points like a DSLR, it shoots at 6 frames per second if you want to do that, and you can continuously focus.  It's just plain fun to carry around and it's just plain fun to shoot.  I have two 5D MK III bodies and a multitude of lenses and they are staying home more and more.I recommend this camera to anyone that is a photographer, that understands the relationship between shutter speed and aperture.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R314411MZ4ZF7D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned my XP1 for nearly 3 weeks.  As a beginning-intermediate photographer moving up from an PEN EP2, this camera has forced me to focus on the fundamentals of photography - exposure, shutter speed, composition etc.Many internet reviews mention problems with AF but I think most of those reviewers are expecting this camera to function as a DSLR which it is not. I'm typically deliberate and patient with my photos and not interested in action or sports photography - so the AF has not been a problem.Aside from the image and build quality, the primary reason I bought this camera is the Optical Viewfinder.  I've had friends mention the advantages of an OVF.  Having never used an OVF I wanted the option of having both an EVF and OVF in case I had a different opinion.  OVF has its quirks with frames but once you get the hang of it, it's a whole new experience in composing shots. Since I've had this camera, I've rarely used the EVF(although very sharp).Should you purchase the camera?  Well, if your search for a DSLR alternative or a Point and Shoot substiture, you should look at other camaras such as the OM-D.  The internet is flooded with reviews (good and bad) so read as many possible to get a balanced perspective on the strengths and shortcomings of this camera- it is fairly expensive so you owe it to yourself to do adequate due diligence.I did the same before buying and I'm quite happy with my purchase- I'm certain this is a camera that will grow with me as my photography skills develop.If the price for the 'body' only were $1,400-$1,500 I would be inclined to give this camera 5 stars. However, although I've never used a Leica, this camera may be intentionally priced to be positioned as a much cheaper substitute - so it really depends on the perspective of a potential purchaser to judge if the price is appropriate.Otherwise, this is an excellent camera with impressive image quality and handling unlike any other camera available below a $6,000 price point.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have waited a long time for this camera.", "Author": "Edward G.

I have been through alot of cameras in my life but I have never been so torn about a camera before. I really want to love this camera.The build quality, the retro design, the size, the weight. All perfect! Short of my 5D Mark III this cameras IQ is superior to any camera I have ever used. It's high ISO capabilities are legendary. The photos are clear and crisp and look great in most cases. The autofocus, while somewhat sluggish, I find it to be decent enough and more accurate than the X100. Q menu is an awesome addition.All these positives I mentioned would seem like enough right? Then why Fuji would you create such a mess with the rest of the camera? So close to perfection, yet so far away.Chattering aperture blades that can drive a person mad. I shot a company party and was getting looks from coworkers asking me what was wrong with my camera. Aside from that, autofocus is extremely loud, the EVF is sluggish and slow to update. The shutter speed dial is very stiff and hard to rotate while looking though the VF. The customization is so limited. you are only allowed to customize the FN button, while the control dial which is the best dial on the camera remains dormant, unused and non programmable. The arrows buttons, also cannot be customized. Missing a live exposure preview for aperture and shutter speed like all other fuji cameras. Focus by wire renders the manual focus of the lenses virtually useless for anything other than fine tuning. Various memory card problems. Minimum shutter speed cannot be set rendering auto ISO useless.I just dont understand how a company that creates cameras and lenses with such fine optics screws up the most basic features that so many lesser cameras get right. And they do it with one camera, and then repeat many of the same exact mistakes the following year. It's heartbreaking to have to return this camera but I cannot justify the price with so many bugs and design flaws. What a shame. Kudos to you folks that can overlook the negatives as I am truly jealous and will shake my head in disappointment every time I see someone carrying this black beauty in their hands with thoughts of what might have been.If Fuji can address the majority of the issues I mentioned I would be glad to change my review to 5 stars and instantly buy one again.

When I learned of the Fujifilm X-Pro1, it was a godsend, for I knew I could never justify the purchase of a Leica rangefinder with its lenses.With one exception*, I'm not going to address the craftsmanship or technological prowess of my new Fujifilm X-Pro 1 camera body, as I can add nothing to the experts' reviews. What I can address, however, is the bargain to be had purchasing this item \"used\" from Amazon Warehouse Deals or an alternate used reseller sanctioned by Amazon. I compared prices of a \"new\" body from Amazon for $1699 v. \"used-very good\" from Amazon Warehouse for $1222 v. \"used-like new\" from Amazon Warehouse for $1274 and \"used-like new\" from OneCall for $1247 (I know it's hard to believe, but these were the prices displayed at the time I made my purchases).I opted for the \"used-like new\" and decided against the aftermarket warranty, even though the ad copy cautioned that the body, as it is used, may not qualify for the factory warranty.On 14 June I placed the order for the \"used-like new\" body from Amazon Warehouse for $1274, as well as for the Fujinon XF 35mm \"used-like new\" lens from Amazon Warehouse for $533 and the XF 18mm lens \"used-like new\" for $521 (also from Amazon Warehouse).  I selected super saver free shipping. On 21 June, all items arrived intact in the same box via UPS. When I opened the original Fujifilm box containing the camera body I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was in pristine condition, giving the appearance of \"new\" with all accessories, literature, CD-ROM and warranty certificate.  True, the box had been opened and resealed, and Amazon Warehouse had obscured the original body SKU and serial number on the box, but those are the only discrepancies from new as far as I could tell.The Fujinon XF 35mm lens, contained in its original Fujifilm lens box with lens SKU and serial number stickers intact, likewise appears to be \"new\" rather than \"like new\". All materials are present and free of any fingerprints, smudges or blemishes (lens, front and rear caps, hood w/cover, lens bag, owner's manual, service locations information sheet and original factory warranty certificate with registration instructions).Because I wasn't certain what I would find when I opened my Amazon Warehouse camera body, I decided to also separately purchase the \"used-like new\" body from OneCall for $1247 because the ad copy stated \"brand new, open box ...\"  It arrived on 22 June from OneCall.  Indeed, this body does appear to be absolutely brand new and unmolested, with SKU and serial number stickers intact on the resealed original box and all items in their original sealed cellophane bags.I have elected to keep the camera body from OneCall and return for refund the body I purchased from Amazon Warehouse, because the OneCall body is $27 less than the body from Amazon Warehouse and, subjectively, the OneCall original box and contents appeared \"newer\" than its Warehouse twin.  But, before making that decision, I mounted the 35mm lens on both bodies and tried them out. Unsurprisingly, they all function exactly as I expected. I have now registered the OneCall camera body and the Warehouse lens online with the manufacturer.As I said, I'll leave the discussion of the camera's merits to the experts, but for the price savings for this body and lens, I couldn't be happier.And, I couldn't be happier with my order's arrival date, because now I'm looking forward to taking my new, incredibly lightweight and compact traveling camera to Europe next week for the 2012 Tour de France.NB: I will be returning the 18mm lens, because unlike the 35mm lens, it was not accompanied by its lens bag or warranty certificate. The little space in the box dedicated for those items was empty. I realize that I could contact Amazon and arrange for an exchange or for them to send me the missing items, but I've decided to use this opportunity to simply await the release of the new Fujinon XF 23mm (35mm equiv.) lens.I've decided to take a pass on any telephoto or zoom lenses for this camera, because IMO those lenses negate the attraction of a small, lightweight, discreet travel camera. If my shooting situation requires the use of such lenses, I'll just pull out the D700 big gun.I considered the X-Pro 1 assist grip, but I think I'll instead purchase the X-Pro 1 leather case for the protection it offers when using a standard or WA prime lens, but also because the lower case less the lid allows full access to all camera functions while providing a larger form factor when holding the camera while decreasing the likelihood of inadvertently pressing the Q button with one's thumb.*I am amazed and disappointed that such a technically advanced, near-perfect camera does not have a OVF diopter adjustment.  I suspect that many potential users of this camera are going to be older enthusiasts who recall and appreciate the film rangefinder cameras of our youth, and who will not hesitate at paying a premium price for quality.  Most people who fall into that category would not only benefit from a diopter adjustment, but require it.  I can't imagine how Fujifilm could neglect to include such an essential feature.BOTTOM LINE:  For a total price of $1780.00 I have a new, factory-warranted Fujifilm X-Pro 1 camera with a new, factory-warranted Fujinon XF 35mm prime lens.

Even the shutter button, VF toggle and focus mode selector controls are painted metal - classy!  With the XF 35mm f/1.4 R mounted, it balances very nicely.  I can't really fault the build quality, other than that the buttons on the rear of the camera don't feel quite as good as those on a pro-level DSLR.  Also, the SD card slot location is right at the hinge of the battery door, making access difficult, especially with my Gariz leather half-case mounted.Operation:I've actually used the hybrid viewfinder much more than I expected.  It's surprisingly intuitive and allows for accurate framing with parallax correction.  I believe the rear LCD is one of the finest on the market - a 1,230,000 pixel RGBW Sony WhiteMagic panel, shared with the Sony A99 and RX100.  AF speed isn't terribly fast but has proven to be very accurate even shooting at f/1.4.  There is a learning curve with this camera but it's so much fun to use that you'll pick up on it after just a few outings.Image Quality:What drew me to this camera was the image quality.  I'm not a big videographer or action shooter, otherwise I would've considered a DSLR.  Paired with the excellent XF 35mm f/1.4 R lens, this camera is capable of truly first-class images with crisp pixel-level detail and very low noise.  While the output may be an fairly average 16 megapixels, the extremely sharp pixel-level detail means you're getting roughly the same amount of overall resolution as most higher megapixel cameras with the benefit of smaller file sizes.  One downside of this innovative X-Trans sensor is the unique pixel layout requires a very complex algorithm for detailed RAW conversion and a mature RAW converter still isn't available.  Existing converters can't quite squeeze out the detail you'll find in standard X-Pro1 JPEGs.Wrap-up:If your style of shooting weighs more on thoughtful composition than outright speed, this is the camera for you.

The main reason I got the XPro-1 over the X-E2 was the optical viewfinder, but the autofocus in OVF stopped working for shots closer than 18\" away from the subject.

I shoot jpeg (preferring Astia setting for general use and Velvia with -1 on the shadows for landscapes) and raw at the same time.- 90% of the shots I shoot get uploaded directly to flickr with an eye-fi card; the other 10% get the same treatment but I use the built in RAW converter in the camera to quickly tweak exposure, white balance, shadows etc. This is a great feature for me, especially as a busy dad. I can do my selections, raw processing and uploading directly in the camera at the end of a busy day by looking through the (very sharp) eye level digital viewfinder.- RAW processing woes now fixed with latest Lightroom; personally I use Aperture and RAW process in Photo Ninja for the small percentage of images that I want a little bit extra from.- Image sharpness is (I think) better than my Canon 1DS II. Lacking the AA filter and also having no mirror has enabled me to get incredibly sharp hand held photos of landscapes at dawn and dusk.- I love the optical finder and use that most of the time. Once you figure out how to focus with the thing the OVF is very useful. Being able to switch between this and the digital finder with a quick flip of the switch under your right finger is so useful for those times when you are just a few feet or less from the subject. This helps resolve focus and framing issues due to the lens axis and optical finder being apart from each other.- I can nail focus most of the time but it is a little quirky. The shutter mash technique is useful when shooting a moving subject.- Image quality at high ISOs is exceptional- I wish it supported ISO 100 or 1/8000 second for shooting on bright days with a wide aperture.- Ergonomics are great.

Initially, I got the Fuji 35mm (which optically is really quite good).  The focus was ridiculous slow however.  Even with the firmware upgrades the focus speed was less than stellar.  The 35mm would hunt for focus, lose it, reacquire it and maybe when the shutter was released, the image would be in focus.  I attempted to use it to shoot images of my grandson who is six months old and just rolling around, and about half the images were unusable.When I put the adapter and my dad's old 50 on the X-Pro 1 though it breathed new life into this camera body for me.With the adapter and lens that actually responds when the shutter is released I am loving this camera.  All the stuff that makes modern cameras cool, works like a champ: white balance, image quality, fit and finish, processing speed are all top notch.  The menu system, not my favorite feature on any camera, is actually pretty decent in that it allows one to quickly access whatever you happen to be looking for.  The shutter is very responsive and quiet when there is a lens attached that can take advantage of it (Turn off the annoying beep that sounds when ever this thing does something it likes).I have started using this as my primary street shooter since it's quite light weight yet still feels solid.  It's not the smallest camera in Fuji's lineup, about on par with a Leica M6, but it feels good and is pretty unobtrusive.  I have relatively big hands so I was constantly hitting buttons and doing things that I hadn't intended.  I finally broke down and got Fuji grip and a Thumbs Up attachment for it and the unit feels outstanding.  I no longer worry about dropping it when I'm focusing.I'm shooting this in aperture priority mode most of the time and, of course autofocus is gone, but I guess that is what I am beginning to really like about the X-Pro 1. There are certainly much cheaper ways to rediscover the joy of manual photography but the body of this system is pretty good.  I can't give the X-Pro 1 a full five stars since the initial buying experience was so so disappointing (again, because of the lenses that were designed for this).  But it has gotten to the point where I actually enjoy using it even though it cost additional time and money that one shouldn't have to spend on a camera at this price point.  Overall however, I can say that I like the camera itself.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best", "Author": "SM", "ReviewID": "R2Q2S256UACK1R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are portrait  or landscape photographer and you did not try it then do it right now! it is a piece of Art specially with combination of 18-55mm lens will be very fast in focusing, buy an adapter and use your lovely old Nikon or Olympus or Contax lenses and it will be far better than Leica range finder!.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly Horrible Focusing Ruins This Model", "Author": "Diego Norte", "ReviewID": "R2QUZX1T28TWB1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dear Fujifilm, you could have knocked this one out of the park. Why did you release the X-Pro1 before it was ready? Before you solved the obvious focusing shortcomings, firmware glitches, and engineering issues that infuriate trusting users like me? You could have turned this camera into a classic, but that chance is now gone. You've lost me as a customer, maybe forever. My X-Pro1 is hitting eBay in time for the Christmas season. I'll eat several hundred dollars on the sale, and be forced to admit to myself and my wife that I made a significant mistake. Goodbye.I've shot several thousand images with the X-Pro1 over the last few months. Naturally, I read all the reviews, and thoroughly convinced myself the Fuji was going to be a rewarding alternative to the typical Nikon / Canon / Sony offerings I've shot for 30+ years. This camera seemed different. It held out a promise to be something considerably better than usual in a compact package. Sharp lenses, a metal body, cool retro design -- a beautiful object that could potentially take beautiful shots.Unfortunately, the X-Pro1 has fallen woefully short for these reasons:1. Manual focusing is essentially useless. So many turns are required that it only makes sense on a tripod. And because the control is electronic, rather than mechanical, it has no feel, no tactile feedback.2. That wouldn't be of a huge problem, except that the auto-focus is RIDICULOUS -- painfully slow and often inaccurate. I've missed so many nice shots because of this problem that I've actually given up on this camera. It's a complete, total deal breaker. You can read in detail about other's experience with the focusing mechanism in various online review sites, but know this: If you plan to shoot anything that moves, forget about it! Forget about photos of friends, family, pets, street scenes, etc. I'm serious. The focusing response is simply too awful. You'll be relying on pure luck or pre-focusing to get the shot.3. The XPro-1 exposure metering is easily faked-out by strong lighting conditions, such as back-lit interiors. The metering is considerably less capable than the Nikons and Canons I've owned.4. The video functionality is primitive. Again, it's the poor focusing mechanism, constantly search for a focus point, and contaminating the audio track with noise while it's doing so. Why even include video functionality if it's this bad?Between the poor auto-focusing and easy-to-fool metering, you are going to miss a unacceptably high percentage of shots that other cameras can nail. It's extremely frustrating.The X-Pro1 is ONLY suited to enthusiasts that own at least one other camera, and plan to use the X-Pro1 for shots of subjects that don't move. The excellent sensor and sharp lenses are sweet, but only in specific situations. If you want a camera that can handle a wide variety of subjects, especially subjects in motion, this isn't it. I'm sad, moving on . . .Update 11/12/12: Someone questioned the legitimacy of my review in the comments section, so I scanned other reviews on Amazon and found these confirming snippets:\"the autofocus is ... bad\"\"image quality is great . . . but only great when you can get the focus\"\"such a cool sensor in such a crippled body is a shame\"\"the X-Pro 1 is a tragically flawed\"\"this Camera so bad that I am depress now since I am sending it back\"\"way over priced for the quality\"\"The AF keep searching for focus\"\"NO Usable Manual Focus\"\"the AF took several seconds to fix . . . the focus was off and the image was blurred!\"\"The AF is slower than in my P&S;\"\"firmware update . . . does not solve sluggish AF focus issues\"\"US$1700 is just too much for a gimmicky camera like this\"\"too many quirks and bugs\"\"truly bad focusing\"Update 03/19/2014: After looking through months of still images and videos shot with the X-Pro1, I dropped it another star to the lowest possible rating. It irks me so much that irreplaceable shots of my kids were lost due to the truly bad auto-focusing of this camera. Fuji should have never, ever released it before it was ready. It took two full years to iron-out the problems and it seems most of the issues have been fixed in new models like the X-T1. Lesson learned: NEVER buy into a new camera system -- wait two or more years until the inevitable bugs are worked out. I dumped my X-Pro1 on eBay. Worst camera purchase in 30 years. Good riddance.

I have used a Sony Alpha a850 full frame DSLR for the past two years and the Sony takes absolutely wonderful photographs.  However, it is built like a tank and I needed something lighter that could fit my needs. I purchased a Fujifilm X-Pro1 and used it for the first time during a stay as a tourist in San Francisco. I am absolutely impressed. The pictures turned out great and it was a pleasure to use.  I only brought a Fujifilm 35mm prime lens with me and took over 200 pics (with no flash).  I went on a Sunset Bay Cruise and the camera performed well.  I also had no problem cropping in Photoshop during post processing.  About the only glitch is that when I purposely took a couple of photos in Black and White both Photoshop 6 and Lightroom automatically converted it to color.  The supplied Fujifilm software did not.  It displayed the photo as shot.  I suppose I should be happy that both Lightroom and Photoshop 6 now recognize the Fujifilm X-Pro1 at all, but one of the reasons I picked Fujifilm is the quality of their color.The Fujifilm X-Pro1 meets all my needs.  I should also mention that there was also less \"fringing\" in the photos than my Sony, which sometimes becomes apparent during post processing with P/S and L/R. I do not use a zoom lens, all my zooming is done in post processing and any flaws in the photograph become very noticeable upon magnification.  The Fujifilm X-Pro is as close to a perfect as I can get.  I really am totally impressed with the camera.

It must be seen to be believed. With Fuji's matching 35mm f1.4 lens the camera produces awesomely sharp images for pixel-peepers.The camera is also fun to use. You directly control the aperture, shutter speed, and exposure compensation by manually turning dials and rings--it gives you a hands-on ability to quickly and easily change settings with no menus to get in your way. With that said, it requires the photographer to have a full understanding of the tradeoffs between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO in order to get the best possible results.The X-Pro 1 wonderfully allows you to see the histogram in the viewfinder, and you can see it shift as you turn the exposure compensation dial one way or the other. By shifting the histogram just to the edge without going over, you can make correctly exposed photos in a wide range of situations.Another remarkable ability is that you can tweak settings to RAW images *in the camera* for saving out exposed or \"styled\" jpg photos. Normally you would need a photo editing program to do this! Sadly, X-Pro 1 RAW support is flawed in Lightroom and nonexistent in Aperture.* DrawbacksWith all of its capabilities, however, the X-Pro 1 is a tragically flawed camera. Fuji's quality control is third-rate and the X-Pro 1's image sensor (or more likely, the IR filter which covers the sensor) comes with blotches all over it. It was heartbreaking to return this camera for replacement *multiple times*, only to have the replacement still have blotches all over its images--this is seen at f/16 on light backgrounds. Simply stated, it's unlikely you will receive a camera from Fuji without blotches of one degree or another visible.There is a simple test which can be done to check. Set the aperture to f/16, photograph a LCD monitor showing a white screen (move the camera in a circular motion while taking the photo to blur any monitor pixel detail), then open the resulting photo in Photoshop and select Adjustments > Levels > \"Auto\" button on the photo. The faintest of splotches and blotches immediately become visible.Fuji could have cleaner assembly facilities and preform this simple test to make sure there are no blotches--but this is a business decision on their part. Fuji literally needs to clean up their act. I wonder if Fuji has this problem on their other cameras?In the end, I returned the X-Pro 1 and received a refund--Amazon was excellent in this respect. The X-Pro 1 is just too heartbreaking to use. No one should have to put up with dirty imaging sensors, especially on an expensive camera like this.*11/4/12 update: A photo was added showing the blotches in the customer images section.

BROWN \"JDB\"", "ReviewID": "RF2TX82NTDCWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is simply the best camera I have ever held, let alone actually owned! I love this camera and when I am taking photos it is hard to pry from my hands. Let me begin by saying that the person responsible for me owning this camera is Mr. Ken Rockwell from kenrockwell dot com. He writes extremely informative, thorough and eloquent reviews on all things camera.I've never owned a professional camera. I've never owned a mirrorless rangefinder, or any camera that required me to learn about photography. Let me tell you this, I am so glad that I got this. Within a day of reading about photography, aperture and focus, I was shooting pro photographs fit for photography books. It is simply a joy to use. Really the only gripes I have with it are this: The \"continuing\" focus feature is just garbage, in fact, the autofocus one isn't very good either, set it to manual and use the \"AF\" button to auto focus and then adjust to your needs if you absolutely need autofocus. Otherwise, if you intend on only using autofocus, go with a different camera. My other gripe is that the buttons are placed kind of strangely and its a bit awkward to hold in your hand. The right side is just so cluttered with buttons you absolutely must use both hands to hold it. Fortunately the lens is mounted on there so strongly that you can hold it from the lens, although this isn't something I'd recommend doing if you're like me and paranoid about breaking expensive things.On to the image quality, the quality of this camera blows me away. I rarely spend any time going back to look at my photos: I already know how they will turn out, perfectly. Really the only problem with image quality is that the focus can be very specific to certain objects. You can't really take a picture of someone with the background being in focus as well. This is fine for my purposes, but it may not be for yours (it probably is fine, heh) . I mostly use this camera for street photography (graffiti, buildings, etc) and portraits. I'm never disappointed with this camera.My only regret about this purchase is that I got the 50mm macro lens. To be honest, it's pretty useless. The lens is very hard to focus with and I just found it too be, in my opinion, a waste of money. It is probably a great camera for getting certain close ups, but not small objects. Think detailed pictures of textures, flowers, perhaps even some face shots or very \"personal\" body shots. However, I don't intend to derail from this review. This camera is just amazing. I have the FX18mmF2R and the FX35mmF1.4 lenses and both of them are just fabulous. I am always impressed with the the quality of the photos I get from this camera, regardless of the lens. I'm going to end this review here save the rest of my comments on the lenses for their respective pages.One thing you should know about this camera, and I think it is specific to rangefinders in general, is that it absolutely excels in low light environments. In fact it sees better than the human eye in most scenarios. This camera is simply a thrill to use in every environment, and I am always surprised with how well it performs in a low light and just down right dark setting. Any SLR would fail miserably in these settings.Hell why am I rambling, you already know this is a good camera, check out Ken Rockwell's review, come back, and make your decision. I hope this was helpfulIn conclusion, if you want a point and shoot, 100% hassle free, beginner camera, this is NOT the camera for you. If you are like me, have never owned a professional camera, and want an introduction into professional photography, will take the time to learn how to operate it, then this is the camera for you.You will get amazing quality photos, don't hesitate now.

Frankel", "ReviewID": "R1UKEB8X60VL5D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The X-100 I bought about 18 months ago is probably my favorite camera of all time and I happily gave it a 5-Star rating here on Amazon.  When the X-Pro 1 came out last quarter I ordered it and took delivery immediately before leaving on a cruise that visited Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo.  With the X-Pro 1 as my primary camera, and the X-100 and a Canon S95 for backup, I thought I was in great shape for the trip.  Since I've taken about 2,000 satisfying photos with the X-100, I was sure that the transition to the X-Pro 1 would be nearly seamless.That wasn't to be the case, within the first few days I was finding that routine street shooting was uncomfortable!  The camera with the stock lens was about twice as heavy and conspicuous as the X-100.  I sometimes felt -- especially in markets and in the evening -- that it was crying out, \"I'm heavy and expensive, please try to grab me!,\" whether it was being carried at my side on my thin Leica strap or whether it was being carried on my larger Sun Sniper strap.  The X-100, on the other hand, snuggles right by my side using either the Leica strap or the small Sun Sniper sling bag that hides it completely and is my favorite way of carrying it.More important, the first few days with the X-Pro was really disappointing because when shooting anything that wasn't strictly static and high contrast, the AF took several seconds to fix on the subject and then, about one-third the time, the focus was off and the image was blurred! By the third day, I had packed away to await its return to Amazon.Ironically a few days later my X-100 developed the sticking diaphragm problems and I had to set it aside and shoot the rest of the vacation with my faithful Canon S95.  I know from the boards that Fuji is standing behind them and repairing them in within two weeks, so I was much more concerned about the X-Pro.  Hopefully the truly bad focusing is not epidemic to all the cameras released by this time, or it can be easily fixed by a software update (I did not use the camera long enough for the first update to be uploaded), but otherwise I strongly advise the X-100 as being a more satisfactory camera, especially for street photography.As for the X-Pro's replacement, I've just ordered an Olympus OMD E-M5 but I'll keep my newly repaired X-100 close to me for at least another generation of cameras.  I played around with it in a local camera store where it was being demoed by the factory rep and it truly looks like the best of the bunch (I also had a NEX-7 for a few days) from a standpoint of quality and versatility.  And, for about the cost of the X-Pro body alone, I've been able to order  the OMD with the Olympus 12-50mm lens, the Olympus 45-150 lens, the Lumix 20mm lens and a neat little Olympus optical finder; with this 3-lens kit probably weighing no more than the X-Pro with one lens and able to fit into the same size gadget bag.  Providing that there aren't significant difference in resolving power between the two cameras (I love to make 16x20 enlargements), I think the OMD will be my primary camera with the X-100 as my primary backup camera for the next 1-2 years.I've also ordered the new Olympus TG-1 1HS \"Tough\" camera as a backup for the X-100.  If it is at least as good photographically as the Canon S-95, this will truly prepare me for any photographic calamities I'll be likely to experience in the near future.  The S-95 will likely find its way into my glove compartment for spontaneous use, or be sold on eBay to help support my camera \"habit.\"If there's a message to all this, it's never leave for extended trips without 3 cameras.

I doubt that it's impact damage, as I never dropped the camera. The switch that I wanted to have repaired only jams in sub-zero weather, and thus doesn't affect me 99% of the time. However, I get the feeling that Fuji's repair tech didn't even bother to figure out WHY the switch jams or even to duplicate the issue -- since it only fails in sub zero weather; they just marked \"impact damage\" due to the scratch on the glass, and wanted to charge me almost as much as a new camera to repair it. I asked them if they would consider replacing just the switch, and was denied.I do not expect that Fuji will replace a part that I nicked or scratched, but I also do not expect them to invalidate my ENTIRE WARRANTY for supposed impact damage -- I never dropped the camera.I didn't write about how well the camera performs because many others here have written about it far more eloquently than I.
