{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hard a problem but now fixed by vendor", "Author": "Seaweid", "ReviewID": "R3C5CQ4GHHSM6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The problem we had was the cleaning solution leaked inside the package (a 8X10 padded envelope) all over the rest of the inclosed product.  Also..  the batteries are NOT 2100mAH power.  They are 1700 mAH and I pointed out that it is false advertising to ship product that is not to spec.  I also notified Amazon..  not sure if they changed it yet.  After sending a note to vendor a few times, they did very well in replacing it with the correct batteries and products. So I give these guys and products a 4 star because it is NOT what they said it was and the product was contaminated when we received it.  The vendor after understanding the issues, did fix it so 4 stars! (would have been 5, as the products all work great after getting them right).", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ideal replacement battery for my SL1000", "Author": "Jim Cockburn", "ReviewID": "R2WVRH8PBU9E65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These batteries are an excellent replacement in my Fufi SL1000 camera.
