I have a large zoom digital camera (Panasonic Lumix) for wild life photos on vacation.  But I wanted a small point and shoot to take mostly inside photos of my dog, in low light.  I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great outside photos, but horrible, blurry inside photos.  I found that unless my dog sat completely still, every photo blurred.  Not with my new Fuji.  I've taken at least 300 photos in the last 5 days and they're terrific.  I mostly use the Anti-blur setting with a red eye reduction flash for my dog, and I haven't been disappointed.  I also looked at the Canons, but found them to be slow in writing speed and flash recycle time.  I considered the Fuji F40d or F50d at $250, but the flash recycle time was very slow on the F50d, which is the newer version.  For $150, I have a great camera that does exactly what I want it to.  Great battery life considering how much I've been playing with it in the last week.  I recommend it.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "FOR THE PRICE, ITS A PERFECT CAMERA", "Author": "Ricardo Navarro", "ReviewID": "R3UETJJXXGRL4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just bought this camera. the picture quality is excellent. the video quality isnt as great and i have seen better, but on a $300 camera. but it does the job.the pictures are extremely clear. day or night.for the price, i highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent value.

While the pictures it takes will never be mistaken for pics taken with a DSLR, the results are generally very good. It's also very simple to use. If you're the type of person that is going to \"pixel peep\", or be upset about \"noise\" at a high ISO, then this probably isn't the camera for you. Then again, no camera for around $100 is going to make you happy. If you want an inexpensive, small camera to just take pictures, then this camera is an excellent choice. It's a small, no-frills, to the point, point and shoot. It also seems very well built, and the 2.5\" screen is acceptable for a camera at this price. The camera itself probably rates about 4 stars, but I give it 5 stars at its price point.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera clear pictures on the move", "Author": "John A.

The quality of the pictures are really good, and the camera does a good job of determining lighting conditions for the auto flash. One of the best features of the camera is its ability to take clear shots of moving objects, I've taken pictures of people moving as well as taken shots from cars on the road and the picture remains clear with little or no blurring.

The Finepix is an easy to use point and shoot camera.The pictures it takes are very clear - this is probably a result of Fujifilm's Picture Stabilization Technology. I took pictures from a moving bus, and they look as if I'm standing still.The camera is good in low light at a reasonable distance. We took pictures of the Las Vegas Strip at night, and they look amazing. However, we also took pictures in a very dim room and found that unless the object you were focusing on was close at hand, it was very difficult to see in the picture. The low light pictures still very clear.The 3X zoom was perfect for every picture that I wanted to take and made items look close enough for a good shot.In sum, this is an excellent purchase for the price.

Really if my Samsung Blackjack's camera has a built in flash, I might not really need a new camera. I need a small camera that can fit in my purse or pants pockets. I looked at some models that use rechargable AA batteries, but the camera will be a lot thicker and heavier. This camera fits my requirements and the price is really attractive.I played with it the night I received it. The basic manual didn't take too long to read through the important points. There is supposed to be a more detailed manual in the CD, but I haven't had the need to read it yet.The anti-blur feature, which is new to me, is really useful. The camera doesn't have too many buttons to confuse me, and as you change the settings the explanation of the new setting is displayed on the LCD. No need to keep the manual around with you.I have a 1GB Kingston micro SD that I bought for my cell phone, and I am able to use it on this camera, with the SD adaptor. The basic manual does warn that some mini/micro SD adaptors have additional contacts at the back and they should not be used on this camera.Overall I am really pleased with the features on this camera.

I purchased this one because of its very small size (and low cost). After comparing this one to similar cameras by other manufacturers, I decided to stick with Fuji. Like all others in this size and price range, it lacks a viewfinder (which I sorely miss), but that's just the way they are making them nowadays.I found a couple of the controls to be slightly funky, but nothing I couldn't easily adjust to. Most other aspects of the camera functioned pretty much as I expected -- time between pictures, light adjustments, etc. The one critisism I have is that the colors are not as vibrant as in photos I've taken with my other Fuji digital cameras (which used the super CCD technology). On the other hand, I paid between $350 and $550 for my previous cameras, so the comparison really isn't valid.All in all, a nice, small camera that will comfortably fit in a shirt pocket. Great for taking on an outing where you don't want to lug around a heavy camera and just want to take some casual snapshots.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "good camera for the price", "Author": "Gabrielle L.

It's small and light enough to keep in my purse on a daily basis.My one qualm is that the software it came with sucks.  It won't work properly on my new computer (and I don't have an old PC to test it on) and crashes when I try to upload photos from the camera.

I wonder if Fuji can't say how good it is because it might be better than their upmarket cameras that are supposed to be low noise. Adequate for some sunsets, that's one of the major reasons I love it. The lens might not have much telephoto but that made it easy to manufacture a very good lens.Variable shutter to 8 seconds in fireworks mode. Usable night mode with a tripod. ISO 64 to 1600 in \"manual\".Excellent color.I bought two as my observation is that when a camera this good comes along it is quickly superseded with something worse. This also gave me a spare battery.To return to shoot mode press the shutter. This is really the best way to do it but they could have programmed both ways instead of the stupid message.The software didn't do much except stop my card reader from working (Win 2K). At least it uninstalled neatly and now I use the reader.The menus are in seemingly random order but include useful functions.The corners are cut off at full wide. Big deal, with 8 megapixels there is plenty to crop out. Typical for little cameras.The battery seems to run down over a few weeks if left in the camera.

Along with that , I already had some XD cards from my not working so good fuji A350. So at least I didn't need to buy SD cards. This zoom is alittle jittery over the samsung 860, but not by much. So I try not to use zoom if I can help it.It takes great out-door pictues, but not as good INDOORS or longer distance indoors. I was never sure if it looked better with or without flash and somtimes get blurry without flash due to it probalby holding the shutter open longer without flash. All depends on distance and lighting indoors. I was getting used to using my wifes camera,, a sony cybershot DSCH-10 which took much better pics indoors. But it is a double the cost camera. I like that it also takes regular SD or XD cards, but manual says the video may be jumpy on the SD cards depending?? The olympus version of this says it takes Micro SD, not the full size sd,and you would need that stupid adapter thing, but don't quote me on that. I also was looking for a cam that took AA batteries due to availability, but once you get a few ion battery packs, you should be set. Batt life was acceptable, but factory batteries are $$$. I got a couple maximal power's off ebay cheap, and they seem to be ok, though may not last as long as original. Im very leary on no name batteries, but for $7-$14 for Two,, I can't complain.

This is an 8.2 megapixel camera, but it is NOTHING in comparison to my phone. I should have known better. The pictures are very poor quality, I'm disappointed it's too late for me to order a different camera before I leave on my trip. I might pull out my old digital 2.5 megapixel camera from High School photo class to use instead. The quality will look the same overall but there will be more features, as well as less blurry pictures!!!Cons:-Noisy - camera beeps on every photo, no option to turn this sound off (not to mention all the gears grinding makes it feel like I went stone age)-Image stabilization is extremely poor, meaning you have to have tripod-like (not human) hands if you want a semi-crisp picture (even bracing my arms against myself, I was unable to take an appreciably clear photo)-Images do not look like 8.2 megapixels (apparently I'll have to research megapixels because I learned today that they are not universal)-Camera struggles to focus at all distances but very close up, but if too close up all focus is lost again. Examples: at anything closer than 6 inches away, there was no focus ability, at distances of 12+ inches, focus quality increased. My advice for close shots is to go between 12-18 inches away, then zoom in to the image you want a picture of and hope it's close enough to get the details wanted.Pros:-Great for someone's FIRST EVER camera-Cheap-Lightweight/compact-Big LCD-Battery charger is compact and charges battery quicklyIf you are buying this as a go-to for decent quality pictures and a good price, I DO NOT recommend this.

I have a Canon PowerShot SX20IS and a Canon PowerShot A2200 - and, on the fly, this camera takes much better pictures than either of them.

The construction and format is very straightforward.  The picture quality can be very good, and what I have found particularly satisfying is the camera's ability to capture movement (I noticed this when viewing pictures of moving water), the quality of its tones and detail, its ability to take excellent close-ups, and its balance in modest amounts of light.  I found that some pictures, compared to my Fujifilm Finepix JV100, appeared better than they would have if they were taken with the previous camera, which had recently broken.  The LCD screen is also satisfactory, and makes the pictures very visible.That being said (and here's where the person who considers him/herself artsy, the amateur photographer, the person who travels, the person who visits the outdoors, or the person who cares about quality may want to pay attention), the camera can take just awful pictures in a number of circumstances.  Want to zoom in?  Out of focus and extremely blurry, many, many times.  Taking a picture in a frame that is relatively monochromatic?  Colors are totally off.  Taking a picture toward a light source, toward the sky, or toward a significantly brighter area?  The camera can't handle it, complete overexposure.  Too much shade, too dark, approaching night, or cloudy and/or no direct light source?  Grainy, horrible pictures, unequivocally -- and this is the most significant flaw.  On top of that, it is almost completely impossible to operate the camera with any customized or manual features.  The entire camera body has only eleven buttons, and there are barely even any *automatic* features that you can set for varying conditions.  Virtually all you can do is point and shoot, meaning you have absolutely no control on how the pictures turn out.  There is no viewfinder, either, and the battery does not last long at all for the simplicity of the construction -- maybe 200 pictures.  Also considering the camera uses only 8.2 megapixels, you have very little ability to blow up any pictures that do turn out well; when I watched a few slide shows of some pictures on my laptop, almost every single one was low resolution and bad quality.

It could be fully charged and when I turn it on to take some pictures it constantly shuts off because the battery is supposedly low.Before windows 7, you had to use the finepix program to get the pictures off the camera which was a pain.

The price on Amazon is $49.95!When you are on vacation and use up the battery in one day, you won't be able to stick another pair in (unless of course you pay the $50.00).Many other point and shoots use AA batteries.
