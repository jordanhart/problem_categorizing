Fitting 14 MP on a small sensor is a challenge that all these small P&S; cameras are facing, the result: they simply fail to deliver sharp clear pictures. The MOS sensor even increases the problem as the picture quality is worst with the offset to have a much better video quality. What this camera doe's fine is with the intelligent Auto mode, it really picks the right shooting mode for the best picture possible. The only thing I did is to change the color effect from standard to happy to improve the color saturation. There are times where the iA actually doesn't work and you have to go over either with scene or program mode, make sure you properly setup these modes in order to improve the picture quality; what I did was:- Limit the ISO to 200, as the picture quality really decreases with 400 or beyond- Select intelligent Exposure to standard- Select intelligent Resolution, it really gets better picture quality (this is not available on iA, so make sure to switch if you want a sharper picture)- Changed the color effect from standard to warm to improve color saturationThere is a firmware update from 1.0 to 1.1 (improving Motion Deblur in iA and autofocus on video capture) that I really recommend to upload on your camera.On Panasonic's global webpage -> support -> consumer products -> Digital AV ->  Digital Camera -> Download -> DMC-Fx70/DMC-FX75/DMC-FX700 Firmware update serviceThere are some really interesting shooting tips (some are just plain basics) on Panasonic's web page that can help you improving the picture quality. See the attached link and select the FX700 model.The shooting tips specifically for the FX700 camera can be found on Panasonic's global webpage -> support -> consumer products -> Digital AV ->  Digital Camera -> shooting tips -> FX700One that was particularly helpful was to take portrait pictures on the telephoto end of the lens to avoid barrel distortion. This was a very annoying  problem that I fixed just zooming in when taking portrait pictures.Video recording is one of the strong points for this camera, video and audio quality is superior to any flip or similar compact camcorders.The touch screen menu is quite intuitive and takes only little time to get familiar with it. One really nice feature is the manual  focusing by touching the subject on the screen, the focus is followed as the subject moves on the screen and you can change from portrait to landscape mode just by touching the subject or the background.It's not the best picture quality camera I have had, but for a P&S; camera and sharing pictures that are seen on a PC screen (without cropping) or on the TV is more than enough.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Promising features and specifications... but terrible performance!", "Author": "N.K.", "ReviewID": "RT8LVXI4ZMK83", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before I go into my impressions, allow me to share some quick information with you. I bought this camera for a number of reasons, which include:- Leica Lens- Fast 2.2 aperture- Full HD video- VIdeo records in AVCHD- 10 FPS burst @ full resolution and up to 60 burst at 3.5 MP- Size and weight- Wanted to try out touch screen camera- Wide, 24mm lens- Cool features such as motion blur and intelligent burst, which chooses the burst speed based on the amount of movement occurring in the frame- Manual controls (actually has PASM)- MOS Sensor (which is huge for me, see below)- Four different aspect rations (1:1, 3:2, 4:3, 16:9)I have been a long time SLR/DSLR user, and have always had a backup camera. Up until a few months ago, I was happy lugging around super zoom point and shoots as backups. Then, I got tired of not being able to take a camera to dinners, events, concerts, etc. since I was unable to lug around a large SLR format camera or super zoom P&S; to certain places and often times did not want to carry around something so obtrusive. Recently, I have been researching some of the newer point and shoots, including the FX700, SD4500IS, S95, ZS7, and LX5. This is the second of the bunch I have tried. The other was the LX5, which I will briefly touch upon below.As stated, there were numerous features about this camera that caught my eye. So, why not buy it!!! Well I did and I am VERY disappointed with the image quality. Tonight I had a chance to test the ability of the camera to capture shots in a low to medium light setting. Of the 140 or so pictures I took, all but a dozen or so were soft and many had a very hard time focusing properly, even on IA (automatic) mode which I tried using a for a few shots. For the average person, the pictures may cut it but for me, they were really unimpressive. Additionally, the few pictures I took of people with the flash were awful. The people were wearing black and white but the entire picture had a nasty, red hue. The placement of the flash is very awkward as it is right by the hand grip (if you hold with right hand) so your index finger could easily cover the flash. At first, I thought the red hue was caused by my finger accidentally being placed over the flash but after being very careful to avoid that, the same result(s) occurred. Truly disappointing. On the plus side, however, the camera performs moderately well in well lit situations but unfortunately, that is not what makes a camera good in my eye. This is because I feel as though every camera (especially in this price range!) should do at a decent job in well-lit situations... I should also let you know that I have tried to camera on an overcast day, a clear and sunny day, in an artificially lit room, and in moonlit environments. I was hoping I just had a few crappy outings but I just didn't get the quality I wanted and expected... but maybe I expect too much from having used SLRs and the new LX5.As for ISO performance... I really thought the camera suffered greatly at any ISO level above 200. In addition to the aforementioned subpar low-light image quality, the inability for the camera to offer good high ISO performance (in my opinion), really makes shooting low light more frustrating and unappealing. A cool benefit of this camera, however, is the ability to choose between four different aspect rations, which are 1:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 16:9. This feature really gives the photographer more \"creative control\" when taking pictures. Standard cameras generally offer only two or three of these aspect ratios, so keep that in mind! Another plus side is that the camera can utilize shutter speeds of 60 - 1/2000 sec, which is pretty good, but nothing new for a compact camera. Obviously the ability to use 1/3200 and 1/4000 shutter speeds would make the camera better for certain situations but it is pretty good as is. Also, the burst mode works well manually and with intelligent burst so if you want a super fast compact camera and don't mind sacrificing image quality, this may be to your liking.Now onto video.... Another big selling point for me was the Full HD video capability. I was able to test the camera in well-lit and poorly lit situations and both did fairly well for a compact point and shoot. I was pretty impressed by the quality and the sound was actually pretty amazing for a camera of this size. The MOS sensor was especially appealing to me because the CCD sensors of the LX5, s95, ZS7, etc. really bother me when light sources produce vertical blue/violet lines as a result of the CCD sensor overload. This camera DOES NOT do that since it uses a MOS sensor. For many people, this is a huge selling point so keep it in mind... The only downfalls about the video capabilities is that it cannot record 720P @ 24fps (unless I missed this somehow) for the \"film like\" look that many people seek or 1080p at any FPS. Please note that some reviews/comments have stated that this camera is 1080p capable but it is not. Also, the product page says it is 1080p capable but I believe that is erroneous. From my observations, it is capable of 1080i. Moreover, I do have and do love the ability of the LX5 to take super crisp 720p/24fps HD videos but really disliked the CCD overload. An LX5 with a large MOS sensor would be the perfect set up... maybe the LX6 to LX7 will make this wish come true.Another small, and relatively insignificant issue I have is the relatively low resolution of the screen. Since it is a touch screen camera in at a fairly high price point, I expected a nice, crisp, high-resolution screen. Much to my dismay, the screen only had a resolution of 230k. I would have much rather liked to see 460k, which has become relatively standard on point on shoots. Please note that I am saying that it COULD be better and not that it is bad as is. The screen it has is fairly good and gets the job done.In summary, the camera is WONDERFUL on paper but in action, it really doesn't do a great job for what I needed and expected. If you are looking for a camera that does a good job in low light situations with great image quality, perhaps consider an LX5 (love it!) or S95 (which I am yet to try). Or, if you want a cheaper option with better (or at least better known) results, check out the ZS7. My friend swears by his and I am going to try one soon. If you, however, only shoot in well-lit environments, then this may be a good option for you!

I'll not bore you with lots of technical information.  There is plenty of that available in Camera Review Blogs online.  The following is my opinion on the performance and features of the FX700.*  No ..... The FX700 does not shoot great photos in bad lighting.  Neither does any other camera that I am aware of.  Lighting is everything when it comes to photography.  Ansel Adams would wait for days for the perfectly lit scene before recording his masterpieces.  We have become consumers that seek miracles from new technology ... The magic pill that will make you lose weight, feel great and stop all of your joint pain, the titanium driver that will fire a golf ball over 300 yards with accuracy and consistency; a cell phone that will make clear un-dropped calls from anywhere in the country;  a powerful lightweight vacuum cleaner that will clean the entire house with very little effort; and yes  \"a camera that always shoots great photos in bad lighting\".  I don't believe that such animals exist.If you are lucky to have a camera that takes great photos in poor lighting .... God Bless You!  You are living a supernatural life. I am quite sure however, if you try to enlarge such photos you will find them to be quite fuzzy and grainy when blown up.  The FX700 does a fairly good job in poor lighting if you are able the keep the ISO setting below 400 ISO, slow the camera exposure down, and have your subject remain perfectly still.  The best strategy however is to do like the pros.  Don't take photos in badly lit scenes.*  The video quality is really one of the highlights within the FX700.  I found very little camera shake, easy controls, smooth zooming and spot on focusing.  A quality memory card is essential. I use a SanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-016G-P31).  It more than satisfies my needs and is extremely fast.* The touch screen controls on the FX700 make quick programming changes a snap.  This is the best upgrade on any new camera that I have seen recently.  No more spin dials, toggle buttons, awkward menus, etc.  The touch screen also assists in face recognition, subject focus, and many other easy to set functions.* The camera is very solidly built.  It is similar in size to my FX55 which also sports a 3\" LCD screen.  But that's where the similarities end.  The FX700 has many great new features that render my FX55 as a hand-me-down to one of the family members.* The \"panorama assist\" and  \"hand-held night photo\" features are another great bonus with the FX700.  I was able to shoot a 360\u00b0 panorama perfectly on my very first attempt.  The night time photos are the best that I have experienced without the use of a tripod.If you are looking for a small pocket-sized camera with loads of features, the FX700 is worth considering.  There are many great options in the market. I am very happy that I made this purchase.  The FX700 certainly has fulfilled my expectations.David Perez", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "Drac", "ReviewID": "R2K990E6BT8KOG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the Panasonic Lumix DMC FX700 for only a few days.  I love everything about this camera it does everything I want it to - EXCEPT the one thing a camera should do well - take sharp clear pictures.  The FX700 fails in that task. It is a shame that Panasonic chose to use a lackluster lens and too small sensor (a 14MP sensor should have a much larger physical size) in this otherwise amazing prosumer camera.  I chose this camera despite a lack of reviews (because it is so new) because of the amazing number of advanced features packed into its small size.  The camera's large touch screen makes it easy to access and use its many features.The top of the camera has the speaker and stereo mics (not sure they should be on top where it is easy to cover them with a finger), the slide on/off switch, the shutter button with the manual zoom control around it (VERY convenient) and the dedicated movie start/stop button.  The lens retracts completely into the camera and is protected by metal shutters when retracted.  The side of the camera has a cover protecting the USB 2 and HDMI sockets.  The bottom houses the battery/memory card compartment and a tripod socket.  The back has the large touch panel, a slide switch to choose either record mode (take pictures) or playback, a mode button that brings up the 6 mode choices on the screen and a menu button.I was considering the Canon S95 which was the same price.  And while the S95 produces sharp clear pictures (I have its ancestor the S70) it cannot touch the FX700 when it comes to features.  I was a little leery about the touch screen but I am very pleased with it.  The only problem I have noticed with the touch screen is that when viewing pictures that I have zoomed in on (you can magnify a saved picture up to 16 times) it is VERY easy to increase the magnification (which is done by touching the screen) while trying to move around the enlarged picture (which is done by sliding a finger around the screen).The HD movies looked good, but I haven't yet played them back on an HD screen.  The photos, as I mentioned above, are NOT sharp and clear.  There is a \"softness\" about them.  I do not know what other word to use.  They are not bad - just not sharp.  I think it is like watching a program on a standard TV versus watching the same program on an HD TV.  The still pictures look like you are seeing them on a standard TV.  Running the pictures through Photoshop's unsharp mask can improve the quality a bit.I like the shutter response time compared to my S70 - which has a significant delay.  The SX700 shutter delay is minimal - especially if the focusing is completed (by pushing the shutter button halfway down).  The burst mode is fast, the face location/recognition works well, the image stabilization does an excellent job.  You can use the zoom while taking movies - a feature I like and one that many cameras do not allow - you can even take still pictures while shooting a movie.  The battery lasts quite a while - shot 65 pictures, mosts with flash, and the battery indicator was still indicating full.  The camera is very customizable allowing you to turn on/off most features and customize what info is shown on the LCD when shooting or playing back pictures.  Panasonic did an excellent job with this FX7x series (which includes the FX75 and FX70) except for the picture sharpness.  If you are not a stickler for very sharp pictures, I think you will like this camera, if you are put off by anything less than an ultra sharp picture, this is not the camera for you.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Deceptive (IMO) - no manual control of video", "Author": "T.

You have no control over shutter or aperture of the video, as you do on the LX5 or the FZ100, for example, cameras which were released by Panasonic at the same time as this FX700.I was hoping that the MOS sensor in the FX700 would complement the CCD in my LX5, and also produce decent, manually-controlled, HD video.

But there are problems.", "Author": "GskFn", "ReviewID": "R1ST3YGBFJA25N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you want a wide-angle lens in your pocket camera, there's nothing like having it. I do love that.  And the \"intelligent auto\" mode is quite good on light and color in most of the environments I've tried so far.  I'm getting good pictures and some I could not have gotten before.  So I *want* to like everything about this camera.  But I can't say that.I lose some functionality by setting aside Canon pocket digitals from 2008 and 2004 that had fewer features and lacked the wide angle, but were easier to use. Settings are often difficult to adjust on the Lumix touch screen, and frequently result in firing off a picture instead of adjusting the desired setting.  I understand it comes with a stylus and I could try using that.  But seriously?  A stylus to adjust settings like exposure, shutter, and image size before snapping a picture on a pocket point-and-shoot?Playback is slow and clunky too, requiring swiping gestures instead of simple clicks on a physical knob.  In playback, organization is limiting as well.  I'm not finding any in-camera creation of folders.  Only favorite tags and picture protection from deletion.Battery life and extra-battery purchasing are question marks too. I'm having trouble locating an online retailer selling a Panasonic-made battery for this camera.  And I see user reviews online that call out a caution about updated firmware rejecting non-Panasonic batteries.  So if the camera requires a proprietary battery and that item is difficult to purchase, that's problematic.It might be worth looking at the newer, upper-level Lumix models where, I would hope, the additional physical knobs and buttons could help make the camera easier to use.  Meanwhile, I certainly will enjoy the wide angle on the FX700: it's better than I've ever had, and I've wished for a wide-angle lens in a pocket camera for a long time.  The pictures tend to be very good once I get them.

I set out to buy a Cannon, Nikon, or Sony and stumbled onto this Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX700 camera...I'm glad i did.  I was using an old 2002 Olympus 4MP that I bought in college, it was still working great but we were having a baby so it was time to upgrade.  I have been using the FX700 since Oct. 2010 and I love it.  Just like anything new it takes some practice to get a great picture, but that's the beauty of digital cameras and large SD cards.  I take photos like they are going out of style then find the one or two my wife and I like, that's what the pros do, lots of pics to find the right one.  Let me tell you why I spent a few extra dollars for this camera:1. 24mm Lica Lens = bad-A super wide lens, I love taking self-pics and I can hold the camera out and get me, my wife and our baby in a pic no problem, awesome!2. Fast Shutter speed = no blurry baby pics, kids do not hold poses when they are awake and having a new born or kids any age requires a fast shutter.  Move as fast as you want and this camera will make you look still, no blur with flash!  I watched my sister trying to take pics of her 18 month old. Yeah right, that kid doesn't stop, even with her SLR she had trouble getting clear pics, and just one pic from the FX700 came out clearer than her SLR.3. Full 1080i video with stereo sound = no need for a video camera too, that will save you a few $$$.  My first videos were of my dog catching a Frisbee, great videos and sound; I could hear the birds singing in the back ground.  Hooked the camera up to the 40\" 1080 LCD and the videos were pretty good (with RCA cable) at that size but I need to buy the mini HDMI cable to get the full resolution.  Ill update when I get that.4. One touch Video = just push the video button any time and start rolling, and you can still take pics!5. Touch screen = easy and more fun to use, I have an iPhone so I like touch screen; this was a selling point to me.  It's very easy to use with min practice. I can switch from color to b/w or sepia pics in a matter of seconds giving me the ability to take so artsy photos.6. Lots of seen modes = I can take all kinds of pics, my favorite is \"film grain\" that's a grainy b/w photo, it sure makes a lot of things look vintage.  Also ust the \"Baby mode\", this allows you to put the childs name and DOB in that mode so it will stamp this pic with their name and age! There is only 2 baby modes, not as helpful with large famlies.7. Super battery and fast charger = 275 plus pics and viewing on one charge! Then only about an hour to charge!  This means never missing a photo opportunity especially if you have an extra battery, we're talkin days of pics!8.  Editing on the camera = cropping, adding titles, color,... maybe all the new cameras do this but it has come in handy after taking pic of child birth ;-)9. Auto tracking = if you have a moving object, child or pet, if you can just keep them in the field of view it will make them the focus point.  That is a fun feature, I have not used it many times yet but I have a feeling it will come in handy very soon.10.  Its quick = I can turn it on and take a good pic in under 4 seconds!11.  Lots of adjustment ability = when i learn what all the aperture, ISO and shutter speed do I will be able to take even better pics.  Now i just have to take the time to learn.BUY A GOOD SDHC CARD!!!! If you truly want the best performance for this camera get a Class 6 or better card.  I had no idea cards came in different classes/speeds until researching cameras, it make all the difference.  I have a Delkin 8GB Class 6 SDHC Card, its been great so far.  It will hold about 1200 14mp pics or 1 hour of full 1080 HD video, that's enough for me for now.If you can tell I am very fond of the FX700 and everyone who sees or uses it wants one!  I have recommended this camera to many friends and family, but again don't skimp on the memory card.  In the end you do get what you pay for, I can't expect every pic to be perfect and its hard to tell who's at fault the operator or the camera...?  Just take lots of pics and then you'll always be happy. I plan on updating this review in spring 2011 so check back.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty good value", "Author": "Duncan Gray \"Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1PSUMNDJCFC3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera because I wanted a small compact full HD video camera mainly for home and Youtube use.  I own a Cannon MV700i with a 18x optical zoom which records on DAT cassettes but it is bulky to carry around for ad-hock shoots and it records in 4:3 ratio screen size.The Panasonic Lumix FX700 records perfectly in good light.  In poor light it suffers a bit.  I recored some footage in a rain Forrest in the Blue Mountains (near Sydney Australia) which is full shade conditions and it look good until you zoom in to full 5x optical at which point you can see digital noise in the darker areas. (When viewed on HD TV) You don't want to use it for a \"indie\" style TV movie in the shade at full zoom but if you are mindful of that short-coming then this camera will give results that you can be proud of.I also recorded a short movie of the train that goes up the side of the cliff at Scenic World.  At several points I panned the camera across to my wife, seated next to me, and then panned back to cover the front of the train again.  The train also enters a dark section of tunnel for about 5 seconds.  I shot the entire scene with the camera on \"automatic\" which means the camera selects the best settings for the circumstances.  On playback I noticed that one of the pans to my wife was out of focus.  It seems as if the camera focused on some other part of the scene.  There are plenty of setting you can choose from to affect the focus area so perhaps if you have patience enough to pre-asses what you are going to record and then set the camera accordingly, then you might get better results.  For example, had I set aperture priority and select the maxim F6 setting, I probably would have had more success with keeping the focus correct in the above example. One can't really blame the camera in this instance.The recording of the train in the 5 seconds of tunnel showed the noise artifacts in the dark areas.  This camera has a MOS sensor rather than the CMOS sensor used by most cheaper digital cameras and it is supposed to give superior low light performance than CMOS, so I can only assume that the movie would have had worse low light artifacts with a cheaper digital camera.We all wish for a camera that gives perfect results in all circumstances but I doubt that such a camera exists.  Certainly not below the $400 mark anyway.Regarding results of normal photographs, this camera certainly gives me MUCH better low light results than the $150 digital camera I own.  The Leica lens also gives fantastic results compared to the $150 camera which shows a lot of lens glow around the edges of bright objects.  The Panasonic Lumix FX700 does not show any such problems.In my opinion, if you want something better then you need to be look at cameras costing $800 or more.  Reducing the low light noise even further would be nice but it would require a bigger MOS sensor as mentioned by another reviewer but don't let that put you off unless you were hoping to use this camera to shoot TV commercials in near darkness.This camera also has face recognition and it works well for photographs.  If it recognizes a face it will choose to focus on that which means you family snaps should always be in focus.  I believe that this feature also works in movie mode.  The out of focus movie shot I mentioned earlier was more of a side view of my wife which makes it harder for the face recognition/detection to function.Something to watch out for, when playing back movies on your TV using the provided TV out cable, the color-detail quality is poor because of the digital to analogue to digital conversion process involved with that format.  Buy yourself a mini HDMI cable and rather use that for playing back on TV and you will see a huge difference in picture quality.  Using the provided TV-out cable actually hurts this camera's reputation and Panasonic should have given a HDMI cable with the camera, if only to ensure that people see their movies at the same high quality as they were recorded with.  If you are going to download your movies to a PC for editing and creating a DVD then the HDMI cable is not necessary.For more details about this camera, try this link [...]I rated this 4 out of 5 because the advertising hype about this camera's low light performance makes it sound perfect.  It is certainly better than a similar CMOS sensor camera but it is not perfect.  It more like 4.7 out of 5 stars.  Put in a bigger MOS sensor, even if it adds $50 to the price and it would be almost perfect.For what I'm using it for, I can't really complain and I am happy with my purchase.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "thrifty mom \"clare a\"", "ReviewID": "R3CNTM0EL8UX33", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had it for only a few days, so here's the initial review. I love this camera! The two major features I was looking for are fast shutter speed and no blur taking moving photos. I have a 3 year old and previously had the canon sd1200, which was crap at taking pictures of a kid unless they stood perfectly still. This one takes photos quickly, especially in burst mode, and she's always in focus. Last weekend I had a girl's weekend with 8 women, we used the camera a ton for 3 days straight-and just now it's showing the battery as 2/3 full. Also we used the slimming feature, slight slimming works great,we all looked fabulous! but the more slimming feature made it look like a funhouse mirror. We also tried the softening effect, made your skin look a bit better but not showing obvious editing.As far as the picture quality goes, outdoor light and bright lights looked fantastic, inside not as much. The indoor or nighttime shots were a bit soft, not as sharp as I would have liked. That, so far, is the only downside to the camera.

It is compact and slips right into my pocket.  The basic features for pictures and video are real easy to use.  Just flick a switch and press buttons.

I have taken a couple videos outside which are excellent of my rocket launch.  a video inside of a couple Raod Runners coming in our house to eat a handout came out good but a little dark, so need to figure out how to lighten up the foreground in the video mode - I am sure there is a setting for that.

That wide angle lens is the absolute best.  It is so great to get such a large area in your compsition. This lens far far better than the other one I had.  You can even get a close up of the kids at Christmas around the tree and get the whole tree in the picture and not just a portion as in a non wide angle lens.  There are lots of other setting for the more professional which I have not explored yet but will later on.  Give this a try, I think you'll like it.....", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing...", "Author": "T.

The LCD screen is useless in sunny outdoors conditions--you have to point the camera in the general direction and hope for the best.

This camera is like that it has features of $400 camera and costs like $200. Things I like about it .1) it is fast, so you never miss the moment2) video/audio recording is great3) Intelligent mode works great, so you don't have to worry about choosing different modes for different light setting and conditions. If you don't want to use the intelligence you have the options of playing around setting different modes or actually setting controls manually.I did some low light and outdoor photo's. Outdoor photo's were excellent. For low light most of them were great but some were not. But I would rather blame on my handling than the camera.One thing to take care is to order a SD card along with it. like 16G or 32G.

Jen", "ReviewID": "R1166Z0L6YNZEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the current price of about $200...the Panasonic Lumix DMC FX700 is an excellent value for this little super-compact, multi-function, and multi-featured P&S; camera...as long as you don't expect the image quality is the same as that from a DSLR, because it is not a DSLR! If you want a super image quality camera, then go buy a DSLR if you like to carry big/heavy camera with different lenses and equipment plus spending lots of $$$!When I first started my photographic hobby many years ago, I used SLR cameras along with telephoto & wide-angle lenses....I got tired of them so, I changed to smaller super-zoom models, such as Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ models. Even that, I still feel they are too bulky to carry all the time during traveling...I missed quite a bit opportunities because I didn't have the camera with me in some occations. So, I decided to carry good quality super-compact models for most my travelings.....the FX700 is just the ticket for me!I really like the 24mm super-wide-angle lense (with f2.2....do you realize how expensive that lense would cost if it is for a DSLR???)....it is perfect for taking scenery photos while traveling! I also like the fact it offers many manual settings besides just all auto settings (like most P&S; do)....very few super-compact cameras can say that! The LCD touch-screen is fun and functional, very easy to get used to...although it is measured 3\" but, it seems a little smaller than my older camera's 3\" LCD...I think it is due to the newer shape (newer 3:2 vs. older 4:3???). The new Panasonic FX78 model features a new 3.5\" touch LCD...that should be better than the current 3\" LCD!All I want to point out is don't let the image quality discussions stop you from buying this great little camera....the image quality is on-par with all P&S; super-compacts, if not better (the key is not to set ISO too high for better pictures)! But, with all the features it packed, no other camera in the same class can touch it for the current price ($200+/-)! Best of all, I can carry it all the time and don't even feel a thing! Once awhile, if I really want great image quality photos, I can always use the Canon 7D I bought for my daughter....but, I would never carry it for my traveling trips!", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera.

I did notice that the camera comes with a 6 month warranty for the CCD detector.  How convenient.  No wonder the price has dropped to below $200.
