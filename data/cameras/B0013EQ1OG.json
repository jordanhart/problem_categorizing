You just select it,  then point and shoot. -- LCD screen is good sized and clear. -- Provides 4 different preview shots at once (splits LCD display in 4)  and gives you the option to select which shot looks best to you. -- Image quality is good. Nothing spectacular, just good.CONS: -- Only takes xD picture cards. -- No burst mode (this is the continuous shooting mode). -- Write speed and flash recycle time is very slow.If you like fast burst mode, faster write speed, and SD card compatible,try either Canon SD1000 or Casio EX-Z80.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "awesome little camera", "Author": "Jane Scanlon", "ReviewID": "R2ENAROZBDTX7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 12 year old daughter bought this with birthday money and just loves it.

I really enjoy using it. One downside is the battery has to be removed and placed into a separate charger when charging. It would be much more convenient to plug the AC cord into the camera to charge it and less likely for me to lose the charger and have to purchase a new one.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "B.

I had previously owned an Olympus digital camera but was in need of one with updated features (optical zoom, larger view, slim body, lightweight, etc). In all ways this camera has met my complete satisfaction and was an excellent price on Amazon.  Very user friendly, takes great shots! Would recommend this camera to beginners and to those more experienced who wish to take along a compact excellent camera.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "i love this camera SO much!", "Author": "Michelle S (real name too revealing) \"boot ju...", "ReviewID": "R27KOLFWRA5WJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We go through about a camera a year (due to teen usage)so I tend not to spend a ton of money on one. I've hated every camera we've ever had and always wanted an Olympus. This camera has the funnest features, clearest pictures and frankly, if my son breaks THIS one I'm going to be so angry... and then come right back and get the exact same one again. The screen is crystal clear, everything is really easy to use and figure out. I can't reiterate enough- I love this camera.eta: i should note that we got the refurbished item and are just as happy as if we'd purchased the new one", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great small slim camera", "Author": "E.
