There is a button for a wifi \"wizard,\" which should make things easier, but it didn't. That's because, at least for the average buyer, there's not enough information in the box to guide you through some of the things you need to know or have questions on. (I think most users are like me; you set up a wifi connection with a device, pray that it works, and then, thorugh trial and error, you're not even sure what you did that got you to the end result! And then you forget all that until you need to do it again.) I tried on line help at Panasonic and emailed their customer service, and got no where. Finally, I called their 800 number. Talked to a nice techie, but I think he was figuring it out on the fly, just as I was.Here are two (I think) big helps for others who run into similar problems: 1. You CAN'T use the wifi until after you load the software and set up a folder where the wifi will transfer your pictures to. (Embedded in the directions, it does tell you to do that first, but it's far from apparent that things just won't work until then!) Second, once you load the software, you actually get a window that tells you exactly what you need to input in the final stage of wifi set up (but the nomenclature is slightly different, and that helpful fact was never made clear!), and this is where my problem occurred. BEWARE: if you have a computer that doesn't have a password, the final step WILL NOT WORK! (I never bothered with a password on my laptop:one extra step, and I've never worried about it: you need a password.) Apparently, the code is written so you HAVE TO input a password; you can't just leave it blank (At least their software program listed my password as \"NONE,\" and that's what gave me the idea to try again once I added a password. The Panasonic techie had no clue as he walked me through exactly what I had done in the wifi set up (again), and he should have known about this issue since in my original email, I asked if that was the problem.I can imagine all kinds of people returning this camera over frustration with the wifi (I mean, why would you keep it if you can't make this higher end feature doesn't work? Too bad, because I think I'm really going to like the camera itself. What I've seen so far, the menu choices are much easier to deal with that my older digital, an Olympus Zoom. I would strongly suggest to Panasonic that they put better \"Quick Start\" instructions in the box, ones that are consumer tested by ordinary people who are a little unsure of terminology and need the hand-holding. It's actually a 4 or 5 star camera with 2 star directions.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera with awesome WiFi.", "Author": "alan", "ReviewID": "RV9QNOULP84JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace an IP video camera, in order to be able to watch for expected visitors without being tied to the front window, allowing me to get other things done while waiting.  It works very well for that purpose.  In fact it is considerably better than the IP video camera purpose-built for that. This camera is particularly good for that that because it is small and unobtrusive, it can auto-focus and auto-adjust for the light conditions, and be remotely zoomed if desired.  Because it is battery-powered, I didn't expect it to have much WiFi range, and it doesn't, but it is good enough be to useful for me.  Working by remote control from my Android phone or tablet, the battery lasts for a couple hours. For more time, I also purchased a DMW-DCC10/DMW-AC5 AC adapter, which works well.The camera also takes good still pictures, and because of its small, easily pocketable size, it has been very useful to take along when I go out just in case an unexpected photo opportunity arises.  The SZ5 doesn't have a mode dial or touch screen, but none-the-less, is quite useable.For improvements, I'd like to see the WiFi remote control range increased.  Perhaps that could be done by also allowing a remote control mode that works through an existing WiFi channel.The WiFi remote control experiment Panasonic tried with this camera is very successful.  I think they have done a good job of it, and I find it very useful. I wish my FZ150 and GH2 had it as well, and suspect it'll be a highly prized feature on the GH3.  I'm glad I purchased this camera.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a fun/practical camera", "Author": "Christopher J.

The specs are great and this may be a great product, but I have lost an entire month and all of my pictures because of the PHOTOfunSTUDIO software that comes with the camera. The CD that comes with the camera asks you to load one of two software programs. One is a free 30 day trial and then there is a charge. I loaded the other software (PHOTOfunSTUDIO 8.4). I found this software totally non-intuitive. It brings up all the photos on your hard drive but does not show what directory or sub directory they are in. I could not figure out how to view the photos I took on the camera. I thought I was deleting the sample pics I had taken on the camera and instead deleted all the photos on my computer hard drive. I got so disgusted with the software I did not touch the camera for a month. When I picked it up today, I decided to print the PHTOTOfunSTUDIO manual (184 pages) to try to learn about the software. It is incomprehensible. I could not even determine what type of digital file I was creating when I took a pic. Was I creating a .JPEG or .TIFF file or some sort of proprietory Panasonic file? I called the 800 number and asked some pointed questions. I learned that I did not even have to use the PHOTOfunSTUDIO software, that I could use the image viewing Microsoft software that came with my computer. So, I deleted the PHOTOfunSTUDIO software from my programs and threw out the 184 page color manual that I just printed out. I have now found an Owner's Manual on the same CD (also 184 pages), and have printed that out. I am still short all of the photos that I lost on my hard drive. I know what the game is now. Panasonic is trying to tie you into their proprietary software so the next time you need a camera, you will be less likely to buy a Sony or Canon. Unfortunately, this business strategy by Panasonic does not benefit the consumer, just the opposite, it takes away from their fine products by confusing the consumer and wasting his time (and in my case, deleting his irreplacable photos). 1 out of 5 stars guys. Fire your software engineers and your marketing genius's and put on the 1st page of the Basic Owner's Manual (which is a seperate document from the 184 page Owner's Manual) this statement: ATTENTION BUYERS: IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE PANASONIC SOFTWARE TO USE THIS PRODUCT. IN FACT, USING PANASONIC SOFTWARE WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THIS CAMERA CREATES .JPEG FILES THAT CAN BE VIEWED, COPIED, PASTED, AND DELETED USING THE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH YOUR COMPUTER. HAVE A NICE DAY!1/22/13 update: In the 184 page manual that I printed out, there are no instructions on how to load the photos onto a personal computer. I had to figure that out myself without any help from the 184 page manual.
