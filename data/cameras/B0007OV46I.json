I had originally planned to get the FZ5 to replace my 3-yr old Panasonic LC5 but when I tried both, I found that an extra $100 or so bought me a slightly larger LCD (not enough to matter), sound when using the movie mode (which I have not used on any digital camera) and other useless gadgetry, like choice of silver or black body. I feel that the FZ4 is slightly faster and noise, which is usually seen in the shadows at higher ISO, is slightly reduced---and no purple fringing, period. Both are excellent cameras within their design parameters as cameras for sports, family gettogethers,nature and travel, not portrait or studio work although enlargements on the FZ4 are fine up to and including 8x11 and often even larger. What it lacks is a complete set of manual controls but if you want that you must get a DSLR and a couple of zoom lenses which will set you back several thousand. My Panasonic DMC-FZ4 was well under US$250, including tax and shipping.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 4MP Digital Camera", "Author": "SewingNana", "ReviewID": "R1ZZSNTZGKANYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With out a doubt one of the best little zoom cameras ever!

Virtually no learning curve in full auto..easy to progress on and learn to use the other functions this camera has. I do think that outdoor pictures are superior to indoor one's, but then there's still many more settings to play with and perfect all the gadgets built into this rig..", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "V. Young", "ReviewID": "R3K414BRUHRSIW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is kinda old but takes some pretty great pictures. I haven't gotten the hang of everything but its a pretty good cam. The viewfinder could be bigger most definitely and while the manual says the max card it can use is 1GB, I'm using a 2GB Sandisk Extreme III Card with the camera set on its highest settings which gives me about 1172 pictures to take. According to the manual, if I'm understanding correctly, this particular model doesn't have sound to the video but the next model does. Not a biggie for me. It comes with a lens cap and accessories to the keep the light out the picture, connecting it to the printer, among other things. Good camera. It was about 94 dollars without shipping and with what you get in the price it was a great deal, but I'd rather get a more recent model that has a viewfinder and bigger optical zoom.
