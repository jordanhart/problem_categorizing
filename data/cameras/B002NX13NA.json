{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Back to photography", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R2117VG1EW5FGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the first time I went out with my new Leica M9 I could not believe how much I missed the days of manual photography.  Granted that the Leica M9 has plenty of automated features (like Aperture priority shooting), but the need to construct your shot with this camera took me back to the golden days of manual photography.  Point-and-shoot is definitely not what this camera is all about.  With the M9 I found myself back in the world of photography as art.  Composition, aperture, f-stop, distance, white balance, etc., were again something I had to think about, and this gave me the feeling that photography was once more all about the photographer than about the camera.  You, the photographer, are back in charge, but with an extremely modern work of art at your disposal.  The experience is so great that you tend to put up with some of the challenges presented by these rangefinders: people with glasses find it hard to see the whole finder coverage, you sometimes forget you have the lens cap on, some lenses partially cover the rangefinder view, and the viewer doesn't have all the info goodies we have grown used to with late model DSLR's.  The thing is that after taking this camera for a ride, you really won't care much about what's not there.  You'll be plenty distracted with the art of making photographs.  That's right, the Leica M9 is not one of those cameras that allow you to \"get lucky.\"  Leica photographs are the product of some photographic reflection, composition, and manipulation of the simple functions of photography.  You will have to put some time on taking a photo, but the rewards brought about by impeccable optics and a machine reminiscent of a high-end Mercedes Benz will make every minute worth it.  Never thought that photography on the slow lane would be that much fun.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "$7K and No Engravings!", "Author": "JazzMann \"Jazz-Wine-Sun\"", "ReviewID": "R2081322WLXT23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Remember the Leica M8? I wrote an honest review of the M8 on Amazon and got flamed by Leica enthusiasts. My main concern with the M8 was the smaller than full frame sensor (18 mm x 27 mm) and its extreme IR sensitivity. I fully expect to get flamed for this review. I was not able to rent an M9 in my home city, Milwaukee. 6 months on a waiting list and an AmTrack ride I did get my rental from a well known photo shop in Chicago (with insurance!). So here goes. The full frame sensor on the M9 boasts a resolution of 18 Megapixels WITHOUT an anti-aliasing filter. Files are in the DNG format. Both Canon and Nikon use full frame sensors with resolutions of  25 Megapixels BUT they DO use anti-aliasing filters. In theory less processing (i.e. no anti-aliasing filter) can can yield better images. Without an AA filer images could be suseptable to moire patterns. But there were none visible with the M9. The question is this. Is the picture quality of the Leica quantifiably better than its competitors? I rented my M9 with a Leica 35mm f/2 ASPH lens. I shot numerous interiors, cityscapes and a few portraits. The quality of the images were excellent. But it's really impossible to distinguish Leica images from those of any other full framed brands. Handling and controls were excellent. The M9 seems to be about the same size as the old M8 so it's really small for a full framed 35mm camera. Controls are very similar between the M8 and M9. Leica removed a LCD counter from the top panel if I remember correctly. One thing about the camera is that it's auto exposure but manual focusing. I admit to being slow at manual focusing. This is a big disadvantage with action photography. BOTTOM LINE: This is a high quality digital camera built like a tank. If you are a long time Leica film camera enthusiast and already own Leica lenses then the M9 may be for you. If you are starting from scratch consider this. The M9 body will cost you $7000. A 35mm F2 Asph lens is another $3000. Is it worth the money? $10,000? Are you kidding? For me the answer is no. I am quite sure others will disagree. ; )", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nothing on earth like it", "Author": "Mel Rose", "ReviewID": "RD3KS76156MMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have wanted a Leica Rangefinder for a very long time. I am an experienced amateur photographer with an extensive portfolio in sports, landscape, portrait and travel photography. I have an immense collection of Canon digital and film bodies and nearly every lens Canon has produced in the past 20 years. I have been more than satisfied, more like enthralled, with the photography this equipment makes possible. Then I took the plunge and bought that Leica M9 I had been eyeing for the past year. After the sticker shot passed though I very nearly experienced buyer's remorse. Although I usually shoot all manual settings on my Canons, still the M9 looked painfully plain and unadorned without all the knobs, buttons, menus and gizmos to which I have become accustomed (alright addicted). I mean did I really intend to pony up $7000 for the body and another 3K for a lens so that I could step back twenty years? Then I took the camera on a winter photography trip to Venice along with my two adult sons who were both carrying Canon 7D's and 100 pounds of lenses. I couldn't believe how much fun photography became again and how this straightforward and exquisitely built camera freed the operator to become a photographer again. The learning curve is a little steep but fast and the immediate results are impressive. I knew that I was on to something in Venice but was blown away when we returned stateside and I have had several weeks to review all the images from the trip carefully. The Leica is a pleasure to carry, elegant to use and produces the sharpest photographs I have ever taken. This was apparent across the board, in all lighting conditions and when used for long exposure or for HDR work. I could not be happier with this camera and take it with me everywhere now. This camera can only be described with superlatives. If you can afford it, buy it.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "eccentric and astonishing camera", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R2ZATULHUD31J5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Leica M9 has a very good sensor but is primitive and has very limited capabilities compared to a DSLR.  It exists only to provide a full frame body to mount Leica and Zeiss M lenses.  That said, it can produce some of the best photographs of any camera, especially landscapes.Shooting a Leica M is a lesson in the importance of lenses.  I now realize how much lenses are the basis of any camera system followed closely by the quality of the camera sensor.  A sensor cannot correct a deficient lens.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Leica's M lenses must be shot to be believed.  Thirty year old Leica M lenses are noticeably superior to any Canon lens, although Canon's new 24-70 f2.8 II and both 70-200 zooms are getting close to the same magic.  Leica M bodies only exist, and their cost can only be justified, as a means to shoot these astonishing lenses.  The biggest problem, after getting enough money to afford the stuff, is finding lenses to buy.  All of the Leica lenses I have (35mm f2, 50mm f2 and a 90mm f2.8) were purchased used.  I had to check sites offering used lenses frequently to find them and it took several months.  I would have bought new if they were available.  (I did manage to find a Zeiss 21mm f2.8 new that is also a terrific lens).  These are not mass produced.The quality of the lenses is hard to adequately describe.  I also shoot a Canon DSLR (1Ds, 1DSIII and now 5DIII) with the best Canon lenses.  I bought the M9 originally to have a smaller camera to hike with and carry while traveling but now the M9 is my first choice.  I only shoot the Canon if I need its additional versatility (which is quite often -- the Canon body is far superior in every respect).  Shots taken with the M9 and a Leica or Zeiss lens have more detail than any other camera I have used.  But it is more than just the quantity of detail.  The quality of the details seems more natural, more real.  I think the difference is that Leica lenses capture more real detail to begin with and the images are less computer generated.  Colors and contrast are also very rich and the balance is really engaging.  I recently made a 17\" x 22\" cropped print of a landscape taken with the M9 and 35mm f2 Leica lens.  Small bushes can be clearly seen that are more than 1000' below and a mile away from where I took the shot.  All of the Leica and Zeiss lenses I own outresolve the M9's 18 mp sensor.  The more you enlarge the more the details pop until the pixels finally turn to squares at about 300x enlargement.  Shooting the Leica has turned me into a detail junkie.Another reason for the crisp detail is the lack of an AA filter in the M9.  This occasionally results in moire which is a strange and unreal color and design pattern in areas with close parallel lines.  Moire does not happen often but it is a trade off.  Many photographers report never seeing moire either with the M9 or the new Nikon D800E.Manual focusing has pluses and minuses.  Often it is easy and fast.  If you are shooting a landscape at infinity you just set the focus and aperture and fire away.  You don't worry about autofocus inadvertently missing infinity.  Because of the extraordinary clarity and speed of the lenses coupled to a full frame sensor, the M9 has the same depth of field characteristics as a DSLR and can take terrific selective focus shots.The M9 doesn't have much high ISO capability (it goes to 2500 and that is pretty grainy) and the camera is really hit and miss if shooting anything close in that is moving.  Manual focusing in that context is really difficult.  Because of the configuration of the lens and sensor, very wide angle and long telephoto shots are not possible.  The many manual settings can also be frustrating.  To shoot the 21mm lens I have to set the lens manually in the camera menu then mount a separate viewfinder on the flash mount.  I have to first focus through the rangefinder and then look through the separate viewfinder to frame the shot.  Some people love to do that.  I don't.  In the end putting up with so many limitations and hassles is a testament to the great images this camera produces.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Results", "Author": "Marcella L.

Coming from full frame Nikon with tons of lenses and auto-focus, I was initially worried that the transition to manual focus and a small set of primes would be too difficult.  After several months of shooting solely with the M9 I am 100% blown away with this camera.  At first I was frustrated because I was unable to shoot as many frames as quickly with the Nikon but then I realized that the only reason I was shooting so many frames was because it took so many more shots to get the perfect one.  The M9 forces you to compose and focus with so much more precision that I now usually get the shot within the first or second shutter click, whereas I used to have to fire off a couple dozen with the DSLR to get the same quality.  The camera and lenses are very expensive but the quality of the images, the build quality and compact size and precision far outweigh the cost.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Leica M9", "Author": "Dneez", "ReviewID": "R36W9A9YVN9E8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took a plunge, spent more money than maybe I should have but have no regrets! I grew up with a photographer father and his Leica. I have experienced a range finder and so there was no adjustment there.What I experienced is the same as a review I read when trying to decide whether to purchase the Leica or not. I have found after taking vacation with the M9 that is slows everything down. You think about composition and metering and you have to focus. You think about the old principles of photography. I had started to forget these and be spoiled by auto focus in the heat of the battle during a shoot for a wedding.I like being challenged by the 50mm lens as that ia ll I could get along with the body.

Many Leica, Zeiss and Voigtlander M-mount lenses do not fit Leica M9 such as Zeiss ZM 21/4.5 and Voigtlander 15mm, due to M9's stupid sensor. Its noise level is horrible compared to much cheaper competitors such as Canon 5D mark ii and Nikon D700(around $2000). Moreover, it is a manual-focus camera which should be obsolete in this great digital era. Compared to Leica's older models such as M3 and M6, this M9 claims no success at all.
