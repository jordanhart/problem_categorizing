The quality of the image is acceptable, clear enough. The night vision is better than I thought. I can see any movement that happens in my carport throughout the night. They shipped quickly too! I am so satisfied with my purchase. I recommend this product.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "BB", "ReviewID": "RUE6MRQO72YST", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Perhaps my expectations were too high.  Daylight use is OK, not as sharp as I was hoping but probably normal for a video camera.  The night functioning is useless.  The images are just ghostly outlines.  I have the system set for motion detection and there is so much image noise at night it seems to trigger the motion detector and it records all night long, even though there is nothing actually going on.  Trespassers at night need have no fear of this camera.  All it would really show me is the time of the intrusion.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.95", "Features": "1/3\" PIXIM DPS technology.
