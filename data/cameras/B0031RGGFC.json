{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I'm Happy With It", "Author": "N. Bachers", "ReviewID": "R3QYD4BPWNV76H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was a last-minute rush order for my trip to Vietnam.  I had a couple of uptight days when Amazon sent me an email telling me my Kingston 4gb SDHC card was shipped separately, and \"the remainder of your order will follow as soon as those items become available.\"  Since it was rated \"in stock,\" I was wondering what the issue was.  However, Amazon got it to me by Tuesday night after I'd ordered it the previous Friday.  So, Whew! good going, Amazon.I'm fairly electronic-gadget functional, but I'm no techno-wizard.  I had a little time to check my camera out the night I left, and while waiting at the airport.  Buttons and controls are laid out well, and the learning curve is pretty easy.  The last thing I wanted to do was stand there fiddling around with buttons while people waited.  In that respect, it worked fine- the Smart Mode, the default start-up mode, worked in most cases.  I was able to quickly engage the flash settings when needed (most of the time.) I tried some daytime and night time panoramic shots; the internal stitch feature worked flawlessly.  I learned that the night-time panorama and landscape modes keep the shutter open for a looong time; if you move the camera, the shot blurs.  So you need a solid surface to rest the camera on when you do stuff like this.I've learned what most of the 22 different \"Scenes\" automatic feature-settings are, but I haven't reached the point where I can push the button, and go right to the appropriate setting.  The on-screen description of each \"Scene\" setting tells you what you need to know.I found the view screen to be large enough both for shooting and sharing.  People were always looking to see how a shot turned out.I'm very happy with picture color, clarity, and sharpness.  I took a few shots under an awning where it was bright outside, and the subjects under the awning were not quite light enough.  I can upgrade that in post-photo processing.  There's a \"Scenes\" setting for both backlit and forelit shots, but, as I said, I didn't spend the extra time to access the setting before the shots.My obligatory bee-on-a-flower and butterfly shots were made using the 3x zoom feature.  Due to the 12 megapixel rating, I can magnify the shot and still get excellent detail.  I shot the bee close up in Smart Mode and the butterfly from a distance.  I wish I'd used the close-up or flower settings in \"Scenes,\" but I just wanted to get the shots quick while they were happening.  I had to delete a couple of the bee shots due to camera-motion blurring, but the ones I kept have plenty of clear detail.  3x zoom is a little minimal, but, hey, I didn't even pay a hundred bucks for the camera.My rain and fog atmosphere shots came out the way I wanted them, with visible rain coming down.  Landscape shots are sharp and detailed.We ended up at a karaoke and dance club, and every shot there came out just the way I wanted it.  Everyone was happy with the shots I took of them, both around the table, or on the dance floor or at the mike.  The flash was adequate for the dim interior.  I used the pre-flash non-red-eye setting for all the night club shots.Charging and up-loading is super-simple.  There's a mini plug for the camera, with a USB at the other end of the cable.  There's a two-prong plug to insert into a socket for charging; you plug the USB into the plug.  Upload via USB to the computer was quick and easy.  Battery life held up fine for the week I was using the camera.  I entered a lot of email addresses for the \"Share\" feature, but I haven't used that yet.  There's an on-screen keyboard that makes email address entry quick and simple; accessing this list is also easy.So, overall, I'm as pleased as I can be with how this camera works.  I basically kept it in my pocket and whipped out & turned it on whenever I wanted.  It starts up almost immediately, and being bounced and constricted in my pocket didn't seem to bother it at all.  I didn't experience any buffer delay before the next shot was available.I shot a few trial videos just to learn how to use video, but I didn't take any permanent video.  It's easy to shoot, and seems to work, from my fiddling around.I ordered it with the Kingston 4 gb Class 4 SDHC card featured on the same page as the camera.  They seem to be a good match- the Kingston's a good price, with plenty of photo space.One tiny complaint- the camera battery & card door kept coming open when I pulled the camera from my pocket. This is probably more due to how I use the camera, but a better latching system is surely in order.  I googled \"Kodak M530 battery door problem\" and didn't see any rash of complaints on this.As a non-high-tech camera guy and a short-time owner, I've gotta give this camera an enthusiastic two thumbs up.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for a great price", "Author": "W. Lucero", "ReviewID": "R1K33LOK9KNZ1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually shoot on a Canon DSLR, but am getting ready for a summer trip and wanted something small to carry in my pocket. I did some research and looked around and after messing with a few cameras in hand, I stumbled upon this kodak and impressive it is. For the price it cant be beat, at 12mp with a nice sleek design and very easy to use the buttons are very user friendly. The layout of the buttons are also user friendly no fumbling around at all. Basically at the size of a credit card it easily stores away in my pocket. It also has a \"smart\" feature which basically just adjusts everything for you instead of having to mess with settings. Its pretty fast when taking a shot, I was expecting a slow response time, but again have been pretty impressed how fast it actually is for a little point and shoot. The pictures have all been really crisp and gives very vibrant colors. Easy downloads of all photos and its a quick painless transfer. It also has a function to connect to your facebook or flickr account if you have one, which I didnt use, but is convienant regardless. If you looking for something quick easy and fun this is a great deal, if your want something more advanced than look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "So many problems out of the box...", "Author": "R. Kyser", "ReviewID": "R2M09ZLY5RMU3L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Our previous camera died so we bought one of these M530's.  My wife liked the Kodak name and has used Kodak before.  Unfortunately for us, the camera is problematic and it's not just ours judging by complaints and reviews I've read online now.On the plus side this camera takes video with sound, in addition to normal photos.  There are a variety of menu options and picture types to choose form, though to be honest you're going to take 95% of your pictures in the default \"Smart\" mode anyways.It's the problems though that keep it from being a recommendable purchase.First off, almost as soon as it was out of the box the LCD screen has a tendency to go white after it's been on once.  If you turn it on, take some pictures, turn it back off, then on again a few minutes later the LCD display will ALWAYS go white, no exceptions.  You can still take pictures, but can't possibly see what it is you're taking of course.  I've read online this is sometimes due to a loose wire internally, but find it hard to believe it's a loose wire because it always happens after it's been on once already then magically disappears if you leave it off for 10 minutes or so.  This is a huge problem because nobody leaves their camera one for an extended period of time, and judging by reviews is not unique to this specific model but is a problem with many, many different Kodak cameras.  I don't know or care what the reasoning or excuse is, but this kind of problem is not acceptable out of the box.Secondly, the camera takes a rather large amount of light in order to take pictures.  My kids have fairly cheap cameras that require less light to take a simple picture.  I don't know what the problem is with the M530's light filter, but for a company like Kodak this kind of problem really isn't acceptable either.Lastly, to do something as simple as add a date and time stamp to your photos is not possible without going in and selecting each photo individually and then adding the stamp.  This is just plain dumb.  An option to turn On and Off automatic stamping is all that's needed here, and as it stands this way stamping your photos will not be an option unless you just have loads and loads of free time to waste by adding them individually.Overall, my verdict is to stay away from this camera.  The problems aren't minor, but are medium to major and it's just not a good value.  Quite frankly Kodak seems to have the same problems with various camera models and lines, so perhaps staying away from Kodak altogether is your best bet.  You'd think a company like Kodak would be able to put out a better product than this.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak M530, fantastic point and shoot camera, price affordable", "Author": "danpan11", "ReviewID": "RXNW43VTOCDAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On of the things i like most about this camera is the size, its the perfect size, it fist in your hands great, and the menu buttons and the 4-way navigation feels great even with the smal size. The price is unbeatable, with the lithium rechargable battery, the cable and charger, and of course the quality of the hardware you are getting a great deal.The Pros:- Rechargable battery. Is durable, and it charges quickly.- Quality value for small price, is a great piece of hardware, when you pick it up you can see is sturdy, with a good weight but not to heavy, and made from durable plastic.- The camera always start in smar capture mode, wich is great for inmediate photos, anyone can pick it up and take the picture.- The program mode is extense, gives you plenty of room to experiment, with ISO, exposure compensation, long time exposure up to 8 seconds (light painting), white balance, and even sharpness. Great for begginers.- The share button. I think this is the greatest thing about this camera, setting up the software takes no longer than 3 minutes, and once you are done, you can hit the share button in the camera and it will instantly upload to facebook, flickr, kodak, and even some emails that you add to the camera. The software auto optimizes the pictures so that the file size is about 300 Kb, and the picture stays with a good resolution.- The review mode. Any camera has a good review mode, but what makes the kodak m530 great is the flexibility, you can review all pictures, favorites (previously declared as favorites), from an especific date, and the best, with the face recognition software in the camera you can tag your family and friends, after taking about 10 pictures of the same person the camera identifies him/her and you can tag the face, in the review you can select the name of the person, and the camera will automatically filter the files and show you only the ones where that person you chose from the menu appears.The Cons:- Battery doesn't last that long, one advice is to set the AF mode to single, so the lens is not constantly focusing, but only does it when you press the shutter button halfway- The shutter button, the power button, the mode button, the flash button, all of this buttons are located in the upper part of the camera, and they are very small, and kinda hard to press if you have big hands.- For those who think smart capture does not make the the right selection 100% of the time. This is not the camera for you. This camera is a low price, point and shoot digital camera, is made for that, begginers in photography. And the smart capture does the best job in taking the job off editing options before the moment passes and you didn't get a chance to take the picture.- The colors are a little blend, so you might wanna edit the color option to \"Natural Color\" or in some cases \"High color\"", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Kodak is much better than just OK", "Author": "G. Max Gooding", "ReviewID": "R1I7XTDP3504YX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previously to getting this camera, I had some Sony cameras that ended up giving me some trouble, so I decided to make a brand switch. Kodak has been in the photography business for years and is a well trusted name. In fact the trade name Kodak was registered in the year 1888. Subsequently, the Eastman Kodak company was registed in 1892. Why is this so important? When buying a camera, reliability is important, especially if you travel to distant locations where you may want to capture a once in a lifetime experiences on your camera. The last thing you want is for your camera to konk out on you when you most need it.This is a feature rich camera, and has all that you need to capture and share your pictures easily and effortlessly. I have found these cameras to be defect free and to perform as per specifications. What I found to be unique about this camera is that you can tag your pictures so that you can find your subjects easily.Here are a few notes that may help you in your purchasing decision:- No software is included, you will need to download it yourself, the web site is given inside the manual.- The Camera has 3X optical zoom, but no digital zoom, which is really OK, since you can digitally zoom your pictures if you really to on your computer.- Built in memory is 32MB, so you should purchase an SD card one time if you know that you are going to be taking out a lot of pictures.- Also in the manual is a web address that gives a lot of information, topics covered include: battery management, lens maintenance, minor repairs and firmware upgrades.This product works properly and it is well supported, so that if you run into problems there is abundant support so that you can make the most of your camera investment.

I've experimented with my new M530 now for 2 days.  Pros:  takes great pictures in various light situations.  Close up shots are great.  Telephoto works fine for my purposes.  Flash is ok.  Downloads easily to computer.  Lots of functions in the SCN mode.  Reasonably user friendly.  I've taken approximately 50 pics and the battery appears to be about 1/2 way down.  I plan to buy a spare battery.  Kodak says that I should be able to get 200 pics on a charge.  (time will tell). So that's better than my Sanyo.  Great value or $70.  Ok, now for the cons:  The on/off button is not made for a guy with big fingers and short fingernails.  ( which I have).  The internal memory holds only 5 pictures a@ 12.0 mp.  By lowering the setting to 6.2 mp I was able to get 11 pics in the internal memory.  I have bought a 2 GB memory disk.  My old Sanyo would hold 55 pics in the internal memory and in two years I never came close to filling a 1 GB memory disk.  The mode setting keeps returnig to \"Standard\" every time I turn off the camera.  I guess this is ok, since Standard will work for me most of the time.  In those rare occasions, when I need something else I can change the setting.  I will probably never use the Video feature.  Bottom line:  I am glad I bought this camera.  I am sure we will get to know each other better.
