Since I work with computers, I suspected that the problems the others were having could be user issues and took a chance. I bought mine from a drug store for under $100 after verifying the specs on the box: dual core processor, front camera, 1 gig memory, 2 USB ports, HDMI and SD Card slot. I took a chance knowing I had 30 days to take it back.The 30 days are up, and I love it. It has more apps than I will ever use, though there's no guarantee it will have the one you want. I use the Amazon App Store, which has a TON of titles. Some of the concerns I had were:1 - battery life. Others had complained, but it didn't seem like they were familiar with electronics batteries. I took the tablet home and plugged it in. After charging, I left it playing a video until the battery was completely dead. I did this again three times, which conditions the battery. I just ran an 111 minute movie on my monitor through the external HDMI port twice off the battery. Thats almost 4 hours sending video to an external display, and the battery still had a 60% charge. Much better than I expected.2 - Would it have all the apps. After loading Amazon apps, I was more than happy. I downloaded some browsers and Kingsoft office, and I was set. Again, there may be apps that you can't get on Amazon, but most of the popular ones are there.3 - Locking up. The tablet has locked up once while I was trying to load two programs at one time. I just let the battery discharge, which turned the tablet off - basically a reset. I recharged and it has been working perfectly.4 - Internet speed. At home, work, and at my local library the speeds are good. I haven't had any latency or loading issues. Signal strength has been consistent. I had a problem at one restaurant (got to check on baseball). I couldn't connect, but my iPhone wouldn't either.5 - USB function. I had an inexpensive, older tablet that had a USB port, but it didn't work like a USB port. On this tablet I can plug the wireless keyboard and mouse from my laptop into the full-sized port and it works perfectly.The speed is fine, it runs at dual core speed. I've played video from file and from the internet. On the basis of specs, this would probably rate 4 stars, but it exceeded my expectations which pushed it up to 5. There's no guarantee everyone will have my luck, but I did.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good For the Price Point - Don't Expect Super Performance", "Author": "Veil_Lord", "ReviewID": "R1LWNB0I6DN22U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I picked this up at a pharmacy for a very cheap price.  This is the first tablet that we've ever owned had.  I read the other reviews and the one that was positive and we figured we'd take a shot.  We've only had it a while now, but we're both quite impressed for the price point.  Just don't go expecting a Kindle Fire, Galaxy, or Nook level of device.  If you're getting this for about half the price of one of those I'd say go for it.  If you're paying 2/3 the price, spend a bit more for the upgrade.The construction of the device feels solid.  I didn't get a \"cheap feel\" off of it.  The touch screen was highly responsive once you figured out how to use it.  You can't really use your fingernails to do it, you have to tap with the tip of your finger or use a  stylus you purchase separately; I liked the stylus that came with an accessory pack I got for my kindle.  I do notice the back of the device getting a little warm after continuous use.  It has one HDMI output, a standard mini-USB sized input (file transfer/recharging), and a micro SD slot to expand memory.  The memory card is helpful as the free space is only about 2 GB out of the box; the instructions say it can handle up to 32 GB.  You won't be filling up much memory with its camera. There is only a front-side camera and the quality is on level with a cheap cell phone.My wife basically wanted a video player with a larger screen than her old Sylvania 8GB Player (2.8\" Touch Screen).  The device manages that perfectly.  The screen is clear and the sound is good.  Battery life could be better, getting maybe 4 hours of non-constant video, but it may improve as the battery goes through a few more charging cycles.  It also comes with a bonus mini-USB cable with a female port at the other end. You can use this to connect a USB flash drive but it blew my mind when it successfully connected and powered a Western Digital My Passport Edge Portable Hard Drive!  You'll drain your power really fast powering that hard disk off the tablet's battery, but it's incredible it can make that happen.  File transfer was slower than from a PC in both cases, but it saves having to lug a laptop on a long trip.We like the apps that came with it, including Google maps, a web browser, and the Kindle one (though I vastly prefer my Kindle for reading books).  Best I can tell you're limited to Amazon's app store and some other one I hadn't heard of, but we likely won't be purchasing much of anything.  For our purposes it, we don't need much else.  It occasionally locks up for a bit or slows down to nearly a lock-up, but overall it's speed is quite good and everything seems responsive.I do want to warn you, since we almost took it back.  I plugged it into both a Windows 7 64-bit machine and a Windows XP 32-bit machine and both failed to install all the drivers.  I had to go into Device Manager and look at the USB devices and uninstall both USB Mass Storage and USB Composite Device (you can tell which one to remove because they're the new ones that appear when you connect the tablet to your PC).  After removing them, I rebooted and re-connected the tablet and they installed properly.  The device called Android failed to install no matter what I did and I still couldn't see the tablet in My Computer so I almost gave up, but then I realized it didn't matter and the instructions that come with it are wrong.  The manual says the tablet will ask you when you plug it into your computer.  In my experience, this is not the case.  After I connected the tablet showed a message about the USB next to the clock.  When I clicked the clock area, it popped up the menus with settings.  There was a USB debugging one and another USB one.  When I clicked the second one, the device popped up the menu asking to turn it into a mass storage device.  A click of the button and my computer now saw it and file transfers went smooth as silk.I can certainly believe that a low end device may have the problems that some of the negative reviewers experienced, but thus far we haven't seen any.  The warranty is pretty much worthless; you have 90 days and you have to ship it back to Craig along with $20 (US customers, more for ex-US) to cover return shipping.  That said, if it's going to have problems you'll probably see them in the first month so as long as you can return to the seller you bought from you're probably OK.I can update my review if anything goes wrong with it, but so far very happy considering the price.--Update 4/19/13-- (5 months later)Tried Angry Birds Star Wars and it just very barely ran it.  However, the tablet is still functioning well as a video player.  I tried hooking it to the TV, but found the connection on the tablet end is actually a mini HDMI instead of regular HDMI so I would need a cord I don't have.  It's slowed down a bit so I'm considering a reformat to see if that helps.  Battery life is in the 3 hour range with WiFi off, but for the low price we paid, she's still pretty happy with it.  I installed a program called ES File Explorer for free from Amazon's app store about a week ago and now she can see video files over our LAN.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked well", "Author": "Jeff Rutsch", "ReviewID": "R3A5URQM39Q376", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a positive experience with this tablet.  What basically attracted me initially was the price and the options - an SDHC card is a must for me, and I really liked having an HDMI out as well.  However it worked about as well as I could have hoped.  With a few negatives:- Audio output was pretty \"noisy.\"  It was fine for casual listening, but when I plugged it into stereo speakers there was a very noticeable hum.  A bummer, because I was hoping to use it with TV & stereo in a pinch.- Battery life was OK but not great.  It felt like maybe 5-6 hours, and if you left the tablet in \"standby\" mode without turning it entirely off, it would drain maybe a third of the battery in a day.  Which sounds like nit-picking, but it meant that when I ended up using it every few days, I'd run into battery problems.  One more thing to worry about.- A little bulky, with a non-operational button in the front for some reason.- I didn't buy it for games, but I tried out a couple just for curiosity.  Angry Birds worked fine.  Temple Run, a more arcade-ish type game, didn't really work, because it was too slow responding to movements, especially screen tilt.  It worked fine for watching movies in HD avi files though.- Amazon app store was fine, but sometimes it would pause for a few seconds when you pressed a button.  I didn't notice any delay in other apps, though.That sounds like a lot of negatives, but mostly it worked fine.  Still, I ended up returning it because I found a tablet to not really be that useful for me.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "avoid this like the plague", "Author": "Ed \"Ed\"", "ReviewID": "R30OE5AVZSKJIS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was a huge mistake getting this poor excuse for a tablet.  Not a single third party app works, there's no built-in compass so you can't use compass apps or sky charts.  The screen is dim, the sound volume is so low you can hardly hear it, and it's so slow you sometimes have to wait 20-30 seconds for the unit to respond to touch commands.  The tablet also doesn't keep time well, it loses about 20 minutes a day.Virtually none of the apps I use from the standard android Play store are available on the Amazon app store, so there really isn't much you can do with this tablet unless you want to give it to a child to play games - plenty of silly games available, just nothing to be productive with.  Many of the apps which are available will not run on this tablet, they either won't install or Force Close the moment you try to run them.I wrote to Craig asking how to get some things working - they took over 2 weeks to respond and said that the Play store is off-limits, all the apps I need are not compatible with this unit, and the clock should work fine, I should just hit the reset button on the side of the unit (sure, that's good advice).It's hard to believe a company would actually put this garbage on the market, it's not really suitable for any purpose at all.

Martin", "ReviewID": "R39IO43KCYLS6S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The tablet runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). A fair amount of apps on the Google Play store aren't compatible with this device. Video looks fine on the screen but I couldn't get the Netflix app to work. The tablet has a YouTube app preinstalled.I started out using a Wireless G router but switched to Wireless N and the online response notably improved. However, the tablet can't take advantage of Dual Band. There is no Bluetooth but it does have a 3D gaming accelerometer. You can install Google Play for apps but you have to root the tablet to do so. The SlideMe Marketplace and GetJar app stores are built-in but they're inferior to the Amazon and Google app stores. Reading is fine on the Amazon Kindle app and there is no flicker when turning the pages. The built-in Twitter client crashes pretty regularly.The speaker is pretty weak but when connected to an external speaker sounds fine. I tried overclocking it but it would regularly reboot so I gave up on that. Even though I went back to the factory settings, it still occasionally reboots but not as often. The processor is not a speed demon. Lagging is pretty frequent. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. If you would like to try a tablet to see if it's for you, this is a good choice. You can always use it as a backup. It comes with two USB connectors and an AC/USB charger.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "app store solution", "Author": "mara doll", "ReviewID": "RIWSQERWN70KJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i found a app called 1 mobile market that works good and has most google play store apps unlike the junk one this comes with.

No functionality however was a surprise.Despite the up to date Android 4.0 operating system establishing a WIFI connection via WEP or WPS was an unreliable prospect and often was not possible at all as the unit would go into an endless cycle of trying to obtain an IP address. I had to turn to multiple tech forums online to find work around solutions such as entering a static IP address manually or tinkering with my SSID settings. Open public access wifi hot spots were not much better as the unit would connect with decent signal strength but would freeze up and shut down while trying to load a web page.At 70% power the unit started getting very buggy sometimes spontaneously going into a power off restart cycling loop or locking at the android logo start-up screen rendering the power button useless and requiring a hard reset. Speaker quality, camera resoltion, available memory and battery life were all low end on the performance scale but that was to be expected given the price range. All I really wanted from this unit was to surf the web and check e-mail but it was too broken down to pull it off.Craig does have a tech support toll free line printed on the box but calling only lands you on hold for several minutes and then you get routed to a voicemail box requesting name, phone and the nature of the problem for a follow-up call back. I'm still waiting for mine two days and counting.Inexpensive techno junk is fun to take a risk on buying as sometimes you will luck out and find a true gem but this offering from Craig into the tablet market is a real vegas style gamble. You might get a functional unit or you might get a bug riddled paperweight.
