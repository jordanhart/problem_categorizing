[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.

In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane. Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.

My fault for not fully understanding its limitations But...", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMZBVAQM3X7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/11/14 Update:Having had the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for a couple of months now, my experience with this device has me convinced that there are much better options available a within the same price range.I'll go over some of the ground that I wrote in my full review below, but feel those things that I do go over are important considerations in determining whether or not the Kindle will work for you so I'll be going over the most important points here as well.First off the display.While the display looks great in general, I am a little disappointed with the brightness of the display when outdoors. I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Oh dear sweet baby Jesus...I'm in love!", "Author": "HotMessPrincess", "ReviewID": "RGGLLVVS9K0E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can I just say that I love this new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (64 gig) so much that I'd make out with it if I wasn't persnickety about getting drool on the glass?Where to start...First, I should confess my sins. Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always. Amazon is truly a customer friendly company and I will never stray again. I am so happy to be back in the fold of happy Amazon customers. This is the best purchase I've made all year.

It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7\" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3\" x 5.0\" x .35\", it's one of the smallest 7\" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7\" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like \"Books\"  \"Music\"  \"Videos\"  and \"Web.\"  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that \"special offers\" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled \"oops.\" As in \"Oops, there aren't very many of them.\" Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think \"10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty.\" Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say \"previous\" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7\" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new \"Mayday\" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By \"one hand\" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine.

Its interface is much improved over the previous generation. Yes, it has great sound and great picture.Now, here are the reasons that I think that I'll return the HDX.1) Purple hue on the edge of the screen when reading books. There are a lot discussion about this on the product reviews and it is true. Personally, the color becomes so distracted that I no longer enjoy reading from the device.2) Resizing issue. When you enlarge the display (in email or browsing), the device does not do auto-fit to or wrap the text to next line. This is very annoying, as you have to slide back and forth to see the full text. This is not the case with other Andriod device or phone. For me, it is unacceptable that I have to keep my finger on the screen, almost all the time, sliding it back & forth, left & right to see the whole content of an email or a web page.3) Amazon app store still is lack of common apps that user take for granted.

In my mind the fact that that the screen flaw is most apparent when using the Kindle as an e-reader (one of it's marquee features) points to a critical failure in Amazon's QA process for this device.  Frankly, Amazon should be embarrassed.I debated between exchanging the device and returning.  For my sake and Amazon's I've decided to return it.  I don't want to go through multiple exchanges to find a screen without this flaw.  Also, reports of Amazon's customer service rationalizing this screen defect as \"normal\" puts a bad taste in my mouth because it reminds me of all the rationalizations and backpedaling Amazon went through with respect to the very real issues the first generation Kindle Paperwhites had with defective front lit screens that had green/pink blotches.I'll consider repurchasing what is otherwise a great 7 inch tablet when Amazon officially acknowledges the screen issue as a defect and confirms that it has rectified the problem either in software or in the manufacturing process.tl;dr version -- Amazon claims the Kindle Fire HDX screen is the best available.

Magazine subscribers - you CAN buy this Kindle", "Author": "Mark Bail", "ReviewID": "R1M26265LB668Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE!Upon posting my original review (maintained in its entirety below), I was contacted by Amazon's Customer Service. Cody wrote me an email and tried calling twice as a follow up.  He was able to demonstrate that I could keep my magazine collection on the new Kindle HDX (Solution: once the magazine is downloaded, press and hold the issue until a pop-up window appears.  Select \"Keep\" and the issue will be kept indefinitely).  I now have my complete collection of PC magazines on my HDX available when needed.Prompt customer service can change a bad situation into a good one, and in this instance that has happened.  The original review was posted on Sunday and Cody had responded on Monday, the following day.  As a loyal customer, I appreciate the effort by Amazon to provide quality customer service.  I know it's not cheap.As a result, I have changed my rating from two stars to four.  If I could bifurcate my rating, I would give customer service five stars and the HDX four.  Specific to the HDX, the battery life seems to be shorter.  I only get 2 days of mild usage, whereas I could go 5 with the original Fire.  It also has some idiosyncratic features I'm not certain I like (e.g., using the camera to automatically power on if the cover is opened, which would impact battery power), though I have not been able to investigate whether this is an option that can be toggled off.Thank you, Amazon, for your excellent customer service.I hope this helps.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Magazine Subscribers BEWARE - I recommend you NOT buy this KindleORIGINAL RATING: ** out of 5For anyone not planning on purchasing or subscribing to magazines or newspapers, you can skip this review.  But I strongly feel I need to let potential buyers know that Amazon has implemented an arbitrary cap on the number of magazine issues you can download to your Kindle: two.TWO!!I own the first generation Kindle Fire and when I originally purchased a magazine subscription, it informed me the Fire would keep 6 issues and then begin removing them as new ones arrived (I actually have 8 on the Fire right now).  I understood the original Fire only had 8GBs of storage.  I reasoned, 'Amazon is limiting the number of issues because of the limited storage space.'  I got it.  In fact, when I purchased the HDX I bought the 64GB version (the max available) so I could maximize the amount of information I could carry.  I should mention I bought the 7\" HDX, 64GB and the non-4G version.I received my HDX Friday night and by Saturday morning was downloading my magazines.  I thought, 'Finally, I'll get access to my whole library if I ever need it.' I subscribe to PC magazines which contain tips, how-tos, troubleshooting advice, software reviews, etc.  Since my friends realize I'm a PC hobbyist, I often get asked PC questions and many times I know I've read the answer, so I just need my magazines to be available to find it.  Obviously, if one of the first things I did was begin downloading my magazines, it was a major reason why I purchased the HDX.  But, I digress.As fast as I was downloading, I realized they were disappearing on my HDX.  I finally realized there was some cap to the number of issues and the default was \"two\", so all I needed to do was adjust it...but I couldn't see how.I could not believe that I would be using Mayday one day after I received the HDX, but there I was.  To Amazon's credit, Wilfredo (Mayday assistant) and Mike (technical support) were both professional and courteous.  And I believe they were equally surprised that I could only download two issues to the HDX at a time.So, as it is right now, Amazon has implemented a software cap on Newsstand (which includes magazines and papers) of 2 issues per subscription.  Why?  I have no idea (and neither did anyone else I spoke with at Amazon).  It doesn't make sense.  Could you imagine if Amazon placed a limit of 2 on everything (2 albums from a single artist, or 2 books from a single author)?By writing this I want to warn customers and I hope Amazon will see it and remove the silly limit.SO...how'd I come up with a 2-star rating?First, I don't plan on returning it (if I did, it would receive 1 star).  I will use this for more than my magazines and from the looks of the other reviews, it performs admirably in all the other functions. Per Amazon, 3 stars indicates \"it's okay\"; and since it is NOT okay to me, I can't give it a 3 star rating.  2 stars means \"I don't like it\" which right now is the appropriate rating:  with this 2 issue limit, I do NOT like the HDX - it's a horrible restriction and it needs to go.I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16KKIG549WA3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GRAPHICS DISPLAY:  In one word and considering the price for this tablet---WOW.  With 323ppi, the 7\" HDX blows away the 1st gen iPad mini and even the latest iPad Air and is on par (within 3ppi) with the upcoming iPad Mini Retina and matched evenly with the Nexxus 7.PERFORMANCE:  This one is fast.  I have a 4th gen iPad that stops/slows down during certain games.  Not with the Kindle HDX.  No slow down or crashing at all.  I can wiz through the menus, the web, and within apps and entire experience is fast and responsive.SIZE/WEIGHT: Admittedly, I would have preferred a display closer to 8\", but the 7\" size is definitely not much of a sacrifice, considering the feather weight of this tablet and ease in wrapping my hand around the edges of both sides.VIDEO:  It was probably the new option to download some Prime video content for use when not connected via Wi-Fi that influenced me most in my decision to buy this latest generation of the Kindle Fire.  Not every video has this option, as it's my understanding Amazon is working to secure permissions from the various movie studios, but it's available on enough content right now that I had no problems finding several movies and TV shows to download for use when not connected.  Plus, the integration of video content with IMDB is neat. I bought a 32GB unit, mostly in anticipation of downloading Prime video content for use offline.  if you plan to download much content, I would urge you to consider either the 32 or 64GB models, as 16GB fills up fast, especially if downloading HD versions of movies and TV shows.AMAZON EXPERIENCE:  If you are entrenched in a lot of the Amazon universe---Prime, Kindle, Audible, and Amazon MP3 music it makes for a beautifully integrated experience.  In addition, the Amazon App Store contains most of the biggest, most popular games and apps that can be downloaded and used on the Fire.  Granted, not every Android app found on Google Play is available in the Amazon App store, but for me personally, the ones I use on a daily basis are there.PRICE:  When considering the technical specs and user experience, you'd be hard pressed to beat the price.  I purchased my Kindle HDX last week and then yesterday when Amazon announced 15% off special,  I logged into Amazon. com and chatted with a rep and they happily applied the discount retroactively to my order, so got my 32GB HDX for $228.65.  I fully expect Amazon to do something similar around the holidays to entice more sales.WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? Amazon gives you a 30 day return window, so if you're on the fence about this, I'd say go for it and see how much you like it.  If it's not for you, Amazon has one of the smoothest, easiest, fastest return systems I've ever dealt with.WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE TINTED EDGES?  It does exist...but it has absolutely no impact on my viewing pleasure.  I read my Kindle content via a black screen with white lettering, because it's easier on my eyes, so I don't even see the tint when reading which is where I have heard the majority of complaints.  I can see it if I look hard on a web page, but for me it just doesn't register.  Your mileage may vary and that's why you have a 30 day return policy.BATTERY LIFE: I'm getting about 6-7 hours of use per day while connected to wi-fi and with streaming a few hours of video & several hours of online game play. It could be better, but I'm able to do what I need to on a daily basis and I just charge it nightly, or after heavy use. It seems to be a little slower charging though than last year's Kindle Fire HD, so overnight charging is best.DISCLAIMER:  I enjoy tech, but I am by no means overly attached to any one manufacturer or OS.  Personally, I own an iPad 4th Gen, Kindle Paperwhite 1st Gen, Samsung Note 3 mobile phone, and now a Kindle Fire HDX.  I love each device for what I use it for, regardless of whether it's Apple iOS, Android, or Amazon.

At first I thought its small size & light weight was indicative of poor quality, but I was so wrong!  This device is a powerhouse and now I appreciate its smaller size and weight.  I can use it for hours without straining my hands.  Now my older KFHD feels as heavy as a brick!Watching videos on this device is such a treat!  The color is gorgeous, vivid and vibrant.  The picture is amazingly clear and sharp.  This screen puts my first generation KFHD to shame!  As an Amazon Prime subscriber, I'm able to download Prime videos instead of just streaming them, which really comes in handy when I'm away from WiFi.  There's a huge selection of t.v. episodes available for download, and you can choose which picture quality you prefer (the higher the quality the more time it takes to download & the more space it uses).  I find that the videos use up a lot of storage space but you can easily delete them once viewed.The pictures that I downloaded from Facebook,  as well as all the screenshots I took, are GORGEOUS!  Their clarity & rich color is amazing!I feel the sound quality isn't as good as on last year's model, and it doesn't get as loud as I would like.  And that is really my only complaint.  A good set of ear buds makes a HUGE difference though.It loads web pages, videos & apps EXTREMELY fast, literally in a blink of the eye!  What a pleasure this is compared to the first generation KFHD, where you just watch that circle going around and around.  This is due to the speedy 2.2GHx quad-core processor which is advertised as being the fastest processor available on a 7 inch device.I find this device extremely responsive to touch, more so than the first generation model.  You can make the items in the carousel (which is a collection of every book, app, video, and song recently purchased or accessed) literally fly by.  In addition to the carousel, the \"home screen\" (which is what you'll see when the device is powered on), allows you to place your favorite items underneath the carousel for quick and easy access.  I love the new feature which allows us to view and access recently used apps & books with a quick swipe to the left without having to exit & go back \"home\" first.This device has no problem finding and connecting to WIFI automatically, and I have yet to receive an authentication error which happens frequently on my first generation KFHD.I've used the Mayday button twice, and my first attempt was aggravating because there was so much static, but my second experience was wonderful, with a friendly, knowledgeable agent.Some people are complaining about it taking so long to charge & then not holding the charge very long, but so far my device charges pretty quickly, even when I use it while it's charging.  I get approximately 8 to 9 hours of use per full charge, depending, of course, on how it's being used.I can't wait until mid-November, when a software update will give us the ability to sort our content into collections!!I highly recommend this little gem, which has been attached to my hand since I took it out of the box!!  :)", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATE 11/8 - NEW hdx - Same Problem - Four Stars - But Returning It Bcz Blue Tinge Border Very Distracting", "Author": "Expert Reader 1 \"Spot On Review\"", "ReviewID": "R37EYAZC7C81NR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it today.

I LOVE AMAZON. I am a big fan.  But this is a clear design flaw or manufacturing flaw.MY EDUCATED GUESS is that this is Amazon contractor manufacturing versus Amazon engineering department fighting in the background.  Since Amazon's contracting factories already produced millions, Amazon doesn't want this as a 'defect' fight in the public eye.  Amazon is taking a page from the iPhone Antenna debacle.  Remember when Apple claimed it wasn't a design flaw, but quickly redesigned it for the newly manf. units?  Remember when Amazon had a bleeding light issue with generation 1 Paperwhite Kindle?  It spinned that too, then fixed it.While Amazon is spinning this as acceptable.  It's not for me.  Nor will it be for a significant number of people.  It's too distracting.  Amazon will fix it.  I'm sure they are scrambling like mad.  So I'm returning mine until they do.  Sucks because the device is great.  The Mayday is an outstanding innovation.

I also us a second gen Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Often I use a smartphone, like a Note 3 or Icon.  I will compare the HDX7 to these.First is screen.  I nailing this because this is the big problem.  This is supposed to be a book reader.  But that purple/violet glow intruding into the readable space is awful.  And it does not disappear regardless of your background settings - black, amber (my favorite) or white, it's always there.  Sadly it's MOST apparent in amber, which color is otherwise the easiest on your eyes.As a video display device, for movies and such it seems much better.  I suspect it's just not as noticeable with things going on on-screen.  It's there, but doesn't seem as bothersome.  But the screen is why I returned it.  Of the devices I mention, the best screen by a long way is the Nexus 7.  It's a nice reader.  Far better than the HDX.  The iPad came in last because while screen res is fine, you cannot get a decent sepia from it.  Sepia is nearly white.  Oddly. the iPad supports that cool page turn animation while the Android and WP and even the Kindle do not.As for watching movies, I think I have to give the nod to the iPad.  Sound is good on the iPad - nearly as good as the HDX.  Make no mistake, the HDX sounds great.  I hate to be repetitive, but that damn screen really sucks.  If you read the other reviews, it gets hammered for that constantly and Amazon pawns off some lame excuse about how their great display technology is so wonderful you should be happy to pay the price of that violet glow.  Well, the display is nice in the center.  But it's no better than the N7.  So, sound and display for movies goes to iPad, plus you can download your movies to the iPad just like the HDX.  You cannot, unfortunately, watch videos on Android.  Why Amazon doesn't allow this is stupid and beyond me.  You cannot BUY movies from iPad, but that is the only disadvantage there.As for use as a tablet - the HDX is very clearly focused on use as entertainment, centered on Amazon.  There is little there that is free, unlike Android or iPad.  What is available is available ONLY through Amazon.  You cannot use Google Play to fetch apps.As far as performance goes, no quibbles.  The HDX screams.  It's very fast and smooth.  But then so are the other tabs, with the N7 being slightly slower.So, the summary.  If you were able to buy titles using the iPad, I'd say forget the HDX.  Get an iPad.  It's a far better general purpose tab than the HDX, and every bit as good as the HDX for movies and reading.  If you could WATCH movies on the N7, I'd say get that.  It has the best reading display of the three, and not being locked in to Amazon is a huge benefit.  If all you care about is consuming Amazon content and that purple hell-glow is OK with you, then get the HDX.  It's the smallest of the devices, with a slightly larger screen than the N7 (not as big as the iPad though) with good sound.  If Amazon ever gets it's head out of the sand, stops trying to convince everyone that the screen is actually OK, really it is, and FIXES IT, I will buy it again just for reading and movies.

Amazon generally has been painless in this matter, but I was surprised at the insistence of the account representative to send me a replacement.

I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle.

In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.

Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.  If I have any future questions about the device, I will not hesitate to use the Mayday feature.All in all, it is amazing to me that you can buy a quad core, high def, touch screen tablet like this for $229.

I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

I am convinced it caused my first Kindle Fire HDX to lose its ability to start up.  I attempted to side-load my music again to the new replacement tablet and it almost stopped responding as well.  Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!). I'm hoping the soon-to-be release helps with this.I appreciate many of the features of the new machine, but Amazon giveth and taketh away.

This is very disappointing as I love everything else about this device. Everything else. It's fast, light and the screen looks great (except for the bleeding). The backlight bleeding is a deal breaker. I am sending my current one back and hoping that the next one will be perfect, but I am not confident. If the next replacement is also bad, I will give up until Amazon fixes this issue.Follow-up: I recently received an email from Amazon telling me that the blue/purple light is normal and makes the screen nicer. This is a silly answer as it disrupts the experience so badly and makes reading on the device nearly impossible. This is the same type of shenanigans Amazon pulled with the Paperwhite. An obvious defect becomes something they intended. Don't believe it. I have never seen a tablet (or almost any other device) where you can see the backlight around the edges. If Amazon wants to challenge me on this, I will gladly post pictures of my Fire HD and HDX side by side to show just how much this answer makes zero sense. This is a defect not a feature.

The Nexus 7 (2013) has a slower processor 1.5 GHz Quad Core to the Kindle Fire HDX 2.2 GHz Quad Core. This is the only reason I am rating this product with a 3 star rating.The sound is great but in a side by side comparison to the Nexus 7, the Nexus 7 has a bigger and crisper sound, but in all honesty not much of a difference. It may be a matter of preference.A lot of technology blogs are giving the Kindle Fire HDX a better rating for the screen quality but with the brightness settings set at max. The Nexus 7 (2013) has a much brighter and cooler picture than the Kindle Fire HDX. (Again a matter of preference both 1080p displays).The HDX only has one front facing camera compared to the Nexus 7 which has two. Albeit the front facing camera snaps great images, the Nexus 7 has two equally great cameras in the front and back.The battery life is a better than the Nexus 7 but both lasted around three days with average use.I also find myself fumbling to find the power and volume buttons. The buttons are placed on the back of the Kindle HDX and more often than not I have to rotate the tablet a couple of times to locate the power button.Another thing I just cannot get over is the Special Offers version 16 GB model. Everytime I turn on the device an Advertisement for some random Amazon product greets me. I find this a bit annoying. As a huge advocate of online privacy, I do not like this type of marketing scheme especially for the price of $230. The Nexus 7 (2013) costs exactly $230 without ads or added bloatware. I have actually seen deeper holiday discounts on the Nexus 7 (2013) than the Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased my Nexus 7 last week at Staples for $180. Similar discounts are available with a quick search of DealNews.com or Slickdeals.com.The Amazon App Store is lacking many products that a college student like I use on a day to day basis. For example: Skydrive, Black Board Learn, Gmail, Youtube, Falcon Pro (Twitter client), and Outlook 360. (This is not Amazon's fault its up to developers)Comparing the Accessories for both tablets. Amazon seems to have a monopoly on the cases because I was not able to find cheap cases for the Kindle Fire HDX. Ebay and Amazon have excellent hard ergonomic covers for the Nexus 7 for less than $10. Amazon is selling a case for its Fire HDX for $50. The cheapest case I could find for it was $20 from Belkin and that product did not really protect it.In closing the Kindle Fire HDX is not worth the price of $230. The one thing is has going for it is the actual Kindle side of it. I read Mockingjay on it and enjoyed holding the device in my hand. It is light enough that your hand never gets tired of holding it. I will return this item and exchange for a lower version of the Kindle family that is strictly for reading.In comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) default reading apps, i was able to read ebooks easier on the Kindle Fire but PDF's were much easier to read on the Nexus 7 which now uses QuickOffice as an out of the box reader. The QuickOffice app had more settings to adjust large PDF files and customize the text color and background. I was amazed the Kindle Fire did not have these options available. As any college student will tell you, professors are out of their minds and assign scholarly articles from JSTOR or Google Scholar that are 30 to 50 pages in length.

My expectations were for smooth web browsing, Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming, movie playback (Handbrake encoded), and reading news/books.I have not been disappointed. The Silk browser works well, no issues so far. The screen has excellent picture quality. Netflix and Prime stream perfectly and look sharp. Handbrake encodes are sharp and play with no issues, at either 720 or 1080p. Feedly app works ok, and of course reading books works perfectly. I had seen some reports that there is a blue glow around the edge of the screen that people found distracting. On my particular screen, I can faintly see the blue glow on a white background, but it is very light and hardly noticeable. Certainly nothing that will impede my use of the product.As for the kindle itself, it feels sturdy and well-built; power and volume buttons are in good places, as are the speakers. Battery life is good so far, enough for a day's worth of surfing, movies and games. About 6 hours of mixed use (games, movie playback from kindle and streaming, web-browsing and email) over a twelve-hour period left me at 50 percent. The whole Interface is quick and responsive, no lag at all moving from menu to menu or app to app. The speakers provide a good amount of sound for a tablet, and have more than enough clarity to hear dialogue in movies or tv shows.Learning curve on use of this tablet was very quick; the few questions I had were quickly answered on Google. Everything else on the tablet was easy to figure out; the menu and home page are well-designed for finding the way to what you are looking for, and there is a decent tutorial for the basic functions.

I reached out to a customer service rep and made another compliant and the rep was super nice and stated she was sorry. She is going to put in a claim for me and call me back about the issue and about getting me another replacement. I almost don't want to bother because it seems like I won't win. She did tell me this was normal and the blue haze is suppose to be there but it should be very faint and not to noticeable, that the paperwhite has the same thing. She also said it's because they used blue LED lights and not white LED lights. This is suppose to really make the picture look amazing. I agree the picture is awesome and I love it, but while reading this blue light really bugs my eyes out. Is it a defeat or really normal? I don't know what to believe.

I called and the tech told me that the battery did last almost 10 hours so what was the issue, really? No one used it all day, that battery should have been 100%. I looked more into the issue and after talking with another Rep they said that I have to turn the WiFi off every time I am not using it. This seem to be so ridiculous, I have never had to turn WIFI off  with any other tablet. My husband has an Ipad Mini and his charge was at 88% after a few hours of actually using it.

She was NOT impressed.  Growing up in the Apple ecosystem (and being 4 years old) the ui and lack of hardware home button made for a steep learning curve.  She said to me \"Daddy, maybe I should have the iPad and you should have the kindle.\" I of course being wrapped around her little finger said of course.

The design, the weight, the very easy and straightforward UI, and the reading experience. When you pick up the device for the first time  it feels really solid and not too heavy like the Kindle fire HD did. The software and user interface is really smooth and doesn't stutter. Unlike android tablets I didn't feel overwhelmed at all and it's just extremely easy to grasp and navigate. Without the official cover, I found the back buttons confusing to use, and even then it wasn't much better because it was annoying to reach behind the flap and press on the button I needed every time. Here are my other thoughts on this device:ReadingThe reading experience is really great, but just keep in mind that the borders of the screen have a light blue hue to it, which is apparently normal and didn't annoy me. Super crisp text, different fonts, different highlighted colors and the text to speech voice along with buying audiobooks to read along is great. As a matter of fact, I put the device to sleep and had it read me a number of books a few times. The text to speech feels really natural and I would imagine this being a selling point for some since the e-ink readers no longer provide this feature. The only issue I have right now is that it doesn't provide collections like the iOS app does, but from what I understand it's coming in a future update.Video/audioThe videos look and sound fantastic, and the stereo speakers are good enough to the point where I don't even need to use my Jambox blueooth speaker like I did for my iPads. Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and even the CW app (I'm addicted to this show called the The Tomorrow People) are all there. Now, if you're a youtube fan DO NOT expect a good experience for this because it's currently only done on the mobile web. The pictures on the Kindle Fire HDX page show an integrated app, so that's either incorrect or I'm guessing it's not complete yet. The mobile web is not a great experience because you can't easily view your favorites and it's just not as good as using a native app. And sideloading (which I'll talk more about later) the app doesn't let you log into youtube because the logon needs to work with a unmodified Android UI device.Web BrowsingIt's very fast and smooth, but i t only lets you have about 5 tabs at once. This is the first Amazon Silk browser that's given me a good experience to the point where I didn't think I needed to sideload a faster browser. I like how you can default it to pick to load either a full webpage or mobile site. This is great for casual browsing but I'm a big tab and web surfer so I really would've preferred using chrome and all my saved bookmarks there.AppsIf you don't have any specific app you need in mind then the selection is pretty good. It has a lot of the major ones out there but some of the ones missing in the amazon app store like dropbox and instagram aren't there. You can however sideload them :) The games run super smooth on this device thanks to the state of the art Snapdragon 800 processor but don't expect any big android game launches to appear on this device right away. The last big one is Dead Trigger 2 which still hasn't appeared in the amazon app store yet.Battery lifeLike my previous generation Kindle Fires, not good at all in my experience. It charges a lot faster than the older generations, but I average about maybe 5ish hours for this device, and that's with either no or occasional video. I never had this issue with my iPads, but I always feel like I'm charging the Kindle Fires more than I'm using them.Final thoughts and opinionsNotice how I mentioned sideload a few times in this review. I honestly think if you want to take full advantage of what the tablet offers (and tinker around with it), then this might not be for you. It's designed (and designed to make money off of) for people who only stick to the amazon ecosystem and do a fair amount of reading. As much as I enjoyed using the device, I realized that the Nexus  7 would be a better fit for my needs. I can do without the text to speech and settle for a 3rd rate Kindle reading experience (it's much better on iOS) where I can't change the text, do X-ray or view popular highlights. I do have a Paperwhite so I'm fine without having this on my tablet. I guess the more I used my HDX, the less I was interesting in reading because it was able to do so much more than that. I returned my HDX today for the Nexus 7 and even though it's a bit more underpowered, I'm happy with owning an Android tablet that gives me full access to android apps via the play store. For everyone else, this is a great purchase anyone who doesn't mind the amazon ecosystem and loves shopping on amazon while taking advantage of their prime membership. Free videos and books to borrow every month!

I stopped spending money on house decorations and frivolous stuff to feed my habit. I did sell my 8.9 Kindle Fire to Amazon to trade in for this newer model HDX 7. My husband uses my older Kindle Fire HD now. I have the iPad 10\" and could not see having two larger screen tablets. I needed a 7\" device for more mobility and plan to use the Kindle Fire HDX 7 to carry with me. As a prime member, and invested in Amazon cloud space, books, videos, music, and apps, The Kindle Fire HDX was a smarter purchase than the Google Nexus.Not sorry that I made the trade. The video play is fantastic and the games are easy to see and very clear. The device is a lot faster responding, especially online. My uses for the device include: watching videos, playing mindless games, checking emails, browsing online, and writing notes for manuscript. I have a Kindle Paperwhite for reading and use it more than I would the Kindle Fire HDX, except for some \"how to books\" or magazines.

There are too many major pluses in this device to send it back for that one tiny annoyance (however, it doesn't bother me at all).", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX", "Author": "azog", "ReviewID": "R12T45W60Q2SKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the original first-gen Fire, and this looked like a good upgrade, and so far, so good. I'm posting this as 4-stars, minus one star for reasons I'll explain below. Some of my points will be comparing it to the original Fire.First up, it is noticeably lighter than the original Fire, and the beveled edges make it a bit easier to hold. There is a bizarrely angled port for the power charger, in that it does not sit flush with the Fire, and you kinda have to keep this in mind when plugging it in. I am mildly concerned that the power cable will experience stress, especially in a situation when I am using it while charging it. It just seems like a weird thing.Setting it up was pretty easy, just a few steps, log in to your Amazon account, and it automatically populates the carousel with my recently read books, in the proper order. I used the Silk browser for a while, and it is very nice; it is a full blown browser, not the \"mobile\" browser that I've seen on various Android devices. Pinch-n-zoom, slide-n-scroll, all the navigation people are probably already familiar with. If not, it doesn't take long to get used to it.I did look at some prior reviews just now, and see a lot of people mention the \"purple haze\", and unfortunately for me, now that I've read about it, I see the same effect on my HDX. It is mostly apparent in certain lighting situations, such as the reading books, when the screen is mostly white. I watched several hours of anime and did not notice anything at the time. It does not seem to be apparent on the home screen or a few other places, which makes me wonder if this is just a possible software fix.Battery life seems pretty good. When I first got it out of the box, it was at 60% charge, and it did not take very long to top it off. I did not time anything, so I can only offer subjective impressions. I watched at least 18 25-minute videos before I felt the battery was depleted enough to need a recharge, but it was not less than 25%, and I could have squeaked more non-video usage out of it.Speaking of video, this new HDX has the option to download Prime videos. I mean, you can watch them for free via Prime, but to actually download them? That's a new thing on me. I ended up downloading 14 episodes, one right after the other. Those videos take up a bit under 2gb of memory. Seems pretty good.Edit: I forgot to mention that the speakers are very nice compared to the original Fire. While using the first-gen Fire to watch videos, one of the first things I felt I needed was a set of external speakers. Once you start adding external accessories to a supposedly portable device, well, you kinda lose something in that process. The HDX speakers are very nice, crisp and loud enough that I don't feel the need for external speakers.The video app is very fickle for me. I selected the series I wanted to watch, which was an anime with 25 episodes. After watching two in a row, I need to take a break, so I put the HDX down on the table and come back in an hour or so. Restarting the HDX shows the series on the carousal, but when I click on the icon, it gives me a spinning cursor icon and waits forever, and never actually loads the video list. I timed 10 minutes on this behavior once. I've tried disconnecting/reconnecting to wi-fi, rebooting, etc, and can't determine why this happens. And it _only_ happens with the video app. Everything else is snappy as I could hope. I know it is not my WiFi, which is a dual-band BG/N router. Connecting at N speeds, I get 75% signal strength. Dropping down to BG speeds gives me full strength. But either way, signal strength is strong enough, and everything else works as expected, so that I know it is not latency that causes this. It is something with the way Amazon remembers where I stopped off, caching my last viewed video and position in the video. Even going into the previously downloaded content exhibits this behavior.Edit: if I force-kill the Amazon Video app, this behavior is no longer apparent, so I still feel confident in my suspicion that it is something software-wise, or something with Amazon's services, and unrelated to user error.So long story short, I find it is a minor flawed upgrade, but one still worth perusing.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade from the HD", "Author": "Willy Wailer", "ReviewID": "RMP1TPKL887RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 6th Kindle and my third Fire having started with the original.

Very annoying when trying to read a book. I will likely be returning this; I paid $324 for this and that is just too much money to justify a design flaw. I had such excitement and hopes for the HDX. I really wanted to like this small lighter weight tablet, hoping I could use it for a color ereader. But not at the price with such a design flaw. I don't trust a replacement unit to be sent considering how widespread this problem seems to be, as any replacement unit I were to get might start showing the purple after the window for returning it were to close.

I own a Note 3, MSI GT70, Ipad4, Note 10.1 2014, and a few older tablets for reading including an underwhelming 2012 HD refurbished Kindle. I was annoyed with the old HD for many reasons and was going to return it until my son stole it for Kindle Free Time, which btw, is worth the subscription. However, as many people do who don't have multiple screen homes (Kindle HD 2012 was first and only at the time) I was annoyed by its limits and didn't see it's merits.Even with my plethora of fancy and infancy devices I missed Amazon's set up for books and video streaming. I could have got the all new version of the HD cheaply but I thought for a few dollars more having the most recent Kindle would've hurt, would have all the product support (os updates, lending library, and Prime HD streams). However, what I didn't know about was the free Prime downloads they added!!!!!Unfortunately this feature will only be amazingly useful on Kindle with higher memory. It makes me want to cry. :( If you want to store your music and have up to four or so 1080p movies downloaded for offline use 16 gigs is too small. It's the case for any tablet, and to be honest 32 is really very little. The os your apps and games will eat that space in no time. It's not like the olden days.Aside from the os eating all my space, I have to say if you're a Prime Member the HDX is a need. It's so lovely watching videos for free that were optimized for your device in impressive full 1080p. I had no idea how useful this would be for more than a bedside companion. No 4G or purchases necessary to enjoy a show while you're waiting at the doctor. In that respect alone, if you're a loyal Amazon subscriber regardless of the tablet this is a no brained thing you will enjoy.The old HD lags and is slow, but this model is fast. You can write accurately and with ease. The battery life might make you sad, but if you're reading I believe you have 17 hours. Which, is totally why you own a fire right? ;)The app store is still limited, and behind ios and android in updates and releases, but Amazon is working on getting exclusive games for its tablet owners like the Telltale Walking Dead series. Which is amazing...I'm pregnant and struggling with a lot of physical issues and have been confined to my bed so gadgets have become very important. I doubt I could rationalize spending $300 of tech money on an 8.9 or even a 7 inch HDX when for that I could purchase a Nexus 10 or 7, or even a used retina ipad mini, but I can't say I don't want one. (There is one on my wishlist).If you're new to technology and tablets you will love an HDX, if you're a loyal Amazon Prime fan and use their wonderful services then you will enjoy this. It's fast. So fast, and streams in true HD with proper broadband connection so you will only miss the downloads when you're mobile. We all know Kindle Ebooks beat all other ebooks, and Amazon makes the best reading app. It's still an impressive ereader, and the Goodreads integration makes my nerdy soul happy.Cons are it's still a bit heavy for a reader, but a nice case with a strap should remedy that. No back camera, so if this is going to be your main tablet you will be saddened. No HDMI port but those are becoming dinosaur tech, and adapters or Miracast exists now for older tv's. No Google Play store... But I have to say something as a techie dork. Amazon I hope you're listening, you guys almost have it right. What do I mean?You're providing great hardware for discounted prices and adding amazing customer service to your product for no additional cost. *Slow Clap* You're producing Amazon Exclusive content that is available only on your devices, but you allow other devices access to your main features so you're not self isolating either like Apple can.The HDX is truly a step in the right direction of you guys can do the following:Open The Play Store. Trust your products and store, it's great. Apps are discounted, and fair. Limiting yourself in this area is hurting you. I believe you'll see the errors of your ways here. Have exclusive content and offer your own, and win the internet even more than you already have.Step the prices down for the bigger memory tablets. You're not selling machines, you're selling a portal to one of the best services out there. I save so much money using your physical stores alone!! Your videos are beautifully optimized. Your tablets are now impressive, and no one can best your customer service for the services you provide. So, since you're selling physical products, movies, and exclusive content take a bit more of a hit on them HDX tablets so the service is available to more people everywhere.Allow us to customize the carousel. We know it's a Kindle, but give us some options. Let us display a book collection up there instead of all the recently opened things. Remove from carousel is one of my least favorite things. I don't mind the special offers, because there are great deals and recommendations there but allow us some level of customization and I don't mean those weird decals.Let Google into your hearts all the way. Give us a normal page or two with widgets. I love the folders feature.If you made those tweaks your tablet might win the internet completely. (Maybe usb 3.0 too)That all being said this is a great tablet for Prime members, readers, and streamers. The 16 gig HDX is worth keeping around for a long time, and I believe newbies and tech lovers alike will be happy with the hardware.If this is your only tab expect app store limits and some frustrations, but Amazon is really working to improve those things, and HDX owners will reap the benefits of this in the future. Music sounds great for back speakers and is the best I've heard from any non Bluetooth connected tablet yet. Price is still good. May Day is useful for even the savviest of us because it saves time. If you're not going to be a Prime Member, you want the biggest selection of apps and all of their updates immediately and this is going to be your main and only device... you're not a reader... or you're looking for a productivity or Jack of all trades machine this isn't for you. Don't buy it then give it a horrible review. This is a media tab. Movies, music, books, and shopping. All the best things in life. It does do some productivity but if that's what you need look elsewhere.When you pick up an HDX you're picking up well crafted fun. The pixels are so pretty you'll want to shed a tear. Amazon's media access is so extensive you'll want for little, and combined with other services, you may just want for nothing.If you get an HDX no matter what you will find things that will bring you joy, hopefully for a few years to come. I wish I paid full price for device help if it malfunctions (they all do) because dealing with Amazon directly is usually a dream, but I got a great deal. I am absolutely pleasantly surprised and taken with this device, and I think you will be too if this is what you choose for your ereading and Amazon media needs.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet/e-reader on the market!

Besides, I have all of my bookmarks and notes that I haven't learned how to transfer to the Fire HDX. We chose the 7\" size because it's easier to carry in a purse or pocket. Keep in mind that the screen takes up the whole dimension, so it's a larger screen than the Kindle that has the keyboard at the bottom. It's really easy to read. We had our Kindle Fire in the car the other day and needed to look up a contact. That's when I discovered that it's like trying to read my phone's screen in the sunlight. Impossible. So I ordered anti-glare screen protectors. I hope that takes care of the glare. While we do love the Kindle Fire KDX Wi-Fi, I've noticed some problems that maybe aren't a problem to others. I had my Fire with me at church and wanted to jot down on my calendar something that I need to do on a date coming up in a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a Calendar icon, so I opened it to the date I wanted and discovered it wouldn't let me type my note. Why would it be necessary to have the calendar linked to the Internet if I don't care a thing about synchronizing it with my computer? I just wanted a nice little place to jot down the date of something. We don't use smart phones so I didn't think about this sync thing. I guess I just want something simple and old fashioned. At any rate, I had to wait a couple of hours until I got home and could link to the Internet simply to type my note on the calendar.Since this is high definition I was kind of excited when I saw the camera icon. I figured I'd get much nicer pictures than on my 7 year old digital camera. So I clicked on camera and saw myself. I read directions to see how I change the camera to showing what a regular view finder would see and had to chuckle when I found out it's just a one-way camera. Therefore, I took a picture of my Christmas tree by turning my back to the tree and holding the Fire over my shoulder so I could see what it saw. I got a good picture, but that's an awkward way to take a picture. So I guess I won't be using it for much more than Skyping.Things we love about the Kindle Fire HDX: the special offers (which I thought would be annoying) only show up when the device is off, so you don't have to interrupted by pop-ups. Wonderful! It's like the pictures you see on the old Kindle when it's off, only it is advertising instead of pictures of famous authors. It's quicker to manipulate between items. For instance, if you are reading the Sunday School lesson and want to go to a scripture reference, it's just a click away, then an arrow click back to where you were. It's faster to move between pages, chapters, etc. with a swipe of the fingers rather than clicking the page buttons on the old Kindle. (But we still love our old Kindles and will not be getting rid of them anytime soon). We love the bright picture and the fact that it can be read in low light (unlike the old Kindle which has no backlight). The high definition is really pleasing to the eye.We haven't tried Mayday yet, but from the commercials that feature appears to be a real boon to people who are not truly tech savvy (like we're not). I think this is a gadget everyone can find a good reason to own as it is much cheaper than an IPad and most other tablets. It looks great and works intuitively. Everything that's really important to us (and the reason we wanted it) is downloaded onto the device, making it unnecessary to be online away from home. The only thing that might have been nice and could be the reason we may someday opt for smart phones is that we can't use a barcode feature whereby you can skip printing a coupon and instead have the barcode on your device for the restaurant or store to scan.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Kindle yet -- a superb tablet and ebook reader", "Author": "Michael E.

The screen is exquisite, far better than my cherished iPad Mini, the sharpness and color are really something!  There is also something about the touch that seems incredibly sensitive --  it seems to respond instantly to the slightest touch.The Kindle Fire HDX is also very light and easy to hold. The feel of the tablet is much softer -- I got blisters after a long day reading with the original Kindle Fire (which was and is a cool tablet -- a superb deal at the moment).This new Kindle was terrific from its first moment out of the (well designed) box.  The quality of the display is so outstanding and the instant response is magic.  This is really something special!A further update:After using the Kindle a few more days, I am even more impressed with it.  The text on the display is wonderfully crisp and clear --  this is the best screen of any tablet that I have owned, including the Retina Display iPad 3., which is superb. I run a number of apps including Twitter and the New York Times, which all work beautifully.I also had the occasion to use the SOS service to answer a question arising from owning too many devices.

It arrived a day ahead of time and there were no issues with the packaging or turning it on for initial boot up. After using it daily for 4-days I have encountered some issues with the device. I will describe them in the pro's and con's below.Pro'sThe screen is gorgeous. Movies, print, and pictures are very impressive.Speakers are impressive, a near surround sound experience when watching movies.Easy to consume Amazon products.Con'sApps, their are not many apps available.Apps locked up several times requiring a complete reboot of the device.Kindle Free Time has a very limited selection and does not feel justified for the price.Regarding applications failure. I loaded several language learning applications from the app store, Babbel, Duolingo, Learn French Deluxe, and Busuu. They ALL eventually locked up and required a reboot. The device appeared to completely lock up and I held the power button down for quite some time.ConclusionThe Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a great device if you plan to only consume Amazon products. It has some room to mature here, such as more intuitive searching for products on amazon.com. But I would grant this device a 4-5 stars for that experience.Regarding apps, it was only a 2 star rating. Smart devices are all about consuming any type of content on demand. With the several different apps failing the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is not yet there. App developers for Android are pushing out the latest version while Amazon stays far behind and v3. Amazon should keep it simple and leverage what the majority are doing. It would make Amazon devs, and external devs, lives easier.

No unnecessary features attached to the browser. Just bookmarks, HD video, and fast surfing.Videos/Audio/Apps:The Kindle Fire HDX has a Dolby Digital Plus audio engine which allows for the device to separate the background noises from the person speaking or the music. At full volume, I find this hard. But, with the speaker placement on the top of the device, sound is very clear and loud, even with a case. And with a 1920x1280 resolution at 323 pixels per inch, this is right below the Apple iPad Mini 2 at 324 ppi. But, chances are you will not even notice it. Graphics are amazing for games like Asphalt 8. Downloads for videos and movies do not take an hour, unlike my iPod Touch 4. Yes, the Amazon store may be small, but it has its share of cool apps, including Skype built in (on the Cloud; I'm getting there)Amazon Cloud:Ah yes, the Amazon Cloud. Lets say you bought a load of books on your Kindle Paperwhite. Already on your Kindle Fire. You just have to click on \"Books\", download it (which takes a small amount of time) and there: you got your book onto your Kindle Fire HDX.Same for apps and all that stuff. When you get on your Kindle, you already have Skype, Yelp, iMBD and the Oxford Dictionary. Just have to download and you have Skype on your HDX. You have free, automatic and unlimited cloud storage. iCloud can only claim free cloud storage of up to 5 GB. There is also Amazon Cloud Player, which means you get to listen to your Amazon music on your computer.Special Offers:Not disturbing but helpful. I find myself using these for app deals and videos on Prime and stuff like that. Yeah. It is not intrusive or boring mostly. But it is something I would NOT spend money to remove.Home Screen Layout:With the carousel and the drag down screen thingy, I find it helpful for display but not much else. I like the organization at the top with categories such as \"Books\", \"Apps\", and \"Games\".Customer Service:I like the immediate protection of May day but have not used it. The service on Amazon.com is very helpful in fixing my Kindle Fire. By the way, if your kindle ever gets frozen, just hold the power button for 20s and the Kindle automatically turns off. No important info is lost.Reported Problems:The blue haze \"problem\" is present, but it does not affect me at all in a bad way. When I see it, I find it hilarious and just keep playing/watching. For all the people hating it, DEAL WITH IT.Buttons are on the side, but you just have to feel around for them.Charging is slow with the USB, so Amazon recommends the PowerFast charger.Apps crash a lot: Watch out. Just a minor problem.I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING: Buy the 32 or 64 GB version (5.32 GB is used by the device already) with WiFi- adding 4G LTE is +$100 to the price and Special Offers included.

The mayday button is unbelievable and the techs are very friendly. Coming from an all Apple ecosystem I was very worried about how long it would take me to learn the Kindle ecosystem but it literally only took a few hours of playing with it and about 3 mayday calls and now I'm good to go.I hope that the app store becomes better with more selections. I still have about 15 apps on my Iphone 5s that I would really love to have on my HDX but are not available on the Kindle app store. Also the same apps that I have on my Iphone 5s and on my HDX 7\" not all work the same, some features are missing. I would also like to be able to customize my HDX like I do my Apple products, backgrounds, wallpapers, ect.The Amazon cloud and the Iphone cloud app are amazing for syncing photos and documents from my mac and Iphone to my HDX the only problem I am having is syncing my contacts and calendars from my mac and Iphone to my HDX. I have not been able to do so or find an easy way to do it that would always sync without having to manually input one at a time. The emails all sync without any problems (@mac, @comcast, & @gmail) but I still have to get use to the Kindle email and play with it some more before I'm really comfortable.The Amazon Prime membership is the way to go, I actually cancelled my Netflix and saved $100.00 a year. They have a great selection of movies and TV shows and if you want to watch something new its very reasonably priced. You can also borrow books and get 2nd day shipping.Overall I give the HDX 2 thumbs up and will keep it. I will definitely keep my Iphone and Mac's but when it comes to tablets I am confident to say that Kindle is the way to go. The few things that I don't have or can't do on my Kindle are things I can live with and I always have my Iphone and mac and will be able to do them. I finally got my 1st tablet, one that is just as good as an IPad and I can really afford. I purchased the Kindle HDX 7\" with a case, a 2yr complete warranty, and a pack of 3 stylus pens and my total bill with tax was 50% less than the Ipad Mini I wanted with no accessories.Update on Nov. 18, 2013.I finally found a way to sync my Ical from my mac and Iphone to my Kindle HDX. The only way is to first sync your Ical with Google calendar and then once you enter your Gmail account into your HDX it will all sync as long as you continue to update using Google calendar.

The built-in automatic battery-saving feature, when using the e-reader feature, is also a plus.  The main disappointing feature is the camera.  I guess I assumed it would be like the camera on the iPads, but it isn't.  There isn't a lens on both sides.  While the Kindle HDX does take pictures and videos, you have to turn the screen away from you to do so...which makes things a little difficult.  It appears that the primary reason for the camera is for using Skype.  Also, one thing that would have been helpful is for a PDF version of a FULL instruction manual to be downloaded right on the Kindle desktop.  As it is now, you have to go online and read through a list topics to try and find answers to questions....or use the Mayday Button.

I wanted to experience Android - and this Kindle is Android with Amazon's \"skin\" on top.  I considered a Nexus 7, but customer feedback worried me about it being possibly too fragile.  Price on the Kindle HDX was hard to beat - and the features -screen, and CPU and memory are front-line.What prompted me to write a review?  I bought the Kindle 16GB, WIFI only version- and have been using it about 4 weeks. Tonight I set my 4G iPhone up as a Personal Hotspot - and hooked up my Kindle to the Internet, using the Apple iPhone's WIFI broadcast.  Speedtest showed the Kindle at 5.79 Mbps download, and 10.57 Mbps upload -I was very surprised at the speed it achieved and that upload measured faster down download!Tonight, I also started Pandora, and synced the Kindle to a little bluetooth wireless speaker, and got some great sound.  The Kindle's internal speakers are good on their own (and 2x better than the Nexus 7 if you listen to them side-by-side).  I've found all of the apps I've wanted (Evernote, myfitnesspal, flipboard, feedly, skydrive, zillow, lastpass, and others in the Amazon store -I also sideloaded a couple of apps, a virus checker and maybe 3 or 4 other apps - can't remember which ones right now).  Tried Google Chrome on the Kindle, and I find that it really isn't any more stable (in my experience) than is Silk.  Synced all of my e-mail contacts in from Google to my Kindle Contacts app, and also synced all of my Google calendar entries (from Google/iOS) to a Kindle app called CalenGoo - which seem to be working to keep everything in sync both ways.  Photos I take with my iPhone are synced into the Kindle and can be viewed or edited, and they even show up in a subdirectory on my PC in the Amazon Cloud Drive. Music uploads into the Amazon Cloud have been difficult - only 1 music directory (artist) at a time (from iTunes) - something I haven't finished struggling with.  I agree there is a very faint, light blue border (mainly on the left and right side) on white pages.  If you look you see it, but it is barely noticeable, and to me at least, not the least bit distracting.  I just don't ever notice it to the extent that I remember it  - I just don't \"see\" it unless I go look for it. Its not a defect, just part of the screen illumination design.This review has been all over the place - but I just wanted to give people a hint of what is possible (and there is a lot more I'm sure). I've had a few small glitches  Sometimes the browser (either Silk or Chrome - seems too sensitive and wants to open any sidebar advertisement that I happen to slightly touch.  Scrolling can be either too fast, or sometimes just right.  I can't find a quick way to jump to the top of the screen as I can in iOS.

Plus, Amazon has a lot of pretty nifty free games. But the best part is that all my books that I purchased for my old Kindle readers are still out there for me. I got this one before Christmas for only 179.00, which is a great price. I did a lot of comparisons and found that this packed the most for the price. I also like that I can transfer my files and music easily to the Kindle.

The original Kindle fire worked great and did what we wanted. While we have all the \"i\" devices from Apple, the footprint of the kindle was easier to deal with and overall it was a great product.The two HDX however have caused me nothing but frustration. One has FreeTime for my 6 year old, and the other doesn't. Let me go down some of the issues that have annoyed me greatly:#1 - The Kindle for my daughter has issues with staying connected to WiFi. It will drop connection and go into a constant state of searching for an access point. There are a total of 6 access points in my house, overkill yes, but I'm an IT guy... just goes with the territory. Going Airplane mode, Turning on & off WiFi, etc does not work. Only a full powercycle fixes the issue.#2 - FreeTime REQUIRES a password, and the only way to get to some of the kids apps is going into FreeTime. I trust my child, she is very mature for her age, she doesn't NEED a password MANDATED by Amazon. This is simply an annoyance and should be the choice of the parent.#3 - The Kindle with FreeTime also WILL NOT allow applications to be used when outside of WiFi range. It gives an Internal Service Error when trying any application in or out of FreeTime. I've researched the forums and this is a known issue which has not been adequately addressed by Amazon. I have tried every one of the suggestions, flushing the cache on the AppStore service (and one other, can't remember the name), deregistering & reregistering, reloading completely. I'm not sure what they have done to tie every app access to the app store, but this is a huge flaw and only seems to happen on Kindles with FreeTime installed (per review on the forums).#4 - Total Lockout of Google Store/Google Framework - Due to the 'pissing contest' between Amazon and Google, no Google apps can be installed. While the email app will pull your mail from GMail, you cannot load the actual GMail app, Google Maps, YouTube App, etc. You can force a sideload of an app, but it will be massively hindered because the Google Framework cannot be installed.#5 - Relating to number #4 - NO native YouTube app. My children watch a great deal of YouTube because they love MineCraft. However, because YouTube is a Google product now, they don't play nicely together. I've seen several times responses on the forums from Amazon folks saying to load one of the three third party apps which supports YouTube. Two of these are limited to only their selection of videos and have forced ads which my children don't need, and the third which actually allows access to searching (in a horrible non intuitive way) immediately started throwing up ads for ADULT WEBSITES. Great for the kids, eh?#6 - Also relating to #4, lack of access to the VAST number of Android applications which are available due to lockouts. While you can sideload after unlocking one of the settings, it still reduces the effectiveness of the applications due to their tinkering with parts of Android that truly don't need to be tinkered with.#7 - The 'Carousel' (the gigantic scrollable icons on the screen) is nothing but a history of past applications used. There is no way to keep your favorites in place, there is no EASY way to clear it. If the device was mine I would hate it as a privacy issue. Overall it forces you to use the text menus at the top more than anything else, or the search function to find applications you want to use. I personally just hate the interface.We debated long and hard between going with the mini-iPads, Kindle Fire HDX, or the various Android pads. Now that I have all of these for review, I would lean heavily towards something like my Samsung Galaxy Tab or other pure android device of quality. There are simply too many headaches totally caused by the effort to make this device proprietary and denying applications made by the developer of the OS, Google. Overall I've highly disappointed, this could have been a great product.For the Positives : Great screen, great size, better price than apple products.Once again, love Amazon as a whole... but I've tried to make these work for my family and yet my children run and get their 2 year old iPods which have tiny screens just to avoid using these.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely exceeded expectations.", "Author": "Frank L.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I've only owned mentioned Kindles and a Samsung Galaxy smart phone, no iPads, Samsung tablets or Barnes & Noble e-readers etc so take it from there. Can't speak to charging complaints because I keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and I plug my phone in every night and my Kindle every morning when I awake. After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40% and average end of day is about 65% so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience. For those that find charging once a day annoying, hmm, two days should still be good for most average uninterrupted use. I also ordered the Origami case as its enclosure and I love it as well.

Kindle fire uses a modified version of google's android and limits you to Amazon's appstore which is mostly a watered down version of google's play store. I would consider this a con but there are some distinct benefits of the amazon app store. The first benefit is that amazon provides you the ability to use their amazon prime streaming service along with the major apps such as netflix, plex, ETC.Kindle Fire hardware- The kindle fire has top of the line hardware for a budget tablet. The quad core snapdragon 800 has great graphics capability along with great multitasking capability. The HDX technically has a better CPU than the 2013 nexus 7 and a much better CPU than the galaxy series. The screen has great colors and decent brightness with pretty decent viewing angles.Kindle fire battery life- I believe that the kindle fire battery life is subpar when compared to my nexus 7 and my wife's ipad mini. I typically get about 6-7 hours of streaming video whereas I get about 10 hours with my nexus 7 and about 11 with the ipad mini.Kindle fire durability-  The kindle fire is the only tablet that I've ever had a cracked screen with. The screen cracked just towards the edge because I stepped on it. I don't know if this is because I'm a fat bastard or because the screen is abnormally weak. I believe it was a combination of my fat bastard qualities as well as the thinner screen. I have dropped my other tablets and I have stepped on my nexus 7 and slatebook before and they haven't broken yet.Value- No doubt the HDX has great value. The hardware and software are top notch.Which should I choose- If you are a big google supporter then I would recommend a nexus 7 or a samsung tablet. If you are strictly using it for media such as netflix and amazon prime, no doubt you should choose the kindle fire HDX.all in all the tablet is great but there are some limitations which may or may not be the deal breaker. The reason I bought it was to use amazon prime instant streaming so that I didn't have to download flash on my nexus 7.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this tablet!", "Author": "Macy Banton", "ReviewID": "R2UUCOOFX42R5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I should say that I have very limited experience with tablets. Having received an HP Slate (Microsoft based tablet) at work, which I was allowed to keep when they replaced the HP's with Apple iPads (which I used for about a year).I wasn't even in the market for a tablet, but I had purchased a mobile hotspot plan through my wireless carrier (the hotspot was free with a 2 year contract) and was offered $100 off any tablet as a promotion for purchasing the hotspot plan.I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and am certainly glad I did. The Kindle performs flawlessly. It has a great picture - perfect for watching MLB TV games, offers a number of fantastic apps. (I especially enjoy my talking Bible, as well as many Bible trivia/quiz apps, and Hangman).I love the Kindle library choices and also love the fact that my Kindle can read my books to me. The Kindle HDX 7 also features excellent sound, so much so that I have yet had to use my external speaker.I find the HBX 7 the perfect size for carrying around - it is light, compact, and the controls are very intuative. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the Speaktoit Assistant app is not (yet?) available for the Kindle Fire HDX. I have this app on my smartphone and find it very useful.I have on occassion used the MayDay button, and found the customer service reps. & tech support people very helpful.I should mention that my wife has the previous generation Kindle Fire HD 7 which has also performed flawlessly, and my daughter has a Google Nexus 7\" tablet by Asus - which is also a fine tablet, however IMO not quite as well thought-out as the Kindles are. In fact for my needs I prefer the Kindle HDX Fire over the i-Pad, it's that good.I originally was going to use a case with a keyboard for my Kindle, but found that the touch keyboard performs flawlessly & there is no need for an external keyboard. (In comparison the touchpad keyboard on my HP Slate does not perform anywhere near as well as the Kindle's), and with the HP, I use a small external keyboard.I've owned my Kindle Fire HDX 7 for 4 months now and find it does everything I would expect it to do and more. I am surprised at how quick this little dynamo is. Kudos to Amazon for making such a wonderful little tablet. I should also mention that it has excellent battery life compared to the other tablets I have owner and/or used.I'm a completely satisfied customer, and keep Bibles and Bible Handbooks as well as a few other books in my Kindle library, and find it wonderful to be able to store all of  these on such a small tablet.

I was given a discount on the condition that I send the old device back. I complied, therefore spending about $600 for the device.Now I have the new device. The sim card only works part of the time. I have to frequently reboot the device in order to get the sim card to work. Also, the Wi-Fi also stops working at times as well. I would have sent this device back for a refund, but I would have only gotten part of my money back.

So far, I have found no way to use google hangoutson the Kindle.Skype does not allow group calls on the Kindle which is a disappointment as group calls are somethingI am used to using.

This is only possiblewith having already set up a Google Voice account ahead of time. The calls are very clear and are free to anyplace inthe US and Canada.I added Calibre Companion which links to Calibre on a regular desktop so that you can share books between Calibreand the Kindle. I already had many books on the Calibre so moving them was easy with the Calibre companion.I added Adobe Reader which I prefer over the Kindle reader. I added Kingsoft Office which allows me to create documents,presentations, and spreadsheets.I also added Easy Voice Recorder which works well and is easy to use.In also added ES File Explorer, It was suggested as a way to side load apps thatAmazon doesn't offer.I added Espson print plugin to print from the kindle using a wireless printer.I added Drop box.I wanted the Kindle primarily for the ability to communicate using various means such as gmail, skype, phone, google voice etc. Since communication is my primary use of the the kindle that it has a fast operating system is much appreciated.Second I wanted to store e-books and audio files on the Kindle.

Bell", "ReviewID": "R27WLATCO02ZHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to a local electronics to buy the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and was \"talked into\" a Samsung 16GB Galaxy Tab 3 8\" tablet. I took it home, started set up and started downloading the apps I wanted from Google Play. Being an iPod owner, Apple had spoiled me to its user-friendly interface. I own a PC, so I didn't think it would be such a hassle, but BOY was I wrong. After an hour, I still had less than 10 apps downloaded , and the speed of the downloads was a snail's pace, along with YouTube and Netflix buffering every 10 seconds. I was sick with my purchase and took it back the next day to get what I wanted in the first place... the Kindle! I'll try to compare it to my brief experience with the Galaxy and my 4+ years with the iPod Touch 4.1.  Speed.  Kindle rivals the iPod. It's 2.2GHz quad-core processor is a speed king. The Galaxy Tab 3 only has a 1.5GHz dual core. You wouldn't think those little numbers would make such a difference, but they do.2.  Ease of Use. Another way the Kindle is similar to the iPod.  The UI for the Kindle is less cluttered and complicated than the Galaxy (and other Android devices I've seen in the stores). I realize the Kindle runs essentially on an Android platform, but Amazon made it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.(As a side note... the Samsung reps inside the store pushed the Galaxy 3 Tab with the following features that the Kindle does NOT have... rear 5MP camera, microSD expandable storage, multi/split window screen accessibility, and screen-mirroring--which would require a $70 device to control your TV with your device. All I can say is that those amazing features don't mean squat if the user experience with the interface is lousy.)3. Size and Feel. The Kindle HDX has a 7\" screen, It's about the same weight as the 8\" Galaxy I originally bought, but the difference is the FEEL.  The beveled edges and thicker casing make it ergonomically-friendly without feeling too bulky. The back has an almost \"rubberized\" feel, so it doesn't slip around in your hands. Here, it outshines the iPod/iPad and the Galaxy, whose backs are slick (metal or plastic), and both are VERY thin.  I found it difficult to hold the 8\" Galaxy in bed comfortably to read, no matter whether it was oriented for landscape or portrait.4. App Availability and Store Navigation.  Here, the iPad would win. Apple is known for its amazing apps, and Android seems to \"catch up\" at best. Not all the apps in the regular Android (now Google Play) Store are available in Kindle's App Store (which are actually Android apps), but the most popular ones are there. I have read about people \"sideloading\" missing apps into their Kindles from other third-party sites, though. If there were an app that I just couldn't live without, it would be worth a try. Kindle's App Store is very easy to navigate. It reminds me a lot of Apple's.  I will say that I like how there is a video preview of many apps in the Google App Store. But sadly, with the Galaxy, I could never get the preview to work.5. Screen Resolution. The Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad with retina display would be pretty close in comparison. The Kindle's colors are vivid, crisp, and sharp. And while some people would argue that the human eye can only process so much, I can say that my 30-something-year-old eyes which need glasses can notice a sizable difference between the Kindle and the Galaxy. The Galaxy's color was nice, but the resolution was not as good, and even my poor eyes could tell.  I can see the \"blue lines\" many people complain about in the new Kindle Fire HDX, but I only notice it on books with white pages (sepia color or night mode is fine), and it is not distracting to me at all. It's not a deal-breaker, and it only seems to show up on the edges.6. Price. The Kindle is the clear winner here. I purchased mine on sale for $199, and the 8\" Galaxy Tab3 was $269. A more comparable 7-inch, 8GB Galaxy was $139, but all the other specs were sub-par (especially the resolution and processor speed). The iPad Mini with retina display is closer in spec comparison, but totes a $399 price (the regular, non-retina iPad Mini is $299).Above all, remember this: If you go to an electronics store, beware of reps from companies inside the store. The Samsung guys were all over the tablet section of my local store like hounds pushing their products. I should have been smarter from the beginning and gone with a clear winner rather than something I knew little about. If you want a tortoise-slow, buggy tablet that will frustrate you in the first day with its failure to load apps or stream videos in a reasonable time frame, try a Samsung or similar Android device. If you want a winner with a smooth interface and a great price point, go with the Kindle. If your money grows on trees and is no object, by all means, buy the iPad Mini. For now, the Kindle is my choice, and I am so glad I returned the overpriced Samsung I tolerated for less than a day.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So much for so little!", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3OJUKKVEKI95B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a powerful tablet, just the right size to carry around with you without being too bulky.

I bought this at best buy for $200 and for the price, this tablet can't really be beat! I am absolutely in love with my new kindle fire hdx.Google Play issue:The main complaint for people is that being an android device, it doesn't have access to google play. Ridiculous right? Well, those people are kind of wrong. You can download them at 1mobile as apks and install them, but make sure that you change the settings to allow the apps(apks) to be installed from a non-amazon source. I installed so many apps from the google store available on 1mobile. You can even google them for apks and install them and they will work because this kindle is running on android. For example, i downloaded and ran dropbox without a problem. You can even sideload or root the device for the actual google play store.Speed:Apps open up quickly and the screen also rotates to landscape almost instantaneously. This baby is extremely fast due to the 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU, with Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Although sometimes, the app store does lag. Amazon probably needs to improve that aspect. The Silk browser is pretty amazing. Comparable to google chrome I would say.

The quad core is a huge plus. It's like saying 4 brains vs 2. Using 4 brains is obviously more efficient and faster. The processor is definitely nothing to scoff atAudio:Loud, rich sound with earphones. The sound is loud and clear without earphones too. No problem here.Screen:The screen on the kindle fire hdx 7' is extremely beautiful! Probably the best part about the kindle fire hdx. The HD screen provides a beautiful canvas to watch movies on netflix, play games, read manga, go on social media. When i played with the kindle in the store, the screen was just breathtaking. I haven't experienced the blue/purple edge screen thing people have been talking about though.Body:The curved tablet is actually pretty attractive to me.

It's so pretty and soft.Pros-beautiful screen-long battery life(~10 hours without watching videos)-runs smoothly than other devices-comparable to ipad in functionality-has access to apps on google play - you just need to look for apks or root it(it's easy!)-easy to hold/very lightweight- Mayday is pretty cool for those who are not tech savvy- the price is bangingCons-ugly carousel that you can't customize-somewhat confusing interface for those who aren't tech savvy-Can't add more memory if you want to - you're stuck with whatever you buy but you can use wifi to store things-no sd card slot to expand memory-the special offers - seriously amazon? We paid for a device but are subjected to ads? BUT These aren't intrusive though so it's not that bad and some of the offers are amazing-Doesn't have awkward size like Nexus 7OVERALL: BUY IT. BUY IT.

I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 year old, who was obsessed with my iPad. I was going to purchase an iPad mini, but I thought the freetime feature would be perfect to avoid arguments about time  allowed and the price is hard to beat. First thing I noticed when I opened the device and held it is that it is very lightweight...this does make it easier to hold, but it also makes it feel a little flimsy, which was worrisome considering it is going to a child (albeit a very conscientious child who takes good care of her things). Set-up was a little obnoxious, but nothing terribly difficult, it took about 15 minutes all told. The screen resolution is indeed fantastic as all the rave reviews state. Also, the subscription service for childrens content is amazing, I highly recommend it for the variety of content (books, games, videos, etc.) available for a steal (less than $3 a month). While the Freetime feature is great to set time limits, allows access to great subscription content, and is very easy for children to navigate, it does have a few flaws. It consolidates all Apps into one group, so while you may want to limit time spent on games, you may want to allow your child access to things like an alarm clock feature or Skype. There is no means to differentiate between apps, and once their time is used, they will not be able to access anything which falls under that type of content. And to be honest, I still have to deal with my child's attempts to negotiate more time as she knows that the Freetime feature is customizable, so while it may be helpful for younger kids, don't expect it to eliminate an older child's attempts to garner more screen time. Second, the camera feature is really only for video-chatting purposes as it only faces the individual, so taking photos is pretty much out of the question. Finally, our first device froze irrecoverably after three days of use...major bummer. Amazon was amazing and promptly shipped us out a new device free of charge, and while this could have been a total fluke, it happened, and I have serious doubts about long term longevity of the device. BUY A WARRANTY if you need this to last more than a year or two. So having had the device for about two months now, I feel confident in saying that IF price is your determining factor and you are looking for a gift for a younger child, go for the kindle. If not, the iPad mini is probably a better bet for overall build, functionality, and versatility for an older child.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX = Epic Win", "Author": "Dairenn Lombard", "ReviewID": "R1NDUAFBCNASNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, owning a tablet for me seemed like a little bit of an oxymoron.  I am a power user--so I need a full-sized keyboard, a mouse (or trackball since space is at a premium for me usually), a huge screen and lots of storage, memory and processing power.  A laptop with that much capability costs nearly twice as much as a desktop, so that's what I use.  But more and more, I've been wanting to watch videos, browse photos or maybe quickly check e-mail and social media when I can't be near a computer because of privacy concerns or workplace rules.  So, I bought a laptop, but no matter how light, thin or small they get (with the old, short-lived netbooks coming quite close to what I needed), it was never convenient to whip them out on the bus or train, or while waiting for them.  Not to mention prudent in certain parts of town, unlike a tablet, where it might look like you're just reading a book in the right case.Before the Kindle Fire, your choice was an iPad or so-called \"affordable\" tablets that left you jealous of iPad users.  For me, the value proposition was poor--nearly $700 with no expandable storage, replaceable battery, the ability to use the on-board storage via USB for transferring or backing up data without the use of iTunes, and other edge-case use case scenarios that doesn't apply to the average Apple user, but did to me.  Then, with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, I at least got USB access to the onboard storage, and the ability to load apps that let me watch my video files and browse photos in slideshow mode, and at 50% of the cost.Plus, while other Android tablets like the Galaxy by Samsung and the Nexus by Google are becoming increasingly valuable offerings, I am actually a fan of the Amazon content ecosystem.  Google Play, to me, just doesn't seem to be \"there\" yet.  And I already benefit from iTunes on my iPod and desktop computer.  The Kindle gives me my favorite way to enjoy movies and, in particular, my favorite TV shows.  And Amazon's selection is vast (rivaling iTunes and beating out NetFlix and especially Hulu), especially for TV shows and music, having the biggest music library thanks to AutoRip on catalog items not even available at iTunes.  Even their movie rental system works better--being cheaper, less prone to experiencing spontaneous failures or other errors and integrating wonderfully with their entire system.  For example, movie recommendations can be based on past DVD (or even VHS) purchases, if you've been buying things from them for that long.It's easy to view rented movies on a full-sized HD TV (it was even easier with the mini HDMI output on the previous model), but today's LED HD sets are largely able to Wi-Fi their way onto the Internet, so this missing feature will largely go unnoticed, even for a tech head like me.  I understood going in that the purpose of the Amazon Kindle family of wireless electronic devices is to serve as an easy, convenient, user-friendly access point of their content whether it's e-books, newspapers and magazines or music, movies, TV shows and games.  The edge here is that you can have this remarkable value proposition at a far less expensive price point--even on the 8.9\" tablet.Of course, what I didn't like when I got the original HD 8.9\" was the nasty performance, particularly apparent during use of Silk, the Kindle Fire web browser.  The CPU was so obviously lacking in power for handling the majority of web pages I was visiting to look at pictures.  At first, I thought it was the sluggishness of 54mbps Wi-Fi compared to the 1 GBit/Sec. wired Ethernet connections available to my desktop and work laptop computer, but with this upgrade, I discovered that is not true.  The #1 benefit to upgrading from the HD to the HDX model was, by far, the fact that it is snappy.  Everything took forever on the old Kindle Fire HD.  On this device, I am flipping between apps, bringing up pages as fast as allowed by the bandwidth that I and the web server have, transferring files over USB at true 2.0 speeds without slowing down to calculate how many files have to be copied first.  Most important of all, apps do not crash all the time on the HDX like they began to on the old Fire HDs.  Pages routinely crashed Silk, even more so after the upgraded client, which supported a bunch of new features that I liked, but had maddening stability issues.And it wasn't just the browser.  The built in Amazon video app for playing movies streaming or downloaded from Amazon natively were forcing a hard reset of the device from time to time.  Sometimes, several times in a row.  My tablet was beginning to fall into disuse because I was beginning to expect any video playback was going to cause crashes.  Couple that with running out of space for loading new videos, and it was looking bad.Not so with the Kindle Fire HDX.  FireOS 3.0 is stable!  I opted for max storage at 64 GB, but, to keep it affordable, went with the smaller 7\" device, which ended up being significantly lighter and therefore easier to handle with one hand instead of two, and super fast to take out and put away in my bag.  Even though it's 2.9\" less diagonal viewing area, I barely notice the difference when browsing photos or watching video.  Especially since the color accuracy and sharpness of the 1080 (up from 720) HD-resolution video was instantly noticeable, even though it was over two weeks since I'd seen the display of the old HD 8.9\" that I had traded in.  I see the blue LED on pure white screens around the edges, but it doesn't bother me.  It actually looks pleasant to me.Between the stunning video display quality, super fast performance, stability, and expanded storage, I can now barley keep my hands off this thing.  I want to use it every chance I can get.

It is only there when the screen is white (when reading), but there is an option to change your background to another color and that seems to eliminate the line.  But I don't think that line should be there at all.*I cannot put .mobi files on this Kindle even though I have put them on my other Kindles.*I also cannot put my music directly on the Kindle and instead have to upload it to the Cloud and then download to my device.  I have more music than cloud storage, so in order to use my Kindle to listen to it, I have to pay for more storage, even though this music is all in my iTunes.  It also is very time consuming \"uploading\" it to the cloud.  I experienced a lot of frustration trying to figure it all out, too.  The instructions say you can move music directly to the Kindle, but unless you purchased said music from Amazon, it will not allow the transfer.*I REALLY wish there was a handbook with this.  While I am not a computer \"whiz\", I am not that bad, either.  While some things are very easy to me, other things have been challenging.  I would like to option of reading through a handbook instead of having to search endlessly online for an answer.  The Mayday button is a nice idea, but I really hate to use this for simple answers.*The connection for the charger is at a very odd angle and because of that, it is difficult to plug in.*There is no HDMI output on this model.

I am very pleased.  The purple shadow in the books that lots of people talk about it not really that noticeable.  I probably would not have noticed it had I not read about it.  Not a problem for me.  Worst thing is when I re-downloaded all my apps I lost all my scores that were on my old kinde. Like Scrabble is at zero.  Angry Birds is like I never played ever. Amazon said they can't do anything about that.  I also paid for the Eagle in Angry Birds Rio and that is also not transferrable.  Again, not a big deal.  I set it to charge at 1:30 at 60% and it is at 100% 2 hours later.  I miss the colored on/off button showing the charging (green and orange).  You have to turn the unit on to see how much charging is there.  When I used the camera zooming disturbs the pixels so I am not excited about that but I am not a big picture taker with cell phones or tablets anyway.  Plus the 7\" only has a front camera anyway.One thing that is a gripe is that each time they come out with a new kindle you have to purchase a new cover because they (I think on purpose) reposition things so they do not line up with your present cover.  Keeps the people that make covers in business I suppose.  At least the charger for the old Kindle fits the new Kindle so I have an extra to keep in my suitcase.All in all, I am very pleased.  If the reading charge is close to the 17 hours they advertise (probably closer to 14 if I know Amazon) then I will be happy.  We travel a lot and I wanted more charging for that.  Plus being able to read easier outside was a big deal for me.  I think it is well worth the money.  I love it.I am adding an edit to my original review.  The blue haze, I set my books on the tan (was called sepia in the old kindle) and I adjusted the brightness to about 50% and I don't notice it at all now.

I've had it for a tad over 4 months now, and it's awesome.  I love bragging about the Specs, since they are inarguably the best specs available on a tablet of this size, and this price range.  It feels great to know you have the best.  Sometimes, I wish I had the Play Store, but most popular apps are available on Amazon's app store, so most of the time, I don't really miss it.  It's extremely easy to sideload apps that aren't available on the app store anyway. I love the Free App per Day program on the app store, where they offer a different (normally paid) app for free, every single day.  Sometimes it's stuff you won't really use, but every once in a while there are jewels that you can't pass up.  I've only used MayDay a couple of times, but those times I've used it, it's been awesome, and Amazon Customer service never seizes to disappoint me.  The only issue that I've had (and the one that I mistakenly requested a replacement unit for), is that when the battery gets under 30%, the screen tends to flicker just slightly, almost like a CRT screen.  After describing this to a mayday agent (before I realized it only happened on low battery), they kindly sent me through to customer service to get a replacement unit.  After I got the replacement, and it did the same, I figured it was just a normal thing, and didn't bother them again.

I'm writing this on my wife's account, and it's really her Fire, but I'm hearing the input she has and it's nothing but praise.Truthfully, if we didn't have some specific things we do with the tablet, we might have gone with another brand; probably a Nexus 7. It turns out, though, that our needs are very specific and they have a lot to do with doing business with Amazon. Here's our list of deal breaker priorities:1. She wants to simply browse the internet while she's sitting and watching TV. Does the Fire come with the best browser? Probably not, but it comes with a very credible one. I looked into it and found that I could install Chrome if she wanted, but she's very happy with Amazon's silk. No need to change browsers.2.She checks her email using her Fire when we're on the road. I usually hog the laptop so she uses the Fire to check email. I bought the fire having no idea that the newer versions have Bluetooth. I checked the Bluetooth against an old Bluetooth mouse and it seems to work great. Now we're considering buying a Bluetooth keyboard for her to use on the road just to use for returning more detailed emails and maybe some minor editing of some of our writing too. This wasn't on the \"deal breaker\" list, or even on the list at all, but it turns out to be a nice bonus.3. Finally, and this is the primary deal breaker because the above two items could be accomplished by any number of tablets. We have a reasonable investment in digital media purchased from Amazon. We really like the way Amazon has things set up with their Unbox program for PCs and so on. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't provide a player for their movies and TV shows on iPad or even other other Android tablets. So for viewing movies and TV shows from Amazon, especially off line like we like to do when we're away from the internet, it's either a Microsoft Surface (using Windows 8 and the Amazon Unbox player) or a Fire. The Surface looks promising, but it's kind of expensive when we have such a small and specific list of needs.I've found that Amazon seems to consistently  sell their media for a bit cheaper than most other sources. I like (trust) their cloud storage, and already have a sizable investment in their products. Given all these factors, it was looking like the new 7\" Fire HDX was a good choice.We have an old 1st generation Fire that she was using for all the above. The Silk browser was pretty quirky and pretty slow but sort of worked. In our home in Angel fire, New Mexico, where we have only satellite internet and really slow latency (long ping times), the Fire was almost unusable.The new Fire is like night and day. It's leaps and bounds better than the old one, and the old one was a good buy when we got it. My wife is pleased as punch with the new Fire for our needs, which admittedly are very specific. We believe there's no reason to spend more money for stuff we don't need and we should buy our products tailored to fit our specific needs. Given that we each have Kindle Paperwhite readers, hundreds of books plus lots of TV shows and movies, and that we've never had a bad experience with Amazon, we're comfortable adding another Fire to our inventory of readers. It's just a great fit for us.As for the old Fire, it's now mine. I don't use it for browsing or email, or even for watching movies although it worked pretty good for that. What I do is send documents over to read offline, usually technical reading I get on the internet related to Photoshop, Wordpress, and a few other topics. I then send those pages and documents over to the Fire to read off line. The Fire - even the old one - is a great tablet for reading documents that are read indoors and have color illustrations, like Photoshop tutorials and so on.So for us, it couldn't have been a better choiceDonald Finkhiddenmesa.com", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WiFi Connectivity", "Author": "John Oldenkamp", "ReviewID": "R2D4NDXAQYOGTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be honest, I do not own this particular unit.

I play Words and Scrabble with Facebook friends and I must say I like the experience of those games on the HDX better then on my phone or computer.  It is amazingly fast.  Downloads seem slower but that is not a big deal to me.  The feel and fit of the HDX is wonderful. My daughter will be getting my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 as it is too big for my liking, though a great tablet.  Loved my Paperwhite but I think that the HDX is going to take over it's job.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "M.

I listen to foreign radio broadcasts, heart radio, and tune in radio and in spite of small tablet size speakers are powerful. I have  ipad mini and the kindle blows it away in performance!

I never imagined the Kindle Fire HDX would perform at its level .  I purchased a Nexus 2013 and immediately returned it to Staples because of performance issues.

It looks beautiful and has a lot of features I enjoy. The quick menu at the bottom of the screen is great for keeping frequently used apps handy yet keeps the carousel uncluttered. I don't remember being able to set a passcode on the HD, which I've done on the HDX. The Mayday button is worth the Kindle's weight in gold. I was having difficulties getting apps I purchased on my desktop to download to the device. Talking to the techs I was able to deregister the device and reregister and all the apps appeared like magic.The loss of one star is for several reasons. I have noticed buggy issues with connectivity, downloading apps (device or desktop purchases), and connections with the tech during a Mayday call. I made 7 calls to get the app issue mentioned above resolved. it wasn't that the techs didn't know what to do (one had just fixed the problem for someone else so knew exactly what to do), it was that after 2-3 minutes the call would automatically disconnect. I did get very good at summing up the problem in as few words as possible but it was very frustrating to have to do it 7 times. At the end of all the calls it asked if the problem was resolved and I kept clicking no. I later learned that's probably held against the tech and felt horrible because they all were so friendly and helpful for the time I talked to them.Another feature I don't care for is the limited number of recommended items. When you have the focus on an item in the carousel, just below it displays suggested items you may also enjoy. On the HD, the list was 8-10 items and on the HDX it's only 4 with an option to See All. A bit clumsier than the old method.Overall, I would purchase this again and again and, if I could afford it, would buy one for everyone I know to ween them from whatever they're using now. Fix the buggy Mayday calls and the weird downloads and it'll bump back up to 5 stars.UPDATE 1/6/14 - I have changed it from 4 to 5 stars, as promised. It seems with a couple of the software updates (automatically taken care of) the bugs mentioned above concerning the downloads have been resolved. I have not needed the May day button since that time so I cannot speak to that issue.

The color distribution of the screen is completely off. One side of the  has a much deeper yellow color and the other side is very cold. This is probably a light bleed issue too I suspect.

The HDX fit the bill. I pre-ordered it and got it delivered the day of release. Even then I waited a few days to put up my review. As I mentioned earlier, the stuff advertised about the HDX are all true - including the amazing display, sound etc - so I won't repeat them. I love the device. However, it loses a star because of the distracting bluish/purple haze on the borders when am reading something - be it a web page / Kindle book. Apart from that, the device suddenly rebooted a couple of times without rhyme or reason. The 'Mayday' button is one heck of a technological feat and I am pretty sure we'll see similar 'engaging' support for other devices and products in the market.

Loved that it came with a wall charger.The Good:  Sleek look, movies and videos look great playing, Affordable, Kids Freetime is the biggest perk for me.  My son loves to use my phone (iPhone) to watch PBS kids but I'm always getting him out of the AppStore.  So having him able to only access what I give to him is great!!  Touch screen is easy to manipulate and calibrated nicely.  So easy to set up, connect all my accounts, downloading all my books from the cloud and set up only took maybe 5 minutes if that.  Sound is crisp, pretty loud for a small tablet.The Bad: Since only owning Apple products, some of my favorite apps aren't available.  I.E. Had to download a basic app for a calculator.  Screen does have a glare (somewhat expected), does smudge (just like my phone does, also expected).  Wifi issues.  Ill preface by saying I'm honestly not sure exactly where the problem is coming from, I have yet to try mayday to get suggestions.  Things aren't loading properly and I'm having to shut off wifi, restart the kindle, turn the wifi back on for it to work.  I've done this 3x today.  I made sure my phone and other wifi devices were working to double check bandwidth issues.  Seems to be working okay.  This will be a deal breaker for me so hopefully mayday can help me.  Lack of customizing you can do does bug me, Id love to see my sons big smiling face on the wallpaper, that is not possible.  Lack of additional memory options, though I knew about that.Overall I think it's a great product for the money.  It does everything I would like it to do.  Most of the negatives I can live without or deal with.  I'll be contacting amazon soon about the Wifi issue and will update this review.*UPDATE* 10/29/2013Wifi issue was a home issue.  We had to change a router to get better wifi distribution with more channels.  Thankfully this is fixed.  Couple other things I've noticed:  The battery take forever to charge.  Not a deal breaker, I charge it overnight but its a little annoying.  Kids Freetime, as I mentioned before my BIGGEST drawer to the HDX...BUT downloading the same apps as my iphone has (free kid apps), in-app purchasing is still there so when his little finger accidentally clicks an ad or \"buy\" buttons, the kindle buy box still pops up, now with 1-click buying I have noticed he has bought a couple things.  This makes the situation worse than it is with the apple appstore because there I have a password.

I was thinking of getting the bigger one but for close to the same amount of money & can get a I-Pad or close.

There's an experimental player in this Kindle, and they are improving on it.  However, with the vast amount of content Amazon has available to us on Kindle(especially if you're a Prime Member, which I recommend) there is plenty of things to view.Speaking of viewing, the crisp, clear (no motion blur) image is among the best out there.MayDay has the greatest  access to TechSupport I've ever used and it's FREE, 24/7/365 .Top of the screen is divided up with all your function tabs, and additional are provided with a 'pull-down' finger swipe (MayDay is there).WiFi works very well and the front facing camera is for video chat (no rear camera on the HDX-7in) which I don't need anyway.Recharges quickly and the battery life is good (which always depends on what your doing with any device).Downloads and Installs are quick (never had a problem) and you can get right to the new app.I'll overcome this objection; the one about not being able to get the REAL youTube; yes you can without any side-loading.Kindle provides Google for search; if you have any Google account like GMail, pull up Google, sign-in to GMail and at the top right.

The specs are great, and I was really thrilled at first, I could sideload apps and the community WAS even able to root, I even HAD live wallpapers.

Ultimately, an update broke my device, and even if I had managed to avoid the updates the tablet becomes nearly worthless without internet.  I'm very sorry that I bought from this company when there is another line of devices that would have worked much better for what I wanted and expected.  I wouldn't buy any other Amazon anything, they are worse than apple.  It's my device, I paid for it.  Amazon uses open source software that they get for no cost GNU, Linux, and Android and then they ruin it intentionally to lock in down and limit functionality.  Forcing people to buy from their appstore, stare at ads, and a dull black background.  Many of the apps available from amazon are old versions of apps that I already have paid for and use on my android phone and other devices.  I'm not going to pay again.  Amazon really stabbed us in the back on this one.  I've never had a device that didn't ask first before changing the software not even windows does that unless you op-in and you can always go turn off automatic updates.  Buying this tablet is the same as signing a contract with the devil, they managed to enslave free software and do whatever they want to your device without your approval.

Now, there is no question that Amazon can't compete with Apple on the number of apps available in their respective ecosystems, but nevertheless, I found that Amazon has MOST (not all) of the main apps that I use.I love the size and weight of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\".  It is a joy to hold and feels great in my hands, even though it is not as \"premium\" as my iPad Mini.  By comparison, the latter seems heavy now.The functionality is awesome, as well.  I easily switch from app to app with the multitasking side bar.The speakers are amazing and exceed the iPad with relative ease.The display is awesome for gaming and videos, but I have been disappointed with the blue hue on the outer edges while holding the tablet in portrait mode with white backgrounds such as books or web pages.  Amazon's excuse for this is ridiculous (\"we use blue LCD instead of white to ensure 100% color accuracy\"), but I love everything else about the HDX so much, I choose to overlook this factor.The iPad is still a more complete tablet experience overall and it is much better for content creation and productivity.

I am so use to the iPad and had no problem adjusting to the Android operating system.  Easy to close apps and love the Mayday technical assistance built into the header.Cons:1) It's a hit and miss for me when streaming video using latest Netflix and Amazon Prime video apps.  I've read online that Amazon is blaming the apps creator such as Netflix for the bugs but truthfully, I think it's combination of both.  My videos freeze up a lot while it's playing catch-up or I have to literally force the app to close and /or recycle power to the unit.  Only after I do that will the streaming app reinitialize again.  This is a royal pain in the butt in my opinion and i would hope that Kindle and partners come together to address these issues.  Very well could be software bugs that need to be worked out but so far no side has taken responsibilities to address it.2) t's a bit on heavy side with the leather Origami case.

Overall, this is a pretty good choice if you are looking for something that runs smoothly. I really was impressed by the image quality, every thing looks gorgeous on this tablet, much better than my laptop! The processor keeps this device really quick with apps and while watching movies and surfing the web (depending on WiFi of course). The HDX also really shines if you have Amazon prime as you will have access to a variety of free movies and media! For all that this tablet can offer in terms of functionality, the price is really one of the better values out there right now.Despite some of the aforementioned positives, I there are a couple huge disadvantages to owning this tablet. If you plan on using a wide variety of apps, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. App development for Kindle is still in its infancy and only a handful of even the most popular apps on other devices seem to be available. One of the main things that I bought the HDX for was to surf the web without the need for a clunky laptop. For the most part, it can do this just fine, but when it comes to watching a video this tablet will let you down. I find that since there is no youtube app that I need to go to YouTube's site on the browser. When I try to watch the youtube video in full screen while holding the tablet horizontally, the address bar is always at the top blocking out some of the video! I have tried every button/setting but nothing seems to remove this. The other thing with videos that drives me mad is that most embedded videos on blogs and webpages cannot go into full screen mode. I need to click and double click on them repeatedly just to make the video big enough to be seen. Some embedded videos I have found to not work at all. This is really a huge disadvantage for me and really needs to be fixed.To summarize, the HDX is a great functioning device that performs great in terms of hardware specs, but there is much improvement to be made in regards to software aspects.UPDATE:4/21: I was disheartened the learn that the kindle does not support Adobe Flash player.

They automatically push out updates without allowing you to opt out. Wanna root your tablet? Want to turn off ads on your device without shelling out $15 extra dollars after you just spent $200+ on your tablet? Want to get access to Google play and Google apps and not be limited to what Amazon has in their app store (which lacks a lot of big name apps of no-brainer-we-should-support-this mobile ubiquity)? Too bad. Amazon will continue to update your Kindle whether you want them to or not. Seriously, can you believe on an ANDROID device there isn't an official Youtube app? Or Google Drive? What about Dropbox? Clash of Clans? Xbox smartglass?  Most things that aren't Facebook or Twitter? Customization of any kind? Any high quality apps for musicians? Look elsewhere. The hardware is very capable, but the software isn't even a fraction of what's available on iOS or even full Android.

I've been using a regular classic Kindle for book-reading for several years and I find the HDX 7 to be almost exactly the same size, slightly heavier, but just as convenient to use and transport - and with a wealth of great features! I purchased the upgraded version with 64GB memory, wireless only, and paid the $15 for \"without special offers\".  Great deal!  Colors are superb and the unit works fine with my AOL email & Facebook accounts.  Reading on-line news and FB text is a little challenging because of the small print but \"pinch & spread\" takes care of that pretty well although the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX would certainly be a bit better in that regard.  Book reading is fine, no problems, and the faint blue \"corona\" along the edges of the page is pretty inconsequential as far as I can see.Battery life is very good (especially when doing mostly book-reading) but if one is using a lot of battery-eating graphics a daily recharge will be a way of life.  Needless to say, my old Kindle shines in this respect because the battery typically only has to recharge once a month, but then the Fire HDX does *SO MUCH* more!Audio for music is adequate volume (although not ear-blastingly loud) through the speakers and great in headphones, and I find the audio quality excellent.  Controls are easy to learn and seem pretty intuitive to me.My only minor complaint is that the on-board camera faces the user, not the rear of the device - which is fine for Skype or taking photos of oneself if you're into that sort of thing - but then, who the heck uses a tablet for taking pictures, anyway?  I watched a fellow tourist doing that with his iPad when we were in Iceland and I thought - and still think - that it's a dumb way to take photos (I'll stick with my easier-to-carry and fractionally expensive digicam, thank you very much).FWIW, I'm 72 and strongly believe that any \"senior citizen\" who isn't embracing today's technology is missing out on a *LOT* that can keep life fun and the brain active. I've been using a compact netbook for several years while traveling but a tablet like the Fire HDX is a great and not bank account-breaking way to enjoy reading good books, catching up on email and news, following sports scores, using social networking, etc., etc., and all in a much more compact package.So, don't be an old fud, get with modernity!!!  ;-)", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" Tablet on the market!", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "R37ZK1X4Y66SO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best tablet out there.

My inbox, contacts, and entire calendar were up and running in just a few minutes.Tunes sound good, whether it be from my own collection in the Amazon cloud, via Pandora, or on YouTube. Placing the Kindle face up on a hard surface optimizes tone and volume.Most website functionality is comparable to a PC, but there are the occasional pages that look funny. As an example, I use my Kindle as an auxiliary while playing Battlefield 4, and while it's usually easy to manipulate, there are times when screen resolution makes buttons/web parts awkward.As far as books, I only have a few so far. Some seem better adapted to the Kindle format than others; The Oatmeal's \"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\" is flawless, but Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has the occasional odd hard-return.Although the auto-brightness feature is a nice touch, but I've found that it sometimes it will \"adjust\" for no reason. Still not enough to drop it down from 5 stars.I can't comment on Facebook or Twitter functionality as I use neither of those, but the StumbleUpon app is fun.If my Kindle HDX gets broken, for whatever reason, I would buy another without hesitation.

She is a writer and she reads books as fast as I can watch a couple of movies.  What a perfect gift I thought this would be.  However - she has always told me she never wanted one because it's not the same as turning a real page.Well - over time Kindles have come a long way by adding many useful features.  I'm a guy and what I like I figure she would like - right?  So I bought it.  So as to be sure she realized the kindle is now something real and useful in so many other ways, I first prepared the Kindle introduction video. Kimble has a great video explaining all the benefits that it does.I prepared the TV which we have hooked up to a computer to first show her the video before opening the box to see what it is.  I figured once she saw all the cool stuff it does she would defiantly have a change of heart by loving it and wanting it.She saw the video, opened it up and began learning it all.  Kindle has a REALLY good feature.  Tap one button and a live person comes on screen to guide you through anything at all.  They can even do it for you by drawing circles around what they click and do so you can see and learn - really making it easy.My wife learned enough very fast as to contact this live tech person on Christmas day.And, she asked him for help.  Within no time at all he, according to her directions took no time at all to coordinate the return of the Kimble, even with a return label to print out.Well - That's how my Christmas went.(guys skip this part and don't read) To all of the ladies reading this:  I respect your thoughts, wants and needs.(woman skip this part and don't read) To all the guys reading this:  You can't win so buy her a vacuum cleaner it couldn't be worse than anything else you do>", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "A minor tradeoff between Amazon Prime benefits and Google Play access...", "Author": "R.

So you need to ask yourself if access to such features as the Kindle Lending Library and tight integration with Amazon Prime and Audible are valuable to you, as well as the \"Mayday\" tech support function.For me specifically, the feature I miss is the app-based Google Music Player.  I capture streamed spoken-word radio which I want to then listen to on all my devices (iPhone, Kindle Fire HDX, Roku-outfitted TV).  Google's uploader can be set up to automatically scan my music folders and refresh my library with any new content, and Amazon's uploader does not do that.While Google does offer a web version of their music player - which works fine in the Silk browser - it doesn't have as many features as their native app.Other than that, I've been quite happy so far.  Suggestion - find a way to sideload any apps you might like from the Google Play store; many will work fine on the Kindle Fire.  One example would be Zinio for magazine content.

The Kindle is an INCREDIBLE tool for readers - and for those who may be averse to picking up a paperback. I honestly never thought of myself as an avid novel reader, but this gadget has totally changed that and I look forward to the breaks where I get to read. My only problem now is finding more great books to read! (For the record I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed these books on my kindle: Night Film (Marisha Pessl), World War Z (Max Brooks), Zone One (Colson Whitehead). I also read an advance copy of my sister's book, which I had read before but enjoyed even more on second reading on the kindle (another excellent tool -- your kindle can convert a PDF into a Kindle doc! So Cool! All you need to do is email the PDF to your kindle email with the word \"CONVERT\" in the subject, and voila! It shows up in your \"Docs\" as a Kindle-version of the PDF which is much easier read and navigated than a PDF). So, in short WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS THING NOW!***I was a little hesitant buying this having been a tried and true Apple fan. First though, I should explain that you REALLY want to buy this without the special offers. It's a little more money, but if you DON'T pay the extra, you see ads on the home screen every time you open up the device. So yeah, pay the extra to get rid of thes ads.As for the device itself, it is FAST. Like, the fastest operating system of anything in our house including my MacBook Pro, iPad or any of our iPhones. I LOVE reading on it too. The screen doesn't make your eyes ache like the iPad, and the text is really easy and clear to read. It is also super duper light weight.The only downside I've seen so far is there is no integration with Chromecast, which would be awesome.Overall though, really impressed with this little device, and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.

However, you need to go into buying a kindle HDX with eyes wide open: it is NOT a traditional tablet.  You are signing up for the Amazon ecosystem and the straightjacketing that involves.On the pro side: great price, brutally fast performance, great graphics, excellent selection of apps, books, and content in general.On the con side: no customizing the wallpapers or lock screens, and generally a black box system (short of rooting your system and voiding your warranty, there is little freedom to customize).  The biggest issue I have is no Google play store access.

I got it to take advantage of the lending library, Amazon prime (eventually when I feel like taking the $79 annual hit), and the features it does offer.

To tell the truth, I have been meaning to buy a similar reading device with tablet capabilities and couldn\u2019t figure out whether to buy the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HDX or the Sony Experia Z Ultra. Of course it\u2019s a matter of money. I am not made of the green stuff and even a $300 expense is big enough for me to think three times before buying something first in order to try it out. I read all the reviews, all the personal experiences put out by people, but still, it isn\u2019t the same as having the thing at home to play around with.This way works the best \u2013 they sent the 32GB version that I had chosen in less than 3 days.From the moment I got the package in my hands, I was in love. It is simply great \u2013 it does (almost) everything an IPAD does at a fraction of the cost.First, the cons \u2013 as I am sure there\u2019s ample information on the pros.1. The camera is ONLY on the front \u2013 there is no camera behind the screen. Makes skyping and taking pictures just a tad harder. Not a dealbreaker though, given all the other great stuff this little tablet does.2.  The page turning is by swipes only. When you are tucked in a cozy comforter on a cold night, you sometimes wish for right/left buttons \u2013 again, a minor annoyance.3. The weight \u2013 it\u2019s a tad heavier than the Sony Experia Z Ultra. But honestly, if losing weight means spending $400 extra, I can do without it!4. The included charger is really slow \u2013 I spent the extra money for the power charger. Only I didn\u2019t spend $19.99 on Amazon \u2013 I got it on eBay (new) from China, for $5.22, free shipping. Still waiting on it, but its guaranteed to arrive in a couple of days.  Works for me!5. I am an Amazon Prime buff \u2013 in fact Prime content is the prime reason why I chose the Kindle. It works great \u2013 only your \u2018watchlist\u2019 shows perhaps a quarter of what you have saved. If there is a way to see the entire watchlist, I haven\u2019t discovered it (yet).6. The carousel is annoying. It pops up unbidden whenever the Kindle\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t need to display exactly what books and movies I have purchased and would have preferred if there was a way to discreetly tuck them away only to be brought out when I wish.7. Browsing emails on yahoo can sometime be frustrating \u2013 scrolling is immensely difficult as the tablet, to me, seems too sensitive \u2013 whether I use a stylus or my fingers, it tends to pop open the email instead of allowing me to scroll thru the list.8. Downloading movies is not too cool \u2013 takes too long and if the Kindle powers off, there you go. Lost the portion that you had already downloaded and need to restart.That\u2019s the lot of semi-bad news, if you can call it that. To me, it\u2019s all stuff I can live with, nothing major. Here\u2019s the positive stuff:1. It is GREAT to watch a movie or a show on. The picture (we have a high-speed broadband Wi-Fi) is crystal clear; there is NO dithering or wait time as the video caches. It\u2019s like watching your own personal wrap around widescreen. You might think the size would be too small, but when you do watch it, the screen\u2019s placed close enough to your face comfortably and it actually seems like a much larger screen. Like I said, GREAT definition and clarity.2. The sound\u2019s amazing \u2013 clear, sharp and realistic. Even without headphones, it\u2019s powerful enough to give true surround effect and loud enough to make my wife complain. With headphones, you don\u2019t disturb anyone and the immersion is complete. BTW I bought JLabs Jbud J5 ear buds with this after doing some R&D; (read my review if you wish \u2013 I even bought an extra pair for the wife) and it\u2019s a perfect match right off the top. Tailor made for the Kindle Fire HDX.3. Reading books is easy, except that a couple of left/right/page turning buttons wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The light levels\u2019s just right and if a white page glares at you, voila, make the screen black, the letters white! Bunch of choices in terms of fonts (publisher\u2019s font included) and one can size them up or down as required.4. Browsing \u2013 the silk browser is really great. Fast, no nonsense stuff.5. People talk about the \u2018offers\u2019 as annoying \u2013 I find it extremely entertaining. Not just are the products good (no TV infomercials here) but also the entire ad experience is VERY unobtrusive. Flick it off whenever you wish and go back using the tab.6. Navigating the Kindle is great (except perhaps the carousel feature which I didn\u2019t like). Downloading documents and files, pictures etc is really fast, movies, not so much as explained in \u2018Cons\u2019.7. Best part is its portability. The 7\u201d is slightly too big to slip into the back pocket of my jeans and a jacket pocket is required. However if you do sort out the carrying issue, it\u2019s great to have along and works everywhere there\u2019s Wi-Fi.8. I took the Boingo Wi-Fi on the go service and so far haven\u2019t had too much trouble with it. Of course it\u2019s not as fast as it\u2019s touted to be and there is a tendency to hook you to the nearest network instead of the dedicated Boingo network, but hey, whatever works. I am not that finicky. It takes a bit of time to get hooked, but once it does, it\u2019s a strong link and stays hooked unless you move a few blocks.9. The case and paraphernalia. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $50-60 on the recommended sleeves and cases. I bought the Fintie faux leather package and for $20 approx, got a nice collection of stylus, sleeve, extra USB cable and some other small stuff. Works even better if you just buy the Fintie case for about $9.99. You definitely need a bigger case to stuff all those bits and pieces though \u2013 the charger, USB, stylus, headphones etc. I also bought a screen protector and a TPU Gel soft skin cover to be used in parallel with my Fintie case as added protection. It\u2019s a tighter fit, but works perfectly.All in all, it\u2019s a GREAT purchase and I am loving it. Will be happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

I'm not a techno-wiz or anything like that, I've merely had the opportunity to use different types of tablets since members of my family keep winning them in drawings (e.g. Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini). I actually bought this one because I wanted a tablet and it was less than half the price of the others when Amazon gave me special offers.I was initially worried about how complicated it might be to use, especially since I'm more familiar with the iPad interface, but I found the Kindle to be quite easy to operate. If I ever had a problem, I'd have the best customer support in seconds with the 'Mayday' button.It's fast- it's never really had a lag for anything that I've tried. The buttons are out of the way, but easy to find and use. The sound is by far superior to all other tablets, as is the display. It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time. Two notable apps that are absent from the market are Youtube and Instagram. I'm sure more developers will jump on board, especially since this tablet has proven to be extremely usable.If you are looking for larger text or screen size, the 7\" might be a bit too small. Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g. instant video, lending library, etc). However, it still is great as a standalone tablet (although I'd recommend using the Prime services with your Kindle if you choose to purchase it; they are definitely worth the price).All in all, it's a top-tier competitor in the tablet market and it's also one of the cheapest. If you're considering this and the iPad mini or Nexus, really look into the Kindle or try it out.UPDATE (December 2013)I finally had the opportunity to use the Mayday service due to a downloading issue. It was about 10:30 PM. I tapped the Mayday button and within ten seconds I was in video contact with a representative from Amazon. In less than five minutes, they were able to visually show me the issue with my tablet and help me to solve it. I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had. I can usually solve any issues on my own, but having this feature for the times when I'm stuck is very nice.Many other reviews have mentioned the display issues at the border. It's true, it isn't perfect, but I don't think its incredibly distracting (granted, I don't read with it alot).

After spending only a few moments, from setup to navigating through various apps (books, web, videos, etc...), I must say that the device is near flawless.  The unboxing and setup process were as effortless as anyone could hope for.  The performance is spectacular and allowed navigating around the various screens with lightening quickness.  The feel in my hands is wonderful, in terms of size, weight, shape, and texture.  Heck, I even tried out the Mayday button and I must confess it is probably the greatest customer service experience I have had in memory and probably ever.Finally, I come to the topic that has been discussed in so many prior reviews.  This display is beautiful, vibrant and precise.  Unfortunately, this perfection is inexcusably blemished by an uneven purple haze around its outer edges.  This haze is almost twice as wide along one length of the device compared to the opposite side and contrasts so much with the otherwise flawless display, that it provides a distraction I cannot live with.I literally fell in love with your \"near masterpiece\" in just minutes.  So much so that I mentally tried to convince myself that the many fine attributes outweighed this single flaw (\"Gee, maybe I'll get used to it?\"), but alas I realize that, like so many others, this is something that I cannot bring myself to \"settle\" with.I am returning your amazing invention with great regret and I hope that your talented team can resolve this unacceptable issue as quickly as possible.  When this happens, I promise I will be one of the very first to give it another try.  Until then, I would rather do without.Sincerely,A longtime (and hopefully valued) Amazon customer", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Noonski", "ReviewID": "R2D857ZKAGQPXM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this device (Fire HDX 7\") a little over a month ago. From the beginning it would randomly shut down/reboot itself. When it did that, it would lose my place in the book I was reading, so I'd have to search for the new location by scrolling/paging through the book. I called tech support, we troubleshooted the issue. It performed ok for a few days. Then the random shutdown/reboot started, and this time the screen started flickering too. Finally I called, and a replacement was quickly sent.I've had the replacement for 3 days. It has randomly shutdown/rebooted six or seven times (and I've only used it for a few hours total), the screen flickers, and it doesn't stay connected to the WiFi. So, I am returning it (minus a 20% fee, because I missed the 30-day mark by a couple of days -- if I had just returned the first one, and not dealt with a replacement, I would have been within the 30-days.The replacement was also a refurbished model.I wanted to like it. I've had a Kindle since the beginning. I was considered an \"early adopter\" which, at the time sounded good, but ultimately really means nothing. But, the first Kindle was spot on perfect. Sure, it was \"primitive\" compared to the Fire, but from the moment I took the Kindle out of the box it worked perfectly. No issues at all. It's been downhill since. The next Kindle was not bad, a couple minor issues. Then the first Gen Paperwhite that flickered, had uneven lighting that made it tough to read, and now this disappointing experience with not one, but TWO Fire's in a 5-week period.I really liked how the app was integrated with the Kindle store -- buying media was easy (in fact, I think I bought quite a few more books than normal, because shopping was so easy).In defense of the device -- people have complained about it as compared to an iPad and not being able to use it as a workhorse. The Kindle Fire is, according to CNET and others, a \"media consumption device\" rather than a \"tablet\". The Kindle is meant to be used for books, music, movies (all from Amazon, of course). It's not really designed to be an alternative to an iPad, more a compliment to the iPad -- one would use the iPad for work, the Kindle Fire for entertainment. And, I'm ok with that. I use my iPad a great deal, as I also use a MacBook and an iMac (and iPhone) so everything syncs together. Having the Kindle Fire let me free up room on my iPad -- getting rid of the books and music files freed up much needed room.I think, however, that I'm getting weary of Amazon Kindles. I like Amazon (though I think like any company it's driven by profit, not by concern for the customer).

The power and volume button being placed on the back is an odd design choice but one that you can get used to rather easily.

The horsepower running this modified Android tablet makes all of the applications hum along.  The email client is business friendly out of the box...you can immediately set up email for Microsoft Exchange without having to get a third party application.  Wireless connects well and the tablet streams videos without a hitch.  I'm very excited to see how Amazon is going to take advantage of the Miracast technology built into the tablet.  I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.  If you have any fear of using a tablet, the Mayday function is a welcome addition.  If you're buying the tablet for a technophobe, Mayday will be a great help to them if they have questions or problems.  This function is a quantum leap forward in customer service.

I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.

Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.  At this point I would really like to just return this Kindle HDX and wait until they work all of the bugs out of it and try buying it in about 6 months, but once again, they won't take it back for a refund.  This is the first time that I have ever experienced this problem with Amazon.  Oh, and I am tired of talking with people in INDIA!

The size is fine for my usage. The price is very competitive.I've only experienced one problem. I ordered an app from Amazon and it did not automatically deliver to my HDX. I took the opportunity to try out \"MayDay\" and was immediately greeted by a helpful customer service rep who was able to fix the issue in a flash.The casing shows fingerprints a little more than I would like, but now I have it in a case so it's a non-issue.

I have to look for it to see it but it's very minor.  To be fair I do not read a lot on this, I use it for movies mostly, so I don't see the haze at all on anything but a stark white background.The buttons on the angled part of the rear are PERFECT for me.  Another thing that seemed to annoy others but it's a vast improvement from the way the buttons were hidden on the HD.  I had to hunt on my old HD for the buttons constantly and it was very frustrating.  The HDX buttons are concave so as to not push them by accident, the placement is perfect for easy use while holding the device.  I have never once turned it off by accident and I hold it from the back all the time.  I can see if you have a case that covers the back of the device that might block access to the buttons but this is not the fault of the Kindle, more of the case designer imo.The screen is beautiful, a definite step up from the HD when viewing them side by side.The audio quality is great with headphones and external speakers.  About the same as the HD.The battery lasts a LONG time (but also takes a while to charge up, even with the 9w charger)The speed of the device is excellent with the new quad core cpu.I had some issues with wifi dropping out from time to time but with the recent update to OS v3.1 that seems to be fixed.  fingers crossed.  I am very happy with the upgrade.  I got the 64G version (coming from the 16G HD) and it's so much nicer having all that space to download movies.  All in all, I was really on the fence about upgrading from the HD but am very happy I did.  The only real con is the lack of an HDMI output because I liked connecting my kindle to hotel TVs to watch my own movies while traveling on the hotel room TV.

If I hadn't been a satisfied Amazon customer for the past 15 years I would have returned my tablet and demanded my money back. But I knew from past experience that this is not how Amazon usually operates, so I didn't give up. When I ordered the tablet and accessories I was promised promotional credits plus amazon coins plus bonus credits for some of the app purchases. Half of the credits promised did not show up in my account, and when I tried to use the credits I had, additional credits were deducted that should not have been. After many calls to Amazon, it was finally discovered that a computer glitch was the cause of the problem and it was corrected. My first tablet was difficult to use and some of the menu options were missing and I didn't know it. The online help files did not include descriptions of problems that can occur with a defective tablet so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. (It would be extremely helpful if the help files could be downloaded as a PDF) After many calls to Amazon, I was finally transferred to a very unpleasant technician who determined my tablet was defective and sent me a brand new replacement tablet exactly like the one I had. When I asked about all the books and apps I had downloaded into the device he told me they would be in the new tablet when I got it. He lied.......the tablet was empty just like the original, but it was a new replacement so I didn't complain. It took me 3 days to reload 246 books and 65 apps into the new tablet........it would be helpful if there were a \"select all\" option in the cloud but there isn't and if the downloading is not monitored it stops after a short time. I now have a Kindle Fire HDX that works as it should and no longer regret my purchase! This tablet works extremely well and the graphics quality is amazing!

I bought it primarily as a color reader. I have a Kindle Paperwhite that is about a year old. It was giving me some problems frequently freezing up, even after updating the software, though it would always restart successfully. Also, I use Kindle book loans and they can only be read on Kindle devices so the Kindle Cloud Reader apps for my laptop and smartphone can't be used. And, I knew from reading on my laptop that a color reader is desirable in some situations.The Kindle Fire is so much more than a reader. I was not looking for a full-function tablet, but the Kindle Fire has much more functionality than I expected. I brought in my email account, contacts and calendar, which is very convenient. The Silk browser quickly connects with the few sites that I use most: Amazon, NOAA weather, my public library, a couple of news accounts, for example. I still use my laptop for most web browsing and research but I think I could do more on the Kindle Fire if I wanted to. I've also downloaded a few games, which offer a nice bread from reading. While I don't normally watch Amazon Prime videos on my Fire, I did try it out. It loaded quickly, the picture was sharp, and the sound good.It works well for a reader, though the screen is a bit more reflective than the monochrome Kindles. It's very quick at loading books, page turning, and finding word definitions. A nice feature for word definitions is that it uses the source that it determines is most helpful - sometimes a dictionary and sometimes Wikipedia. Moving around in a book is very convenient thanks to a navigation menu that slides out from the left side of the screen.The battery life is good but playing games in particular will drain it. When reading a book I switch between my FIre and my Paperwhite to recharge the other and the syncing usually works well.In choosing between the HD and the HDX, I looked at both. The HD has a slower processor and that's very noticeable. The HDX screen image is clearer and sharper. For me there was no question that the HDX was worth the additional cost.The case and screen are very smooth, which I like. However, I was concerned that they could be scratched or otherwise damaged, even though I'm careful with my devices. I bought the rooCase slim shell origami case for it and am very pleased with it. It fits well, adds very little weight or bulk.I recommend the Kindle Fire HDX for reading and so much more.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "cb5020", "ReviewID": "R2M9RHRHYB9EJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE Amazon!....I ordered my Kindle one day, got it the next day, talk about fast, you just can't beat it!...every product I've bought from Amazon it's self has been excellent.....I have NO complaints about the company what so ever!...My Husband has Alzheimer's I got him one and down loaded a lot of games and he plays with it all the time, its been real good for him, it gives him something to do that he enjoys so very much, he is like a kid in a candy store.AND I LOVE my new Kindle that came today, the pictures are amazing, can't say enough about it.

I'm trying to think of something I don't like about the HDX, and there isn't anything that I don't like about the Kindle...Amazon did a super job of designing this Kindle.  The games are great and the response time is much faster than the Fire, the colors are much better than the Fire, and the printing is so much clearer when I read the books I have loaded on the HDX.  You won't be unhappy with the HDX, and the Amazon customer service is just as great as their products.  I received the Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift and three months later it quit unexpectedly.

I've owned Kindles in the distant past and have not been impressed with e-readers or tablets in general.  I'm an old-fashioned book reader and really didn't think I'd like an e-format.  Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.  I have to travel soon and the thought of lugging my usual pile of books was not appealing.  I have been absolutely blown away by the functionality, ease and intuitiveness of this little device.  I used it right out of the box and put it through a good workout.  In the few days that I've had this, I've already received a $3 offer for free music (which I snapped up right away) and a free book (which I learned comes once per month - cool).  I've downloaded free books - classics that I've really wanted to read.  I've watched my Prime Videos and Netflix and the sound without headphones is remarkable!  I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.  I like the Silk browser, and for what I need it for (checking and answering email), it works.  I don't game, so I don't know much about these functions.  You save a bit when you order with \"the special offers\" included and they're not annoying at all - in fact, that's how I learned about the free books.  In hindsight, I'd probably go up in size to the larger Kindle if I ordered again.  My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!  I also recommend getting a cover for this - it's a good investment.  I saved a bit by buying off brand, but you might want to invest in a true Kindle cover to protect your device.

HD movies looked, and the speakers were some of the loudest I found on a sub 8 inch tablet.The OS is quick and responsive, but the whole carousel layout feels a bit cumbersome, but it's merely a minor gripe.I think the only major flaw I found on this tablet was the lack of micro SD expansion. I purchased the 16 GB, and I was immediately bothered to realize that I only had around 10 GB of actual storage to use. 16 GB's of minimum storage should have been removed a long time ago. With HD streaming being the preeminent way of enjoying movies, it should have come as no surprise that most 1080p movies were going to be larger than the 10 GB that remained.

The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier).  I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite.  Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite \"seems\" to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver.  The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX.  It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening  and occasional viewing needs.  The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch.  So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't \"see\" an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated \"point and shoot\" camera).  But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses.  I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini).  My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops.  Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general.  The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite #1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010).  Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon.  And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line \"User's Manual,\"  for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and \"free\" User's Guide.  Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source.

The \"blue led\" and purple/blue/violet bleeding on the edges of the screen caused, at least for me personally, eye-strain and distraction (I wear 1.5-1.75 power readers).  I compared this side-by-side to a 7-inch Kindle HD and original Fire and these, as e-readers, were far superior.  When I contacted customer support I was told the blue led was intentional and that if I ordered a replacement it would still have the purple-blue edge.  If \"intentional\" use of a blue led means this wasn't thoroughly tested as an e-reader and is actually a major design flaw, then mission accomplished.  Since ~75%+ of my Kindle use is as a reader (25% video, email, apps), I returned this and am using my \"antiquated\" Kindle Fire.  I am hopeful the next generation will provide a spectrally pleasing balance of reading, web surfing, and video.  As technology, whether using at home or traveling, as an 80s teen and an avid SciFi/Fantasy reader I never thought I would see this. Considering this observation, a violet-colored edge and blue led affecting a white reading background is a minor complication, but does negatively affect the here and now of usage as an e-reader.The 7\" HDX does have amazing video pixel density and sound.  Much, much better than the 1st gen Fire and a readily observable improvement over the 7\" HD.  The speed of the HDX is fast compared to it's predecessors and Mayday, which I used for the purple-blue edge, far exceeded my expectations.  I never tested the camera before returning. I have found a very strong WIFI receiver with all generations of Kindle -- superior to my iPhone.  If you're not using the 7\" HDX as an e-reader, the value and quality is a comparably remarkable value.  If you plan to do a lot of reading, well, just don't go HDX; stick with the HD or original Fire or Paperwhite.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3IRCF2HQWWYKF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the Kindle Fire.

I looked at the various types of Kindles. First I wanted a system that I could read in dark bedroom. Second, To get comparable internal memory to the newest tablet devices(32 GB), Third, the ability to change font & background color. Fourth, to be able to use the device on the internet. I got all of these features with the features with the Fire HDX.Given, I have an Amazon card which at the time provided $40 rebate on the HDX. I would have spent it for extra 16 GB anyway. The device has a three tier color format for color of font/background. I like the brown font on a light tan background which does not have the typical white background glare.  The HDX is perfect for a dark room.The SILK internet browser provides easy access to e-mail or wherever you want to go on the internet; Don't expect a Windows/Android type internet functional capacity but SILK is very good for things one would want to check before bedtime or any other time. The 7\" display is perfect for reading & mimics the normal size of a paperback; the size of words is easily adjustable to your personal choice or increasing to the size of hardback letters or bigger.The HDX is the first tablet I have owned that displayed perfectly at 50% setting(major reduction in battery charge drain) vs typical 90% to 100%. The HDX does not need to be charged till after 8 or 9 nights of 2-hour reading sessions. I turned off the WI-FI(10 second task) unless I need it for a book download or to go on the Web which greatly reduces the draining of the battery charge. I was a hardcore Hard Back reading but I love the HDX & have found myself putting off reading previously purchased books. The HDX has revolutionized my reading & I read 100% more now. I keep my Kindle in a zipped sleeve when charging or not in use. The sleeve also protects Kindle from the elements, display scarring & dropping. I highly recommend a similiar Kindle HDX to anyone who wants Kindle & internet access in the same device.  Somewhat of an answer to questions about  'archiving', 'collection', 'cloud', 'how to tell if a book is downloaded', 'remove from device' & 'remove a book, magazine, etc completely removing a item from your Kindle', etc.Put a note at start & end of the book to indicate you have read it when the carousel is on screen & you actually in the book. Press one to two seconds the book on carousel & move the book to 'Add to Collection'. Add a new folder in 'Collection' titled 'read' or 'red' or what ever title you want, check this folder to move the book you have finished to that folder by checking the folder & then save. Then press 'Remove from Device' which also pops up in the menu where you press the book for a second or two. That moved the book from being downloaded to your Kindle & into the 'CLOUD', the book title is still on your Kindle by being in your Amazon 'Cloud' but not using up your Kindle memory up. You can click on books & click 'Cloud' at the top middle beside 'Device' & re-download the book at any time. Removing the book from device is basically archiving the book. It is available but not using any Kindle memory.You can completely remove the book, magazine, etc by going to the Amazon home page, click 'Your Account' & click 'Manage your Content & Devices'. All your items are listed there & on the right of a item(book, etc) click the 'Actions' tab there. Select the option to 'Delete from library' & click yes to confirm 'permanently deleting the title'. This function also works in the Kindle app on a non-Kindle device.All this can also be done directly while in the Kindle mode but I am not going into the techniques. I assume there are kindle books that describe all things & more or probably in a kindle user manual/guide . Since I am using a Kindle HDX, some of this may not be available to basic kindle; if needed, check the Kindle help home or forum.Books that are downloaded & in the 'Cloud', have a small checked mark in bottom center of the the book to indicate the book has been downloaded. So all books shown in the Carousel or in Device that have a symbol like @ if you have downloaded it & then removed it from device. Some books in the carousel & device have the mark & have a X% in right top indicating % read, so that combo indicates it is downloaded.  \"Don't beat me up, just free info.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.

If I'm in direct sunlight I just change the background to black and the letters pop.I can't say enough positive things about this device. Below is my earlier review.First let me say I had a Kindle HD prior to this and was hesitant to upgrade because of the reviews specifically about the \"blue hue\" people found while reading (what I have, up to this point, primarily used my Kindle for). Either the Kindle HDX 7 inch 32 Gig, no special offers, WiFi has this problem fixed, or those who complained have some sort of odd sensitivity to blue light. I'm writing this review April 2014 having used my new Kindle HDX for almost a week now and I see barely anything noticeable with regard to this blue hue reading with a white or sepia screen. I see zero blue hue with a black screen as well. I even showed my grown daughter the \"offending\" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen. She said, \"All I see is a page.\" Exactly. That's all I see too. The screen for all other uses is crystal clear, amazingly sharp and one of the reasons I decided to upgrade is because even with an i-BLASON case:  http://www.amazon.com/i-BLASON-Leather-Automatically-Compatible-Warranty/dp/B00EA1PMBW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1397744874&sr;=8-2&keywords;=iblason+case+Kindle+HDX+7+inch  the difference in weight between the HD and HDX is very noticeable. I'm 56 and have arthritic hands and the HDX in the case feels feather-light to me. I can read for hours with little discomfort. Also the light weight is important for me when traveling. I was one of the first to buy a Kindle back when Amazon first introduced these devices. During take-off of a flight - I used to read without a problem because no one knew what it was. Then the airlines went to the \"shut off all electronic devices\" to \"now you may leave your electronic devices on during take-off\" recently. So I have had over a 1/2 dozen Kindles and given over another 1/2 dozen as gifts. This Kindle is the best one so far.I also noticed negative reviews about battery life. I can only use my experience - not sure what the others are using their Kindle for - but I played three back-to-back games of Monopoly - read for twenty minutes, went on-line to check a few things for about another twenty and the battery was at 23%. If you've ever played Monopoly - the games take forever (some games can take at least a few hours), with many animations during each game. I do not find that type of batter drain a problem. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and the battery drain on that device is much faster than the Kindle Fire HDX. I can only read for an hour or two - do nothing else on the Samsung no less play any games with high graphics and the battery would be at the same level . Compared to the iPad 3rd generation which I also own, I think the battery life of the new Kindle HDX is as good if not better.Amazon had their special offer for Prime Time users so I thought I'd give it a try despite the nay-sayers and I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase and haven't put it down since registering my new device. It is now my new, go-to tablet with the Galaxy taking a back seat to both the Kindle (in 1st place) and iPad.

Those of you out there that live outside a major city or suburb might know my frustration with being forced to live with download speeds that were common ten years ago.In my experience this device is not ideally suited for those who;-Have a slow or unreliable internet connection-Enjoy a wider variety of applications from a variety of providers-Have become accustomed to the range of well thought out and well executed applications offered to devices running Ios or true Android opperating systemsSure the specs are great, but the opperating system is clunky and excludes the many of the best features of the android os.  If you want a tablet I would recommend either getting a plain reader(the black and white kindles really are fantastic for ebooks) or buy a real Android or apple tablet that allows for the true flexibilty and versitility that a tablet can provide.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Shuts down while reading", "Author": "Steven P.

The Kindle Fire HDX has been a disappointment to me. I can always use an old e-reader or my wife's iPad and the Kindle app for reading.

I love it! It is much lighter weight ,a feature I was looking for,and the playback is amazing. The buffering during movies I've rented is minimal. The picture on a couple rentals was not the greatest, but then again on others was crystal clear. I use my kindle in the same manner I use my iPad. It searches the net very well, e mail great, music playback nice. Keyboard responds well to touch. Lastly I had to use the Mayday button for an issue on the keyboard. I somehow split it into 2 sections making half the board to the left the other half to the right, leaving a gap in the middle of the screen. I touched mayday and viola!  A screen appeared with a live feed from a tech ! He was courteous knowledgeable and marked my keyboard with a blue arrow showing me exactly where to go to fix the keyboard display. It was awesome.  It took maybe 3 minutes. Great addition. I have one gripe though. I' m not seeing my amazon account in its entirety on the kindle, nor is the order experience the same as it is from an iPad or PC. And I feel the amazon prime account has changed. From the kindle I couldn't find much in the way of prime movies. I was directed to other apps such as Netflix . Is Amazon getting out of the \"movie business\"? Experience with the book rental was similar . Not complaining really just saying.i love amazon! No one can beat them for their speed and accuracy in shipping. I got my new Kindle in less than 24 hours of placing the order. Overall I would buy thus as a gift over an iPad.

I find very useful the text-to-speech to listen to the technical books I have to read as I do other tasks, like during morning ablutions.  I like the placement of the on/off switch, and the volume up/down switches, but the power connection being on an angle threw me.  I thought something inside got bent, but that I found out was by design.  Not sure why that is.  Really like the Mayday feature, this was a game changer for me, and had to use it right off the bat because my first HDX didn't deliver the right side audio channel when I plugged in my apple earbuds, but the HDX audio was fine withOUT the earbuds plugged in, not good for viewing movies in a public place. My older first edition KindleFire worked fine with my Apple earbuds, but not with the HDX.  With the Mayday tech, tried different settings, different earbuds, unplugging/ replugging earbuds into HDX audio port, various power cycling, resetting the HDX to default, escalated to deeper tech support, nothing worked, so Amazon actually sent me a new HDX replacement device and I returned mine that had no right side audio channel using earbuds.  The replacement new HDX device came in with  its right side audio channel working with the Apple earbuds!  I am very pleased.  The new technological advancements of this new HDX Kindle are very positive and noteworthy, and I would say it is worth upgrading to this HDX version, but for these advancements, there is a cost - battery energy supply gets used up sooner than the previous version Kindle Fire.  That is ok, and understandable for all the graphical/ sound enhancements and back end support of them in this new KindleFire HDX version.  Hopefully battery technology will catch up soon to keep up with the needs of our advancing electronic toys that are a driving force in technology.

The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now. It is, essentially, a wall plug in with a USB port. I can use any USB to mini USB cord to charge it, and the cord it came with can plug into the charger or my computer with no problem. I remember getting the charger for the Gen One Kindle Fire and having to go out and buy my own USB to mini USB cord in order to transfer files manually (instead of by email) or use my computer to charge it and that was something I found relatively disappointing.

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications.

This tablet compares favorably to both, but is primarily useful if you are a significant consumer of Amazon products, and particularly if you are an Amazon prime member.\\In terms of design, it is a small, light unit.  It is not quite as thin in the hand as the Nexus 7 (2013) is, but it nevertheless feels very slim and light.  The shape of the device is less oblong than the Nexus, and seems more designed to approximate the Kindle size for book and other text reading, while flipping it to landscape mode provides a more than satisfactory width for movies and other videos.  The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.  The screen is bright and the high resolution is basically the same as that of the Nexus (less than the iPad Air, but that has a bigger screen).The operating system is based on Android but is essentially Amazon's modified version of it.  It is very fast and responsive, and everything is easily accessible with responsive swipes.  Unlike other Android-based tablets, however, you do not have access (directly) to Google Play.  This is because the Kindle is a device that is designed to be used primarily with Amazon-provided content.  If you are a big user of Amazon, and especially a Prime member (and therefore have access to the free prime movies and book lending and so on), this is ideal.  If, however, you are tied heavily into one of the other ecosystems (Apple or Google), then you may find yourself frustrated in terms of having your content (e.g., music) tied to another system.  Note that if you have that music downloaded to a computer, you can upload it into Amazon's cloud and listen to it through the Kindle as well, but that's a few extra steps you may not need to deal with if using a different tablet.The bottom line for me when comparing this tablet to others is that the potential buyer needs to understand (1) what am I going to be looking to use a tablet for and (2) what ecosystem am I tied into already, and to what extent?In my opinion, tablets aren't great for productivity as compared with laptops, but if you are looking for a productivity tablet you're likely best served with something like a Galaxy Note 10 or a Surface.  If, like most people, you use tablets mainly to consume media -- either movies or websites or books/magazines, etc., then it really comes down to what content provider you are most tied in with, because there are limits in terms of being able to access the content of the other providers from each device to some degree.  This applies in particular to people with significant music libraries that may be tied to iTunes at this point (music seems to be where many people stockpile more media than movies which tend to be rented).  Similarly, if you are heavily tied into Google's services (not just Google Play, but the rest of them as well), the Nexus may be more appealing because it directly links into all of them seamlessly.  However, if you are an Amazon content person, and especially an Amazon Prime member, this Kindle is a great device because it similarly links into the Amazon system seamlessly, and is a joy to use with prime movies, books and similar types of content.From my personal perspective, I find this my go-to tablet for content consumption at this point.  I am also tied into the Google ecosystem, but I mostly use my Android phone (or laptop) to interface with that, and view this device as my primary interface with my Amazon content.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "love this game,very addicting", "ReviewID": "R3PC9ALVKW82HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.

Mizell", "ReviewID": "RUV69N8BOQ6Q5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a casual user, mainly for Internet, news, e-mail, weather reports, games, and some other things of interest.I've had the tablet for 4 days now, and have found no problems at all.As for the reports of pages on the e-reader with the blue edges - If I hadn't read about it in reviews, I wouldn't have noticed it at all. It's barely there, and certainly not an issue.While I cannot go to the Google app store, I've had no problem finding what I need.  I found a nice Gmail app (Tab for Gmail) on the Amazon App Store. The Silk Internet browser works just fine.  I was able to get my favorite games (Flow Free and Candy Crush Saga), and there is no shortage of others.When I started up the tablet and input my Amazon log-on info, it synched up with all the books I've obtained in the past from Amazon, and had on my Kindle e-reader (old version with the keyboard on it).Setting up my e-mail accounts with the provided e-mail browser was quick and easy.So far, I haven't had to read directions, but I did buy an after market instruction manual from Amazon, which I intend to use.  Amazon has a Kindle support page on their web site, with loads of good info.  Though I've not had the need for it yet, the Kindle Fire HDX has the \"Mayday\" option for free, instant help from a real live person.The speed of the tablet is very fast. Moving from one screen or app to the other, or changing pages is FAST.  No problem with connecting with my Wi-Fi at home, or at work.The display is excellent, and very sharp.  We also have an Apple iPad Air, 10\" size.  The display on the Kindle Fire HDX is just as sharp as the iPad.  I see no difference.I spent the $15 and turned off the \"Special Offers\", and disabled the suggested apps thing just below the carousel view.  There are instructions on-line if you Google something like \"turn off special offers on Kindle Fire HDX.\"  No problem.  All gone.The tablet comes with a $5.00 credit at the Amazon app store. They call it \"coins\", and you get 500 of them to use when buying \"paid\" apps.  Once spent, you can re-up the coins for future use.Things you buy, like paying for apps, books, and everything else you might like, goes against your \"one click\" ordering account on Amazon.com.  Very handy, making it quite easy to spend money if you like.There is a good variety of cases/covers available for these tablets, many available on Amazon.com.  I have the Poetic Slimline case, in black.  Great case or cover, for a great price.I haven't found any negatives yet, and I don't regret getting the Kindle Fire HDX at all.  In many respects, I like the Kindle Fire HDX more than the Apple iPad (which is a great tablet - but about 3x the price - for one with 32GB). The price for the 16GB version is very reasonable.  I lucked out and got mine for free, using up my credit card bonus points I had earned.The battery seems to hold up quite well.  I'd estimate that I ran mine about 9-10 hours before charging it back up from only 5% left.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Kindle Fire HDX, but HATE customer service for Electronic Arts/Origin.", "Author": "Robin Setliff", "ReviewID": "R2R7ZCSPM7USE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire HDX, but absolutely hate that you can't get any answers from Electronic Arts/origin regarding a forgotten password.

I have to say I love it. My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

The screen is brilliant and beautiful, except for a few features which are not so pleasant.The purple/blue bleed people talk about, its real.  It is annoying and distorting.  I only read books in night mode, where the background is black, so the blue doesn't show up.The second issue is that in a large number of non-native apps, the screen flickers.  Sometimes it is just a little bit, once in a while, but in some apps, it can get to the point where it is so consistent that it gives an almost instant headache and makes the app unusable for more than a couple minutes.  I did find, however, that just hitting the power button and then turning it right back on again (so that the screen turns off but not the kindle itself) can temporarily get rid of, or at least greatly reduce, the flicker.Honestly, the display issues really make it feel like a cheap tablet.  Which is disappointing.  My wife has a first generation nexus 7 and I wish I'd gone for a second gen of that instead of the HDX.  We've found no issues with that tablet in the year-and-a-half she's been using it.A big upside is the ability to download free prime movies and tv shows (the downloadable ones are a much smaller subset of the free prime videos, but as someone who watches little tv, there's plenty there that I've never seen that will last me for a long time) which means having the ability to watch movies on the plane, in the airport, or in the train without internet.In all, the kindle is a good entertainment device for videos, but the screen issues mean it falls short of expectations in other areas, including reading and writing, which I'd expected to use my kindle for quite a bit.

Transferring to the new tablet was almost seamless. You have the option at setup to become an Amazon Prime member, which would be good if you like to watch TV episodes or movies (one free month, then pay). Amazon Customer Service is fantastic too!!

Second, you are stuck with the kindle browser, Silk. No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari. Silk is an ok browser but it doesn't handle embedded video very well. Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs. Bookmarks are awkward. Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad. The cursor jumps around randomly. Good luck getting the cursor to go where you want it to when typing. Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps. The OS stores everything in memory and the performance suffers if you use too many apps, and there's no way to close the ones you aren't using. I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently. Fifth, a big selling point was the \"one free rental book a month\" deal with the kindle. But the selection is SMALL and it's impossible to search the lending library. Amazon sells the \"lending library\" hard, but it's clear it's not ready for primetime.

I want both, who are three apart, to have different settings.  They are continuously asking me to log them off to allow them to switch users.  Kindle needs to fix this.  I am about to buy a Asus tablet. My Asus tablet has a similar children's app to allow them each to have an account wit their own password.  This will allow them to log off each and allow the other to log in to their own account.  Second, you can't add memory.  Kindle solution is to have cloud storage.  wrong ideal.  Some apps like Real Racing is 4 gb.  After one month, I am out of memory without any videos downloaded from Amazon Prime.  We only downloaded six games.  Most other tablets can add a SD card to increase memory.  I own a Asus Transformer and love it. I just wish I bought them one.

Its fast, lightweight & portable, has an ever-growing selection of apps, and a BEAUTIFUL 7\" display. To show what this tablet is like, I will be comparing the HDX to the iPad Air(NOTE: these opinions come from a hardcore Apple user who is trying out Android-based tablets. I'm not being biased)\u00bb\u00bb Contrary to what most people believe, the HDX is actually better than the Air. For starters, the iPad air base model is $499... the HDX on the other hand, is $229. Its $270 for a tablet that isn't as powerful.\u00bb\u00bbSpeaking of power, let's take a look at the specs of the devices. The HDX has a 2.2 GHZ quad core Snapdragon processor + 2 GB of RAM. Thats more power and speed than most tablets on the market. The iPad Air has a dual core 1.3 GHz processor with only 1 GB of RAM. So clearly the HDX is way faster\u00bb\u00bbThe display on the HDX isn't as big as the iPad Air, despite being \"HD\". The HDX has a 1920x1200 display, and the iPad has a 1536x2048 display. HOWEVER, the pixel density isn't as high on the Air. The Air has about 264ppi and the HDX has 323ppi. So, although the display on the HDX isn't as HD, higher pixel density means sharper & clearer images. In terms of which is better, this one is really a toss-up.\u00bb\u00bbThe camera on the HDX is absolutely terrible compared to the one on the iPad air... at least on the 7\" model. The 7\" HDX lacks a rear-facing camera, and the front facing camera isn't too spectacular. Bump up to the 8.9\" HDX and you have an 8 MP rear camera that rivals the Air's 5 MP camera. If you're going for the 7\" tablet and the camera is the deciding factor, go with the Air. It has a better camera.\u00bb\u00bbBattery life is HUGE when comparing the tablets. The HDX is really good at conserving power. Amazon claims the HDX has up to 11 hours of battery life, and that really holds true. I myself have gotten even more than 11 hours of battery life. The iPad Air is a different story. Although Apple claims to have up to 10 hours of battery life, iOS 7 is a huge battery killer. I would be lucky to get half that amount with average use. I have a feeling that if iOS 7 was fixed to be less battery consuming, the Air would win this battle. So this is yet another win for the HDX\u00bbAesthetics & looks: Apple is known for its amazing product build quality and sleek look. The iPad wins this one hands down. It has a finished aluminum case that comes in two colors: Gray and Silver. The Air is also really thin & lightweight + it has small bezels allowing for more room for your content. It overall feels really solid. The HDX, though has a fairly sturdy build, is made with materials that look rather cheap. It has a rubbery-material back + is made with plastic... not aluminum. Although the HDX is also really thin & light, the iPad wins this one, simply because it looks nice.\u00bb\u00bbApp selection & software: The Amazon Appstore continues to grow, and certainly has thousands of more apps than it did when it first opened. But nothing can beat Apple in this category. The Amazon AS is rather limited. Its different from Google Play, which has much more to select from. Apple's AS has a huge variety of apps... overall a great selection. Amazon is just way too limited at this point in time. Also, iOS 7 is much nicer & has way more features than Fire OS 3. Fire OS takes the stock Android and modifies it to the point that it just looks terrible. You can't change backgrounds, you have very little customization, and the gray, drab colorless home screen & menus really don't help. Another hands down win for Apple.Overall, the HDX beats the Air in terms of speed, power, price & battery life. However, if you want a tablet that has more app selection, a nicer-looking OS, a good camera, and a really solid build that is aesthetically appealing, get the iPad Air. Below I have ranked the Kindle HDX in terms of all of the above categories. I hope this review has helped you! If it did, please \"Up Vote\" this review!

Much more complicated and I am not talking about the doubling of cost of downloaded books having the ability to do this.A side issue is that the HDX doesn't interface to my car audio system with a MP3 plug forcing me to play the HDX in the car through the devices speaker.

I have it in a rooCase which puts it to sleep when I close it....very handy.The games play a lot faster and email is so simple to use; I used my \"old\" kindle to pick up email when we travelled, but it was not a simpe job. This new one notifies you when there's new email and is much more like my laptop to use! Very nice upgrade and will be great for travelling!My only \"complaint\" (not really) is that I have to start my games all over again! The levels I achieved on the old Kindle are not saved! Maybe that's a good thing though because now I have the games on both Kindles (they download themselves--mega easy!) and can play the level I feel like at any moment! Oh, I have the one with the ads and wish I had the non-ad version, FYI. Some of the little ads at the bottom flash, etc. and are very distracting. Some people said they actually like the ads but I feel they interfere with what I'm doing.

The new Fire is harder to read a book on because of the glare of the pages.  Much prefer the old one's easy on the eyes screen.  I don't like the dictionary at all.  You have to page through from a to z to find the word you want.  Waste of time.  I don't much care for the games that are available.  I like word games.  I play several every day such as crossword and Scrabble on my old Kindle.  The choice of games on Fire are mostly juvenile ones with sound effects which are irritating and most of them will only let you play a game or two without paying the company who created them more money.  On the old Kindle you pay for a game up front and play to your heart's content.  I also don't like how frequently it needs recharging - even when it's just sitting around doing nothing it needs a recharge in no time.  I do like that I can pick up my email without starting up the computer. I can check it while I'm sitting around watching TV, etc.  However, you can't trash the email on your computer from your Fire, so you end up trashing it from the Kindle, then when you get into your computer, the emails are still there and you have to go through the process again..  I also don't like the front only camera.  It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.  Perhaps going up to the next level would have been better, but that was a great deal more expensive.  I'd say this is an okay device if you like to play the games a lot, don't use the dictionary very much, either don't read a lot of books or have young eyes.

I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.

This is one of the highest quality tablets I have ever used.  I argue that this is just as nice as my mother's iPad.  The device is fast.  The OS has major improvements.  That was always my issue with past kindle fires.  The OS was slow and buggy and the browser was awful and you couldn't organize apps very well.This is all changed.  You can organize apps beautifully.  The amazon app store finally has enough apps where I am satisfied (even though it is still lower than google play and the apple app store, it has everything I need).  The silk browser is awesome on this device.  Even if I had the opportunity, I wouldn't switch to another browser.I have not used the mayday button because I am pretty tech savvy, but I am considering getting my grandfather one solely for this reason.If you have any doubts about purchasing this, do it.  Especially if you are a college student.  Textbooks are so cheap on the kindle store, you can highlight and make notes in them, and it syncs to all of your other kindle devices.This device is light. and when I say light, I argue that it weighs about the same as my smartphone.  I can hold it in one hand with ease all day.The battery is not as good as past kindle fires, but I can't complain because of the performance increase.  I can still get a full days use out of it as long as I am not constantly watching videos.

Content is added frequently, which is a huge concern for me.  One of our biggest struggles was that my daughter constantly wants me to download her new games, often minutes after downloading something.  FreeTime completely eliminates that, which is amazing!!I still wish many things available for the iPad were available on the Kindle and I still use the iPad more when browsing the Internet or playing games on the Internet.

I've had the device for a couple of weeks now, and have used it primarily for streaming videos via Netflix, reading books, and browsing the web.  On the positive side, the HD screen is beautiful, and delivers excellent quality for videos or browsing.  Likewise, the fast processor helps ensure that media is delivered more or less flawlessly (subject to the connectivity issue discussed below).  This is consistent with the Kindle's other strength, which is facilitating the consumption of Amazon content.Those positive things said, there are several issues that I have experienced that should give prospective purchasers pause.  And if the point of the ratings system is to help users assess whether to purchase the product, I would suggest passing on the Kindle and sticking with another Android-based device.First, the network connectivity is horrendously unreliable.  When connected to a wi-fi router that provides fast, reliable service to a variety of other devices (tested with an iPhone, an iPad, a Droid Razr Maxx, and a Windows PC), the Kindle for some reason cannot load any webpages or other internet content, even though it indicates having a strong wi-fi connection.  Occasionlly, if I restart the Kindle, the problem will temporarily resolve itself; however, even that step should be unecessary.In addition, the battery life is mediocre, even when the screen brightness is dimmed and the wi-fi turned off.  This tends to diminish the Kindle's value as a media consumption device, because the battery drains, sometimes at the right of 1% per minute or two.Finally, the Amazon app store remains a laggard - far behind the Google- and Apple-based offerings.  (Yes, you can side-load Android apps; however, once again, that's not a hassle that users should need to tolerate.)If you don't need to stream movies via Amazon (for which you need an Amazon device), go with another Apple- or Android-based device and just install the Kindle app.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "not impressed", "Author": "Jesica", "ReviewID": "R3MFXPSZBP4R14", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are just going to just use it as an E-reader then that's fine.

This is not my first kindle (or second, or...). This tablet is definitely an improvement over the previous versions, it's more responsive, it handles video and web browsing so much better than the previous Fire generation, and I love the slimmed down version.The overall design is an improvement. The video quality is great, and music does play with a decent quality. Love the feature where it can display lyrics while playing song (if the mp3 has the information), thanks to the whole X-Ray/Lyrics feature. There's a lot of new touches here that are fun. I really appreciate the volume and the power buttons being on the opposite sides of the kindle now (don't know how many times I've hit the wrong one on my Fire >.<).Also, being able to have more than two browsers open on Silk now w/out it crashing all of the time is a great improvement.Some minor quirks - not sure if it's me or the tablet, but still trying to figure out how to get pictures already taken from my phone onto the tablet and directly into the photo folder.Have installed several apps without a problem, downloaded files and opened them, so far so good. The kindle goes everywhere with me (literally, it's the perfect size to fit in my purse). I wish there were more cover options for the 7\", but it seems to be increasing the longer the kindle is out, and I think a cover/case is a must for one of these. This is the kindle that I do take everywhere, and on a recent trip, I used this more than my Surface as it has my most frequently used personal emails installed on it (easy to set up), I can access my social accounts, my music, and of course my books.The battery is... eh, decent. I can keep it on and play music for a few hours, video less, and use it to read books for most of a day.

Grinstead", "ReviewID": "RP5JLI47IGQSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had owned an iPad previously. And, generally, the concept of a tablet is really convenient and fun. I loved my iPad.But iPads are expensive: The Apps are expensive; the cloud for storage is expensive; iBooks is expensive; updating to a new model is expensive.And the Kindle Fire HDX proves that the iPads aren't worth it. The Kindle Fire HDX does everything I wanted my iPad to do. Further, it's Amazon; so even though technically all of the apps purchased are Android apps, Amazon prices many of these Android apps more advantageously to me than my Google Play store and other Android shops do.The graphic layout of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", i.e. its icon placement, \"the carousel,\" its menu placement is very intuitive and pleasing to the eye. It's a very minor thing, but I actually really enjoy \"the carousel\": You purchase a new book or app and it shows up as this huge icon among other often-used icons. It's fun and makes you feel like you have purchased an actual book.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels amazing to hold, too. I am a bibliophile and, hence, own too many books. Nothing will ever compare to holding an actual book for me. However, Amazon has managed to design this particular Kindle at least feel as much like a book as possible.This is great news because another thing that Amazon generally does exceedingly better than its competition is sell eBooks. As a former owner of an iPad, I was able to and did download Kindle, NOOK, iBooks, Kobe, and other eBook-purchasing and reading apps. While owning those iPads still I always defaulted to the Kindle Reader. Amazon consistently and for a long time has simply offered better and more popular eBooks at better prices. Amazon's \"Daily Deals\" are something to watch for. I have owned my Kindle Fire for less than a month and have already been able to populate it inexpensively with bestsellers like the Divergent series, the Legend series, Burial Rites, the Goldfinch, Doctor Sleep, academic books on behavioral economics, etc. But, going back to the original point, the fact that the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels so much like a book had made purchasing such a large quantity of eBooks as I currently have even more enticing at the time of purchase. As confusing as that sentence was.But, in deciding between purchasing this Kindle and one of its competitors (namely an iPad), here is likely the most important point: My five-star review is as much about Amazon itself as the Kindle.It is true that the Kindle Fire literally does everything that I have known my iPads to do. Like an Android phone, the big difference is in who supplies the apps. I, personally, love Android apps more so than iTunes apps. So considering nothing else, the Kindle Fire HDX was a worthwhile purchase if only because I was able to update my tablet without my credit card company deciding it needed to raise my interest rate because I had paid the equivalent of a new furniture set from Bombay for a tablet that had a logo whose bumper sticker would look great on my Subaru.So, whether or not you get full enjoyment from the Kindle Fire HDX depends on how much you use Amazon. Full Disclosure: I am an Amazon Prime member. I love it: Free 2-Day Shipping, streaming video, cloud storage, one free soon-to-be released book a month, etc. And, as a Prime member, my Kindle fully enhances that experience.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Was a gift--Husband loves it", "Author": "Satisfied Buyer", "ReviewID": "R1DVJMRORZE7GD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set up and operate.

The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" wooed me because I am a Prime member and most websites inclined that it's almost absurd to not look at the Kindle Fire HDX if you are one. I was offered a free trial and enjoyed the 32GB model thoroughly.  The apps I could get were fun and watching videos looked great.The features, look and feel were great.  I was saddened to be limited by the App store and lack of Google Play access.  I find it ironic that when you turn off the limitation on app installation the warning states that foreign apps might not be trustworthy when a recent free app offered triggered people's spyware app on their Kindle Fires.  This wasn't a huge drawback to my enjoyment, but another thing Amazon needs to work on.  There was another new issue that Amazon Techs apparently don't know about.It was during my free trial I saw an odd glitch in the system with certain apps.  Apps such as Simpsons Tapped Out, Angry Birds Star Wars 2 and UNO & Friends, I saw a strobe-like light flicker on the screen.  I ignored it with my free trial Fire, but when it occurred again on the 64GB I got for Christmas I was concerned.  Thankfully it doesn't occur during any video playback.When researching the issue, I found there wasn't much.  There was only one other post on an Amazon comment board from a gentleman who revived his Fire for Christmas this year.  He posted a YouTube Video, but it's rough to see the flickering.  I found one other article giving tips to troubleshoot it and I tried them all and retried them when I used the MayDay button.The Mayday tech sent me to a kindle specialist who had me reboot and try the apps again.  He had never heard of this issue which worried me a bit.  In the end, Amazon sent me a replacement tablet.  Once again playing Angry Birds and the background starts flickering.  Not sure if there might end up being an OS update to fix it, but it's something to be aware of.It's a great device and priced incredibly for what it delivers.  The App store or app accessibility needs to be massively increased and this new screen flicker issue will hopefully be addressed.Overall, I'm pleased with my Kindle Fire to stream all my Flixster movies and Amazon Prime Videos.  There are just a few issues Amazon needs to work to really make me forget Apple's iPad.Updated 2/16/14As a Christmas gift, I can't say that I was disappointed in my purchase but after owning this since December and already going through a replacement I expected much more.  The Tech reviews made it seem like this thing could go toe to toe with the iPad but I had used iPads my family owned in the past and I've seen nothing like the issues this device has.  From repeatedly errors in apps, apps that stop opening and have to be forced closed several times in a row to the screen flickering like a strobe light (Yes the auto brightness is off).  The flickering is what led to my replacement, but immediately upon rebooting my replacement did the flickering come right back.  I led it slide because it happened in games like Angry Birds, UNO and Simpsons Tapped Out because I thought maybe the software was having a difficult time with games that pull a lot of memory.  I really shouldn't have since this is supposed to be the faster Kindle Fire and have the ability to portray graphics with great detail.  Now, apps with simple text articles like IGN are now flicking.  I'm not sure if it's their Android software but I think by next Christmas I'll trade this in for a new iPad Mini.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This product is on fire", "Author": "Al T", "ReviewID": "RHN3DZXIMUN4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an ipad 4 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it and I love it.

I was not impressed by it due to the unusual GUI, lack of true Android, and slow performance. I've owned every generation of iPad and type this from my 32GB iPad Air. I also own a Nexus 7 (2012).  I initially considered the HDX because of the special offers, namely the extra special ones where products are sold dirt cheap ($19 Paperwhite? Heck yeah!). But after buying the 16GB HDX 7, I changed my opinion. I ran out of space on it and returned it to order a 64GB HDX (at a much more reasonable price difference than Apple could ever dream of). I'm not ditching my iPad's anytime soon (too heavily invested in that ecosystem) but I can't stop gushing over the HDX. It's fast  the screen is crystal clear (blue tint on edges doesn't bother me), super light, and inexpensive.  I will always take it when I take a tablet rather than the iPad (which beg to be stolen). The origami case is also pretty impressive. I like how it holds on by a magnet and can easily be removed. And the folded stand is FAR more stable than the expensive leather Apple Smartcase on my iPad Air. As for the Nexus 7? It now feels far too sluggish and I hate the 16:9 aspect as well as the black bar that never goes away. I was using it for travel when working (looking stuff up in the field) but not when going to visit family or anything.

I have submitted one or two, but usually leave it to those more eloquent and well versed in the art than myself. That being said, I like to write about things, and why not write about stuff that I order off of Amazon.To be honest, I was going to give the Kindle Fire HDX a four star rating over a five, and that would have been simply for the apps available. I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole. It's as crisp and beautiful as it should be, displayed on such a high quality piece of hardware.I actually have not tried or used the \"Mayday\" feature. As someone who is familiar and adapts very quickly to new technology, it feels like more of a novelty - to me. To someone with a less of a background, it's probably awesome. I simply haven't felt the need to use it, but it's nice to know that it's there in case I suddenly forgot how to operate things, namely Amazon tablets.In conclusion, if you have some money laying around, and aren't starving, go buy a Kindle Fire; they're cool.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

Although I heard goodreviews of the iPad the cost was prohibitive although the store was top notched.  Likewise, I heard good reviews about the Nexus but I was concerned with the store.  The Kindle HDX 7 delivers both as promised: inexpensive and also linked to the largest store in the world.I have had it for about a month now and it has been worth every cent I spent on it.

It is  so light weight. One handed usage is a breeze. The only negative which I had not realized was that I have no access to the Play Store . While the amazon appstore has tons of apps there are still some I could not get for this one. I had spent months making progress in games that I have to access on my 10\" tablet which I was planning on giving to someone else.

I find this unacceptable. There are too many of these apps. Why are they not available for this fire but only the others. I am still learning some of the features so hence only 4 stars.

I've owned an iphone and built a Hackintosh out of an old laptop, but jumped to Android a few years back in order to learn and explore.  Am thinking about getting a Macbook Air for writing.  I use a Lenovo Windows 8 tablet/combo Helix at work.  My wife uses my old Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9\" (original from AT&T;) and my phone is Galaxy S4.  Recently I sold an Asus Transformer TF701 Android combo (very nice) to save up for the Macbook Air.  In other words I try to appreciate the best of every platform and approach.  What I've really wanted was that ONE DEVICE that would do everything - play my content (movies, books, audio) AND let me write with a keyboard on my lap while on the go.So given this profile and my ultimate goal, why the Kindle Fire HDX?Somewhat begrudgingly I've concluded that my goal is unrealistic.  For writing I need an ultrabook.  And one that has a big enough keyboard for me to want to use it.  And something that runs MS Office.  Unfortunately for me that rules out Android.  Yes I know there are Office-compatible apps and I've tried them.  They save to the cloud but it remains a limited experience.  Combo units are tempting but the larger they are (10in and above) the less useful they are as tablets.So I decided to give the Kindle Fire HDX a try to take advantage of my Prime account and have something larger than my Galaxy S4 for reading and watching on the couch or in bed.Other reviews will give you the blow-by-blow on all the features.  I'd like to focus on a few points:-Angled Edge: people have knocked this as clunky.  I don't get it.  The angle helps with space for the speaker vents.-Button-placement: reviewers have criticized placement of the sleep and volume rocker buttons.  Again, I don't see the big deal here.  Every tablet can potential get upside down.  It's not a big deal.-Kindle OS:  The design is very simple and buttery, I mean buttery smooth.  Yeah, it's not stock Android and I thought this might be a concern but after some intense use over the last few days I really like it.  It's simple.  You get where you need to very quickly.  You don't get lost.  You're not bogged down wondering if you've tweaked your widgets for optimal use.  Android is fun because it's so customizable but this is a device that sells you on how elegant the interface is.  I'm sold.-Mayday:  I thought this was a gimmick but I ran into an issue with my old Audible.com account and used Mayday for help.  The rep was very good.  The experience made me truly think:  this will start showing up everywhere.  The idea that they can see what you're doing is not something I'm worried about; it's a great way to get help.  Anyone who's done their own troubleshooting knows how frustrating it is to walk step by step painfully through screens just to get to the basic first step.  I saw the vision--reducing the time to fix problems.  This is big.-Prime Lending Library: I've got to admit when I finally realized what this is I was a little disappointed.  I hadn't researched in advance that you don't get access to every book; just certain ones.  They've salted it with a few best sellers like Hunger Games but I was hoping for access to more obscure areas of the catalog.  Still, a free book a month will get me reading more.-Speakers: reviews I read didn't emphasize how good the audio is.  I think it's outstanding.  The grills leave space when the tablet lays flat.  You can play it loud even when on your lap.  I'm really, really pleased with this aspect.-\"Side-loading\" apps: I'm still looking at this but one of the first things I did after purchase was download the XBMC apk and install it.  It works great.  Now I have access to my home media servers including my HDHomerun TV tuners.  This makes the tablet an incredible media player.Conclusion:  This is an elegant system, period.  To me it stands alone in terms of its integration of the hardware and Amazon feature set.  If you want the Apple ecosystem, that's fine.  Get an iPad.  If you want Google, same story.  If you want a very streamlined and excellent implementation that maximizes your Amazon investment (along with some additional possibility to get non-Amazon apps), then you won't be disappointed.  In fact you'll really, really enjoy this.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware poor software", "Author": "Cannavaro", "ReviewID": "R22LCYT720OKLA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very nice hardware at good price but software needed to be improved (frequent freezing, poor file management, lack of apps...)", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "All that i need in a tablet", "Author": "CPTNFOOD", "ReviewID": "R2OJCFPJ4PZN7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Starting with the basic Kindle two years ago and getting this new Kindle Fire, HDX 7\" was a wonderful surprise.

Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an \"android\" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a \"fix\" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7\" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need.

I subscribed to the 3 magazines I use to get through snail-mail.  I transferred my Audible.com account to my Kindle, and I downloaded all my android games to it as well.  I just purchased my first Kindle book and that has been a positive experience as well.  I loved my Kindle so much that I purchased two more for my mom and dad.

I Skype a lot.The battery life is very good thus far. I can get about 12 hours of steady web use, 8 hours of constant streaming, and have left it idle for 3 days off charge and still had 99% battery life. I can take it to work for 14 hours with sporadic work related use and end the day with 30% battery life.The device functions smooth and quick. The processing speed is top notch.The display is so clear, HDX is great for viewing pleasure. No problems reading books in sunlight.The speakers are very clear and can get quite loud.Navigation is easy, not confusing at all.Amazon's free app of the day are usually high quality apps.Amazon also has these kindle customer only lightning deals that offer some serious value.Cons:The Device has, on 4 separate occasions, refused to respond from sleep mode. Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time.

The people you get to help you are easy to get Long with and very helpful.  My original intention for getting one was just for reading.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

There is quite a limit on what they can do unless you subscribe to the special kids software for $2.99 a month.Like most tablets, there is edge bleeding from the backlight.Other tablets offer desirable features like GPS, SD card, a rear facing camera and better software for a better price.Amazon does not carry cheaper cases like ebay does.SummaryAs an educational device with occasional video viewing, the Kindle HDX has fallen short of our expectations.  The OS is limited and the kid time application sacrifices a lot of capability without buying an add-on program.  If it were a tablet for me, it would be fine if I could find something to extend battery life.  I can see most people enjoying this tablet.  Since it is a tablet for our daughter, it just does not measure up to our expectations.  We will continue using our Ipad 2 until we can find a decent Android replacement under $200.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet", "Author": "Shelley Courington", "ReviewID": "R2RIJ52GXRKFZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We ordered this for our daughter.

The first problem was that even though I marked it as a \"gift\" it was registered in my name. Her generation (mostly) is not tech savvy and we bought this model due to the mayday button. She lives 1000+ miles away so I could not help her with set up and it took her almost 3 weeks to get it set up, so she could use it. ( this was due to the fact that it was registered to me.) She was on the phone for several hours( at least 3+ hours and 3 separate calls ) with tech support before they figured this out. I understand that the registration process is intuitive for most generations BUT a simple fact sheet with a tech support phone number would have been very helpful. She had to hunt down the number, for herself. She was nervous when she didn't find anything other then the kindle, in the box. I concede that this might have prolonged the delay in getting it set up.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was  a Christmas present to myself, and it was a great price to boot.  I found the setup to be ridiculously simple (already having an amazon account and another kindle), but I think that even first time owners will be pleased.  The videos on HD are very crisp (using a high speed router and Xfinity), and optional \"Amazon Prime\" for $79 a year provides the owner not only with free 2 day shipping on all \"Prime\" items purchased, but thousands of movies and shows are included.  There are a good number of \"apps\" available (many are free), and hundreds of free games.  For the price, this tablet certainly provides a quality interface with the internet and is more convenient that sitting at a desk or carrying a laptop.  I have also found many books and guides (borrow from Prime or purchase) that will help users to get the most out of their Kindle.  If you love videos or reading, playing games, \"Skyping\", or even phone calls (yes, there is a way to do that), I believe that you love this tablet.  Your only decision is whether to spend more for the \"HDX\" version, which adds capacity and speed, or for additional memory.

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3RK1YPEQMC4EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to like? This is probably the best piece of hardware out there for the price hands down. I have 2 iPads, iPhones, iMac. I love the Mac environment and iOS.  The hardware is obviously quite expensive, but if you use the device even 1-2 hours a day I would pay the extra and get the iPad. If you don't use the device regularly or if you're an Amazon-o-phile and your whole world revolves around Amazon, the Fire is the only logical alternative IMHO.  I prefer my iPad in almost every way, but I like the small size of the 7\" to carry to town, mall, church or whatever instead of hauling around the iPad. It's an amazing price, and that's the best feature about this device.  I love the nice PPI resolution, which makes me feel right at home while reading.  The speakers are the next biggest stand-out feature that I really love about the HDX.  The first time I sat down to watch a movie on it, the sound literally blew me away!  It made the movie twice as interesting to hear the amazing surround sound or perhaps even 3-D sound if that's possible, awesome bass, great range, nice to hear it coming from both sides of the device when in landscape mode, all things I would expect from the more expensive iPad, but dont find! Also plenty of power if it's anywhere near close enough to see the screen.  I just have to gripe about the Amazon tweaks and control of the Android OS that just doesn't feel as customizable or as intuitive as plain old Android OS or obviously iOS.  Again for my purposes of mostly reading books, and the occasional movie, or browsing, this environment is actually just fine, but not my first choice, perhaps after using it long enough I'll learn to actually appreciate it, we'll see.  I wish it could be thinner and lighter of course, but I'd rather have the longer battery life that it does have vs. being lighter weight, with technology where its at right now.  I'm thankful for the wake sleep feature with the right case. I love that it has BT where a lot of cheap tablets in this price range tend to leave it out.  So far I've found all the Apps in the Amazon App Store that are important to me, so the App limitations haven't really bothered me yet. They seem to have a really good selection.  I do like not having to worry about bugs or viruses by only using Apps that are patrolled by Amazon, kind of like Apple does. It gives me a nice feeling of security.  Over-all, I can hardily recommend the HDX to anyone that doesn't use iTunes, or have an iPhone or Mac.  And to those looking to just get their feet wet in the tablet experience using it only occasionally. If you plan to really be using it a lot, I would instead highly recommend paying the extra money to get an iPad mini or Air, it's well worth the extra investment.  However this is a great starter tablet for kids or to just dabble yourself a little bit to see if tablets are really all they are cracked up to be!  I didn't get on the tablet bandwagon for almost 2 years, thinking they were just a passing fad, and were terribly limited compared to netbooks... well, after I saw they weren't going away after all, I got one, and I have never regretted it since! Good luck! There's a lot of good tablets out there to choose from.

Since they first became available, I had held off on purchasing a Kindle Fire. The new features on the HDX and the positive reviews finally moved me to make a purchase, and I must say I am very impressed! It was very easy and quick to set-up and your having exploring and having fun. I am considering enabling the parental controls to limit my time on it!I purchased the 7\" because in my mind, I could not justify the jump in cost to get the equivalent 32GB in the 8.9 HDX fire. I also wanted something that would fit in my purse vs. having to carry something else around. I was a bit concerned about the ability to read text on such a small screen, but it really isn't an issue because the screen gives a very crisp picture and there is a magnify feature. Don't get me wrong, if you need glasses to read, you will still need glasses to read ;) I am very happy with the speakers for music and movies, etc.. You get a healthy volume with a quality sound that others in a room can easily hear.There are some neat features that I don't believe are advertised. One, is on the keyboard. There is a microphone symbol that when it is selected, transcribes your spoken word into text. Also, I was confused about whether a anti-virus or malware app would be required. The community forum had a number of conflicting opinions on the subject, so I chatted with kindle support. The representative assured me that the Kindle is already designed with all the security algorithms necessary. She added that there are apps available for anti-virus and malware if anyone wanted them. In addition, she advised me that the browser has a option called Security in the options menu, which will provide you a warning if you are about to Enter a potentially harmful site.Bottom line.... I love my Kindle Fire and I am looking forward to exploring everything it had to offers!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Fire as of yet", "Author": "Reed", "ReviewID": "R1YPC8QTS442JN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great for reading, watching, listening to music and browsing. I have the old Kindle Fire and a Galaxy Tab 3, 10.1. Amazon did a great job with all the little extras they added to the HDX. If you have an old Fire a side by side comparison will have you loving the HDX. It is lighter,  faster, easier to maneuver around the system, the presentation/organization is cleaner, and the screen itself seems to keep off fingerprint smudges better. Another favorite is the ability to put books in collections. A set back on this ability is not being able to change the listing of the books within the collection's pop up window. The only available view is a grid view, and it's hard to see the books in this view.I would say that the volume output on the new Fire HDX is better than the Galaxy Tab 3. You can easily understand the conversation on videos and hear the musical notes on online radio as long as you don't become too picky about the notes. Picture quality is better than the Galaxy Tab 3 too. The colors are clearer, image is sharper, quite comparable to one of the better HD TV's on sale today. I was very surprised at discovering this. The TV we have takes quite a bit of power, now I just watch Netflix and Hulu on the HDX and get the same quality, less electric consumption, but not the big screen.Good battery life if all you're doing is reading or listening to music. Expect to plug it in more if you surf or watch videos. If you are planning to use it in sunlight, you'll need a lot of patience, but that is not the reason for buying the HDX. If most of your reading, watching and surfing activities are indoors, then you'll be fine.I bought a Fintie cover for it, the Fintie comes with 'buttons' that go over the HDX's existing buttons. These make pressing the power and volume buttons easier, and allows for better touch recognition too.Does it take the place of a laptop? Absolutely not. I do not believe any tablet will ever take the place of strong processors and lots of storage for people who 'work' on laptops.

As soon as I logged in with my account all my kindle content synced up! I got the free trial so I had picked the kindle with the ads and I did not feel like the ads were bothersome at all. They mostly showed up when the tablet was in a 'sleep' status so I saw them when I was turning it back on. I even clicked on some out of curiosity since they are items I would be interested in. I did not add any extra apps so I just used what was already installed. It was a bit of a learning curve since I have been using an iPad but I was able to figure it out without much trouble. The browser is user friendly and the menus are not hard to use (once you figure out where the controls are). I mostly used it to watch movies and shows from amazon since I have Prime. I loved being able to take it around the house and not have a sore wrist! It is very light and the screen felt pretty hardy so i didn't worry about scratching the screen or the possibility of it dropping. The screen was crystal clear so I thoroughly enjoyed watching movies and shows on it ( the imdb inserts during shows and movies were a plus for me). I thought its size would be a disadvantage but it felt just like a regular size tablet. I liked that I could easily carry it in my handbag without feeling the extra weight or bulk! Battery life was decent. I was able to use it continuosly for at least 3 hours before it got critically low, although I noticed that even plugged to the wall it would somehow still be on and wouldn't be 100% charged? (could have been tks I wasn't physically turning it off during charge time) I assumed that maybe it was because ads popped up during this time. I had a hard time returning it but I wasn't quite ready to part with that amount of money right then. I still want to get one for sure!!!! So basically to sum it up, this tablet is a small, delightfully light, hardy, crystal clear, fast (in my opinion), and handy tablet. If you use Amazon a lot, it is a great tablet to have! I buy and rent e-books from Amazon, and have purchased most of my music from here too so, it was great to access all my content from it! I didn't think I would want one but after test driving it for a month now I really really do want to get one!

In fact, on the Kindle Fire HDX website under the \"Kindle for Kids\" section it states \" Parents can create a profile for each of their children and choose what books, apps, games, and videos they want to give their kids access to.\"  This sounded great and exactly what I wanted for a media device for the kids.  However, upon setting the new Kindle up I found that the maximum number of accounts possible is 4.  We have five children and thus this obviously does not allow us to establish an account for every child.

I own a kindle keyboard so this is a huge upgrade for me. I am a huge fan of amazon and I did plenty of research on this product before even though I knew I would love it. I am a huge fan of the kindle. For those of you that post bad ratings due to lack of apps or other stupid things is your own fault for not researching this product first. This product is a KINDLE. This is not an ipad or other kind of tablet. For a kindle this is a very good tablet. The kindle was originally made to read books and even though now it is more centered around internet usage, it is still for reading. No you will not find the same features and capabilities on this kindle as you will on another higher level tablet. For the price paid for this kindle it is truly worth it. The color is beautiful and the processor is very responsive and clear. It really is a great upgrade for the kindle. It may not be up to the same level as an ipad but for the price and the fact that it's a kindle makes it amazing. This product is for amazon lovers and those who are dedicated to amazon. I have a prime membership and I have already tested out some of the videos which are great. I also love the sound and how the volume buttons are on the back. I understand that some of you actually have received a defective tablet and that would be a good reason to give it a low rating but it is a new piece of technology so there are going to be some defective ones. As far as the blue or purple hue when reading that everyone pointed out goes, I don't know if it is different on different kindles but mine is very faint and I can hardly notice it. It is definitely not a big deal. There are too many people comparing the kindle to an ipad. No it will not have all the same apps because kindle has its own browser called silk. There however is still a lot of apps available and I assume the popular ones wouldn't be hard to find. There is also a way to sideload apps and all it takes is some research on youtube to figure out how. I am very impressed with this kindle and I understand its greatness. For those of you that hated it because you did not do your research, you should be looking in to this stuff before you buy it. Again, the kindle is for amazon lovers and those who mainly enjoy reading and surfing the web. For those of you that simply play games and want a ton of apps, a different tablet would probably be better for you. I can't wait to learn more about my kindle and experience the other great things that are yet to come.

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice.

I'm coming from an Apple ecosystem. I have Apple everything. This is my first non Apple purchase. I really love the iPad but the market has changes since I bought the original version. There are way more options. The Kindle was a fraction of the cost of the ne iPad mini retina. The screen is gorgeous. I find it the perfect size for watching movies in the hand. Amazon makes it very easy to move your music over to the Amazon ecosystem from Apple if you want to do that. For 20ish bucks a year you can move all your apple music to the cloud at Amazon. From there you can download whatever songs you want to your Kindle or just play them from the cloud. Very easy.I was initially worried about not having access to the full Android spectrum of apps. It hasn't proven to be an issue at all. It took me about 10 minutes to sidestep the Amazon store and install Chrome and Firefox. I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser. I couldn't do this on my iPad.The touchscreen is very snappy with no lag at all. This processor is speedy.A big upgrade from my iPad 1. The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1. I didn't know if I would be OK with the smaller screen bit I'm enjoying it quite a bit. The more convenient size has be taking the kindle with me more than I ever did with the iPad. The iPad was really just too big to lug around. The kindle slips into my coat pocket easy.The special offers on the home screen don't bother me at all. Once you swipe to unlock the Kindle they go away and don't bother you at all.Mayday is awesome! I had a question just today that I couldn't find the answer to so I tried it. Within 15 seconds I had a technician on my screen helping me out.

The only other mini-tab we were considering was the Nexus 7, but it was a gift for the not exactly tech savy 65 year old mother, so we wanted the familiarity and sandboxing of the Kindle HDX.Would we have liked it to have native access to the Google Play store?

I bought this item to bring my 70 year old mother into the 21'st century because it has the mayday button.

The Surface too can also double as a tablet (but because of the weight) not for long period of time. The HDX was so light, the resolution was fabulous for watching movies and to my dismay, the sound was better than on my Surface Pro!!

After reading reviews and doing product comparing on tablets, I decided on a Kindle Fire HDX.First impressions:I loved the look and feel but since this was my first tablet, I wish Amazon would of included more information and instructions.  It took me a few minutes just to unlock the screen.The plugin came with an adapter and I was thrilled because I didn't want to have to use my computer to charge.  The angled way that the cord goes in is a nice feature but made me uneasy the first time I inserted the power cord.Setup was very easy once I remembered all my login and password information.Charging time was about 6 hours which isn't too bad but I was quite impatient waiting.The first app that I downloaded was Candy Crush.  That process was easy and only took a few minutes.After a month of use...I love it.  The picture quality is excellent.  The sound quality is better than you'd expect.  I play a few games, browse Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest with ease.  You'd think you were on a computer with as fast as things load.  I've watched a few things and was really surprised by how good it looked.  I've also visited websites that aren't \"made for mobile\" and was thrilled that they work perfectly.Although I love my HDX there's a few things that I wish were better, improved, etc....Battery life.  I mainly just play a few games and browse a few places but the battery seems to drain kind of fast.  Just doing a few simple things each evening and I have to charge it every other day.  I couldn't imagine how often it would need to charge if I used it throughout the day.Availability of apps.  There's so many apps and games that are only available for Apple and Google so I wish there was more compatibility with Amazon and the Kindle Fire.Ability to watch YouTube videos without an app would be nice.Ability to play Java or Adobe Flash games or videos would be wonderful.Some questions...Care and maintenance.  What's the best way to ensure overall battery life?  Should I let the battery drain completely sometimes?  I have a case.  Do I need a screen protector?  What's the best way to clean the screen?With winter now here, how does the HDX do in cool or cold weather?  Should I keep it at a certain temperature for use or let it warm up before using?  What about summer heat?Like with computers do I need to clear the cache sometimes?  How do I maintain it?  Is there maintenance like on computers that should be done?  Are Kindle Fires at risk for trojans, virus', malware, adware, etc?  Is there a firewall?  What can I do to protect my HDX?Overall, I am VERY happy with my HDX and I'm glad I chose it.  I would recommend it to anyone that was wanting a tablet.  There's many things it can do and it is good for almost anything and anyone.

If you do your research, the Kindle uses blue LEDs instead of white. The blue backlight in the device allows less power consumption and it provides the screen with a vibrant crisp image.The bottom line is, If you are getting a tablet as a gift this season, right now at this price, it doesn't get any better.

Brownie point #1SIZE: It is significantly lighter than my original fire,  and the tapered edges make it feel quite thin.  Not a fan of the tapered edges at this point,  seems slippery like I am going to drop it.  Might just be the way I hold it ..CHARGER:  I am not a fan of the charger port location;  due to the tapered edges ... the mini-USB plug goes in on a weird angle.  Can't just hold the thing flat and push it in ... I can see I will need to be very careful when plugging it in.SCREEN:  Turning on the HDX ... had a instant WOW factor.  The screen is so much better than my original fire it is almost ridiculous to compare the two.  Very crisp, clear picture and ...TOUCH RESPONSE:  I am sure it's due to the power behind it (CPU) that the responsiveness of the touch screen and smooth scrolling are also massive improvements over my original kindle.SETUP:  It took no time at all to setup;  it linked all my old books and apps automatically.  It was seemless .. my old kindle was still warm sitting beside me and I already had this one up and running with all my usual apps on it.

I would download these anyway from another tablet, so why not AmazonThe biggest gripe of other reviewers seems to be Amazon's aggressive advertising and link to their ecosystem.  I have the special offers (cheaper) version, and don't really find the ads annoying (if I did $20 would fix that).  And I like the direct link to Amazon's content.  Nor does Amazon try to prevent you from sideloading APKs (they actually give you an installer on the device) nor from rooting (you can relatively easily install CyanogenMod I've heard).  In truth, I think rooting would be a big mistake, as you would lose out on Amazon's ecosystem without gaining anything.  The better route is to sideload the Nova Launcher (or there are several other launchers that do just as well) as they more or less remove any advertising, and give you a more conventional Android interface.  I make sure that I have links on the Nova Launcer dock to Amazon store and to Silk.  It's the best of both worlds.Update...I've had my HDX for two weeks now, and am pleased that Amazon has such a light hand in controlling their UI.  I've loaded the Nova Launcher on my HDX, with docked icons for Kindle Store, and Silk Browser.  The result is a better UI than IOS or Nexus 7.  Almost everything I want is sideloadable.  I tried sideloading GooglePlay (*HaHa*) but that didn't work for a fairly obvious reason -- Amazon did not want to be responsible for an App that collects payments outside their own ecosystem (it opens up a host of headaches for them).I purchased the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and after a bit of fiddling (I had to load the latest update to get the HDX to mirror) had it working.  For those who don't know, this essentially provides the sort of display mirroring on a TV that you get with Apple TV and the iPad, but without the content limitations.  It works flawlessly, and I have been using this more than my Roku3 to watch movies, YouTube, etc.  The X-ray feature on Amazon Videos is nice (essentially access to IMDB database while watching a movie) works well, and is actually quite useful.I even used the Mayday button once trying to set up the Netgear Push2TV ... it works as advertised and Amazon staff are great!In my opinion for a variety of reasons which I would classify under the general rubric of Amazon's \"ecosystem\" the HDX is better than Nexus 7 and iPad Mini-Retina (which is ridiculously overpriced), which makes it the best 7\" tablet available.Oh... and be sure to buy the Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Polyurethane Origami Case (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7\"), Mineral Black ... this is (if you  look at product reviews) an unloved and misunderstood accessory.  I was not impressed when I first got it, but now that I own it, I think it is the best case out there (though too expensive in my opinion).  The stand and magnetic cover work as advertised.

Over the next 4 years I purchased the Kindle Fire, the Kindle Fire HD, and now the Kindle Fire HDX (64Gb), all 7\" models.  Each Fire model has been a significant improvement over its predecessor, although of course none come remotely close to the battery life of the electronic ink models.  That being said, as a reader, battery life for all the Fire models is fine for those long airplane trips, where you have the bonus of the device playing music while you read.  Other reviewers have covered battery life for those willing to watch movies on such a small screen.  Being able to mirror movies from Amazon Prime onto my TV is good enough for my purposes.So what else is noticeably improved?  First off, the HDX is noticeably thinner, lighter, and faster.  Second, if your email requires VPN, there is an integrated VPN client that is almost trivial to set up (you may have to download the Thor OS upgrade for this, I did).  The provided email app connected easily for me. and I found new versions of apps I typically use, such as ES File Explorer and a really good (free) SSH terminal emulation app that works great on the HDX.I debated long and hard as to whether an upgrade from my HD was advisable at this time, and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm glad I did.  The HDX is living up to the hype.  I even found the help feature useful.

I think he had forgotten we had already checked that and my kindle was up to date.  Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.

Since then I have tried out different tablets, smart phones and computers and over the years I have been buying more and more Apple products (I currently have the 5s, Ipad 3rd Gen and MacBook Air) and I still think Apple makes a hell of a product but my wife and I also still enjoy our kindles.  I am also a Amazon Prime member so when I saw the new Fire HDX and the good reviews I thought I would give this \"mini\" a shot.  So far everything has worked very well and the first thing that pops out if the graphics...  they really pop and it is eye candy.  The second thing you notice is the speed, this little guy is fast and while I agree the application store is a little limited it does well with what is available (and I am sure since Amazon is selling a lot of these things that the developers will make many more and ensure popular Apps from other devices are also offered on this...  might just take a little time for them to show up).  The third thing I noticed is the OS is clean and user friendly.  Some people might think its basic or limited but they have a very common sense approach on how to get to all the content.  when I was using this I was thinking... if I was going to get a tablet for my parents or non tech savvy friends and family this would be it.  With the clean easy to use OS and the mayday  option I could see this being a cost effective option for many people.  I end up being the tech support person for my family when anything breaks or has an issue or just end user questions so I think this device would take care of most of that.  Also after trying this out the last few days I now notice the weight of my full size Ipad and while at home I still enjoy using my Ipad the HDX is what I grab when I walk out the door.  Its does everything I want when I am out and about but in a much smaller lighter easy to use bundle.  So if you picked this up for the Cyber Monday deal of $179 this guy has a lot of bang for the buck, if you already use a lot of apple devices I am sure the Apple Mini is just as good though it costs a little more but if you want to try something new, want something that is a little more cost effective or easy to use for the more technology impaired (or if you have Prime membership) then this is worth the shot.  Amazon also has a great return policy if for some reason you decide the HDX is not for you once you give it a shot.  I think it's a keeper and I might end up getting a few more for my Parents and In-laws as I think this is something they would enjoy and could handle that would cut out the ongoing IT support I usually have to provide ;-)", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible value, and just plain incredible.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3PTBYQ85CD7V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in awe.

I had the regular HD and only changed up because of problems with that device. The HDX is still a 7\", which is what I wanted. I read my books with a black background and white letters. I noticed that on the HDX, the white letters are more gray that bright white which I really liked. Also, on the front page where the books I am reading show up, there are related books below them. The pictures are much smaller than the regular HD and I can't even read what they say. So I have to press on each one and go to the actual bookstore to see if they are even books I want to read. I realize that there are differences between the 2 devices, but would have liked some of them to be improved, not worse. The biggest problem so far (I haven't had this very long) is that the speakers in the back are on the sides instead of down the center. That means that that I can barely hear when speaking to Mayday unless I am using earphones. My hands are holding the device exactly where the speakers reside. I can keep moving them around to uncover the speakers or using my earphones. But the bottom line is that the speakers should have been kept down the center or even put in the front somehow.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun Find", "Author": "Barbara Kidd", "ReviewID": "R19WL75XLV7E0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Screen image is fantastic.

OMG I am in love with this thing!  The first thing that literally blew me away was the sound quality.  Just amazing!  I had the original Kindle Fire and the sound quality really wasn't all that great.  When I got this thing going I literally jumped in my seat because I was surprised at how loud it was.  It's much better than any laptop I've ever had.  It's a very deep, rich sound.  Just phenomenal. Second, was the ability to download prime instant videos. This is great because I got the Wi-Fi version and I take a long bus ride to get to school and can just sit and chill with a good tv show.  Third, I love the immersion reading and if I don't have the audiobook I can choose for it to be read to me.  It sounds a little choppy and robotish with the read-to-me but it's still great if I don't want to sit with my eyes glued to the machine.  The video quality is great.  I personally can't really tell that much of a difference between the Kindle Fire HDX and the original Kindle Fire but that's just me.  I'm sure my friends would tell me there is a huge difference.

I've owned nearly every generation of the standard Amazon Kindle and use the Kindle App on my iPhone (and on my wife's iPad). I thought about getting an iPad for myself, but I was just looking for a backlit device to read Kindle books on with text-to-speech. The grad-school text book I'm reading on Survey Methods is pretty dry and I was hoping to listen to it in the car (it's not available on Audible). The latest Kindle Paperwhite doesn't support text-to-speech so I went with the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I tried to read was a course handout (PDF). The font-scaling on the PDF document was blocky, inconsistent, and difficult to read. This wasn't the case on the iPad, even on the iPad mini without a retina display. With low lighting in the room it was hard to ignore the uneven backlighting towards the edges (dark and/or purple fringing on all four edges).I switched over to the Kindle and went to read through an actual Kindle Store purchase. I reversed the colors (white text on black background) to make the screen easier on my eyes and make the backlighting issues less pronounced. There was immediately noticeable color-shifting on the white text towards purple. I tried to ignore it and kept reading. I went to try out text-to-speech in the middle of an all-text chapter and it wouldn't play. I turned the page and tried again and it played fine. There doesn't seem to be any logic as to which pages will/wont support text-to-speech.Pros:More feature rich Kindle app than the iOS versionText-to-speechCons:PDFs don't scale wellScreen backlighting near edges (I've never seen a backlit display where the issue was this pronounced)White-text color-shiftingWith the above issues I can't recommend this as a Kindle device. If you're looking for a tablet this is really only an iPad alternative if 1) You can tolerate the display issues and 2) You don't mind using an OS designed to be a reading device first and general-use tablet second. I would almost call this a secondary tablet device.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this tablet", "Author": "Reflections", "ReviewID": "R3E5T9MQSZLT8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect tablet for me since I travel a lot, need have a tablet that is light and compact, with huge amount content that can be loaded for the time on the road.

I honestly think the iPad Mini Retina and the Fire HDX are in a performance class all of their own!DISPLAYThe screen is super sharp and has incredible contrast all around, color accuracy is very high but, the backlight does have a soft blue glow around the edges.Now a note from my Eye Doctor, Increased intake of blue light into our eyes has raised the percentage of people who have degenerative disorders with their eyes and they recommend Yellow Filtered Lenses to protect your eyes.  Research Macular Degeneration and Blue Light to see for yourself and keep in mind, this is not exclusive to the Fire HDX but, their decision to use Blue Lighting makes it worth mentioning (this has always been an issue but, mobile devices and increased use of computers make it a much larger issue).SOFTWAREThe interface of the software only has one feature that bugs the check out of me and that's the Carousel, everything else with the OS and apps actually works very well and I'm pretty impressed with what I'm seeing! Oh and Silk works great if you stop it from accelerating page loading because, it crashes often with that on.Mayday is also a pleasant surprise and I've used it a few times for some quick answers. It was way easier than googling the answers and even my Apple friends were really impressed with it.Another issue was that Amazon noted that you could now download Prime Videos to watch on the go but, they neglected to mention that it is only a small selection of movies that can be downloaded so you're forced to stream them and that creates larger issues with Battery Life (see the Battery Section).Not having a YouTube App underscores a larger issue with the Fire line...  The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!  This is a real issue and you would think that Amazon would want to stress the importance of getting these apps to work right out of the box!The Interface also has support for posting to Facebook and Twitter but, no Google+ and I'm not sure why Amazon is so intent on being Anti Google with their devices.BATTERY LIFEBattery is decent for every day tasks like Facebook, web browsing, emailing, reading books, playing a few games, and watching an occasional video clip.However, streaming movies from Prime resulted in a Net Battery Life of 5 Hours and that's half what Amazon claimed!OVERALLNo YouTube and using a blue back light has left me rating the Fire as average and I honestly think Amazon might have made a mistake with this screens back lighting. Everything else about the tablet is spot on and well worth the money they charge for it.For the record, even though I consider it an average offering, it is the best deal for the money and sadly, the other offerings might actually be worse than the Fire (the Nexus 7 FHD certainly is far less stable as is the iOS 7 based iPad line).Okay, two more notes that happened to me today...1st, the Tablet randomly decided to reboot itself while I was reading an ebook and that's twice it has done this in the kindle App.2nd, While I was tethering the device just decided it was going to download a very large firmware update without telling me it was doing it and needless to say, before I realized it my monthly data allowance was done!  I guess the only consolation here is that it might have actually fixed the first issue!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 11/25/13The latest patch from Amazon appears to have remedied the lockup issue and I'm very pleased with it.Since the locks were happening however, I purchased an iPad Mini Retina and honestly, I find the fire HDX to be more responsive and fluid overall and the display is noticeably more vibrant on the Fire HDX.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Krista  Timm", "ReviewID": "R2ECGWOAO5WR6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a first kindle fire they released and I loved it but now I love this one more.
