{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Perfect, But Really Good.", "Author": "Lindsey", "ReviewID": "R2Y3WJ7TP36KC8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been playing around with the Zii O for a couple of days by now. It's not a perfect device, but it's really good for the amount i paid.First up - I've been looking for a tablet to watch my movies without bringing my Macbook along. I'm a real TV/Movie buff, and i have tonnes to catch up on. That's a huge reason why i didn't want to get the iPad; It's expensive, required tiresome video conversion, and i thought it was too heavy after playing with it in the stores.The Good:- Supported movie formats are more than what i need: Most of mine are in the usual .avi formats, and i used to spend about 6 minutes on each episode using Mac's iSquint to convert them into accepted .mp4 formats. With this tablet, all i need to do is to just drag and drop it. Everything just works and plays great.- MicroSD Card Slot: I have a 32GB MicroSD to go along with the 8GB Zii O. It's really convenient because 32GB can hold alot of videos and music, and the tablet allows direct playback from the microSD. You don't need to copy it to the on-board memory in order for it to work.- Apps: Here's a key point - You'll need to go into Settings > Apps to allow installation for non-Android Market Applications. It wasn't enabled by default. Once you enable this, just google around for Android installation files (.apk) and you'll be able to install stuff smoothly. So far, i've installed Evernote and Kindle; Everything syncs and works perfectly.Some of you may have concerns about there not being support for the Android Marketplace. It wasn't that big of a deal for me because a friend pointed me to getjar.com, and there was a whole lot of .apk files to download. Just use the Zii O browser to access the site, download, and they'll prompt you for installation. No need to use your computer at all. (If getjar prompts you to select your device, just select any mobile device. It'll work fine.)- This may be controversial, but i like the resistive screen. It's not fancy like those capacitive touch, but it works with my gloves on, and even better with the provided stylus, so i'm happy about it.- Other stuff i like: Audio quality is really good. HDMI TV-Out to my 42-inch screen works, though the video looks a little pixelated, something to blame on my original source file.Things Which Can Be Improved:- No Android Marketplace integration. (A small issue, but solvable through my above-mentioned point)- A little stingy on the package contents; I appreciate the stylus, but would have been nice to include a pair of earphones, or even the TV Out cable.- There are 4 touch-buttons at the bottom for easy access to \"Home\", \"Back\" etc buttons. They should be backlit so that i can see more clearly in the dark.---I hope i've provided everyone with an objective pro/cons list. Personally, i like it, and i think it's great for anyone who's looking for a low-cost tablet which just works.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised!", "Author": "John Clu", "ReviewID": "RRM1EOK91DNXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this as a gift and spent a few days with it. I do own an iPad.Pros- My media files do not need to be processed by iTunes, I can just drag and drop to the ZiiO after it was recognized by my PC as a USB drive.- I can play all the video files I loaded to it, even up to 1080p trailers, play it back on the HDMI on my large LCD TV and it looks great.- The player is much lighter than the iPad.- The micro SD card slot is very convenient, after loading it with media from my PC, pop it in and had no problem browsing through the files.Cons- Resistive touch. I got used to it, it was not that bad.- Display is not as good as iPad. But then given that the unit is about half of what an iPad sells for, it is very usable.- Android 2.1 only, I expect they will offer an upgrade to Android 2.2 in the future.Ran the Quadrant benchmark and got a score of 2037! That is more than the Moto Droid X 2.2+.I was able to run Kindle and download books on it. No problem with Maps and Street View either.I am a happy camper!____________________________Updated: April 8, 2011I upgraded my ZiiO to the latest firmware release(Froyo) and I am still a happy camper as it supports Flash now. I hope they will release an accelerated Flash plug in soon then it will be awesome for the value of this tablet!Oh, I just bought an iPAD2, still frustrated that there is no Flash support. Probably will return it or put in on eBay as it is not such a big improvement over the first gen iPAD._____________________________Updated: Sept 22, 2011Looks like Creative finally posted a new firmware (2.00.14) and the accelerated Flash Player to go with it.

I intended to send it back to Creative but I opened it up and have been playing with it for the past few days. It's great. The browsing experience is excellent, I just sit on my sofa and browse away. There's a pile of apps available, more than I could ever use. I love the BBC, Time and NY Times apps so far. The resistive touch screen is absolutely fine, very responsive...I don't see what all the fuss is about. The buttons on the bottom should be backlit, especially as I change orientation of the screen I tend to lose track of those buttons. The ebook reader is nice but I can't read text too long on backlit screens (I have a kindle for that).

The marketplace allows you to download seamlessly. Download the Dolphin Browser-it makes the browsing a hundred times faster and never stutters unlike the built in browser. I think you may also be able to get that browser through the Ziio marketplace too but that is a pain to use and sign up for. 90% of apps work that are free in Android PIT-some do not. That is not a Ziio prob. Any Android tablet that is not recognized as a phone/has a data plan via Android Google Marketplace has this problem. That is also why no weather apps ever work on the Ziio, since these seem to require a data plan of some kind. Anyway, any Android device that is not officially recognized by Google as an official Android device will have these problems. If you buy an app that does not work and remove it from your device within a few minutes you get a refund immediately-but make sure you keep internet connectivity on. I still have not figured out how long you have to try before it won't give a refund-though I could look it up. The other marketplace is [...]-in the Android section of course-that is the marketplace which Ziio uses in its marketplace, but i would download directly: you click on the download link for any app and then a page comes up with(supposedly) the download, but it doesn't, so you have to click on the link that says if the download has not begun, click here. Then everything is straightforward. I think either the Kindle or the Nook apps are in one of these sites but i got mine from [...] will find that in some cases the app will fail to download. Try 2 or three times-always until a successful download occurs. Half of all my apps(i have 30) had this problem but now work perfectly. The weather apps-never-and can make your device unstable. I learned the hard way. The Kindle and Nook apps work great, as does BBC. Time, World Newspapers, US Newspapers. I will post a full list one of these days. That's all i have time for now. I hope this helps some of you.You MAY possibly find that if your Ziio becomes slow and unresponsive that you need to do a factory reset(big clue is that the device will not recognize the official charger and will not charge-luckily I had another charger from another device that worked-odd really. But a factory reset would probably have solved that problem but not if you do not have enough power left or a second charger). I had installed a dozen apps and that was the case. I advise all users to fully charge the device out of the box. Do a factory reset and then follow the steps above. My device now works better than the iPad i sold last year. No crappy iTunes and hundreds of useless apps to drain my device and it is very comfortable and light in my hands. Easy to download almost any kind of music/video file that is non apple purchased. So rip your own dvds/cds and have at it.This is not a device for non techies. I write reviews and test these kind of products almost every week. One of these days there will be an android device that IS recognized by the Google Marketplace, without being a phone/requiring a data plan, that does not cost a fortune. Until that day, for me anyway, the Ziio is the best alternative, but needs a lot of customizing. For web browsing and Kindle/Nook replacement alone is worth the price-heck, you get  a backlit Kindle device!! LOL. If anyone has any problems, please make a post here- I will check back on a daily basis.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great budget buy and works like it should.", "Author": "Bess", "ReviewID": "R21GJ5GGCLYYNM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to get myself a new gadget this Christmas. But having a budget in mind, I couldn't afford the Ipad, so Creative ziio it is. It seemed to be a good choice as it's relatively affordable and suits my budget.What I like/enjoy:1. Sound quality: The speakers are loud - useful when sharing music or videos with my friends. Sometimes I just play music directly from it while I'm home. I like it :)2. Lightweight: Given that we girls don't really enjoy carrying too much bulk around, this fits nicely into my handbag, even with the leather case on. And it's not heavy at all. Feels just like a book in my hand.3. Screen: I am not sure if the touchscreen seems to be a trouble, but it doesn't cause me much hassle. My boyfriend owns an Ipad and I notice the differences in the touch experience. With ziio though, I find that the screen responds quickly to the provided stylus. Sometimes I even use my fingernails, which works as well - something which i cannot do on the Ipad. The screen is also really bright and all i have to do is to drag the videos into the ziio folder and viola it plays!4.  Store for apps: It has a store that recommends apps, which I can browse, download and install. It's quite easy to use :)What I dislike:1. Front camera - I feel that the front camera could be better, because the current quality is average.2. No 3G - May not be convenient while commuting. I heard there are some ways to hook up your handphone's 3G to the ziio but i have yet to try that out. I hope Creative will improve on this.Just my 2-cents, hope that helps!", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Media Player; Bad Tablet", "Author": "DaveS", "ReviewID": "R392JYHN6E03J7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Creative's Ziio is definitely one of the more affordable tablets now on the market.  Depending on what you're looking for in a tablet, this may (or may not) be the right one for you.It does a fantastic (10/10) job at playing a huge variety of media file formats without a hitch.  It plays divx, xvid, mkv (some mkv files play without sound, unfortunately), and more.  It even supports video formats that my wife's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1\" is unable to play.  Also, does great with mp3 and other sound files.  So, if you're looking for a straight up media player, and nothing more, this is the gadget for you.  It also has a mini hdmi-out jack (no cable included), for viewing your media files on TV.However, it doesn't excel at anything else.  Not being able to download apps from the app store is, of course, a huge drawback.  In addition, the browser is pretty awful because it lacks its own \"BACK\" button.  Often, when you hit the permanent back arrow below the screen, it will minimize the browser instead of taking you back to the last page viewed.  It's absolutely necessary to install another browser, especially if you want to view pages like facebook, which is basically unviewable from the built-in browser.  Also, for some reason, you cannot view youtube in full screen mode -- I can't figure that one out.The speed of the device isn't great, either.  There tends to be a (very slight) lag when you switch from one application to another.  Many apps don't work on the device because of the lack of system resources or other compatibility issues.  It is also absolutely essential to install adobe flash -- which is hard to do when you can't download it from an app store (and for some reason, it will not install from adobe's website!).  One final nitpick, if you want to use your own headphone/mic combo cord, no dice -- you can only use the built-in mic.The way I see it, this is a solid media player that also lets you surf the internet (although it doesn't do a great job of it).", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another winner for Creative", "Author": "M.B.", "ReviewID": "RH44RXSWCPZMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Creative fan since I bought my first MP3 player a few years ago.  Since then I have bought everyone in the family one.  Creative builds quality products that is comparable to any on the market.  With that I will give you my thoughts on the ZiiO.This was my first Android product I have ever used and I can tell you it is a excellent tablet especially for the price. It is very easy to drag and drop music and video files without converting anything.  The ZiiO accepts a wide array of different audio/video formats.  I wanted a tablet that was more useful than an IPOD touch for movies, e-books, web surfing etc.  Granted it will not fit in your pocket but it is no bigger than an steno pad.  Some people complained about the resistive touch screen but I find the IPAD touch screen to be twitchy. This is a total non-issue.  I think the tablets speed and performance are up to date with the industry standards in this price range.The audio quality is where Creative made its money in the past and they incorporated that into the new ZiiO.  The internal speakers are probably the best on the market.  With the bluetooth feature you can stream music to speakers or headphones.Those that wanted to wait for Android 2.2 the wait is over.  As of March 25 you can download the 2.2 firmware to your ZiiO.  My ZiiO came in the mail the same day and I updated to 2.2 right away so I cannot tell you what 2.1 system was like.  The standard web browser on 2.2 is very good.  I don't know if I will even put another browser on it or not.  It is that good.I really wanted the Kindle App but I had trouble downloading it on the ZiiO.  So after upgrading to 2.2 I looked at my apps and low and behold there was the Kindle app.  It must have been bundled with the new 2.2 operating system.  I had no indication that any of my attempts to download Kindle had worked.  After that I was a happy camper.  I was looking at a Kindle but wanted something that did more than read for only 100.00 bucks more.  The e-book reader on ZiiO is fine I just do a lot of business on Amazon so it was an obvious choice for me.  Of course its about 6 oz heavier than a kindle but that is still about 8 oz lighter than an IPAD.  I have not read outside in the sun yet but i can read at night in bed without having a book light on.  You can black out the screen and have white letters.  My wife likes that.  If I want to read on the beach I guess I will go old school.My only complaint is I wanted a 16 GB version but there were none available when I made the purchase.  I now see that they are available again.  My advice would be to buy the 16 GB version.  A 16 GB SD card will cost you about 25 anyways.In conclusion I would say if you are looking for a low price tablet that works very well this is the one for you.  I bought a netbook and this tablet for the price of the IPAD.  Lets be real, the IPAD, ZiiO and the other tablets are mostly for entertainment purposes.  In this role the ZiiO shines and is a bargain to boot.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect if you're a little nerdy", "Author": "N. Mcclanahan", "ReviewID": "R2RE3TY7A27DK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think some of the negative reviews of this product were written before the more recent firmware update - after the update, I haven't hit into any bugs.  This is a great product at a great price with one caveat; there is no android market.  If you're okay with downloading apk files from another website & copying it over, this isn't an issue at all.  Here are my pro's;Pros- Great price compared to other tablets- Bundled apps (Music, Video, epub reader, etc) are actually quite good.- Fast CPU, tasks are very snappy- Long battery life - I can watch about 6 hours of video before a recharge, many many hours of music- Bluetooth is low latency.  You can watch a video with bluetooth headphones and it will be in sync.- X-fi crystalizer works & makes your music sound better.  Not the gimmick I thought it would be.- Video playback is high quality - plays everything I've thrown at it without any problems and you can hook it up to a TV over HDMI- microSD slot is niceCons- There should be a slot for the stylus in the device- The touch buttons on the bottom are hard to find in the dark- No android market.  Most Google apps work (maps, earth, navigation), but a few don't (reader).- Consider the camera a bonus.  It has the quality of an average webcam- Power button is hard to hit- No flash, although an upgrade is supposed to be on the way (March, 2011)Overall, I'm enjoying it a lot - good price & good performance.  I also like the resistive screen because I like being able to use a stylus.  This resistive screen is very usable with fingers, too.

However I have discovered other sites allowing the downloading of the apps we want.I do look forward to an OS upgrade allowing for even more apps.The resistive touch screen is not noticeable.  I do enjoy the fact that I can use my fingers or use a stylus.  I enjoy using the stylus to keep the germs off of my tablet.I feel that especially for the money this does far more than the IPAD which I have played with as well.  Although there may perhaps be more apps, although android comes out with more and more daily; this tablet has a microphone, expandable microsd card, and camera which the IPAD does not have.  And all for half the price.In my opinion it would be more wise to start with this brand, I've had excellent luck with all creative products and they have an excellent warranty and return service. Apple is more of a headache from my experience.In essence I give 5 stars for this item because you can't beat what you get for the price and now it's unexpensive to expand the memory.Also, downloading opera allowed me to download a lot more apps as well.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 2.2 Android Tablet", "Author": "RadSret \"SR\"", "ReviewID": "R2W5ZJOR1GIHJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect  for:1. watching video2.

Law \"Mike Law\"", "ReviewID": "R225HKK8L0J5IF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the ZIIO 7 for only a few days and normally it takes me more time to form my opinion.What I was locking for is a video player with more than a cell phone screen. I am also interested in ebook readers. Thirdly, price, the iPad attracts me but is priced as much as a very good netbook computer that can do as much (and more) than an iPad.The Ziio is a good video player with excellent sound and an adequate sized screen for VGA resolution. I find the touch screen responsive and precise. Had I not read that it is \"older\" resistive technology I would not have noticed because it works and it works well. Navigation is easy and it is easy to add Android apps.Wireless communications is supported better than many higher priced tablets. Another feature that I appreciate is the multitude of audio and video files type that are supported without a slow and messy conversion software. As for ebook reader, you can get an app to read pdf files and the result is better than the 6\" Amazon kindle (I own one) and with a free app you can import books designed for the kindle and have a good reader (in color). I give Kindle the edge because I like the daylight e-ink reading ability and the Kindle has far longer battery life. Another advantage the Kindle has is its weight, the ziio weighs almost as much as the iPad whereas the Kindle is much lighter and less tiresome to hold. I would tolerate the heavier ziio for a hundred dollars more than the Kindle because you get many other entertainment and productivity options. Ziio has a good free hand pen pad that lets you take notes freehand. With a camera and video support with an accelerometer to keep you pointed up.I like the ziio and it appears to be a sturdy and well made product with plenty of Android apps (many free) on Creative's web site.

Despite my preference for Creative products, I am not afraid to give them a bad review. Fortunately, there is no need for one now.Overall the tablet is responsive to the touch (both fingers and included stylus) and I have had very few issues with any applications which I installed. I really enjoy the flexibility of the tablet.It is great for browsing the web (despite the lack of Flash support), watching videos which are transferred to the device, composing emails, and many other things.Most would say the Ziio fails in the lack of apps available, however; with a Google search and a little persistence I have found quite a few apps including YouTube, Facebook, eBaY, Amazon, and even Angry Birds.The installed Android is only version 2.1 so it is a bit archaic in that sense but Creative has stated that a 2.2 update is in the works and will be released soon. This is where the tablet failed to get the five starsWith an update to 2.2 and (hopefully) access to the Android market, this tablet will rise to 5 STAR status!UPDATE: This tablet has reached five star status! After writing the original review above, not more than a couple weeks later, Creative graced us with an update to Android 2.2. The update included flash support, the Amazon Kindle app, and few other finer graces. Unfortunately there is no access to the Android market, however Amazon has launched their app store and it works wonderfully with the ZIIO.

When I first received it (it was shipped within 2 days even though I chose Super Saver Shipping which was a huge plus)it gave a bad first impression, it loaded up fine but it started to freeze and it even rebooted on its own once and was stuck on the Zii Powered logo screen, and I thought to myself, I'm going to return thisthe next day, but I decided to give it a second chance and it payed off and is working like a champ. The #1 reason I purchased this was to replace \"most\" of my papers for taking notes in class, the built in handwriting recognition is utterly horrible when replaced with WritePad (handwriting recognition app), it improves substantially, as it recognizes almost ANY type of handwriting, even in cursive provided that it somewhat resembles the letter or word. With that it makes handwriting much more easier, and with a resistive screen precision is flawless since the stylus has a relatively fine tip compared to the capacitive screen stylus' (horrible). Another problem I faced was the lack of apps availability, the ziio store didnt have too much to offer so I was thinking to myself howto get the Google Market and apps on it. Looked around a lot and many said it was not possible including some youtube videos, but I came along a certain developers site that actually succeeded in not only installing the Market but also rooting it and installing a proper Busybox (ignore thisif you don't know what I'm talking about :p ). Like I said this tablet is much better for tecnically knowledged people because it even took me awhile to figure howto properly use and edit the files for rooting.  Once rooted the tablet becomes just as capable as any $400+ tablet.  FLASH does work on this and just like any tablet some sites work well and others not so well, on youtube it plays everything upto 480p smoothly, anything higher (720p & 1080p) stutters.  Locally stored HD videos play perfectly (not many tablets can play 1080p videos well like this one does).PROS:-Flash support-handwriting recognition (with writepad) with fine tip stylus-HD video playback-X-FI audio (quality is much better than anything i heard)-Good performance (scored 2200+ on quadrant)-Good apps install after google market installationCons:-requires tecnical knowledge and guts to get the most out of it-resistive screen (im growing to like it though)-no multitouch support-only froyo now would like atleast gingerbread if not honeycomb-does not charge through usbAlso for people who says no 3g support, i got news for you, you can pair this with your phone to use its 3g or even 4g connection on the go (after modifiying a system file).I will post a video review when i get a chance.Enjoy your tablet and sorry to those that couldnt enjoy it like I am.PS wrote this whole review from my tablet with handwriting only.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Creative ZiiO 16GB", "Author": "M.

As an ereader it is easier for her to see the text than a 7\" screen would, and for Angry Birds it's hilarious how well she can play it on this tablet over, say, her phone.The bad - I thought ALL Android products came with the Android Market.  This does not - and it turns out, a lot of tablets don't.The considerations - This tablet uses a resistive touch screen, so it can't do the two-finger \"pinch\" movements.  My wife has some digital difficulty due to microstrokes, so that's good for her.  It also requires a bit more pressure than the capactive screens do, again that's good for her.  Others may find this irritating or make it almost unusable - be forewarned about this (again, for us, this made it a better choice.)Contrast is excellent on it.  The buttons on the border, however (home, menu, back, etc.) are hard to see at times, due to the lack of contrast.Battery life, as always, could be better.  Until they're powered by quark spin, however, you will ALWAYS hear that.  She can read a book for up to six hours without any problem - and on a fresh charge, she can play Angry Birds for over three hours.  Or Solitaire or Mahjong for three hours.  I call that acceptable.  Your mileage may vary.  I don't know how long the battery will last running videos, we don't on this unit.It can play Flash videos, but it can't run the Flash games on Facebook.

Those familiar with Creative may know how global they are with simply the best universal kits available.  I have a couple of high-end Creative media players and have the universal adapter I can swap between any of them whilst on other continents.  For the Ziio it comes ready to exchange plugs with any other continent, will be perfect with the universal.Secondly it comes with a HDMI cable included.  I have a way more expensive Toshiba Thrive that didn't come with a bloody thing!Thirdly a fantastic stylus, again not free with the Thrive.  It's very responsive.The curved sides really make for easy grip, wasn't expecting it to feel this good in the hands.The sound is also as you'd expect from a Creative Product, absolutely great.The only negative is not having Play Store availability but most users should easily be able to have the know-how of where to find the apps they need else where with a little effort.For so little money I don't see how one could complain.  Judging it side-by-side with the Thive that's 3x as expensive its hard to justify that percentage of extra cost.

It is not the easiest to find the apps from the android market as others have stated but with a little time it is possible to get them, and ALL android tablets in this small price range will not include access to the android market so it is not a flaw from Creative. Overall I am pleased with the purchase because it seems to be priced just right as the brand is better than the cheap others you will see out there.

I use it to surf the internet which is faster than I expected and download a few files such as powerpoints or documents, listen to music, and just play apps on it. Also, the resistive touch screen has worked great for me it is not a hassle as some may think.The only Cons I have found and why I give 4 stars:The screen resolution is not the greatest out there but gets the job done. For some reason the enter button and another button on the keyboard are in Chinese. It has frozen a few times so I have to restart it but works fine after that.

Due to its unreliable nature, I really only use it for listening to music and reading the news.  I can't recommend this unit as an every day tablet, because it is slow and you really have to dig through the internet sometimes to find an app you are looking for.  Browsing the internet is fine as long as you keep it brief and don't expect a typical experience.  This device freezes almost daily,  which is extremely frustrating, and the browser frequently closes at random and erases your session.  I also had to update the firmware and go out and find a flash installation in order to have an acceptable browsing experience.The resolution isn't bad but it isn't good.  The resistive touch screen works better than I had anticipated.  The X-Fi audio quality is outstanding, and is the single reason I am holding on to this tablet.  The picture quality from the camera isn't anything to write home about.  I like that it comes equipped with a file explorer and task manager.  I wish the buttons (home, back, search, play, etc) lit up, it is difficult to use this tablet in a dim room.  Overall you get what you pay for.

I was ok with the idea that this is a not-so-great product, but since in this price range I only had to choose between BN Nook Color, a few chinese gadgets and this, I chose to buy the Creative Ziio because of the specifications (why pay $170 for BN Nook Color for a lower battery power, only 800 MHz instead of 1GHz and without the ability of watching movies on it - mp4 format really doesn't count).I think people who give a negative review actually really wanted to buy an Ipad, but from different reasons they ended up with Ziio.

Lee Zimmerman \"Trekscribbler (NCC1205)\"", "ReviewID": "R15OGEXNYEQL7L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a long history with Creative products, all the way back to the Creative Nomad (if you can believe!), so I was excited when Creative debuted this tablet, but, as a consumer, I've always been skeptical about any product's advertised strengths ... so I waited a while to pick one of these up.  I did so about two months ago, and I've been testing it off and on ever since ... and I have to confess some serious disappointments with the Creative ZiiO mostly because it, simply, doesn't perform in the way Creative claims it performs.  For the record, I have been in contact with Creative, and I have been assured that they are aware of these shortcomings and are attempting to address them with firmware updates.As any serious user of contemporary electronics will tell you, memory accessibility is of critical importance.  Creative advertises that the ZiiO is available in both 8GB and 16GB models with expandable memory up to 32GB (microSD chips).  Out of the box, the unit only has 12GB available; and that's not a tremendous setback since any user is going to be aware that the device requires some internal memory for operations.  Subsequent to the purchase, I then purchased three microSD cards: an 8GB, a 16GB, and a 32GB ... and this is where Creative's troubles begin.The only card that works universally upon use is the 8GB.  The 16GB and the 32GB cards will only function properly the first time you've loaded material onto them via the tablet's interface with your PC; however, once you power down your ZiiO for whatever reason, the unit no longer recognizes the media you've loaded onto either of these cards.  You have to blank the card and reload all of the media all over again; but, once again, once you power down, rest assured that the ZiiO will not locate your materials once you've powered down.  As stated, the only card that doesn't suffer this \"lack of recognition\" is the 8GB card.I immediately communicated this error to Creative's technicians, and, as is customary for any tech, the user is first instructed to \"power down the unit and start all over.\"  However, the data never returns to the ZiiO's video cache for viewing.  It simply vanishes into nothingness.  I was then told by a different technician that Creative only tests their product's compatability with MicroSans and Transcend storage cards and that it was highly likely that other manufacturers cards would not work with the product.  I explained that all cards were MicroSans cards, and that silenced this technician.  Then, I received a third email from a Creative representative who assured me that Creative WAS AWARE of this programming deficiency and technicians were trying to address it with a new firmware update; however, as I've checked Creative's website this morning (two months later), no firmware update has been forthcoming.Consequently, I've rated the ZiiO an average product (3.0 on Amazon's scale).  This is not to say it's exceptional because, if it were, then it would perform AS ADVERTISED out of the box.  It doesn't, nor can I assume that it will in the foreseeable future.  What this means, in the short term, is that, if you're looking for available memory, you're likely not going to get it with the ZiiO.  It's still a good product (the reason for the average ranking); it's just a huge disappointment from this longtime Creative consumer who expected better.Consider yourself warned.  Creative IS NOT a service-friendly organization.  It's nearly impossible to contact them regarding technical issues, but it can happen, and you may receive a response (as I've done).  Hopefully, the company will inevitably get its act together and provide the marketplace with a suitable alternative to other, more mainstream tablets; this ZiiO just isn't quite there.UPDATE (03/27/2012): Not even a year later, and this thing completely stopped working.  It will not power on.  I've consulted the good folks at Creative, and, despite having learned in three separate emails from them that they'd furnish me with a Returns Authorization Request after utilizing their website, I've still yet to receive any documentation from them.  So not only is the product a bloated piece of junk, you may as well realize that the manufacturer is in absolutely no hurry to service it once it wickers out on you.  \"Buyer beware\" is absolutely right.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Creative ZiiO 10-inch Tablet", "Author": "JAM64", "ReviewID": "R1W27SG15WCN74", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Priced right!Needs easy link to Android market for apps.Touch key don't light up.Have two for kids and they are TOUGH!

So, when I found the ZiiO tablet on Creative's website, I read more about it.  With the recent price drop, along with it's having Android 2.2 installed, I figured it was time to give it a try.  Also, my needs are limited, since I planned to use it at my office to work wirelessly.The ZiiO arrived quickly from Amazon in great shape.  It was a snap to get started, since it really only required that you charge it.  After that, it started and worked just fine.  I don't own an IPad or other tablets; so, I wasn't sure how this would perform as compared to my computers.  Overall, it's been great and perfect for my wireless work at the office.  The ZiiO's screen is sharp and very bright.  Using the touch screen is easy.  I prefer to use the stylus since my fingers will often hit more than one button or option.  But, it's really sensitive and responds very easily.  I ordered the screen protector, to avoid scratches; this went on easily and does not interfere with the screen's performance.As far as getting and using apps, it's been no problem.  I prefer to use the ZiiO Space website, which connects you with a free Android app site.  These download seamlessly.  Once downloaded, you install them and move the icon to the desktop screen, for easy access.  Then, you're good to go.  I've tried watching YouTube videos, and these look and sound really good.  The included Android browser is fast and sufficient for my purposes.  If you want a more comprehensive browser, you can get the app as mentioned above.  The sound from the small speakers on the bottom is clear and sharp, although more volume would be nice.  I haven't tried using headphones, but I expect that the sound quality and volume would be excellent, given my experience with other Creative MP3 players.Overall, I have to say that I'd definitely recommend this tablet for those looking to browse the internet, play games, or do basic tasks (especially using apps).  Even when going on standard websites, I've found them easy and relatively fast to navigate.  The keyboard pops up when you have to type or fill in a response on the webpage.  The 7\" screen size is just right for me, being larger than a cell phone and small enough to hold comfortably in one hand.  It's too bad that the Creative ZiiO tablet does not get enough press in the US market.  However, given what you get for the lower price, I suspect that sales will go up quite sharply as word gets out.6/8/2012 Addendum:After having success with my ZiiO 7 tablet, I decided to order a ZiiO 10 for home.  And, like the other, this one has functioned very well and is definitely worth the extra money.  (Of note, it did take some minor adjustments when first setting up after taking it out of the box and charging it.  The touch screen adjustments were all off and had to be properly aligned through the settings menu.  After doing this, the tablet was up and running great.) The 10\" screen makes playing games and surfing even easier than with the 7\" tablet.  I primarily use this tablet at home, for those purposes (versus the 7\" tablet which I use in the office).  Prior to purchasing the larger tablet, I had not tried the bluetooth features.  I really wanted to have a bluetooth speaker for when I'm on the computer in order to listen to my favorite internet radio stations.  So, when I was given the Big Blue Speaker (from Brookstone) for a gift, I quickly paired it with my ZiiO 10.  It's been great.  The pairing was quick and simple.  ZiiO connects easily every time.  And, the music streams perfectly; the X-Fi enhances the sound and is a nice feature with this tablet (since Creative is well known for their Sound Blaster equipment).  It's just another great feature that comes with the ZiiO tablets!", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Creative ZiiO 16 GB 10-Inch Android 2.2", "Author": "zilinh nguyen", "ReviewID": "R39RJ7259X4NVV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This my experience with this tablet.

My biggest concern was the single-touch screen but that really hasn't been an issue.  For me, the pros and cons of the Ziio have been...Cons:- Doesn't have the Android Market, but see the first \"pro\" below.- The screen is resistive instead of capacitive, which means that it can't support multi-touch.  You can't do things like pinch to zoom but in my opinion, that's pretty minor and it has really only been a \"problem\" when playing a select few games.- The home, back, menu and search buttons are a continuation of the screen but they aren't backlit, which means that you can't see or feel them in the dark.- It doesn't charge through USB.  You have to connect a separate charger.- The mic doesn't seem to pick up sound very well, which is a problem for video chat and can cause feedback if the other person has to crank the volume up on their end.- You can play Flash videos on select sites only.  They only play fullscreen, in the video player app and even on sites like YouTube, I've gotten errors about unsupported formats.- The firmware updater doesn't check to see if you already have the latest.  It will let you repeatedly \"upgrade\" to the same version for hours if you want.  :)- I wish it had a regular SD slot instead of MicroSD.  You can get a bigger, faster SD card for less and it's not like the Ziio is phone-sized.- So far there doesn't seem to be any support for 3rd party firmware like CM7.Pros:+ Runs the Amazon App Store.+ Has a decent processor and amount of RAM.  Games and videos play well.  I play games and watch movies (in MPEG4/H.264 format) a lot on plane trips.+ The battery life is good.  It might go a week or so on standby.  If I'm just doing a little browsing or playing some games before bed with the wifi off, I would expect to get a few days use out of it before recharging.  The wifi definitely is a battery killer though.+ Has a MicroSD slot for up to 32 GB of additional storage.+ Runs Android 2.2, which is good enough for most apps out there.  Although 2.3 seems to be a common requirement for certain types of apps, like video chat apps (Fring excluded.)+ The screen is good, although the off-angle viewing isn't great.+ Has Bluetooth.+ The speakers are nice, especially compared to the Nook Color.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "My fave toy", "Author": "Kendra Brown", "ReviewID": "R2V8I7K2Y7YTD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was researching getting an ereader when I came across the ZiiO.

Creative have NO facility for you to ring up a customer services team. If you want advice on a product, want to return an item for a refund, or want to make a complaint, its hopeless and it became apparent over the following weeks that they just arent interested and make return of an item and refund of your purchase fee as complicated and drawn out as possible. You wait days for them to respond to any online query - you cant return an item until they send you a return authorisation code and print-off address label, so you are delayed waiting for that. When they receive your item they do not confirm receipt, despite what royal mail tracking may be telling you about delivery date. They insist...would you believe..that you must send them a 'scanned' copy of your return postal receipt, otherwise you cannot reclaim the postage fee. Then, to top it all, they tell you that you must wait a further 30 days from them receiving the item back, before you will have the monies refunded to your bank account.

Kindle reading app is great. I use firefox mainly,  but Opera works great too. I dropped a t & t for my internet on my acer and now pay 90$ a month for 10gb of 4g on verizon mifi. works outstanding. For the money I love it.Update Sept6th,2012:I've had the Ziio for six months now and to any who wrote negative reviews, what the heck do you want for this amount of money.I use my Ziio now 90% of the time, it's easy, small and does a great job.I use Verizon MiFi to connect to the net and I've not had a single problem doing so. The prepaid mifi is $90 for 10gig. More than what we use and twice as much gbs fo half the money of what we used to get from att.The color is great,  upgrades are simple, downloading app from the Amazon App Store is easy. The only problem what so ever I' had was trying to download Mozilla Firefox from Google play. Maybe it's me, but the scene says if it doesn't start then the tablet is not on the list. Hard to imagine Creative Labs not being on the list. But I got Firefox from the Amazon Store. I Got Kingsoft Office from Amazon and works great.Technical point I don't like but fixed, the four control touch buttons really need to be back lite, could have done it from the screen light.  the bottom shows labelmaker labels on the white plastic to help me with the touch buttons. I'll include a video to show how mine is set up.as soon as I get it down to 100mb.

The Creative Ziio marketplace is missing things like Skype, or a good range of Office Apps, for example. You have to find these elsewhere on the internet.The apps on the Creative Ziio \"App Store\" are really just pointers to where to download apk files from various other sites. I get the impression that Creative are not really pushing this, I suspect that they don't have enough resources and/or interest to really make their own big \"app store\" full of apps that have really been tested on the Ziio.That said, the pricing at this time is competitive (maybe they just want to get rid of their stock and forget this product?), so if you are willing to muck about finding apps yourself, getting the apk files onto the Ziio (e.g. plug it into your computer via USB and copy the files to it), installing... then it is fine.Addition: after 6 months or so, this drives us nuts not having Google App Store/Play support - every app is on Google Play, we have to go hunting around for how to find an apk file. It has wasted way more time than the cost saving was ever worth.

Who knows.The processor is proprietary, I guess; it runs android 2.2 fine.Not much of a game player, but of the few I've loaded (actually, others have loaded), about half of them seem to work properly . . . maybe more than half.The HDMI out is really cool -- only watched a bit of one or two movies, but quality was good.  Some ghosting, but might be the source.  Also, sort of wish it didn't have to be a mini connection (C, I think) on the Z10 side; the cable was only like $10, but the nickels and dimes start to add up, ya know?  The vids run and look very nice on the Z10's screen.The usb is the kind that most of the other Creative products I have use (which is the more common connection; Mini?) so that's cool.  Wish the unit would charge via the USB.SD Card support: handy.Resistive screen:  works fine.Definitely need to back light the front panel buttons.A case would be nice . . . even a cheap one that would protect the screen -- as it is, I bought a $10 soft case made for netbooks and it fits very well -- more nickels and dimes.Stylus came with it . . . now, if I could only find it.  :)  There should be a way to attach the stylus to the unit.Just got the bluetooth D100 speaker and looking forward to hooking that in.

It was decent while it worked but it kept crashing and crashing for unknown reasons. Thought it was the battery but even after recharging it would go down again. You can't download anything from the android market but if you download apps from another source i.e an android smart phone they will run fine on this tablet apart from Skype which does not work anyway. Keyboard reduced functionality can be fixed by downloading an app named swype which makes typing much easier compared to its original keyboard. Many of its software drawbacks can be fixed this way. Also you have to be aware to open system manager regularly and close down programs that run in the background. If you don't pay attention to this its performance will be severely affected. The screen is ok although not of the highest quality. One big advantage of this sort of tablets that make them more competitive to Kindle or other similar devices is the fact that it can read pdf files through a great variety of good readers. It offers microsoft office functionality through 'documents to go' with some basic edit capabilities. Videos are ok although u tube will not open on this table unless another program (best tube is downloaded).I don't know if my device (returned today) was defective but by reading other reviews I realise I am not the only one who had similar problems. Overall it comes to accepting that you buy what you pay for. The only reason I bought this item was to give android a try which is comparable to snow leopard installed on my i Mac.

I only used the Netbook computer to listen to internet radio, and the ZiiO was advertised as being internet capable with wireless b/g. After the initial setup I was able to access the internet and tried the two main internet radio stations I listen to. WBGO.org ( a full time jazz/blues public radio station in Newark New Jersey) and WQXR.org ( a full time classical public radio station in New York City). In each case the main web page came up but when I went to the \" Listen Now \" function there was no sound. I went back through the settings, accessed the music application, (Each of the stations also support several streaming formats and in the case of WQXR a streaming format for the Android O/S, none of which worked) etc. Several hours later that included an attempt at downloading the Winamp application for Android ( and finding it is only for phones, in order to get the application you have to submit your phone number, but the entertainment tablet is not a phone ) I was forced to the Creative ZiiO application download sight where I downloaded and installed XiiLive/Light (and for a price you can get the full version. Hay Creative don't forget to nickel and dime a loyal customer). I was than able to receive the music stream from the websites, now the buffer would fill to 100% and than empty to 0% and than refill to 100% each time the music would stop at 0 and begin again at 100. This is unacceptable performance from a company who's main products are sound and music reproduction equipment. I have had many Creative MP3 players and sets of GigaWorks T20 and T40 speakers( and all of the players and speakers are still operational) over the years and given them as gifts and recommended Creative products to many people. The ZiiO has been sold to the public way before it's time. Streaming music has been available for too many years. A unit like this should play it right out of the box. This is one Android that R2D2 and C3PO would have left on the Death Star. I will be returning this to Amazon/Creative for a refund.

The buttons at the bottom of the screen were difficult to activate. The unit froze a number of times and had to be rebooted. The screen itself was not particularly responsive.The worst aspect though was the lack of an Android Market application. Even worse, when I tried to install a couple of apps--Evernote and Kindle--it was impossible to do so. They (Creative) have their own market, apparently, and they have a \"trap\" that diverts you to that market when you try to install anything directly. And in the case of the two apps I mentioned, installation was blocked by their software. They say you can download to a PC, and copy to the unit, then install from there, but there was no real way to do that, as the file explorer application on the unit didn't display the folders that I could see from my PC.I'm not a computer wimp.

The resistive screen is not that bad, it is quite responsive. However the over all product looks cheap and flimsy. Plasticy looking build, not very stylish, it doesn't even come with Google Market Place (now Google Play).

The built is very solid and stylish like Apple iPad2 (which I also own).
