I tried using my phone (iPhone), my tablet (iPad), but I found it to be quite difficult to navigate with one had holding the baby and the other trying to adjust and type on the tablet.  The iphone screen is too small and the acoustics are too tinny.  The traditional stand on the tablets I found to to be too flimsy as I tried to tap away with one hand on the screen.I use the Neos to watch shows/respond to emails/surf the web as I feed my infant son and afterwards the neos converts easily to a background noise sound machine for my son after he is done feeding so he isn't easily awoken by sounds in the house.It's not the most portable of devices and needs to be plugged in, but it's been a great way for me to have some productive time as I am feeding my newborn.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, easy to use", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R11V05JP5WGVGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Astak Neos was a great purchase.My grandpa was reluctant to get a tablet since he is not very adept with computers, but I insisted that he try the Neos. After trying the product myself, I knew that he would be able to start using this new tablet right out of the box. I went through the setup process with him. The set-up instructions were easy to understand and the screen was clear and bright, so there is no problem reading. The tablet responds quickly and has not frozen yet, in fact, he hasn\u2019t called me once for any help using the Neos. Now he uses Skype all the time to chat/videochat with me, and we do that a few times every week. This has been a wonderful purchase for my grandpa that I will gladly recommend to my friends.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Android PC with a nice set of speakers", "Author": "Ali Julia",

I would describe it as an Android PC.Neos runs 4.1 Jelly Bean Android operating system.  As I write this review the current version of Android is 4.4 (KitKat).  The processor in this device (TI OMAP 4430 dual-core CPU) is made by Texas Instruments which got out of the business of mobile computing so it is highly probable that this device will never be updated as with every new release there is a need for new drivers and TI is not going to provide them.  I tried updating the device and it told me there are no updates.  What does it mean?  It means that bug fixes and new features will not be available. For majority of people this is probably not a deal breaker but worth noting.With that out of the way, I thought the Neos performed rather snappy, the touch screen has a nice response, and the built-in speakers are excellent.  The screen resolution is 1366 x 768 and looks okay if you looked at it straight on. But the good viewing angle is very narrow. If you are not right in front of the screen the colors look washed out.  For comparison our tablets (Nexus 7, iPad Mini, and Galaxy Tab 7.7) have brighter colors and wider viewing angle.The front panel of the Neos is 16\" by 10\" wide, the display area is 14.5\" x 8\" (which if measured on a diagonal corner to corner is 15.6 inch, the size mentioned in the specs).  The device is shaped as a triangle. The angle of the screen is fixed, but you can change the angle of the display by standing the unit on either side if the triangle: either horizontally sloping down, or vertically sloping out (see video). The narrow base is 4\" wide, and the wide base is 9.5\".The display works fine with apps that work in landscape mode, but some apps work only in portrait mode (like some of my favorite games) and that means they will not be usable on this device.Neos weighs 6 pounds 14 oz.  The AC cord is 66 inches.  It does not have a battery and needs to be plugged into AC to work.So what is this device good for?  It is good for watching or listening to any content available on the web using Android apps.  It worked well with YouTube videos and TuneIn radio.  I was able to use it to watch cable channels using US TV app.  I tried to stream Amazon Instant Videos, but Amazon told me that this device is not compatible and cannot be used for view Amazon Videos.  This decision is made by Amazon and is true for all Android devices, Neos is not at fault here.In addition to displaying videos, Neos can be an MP3 by playing MP3s either from a memory card or a USB stick. It can also serve as external speaker to any MP3 device attached to it via an audio port in the back of the unit.When I plugged in my USB stick in the port located on the back of the unit, I was able to navigate to it via ES File Explorer. My memory stick appeared as one of the local storage options. I was able to play mp3 files directly from the external media. Neos makes a nice MP3 player with a terrific set of external speakers.NEOS speakers are one of its strongest points.  The sound is clean and crisp, I thought it sounded good at all ranges. I put it through my standard stress test for the bass (Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor). NEOS handled it beautifully, no crackling, not muddy, just crisp and clear.  The sound comes from two Onkyo 5-Watt stereo speakers built into the sides of the unit.NEOS comes with it own user interface called Kloud. Instead of having pages that you get with Google's interface, NEOS organizes everything into folders: Media, Games, Favorite, Communications, etc.  You can get rid of most folders (there are a few non-removable folders like \"available applications\") and add your own.  I liked the concept of organizing appls into folders but I did not like some of the pre-installed categories.  I was able to remove the pre-installed folders and apps I did not like. I was able to add my own folders, and then move and add apps to the new folders.A bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth headset with a microphone (for use with Skype) paired easily.  Both worked well, and I find using a bluetooth keyboard much more convenient than typing on the big on-screen keyboard.The USB port in the back can be used to connect a USB keyboard.  I tested with Logitech Wireless USB Keyboard K360 Logitech Wireless Keyboard K360 (920-003365)I am using WiFi and the device feels pretty snappy when I search and run apps.  In addition to WiFi NEOS also supports a direct Ethernet connection, in the back of the unit there is a RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet port.I was not able to run OOKLA Speedtest to measure the speed of the device. Speedtest app reported to be incompatible with my device.For video calling or social media  Neos has a 5M pixel camera with autofocus on the front of the unit.  The back of the unit has a small lever which allows you to tilt the camera up and down so you can adjust the image based on your height or position in front of the screen.To turn Neos off, hold the glowing blue button in the back for a few seconds and a shut down prompt will appear on the screen.I received this unit for evaluation and review.  The feature I liked best is the speakers, the weakest feature is the narrow viewing angle. I think the introductory price of $499 is a bit high for the functionality you get, but an Android PC is a useful device.Ali Julia review12/28/13  Today a friend with a Netflix subscription visited and I asked him to log into his account to see if Neos is compatible with Netflix.

It is not portable, does not contain a battery and must be powered from AC.If you want my quick opinion of this tablet without reading the entire review or watching the video, then here it is. I think this is a good but not fantastic tablet for general Internet useage including watching movies, playing music, surfing, email, games (though not the most complex processor intensive games) and running many different types of apps. The reason I don't think it's fantastic is because the screen resolution is lacking and is more along the lines of screen resolution that I would expect to have seen several years ago, but not today. The other issue with the screen is its extremely poor off-axis veiwing. It looks OK when you are straight on, but as soon as you go off to one side or another, up or down, left to right, the screen quickly loses quality. And because of the lower resolution, small text looks jagged. The implications of this are that if two people are trying to view the screen, either both will be somewhat frustrated at the poor screen view because of their off-axis vantage point, or one person will have a great view and the other person will have virtually no view of the screen. It is a real problem.Othewise this is an interesting table-top tablet. Because of its large physical screen size (not to be confused with high resolution), this is a good tablet for someone who may not have the acute vision necessary to be used with a smaller 7\" or even 10\" tablet.This does not run an unadulterated version of Android but has a \"skin\" that customized the way Android works on this tablet, compared to a Nexus 7 for instance.On the left side of the screen is a column of pre-determined buttons containing various collections of apps. The column contains the following buttons:- All Apps- Recent- Downloaded- My Favorites- Available Apps- Sync Now- Education- Media- Communication- Games- Kitchen Magic- Fashinon & Style- LifestyleYou can add to or delete the apps that are pre-configured in these categories.Below that column of buttons are three icons on the screen representing, from left to right: Back Button, Home Button and Recent Apps Button.Netflix works just fine and streaming YouTube videos also works well on this tablet. Several games are preinstalled including Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja. Strangely both of those games don't reorient themselves if the tablet is in the \"low\" position, but only if the tablet is standing up do the apps look right side up.The built-in speakers put all other tablet speakers to shame. Obviously since this is such a large enclosure, the Neos is able to have significantly larger speakers inside along with a more powerful 5watt amplifier. It makes a huge difference. But still, you can use external bluetooth speakers if you wish since the tablet also has bluetooth capability.I like that the tablet comes preconfigured with a bunch of apps, many of which are actually useful... like Netfilx, Skype, Angry Birds, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Gmail, YouTube, Pandora and more. There is also a preconfigured number of apps available in the \"Available Apps\" button that can be downloaded using one touch of the download icon for each app listed. Some of the apps here are: Epicurious Allrecipes, Evernote, Spotify and quite a few more.I kind of like this tablet in spite of it's poor screen resolution. The large screen is great and will appeal to kids as well as people with vision that is not quite good enough to see small screen text. It's kind of cool that it has an Audio-in jack so that you can play  MP3 players or other audio sources through the built-in speakers if the Neos. And it has an Ethernet port so you can connect directly to the WAN instead of using WiFi.I particularly like that you can add additional storage by the SD/MMC card slot.The USB port allows you to connect peripherals such as a keyboard... or you could use a bluetooth keyboard if you deisred. I should also mention the on-screen keyboard... it is HUGE. I mean it is nearly impossible to do anything but one finger typing on this because the low screen resolution makes the keyboard gigantic. Very odd to see and use this on-screen keyboard.If only the screen were better, I\"d rate this higher. Unfortunately the screen has about the worst viewing angles I\"ve seen on any computer/tablet screen. If resolution is not an issue for you, you might enjoy this table-top tablet quite a bit. I\"m close a 3 star rating but feel that the large screen, in spite of its poor viewing angle and low resolution, great speakers and pre-installed apps do have some merit so am settling on 4 stars.I was provided a sample for review.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet with speakers", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R2HJT7EUBDSZPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While the lack of portability for this tablet can seem off-putting, I think the size, clear display and speakers make this a worthy investment especially for college students. Because I don't have a television in my apartment, this functions as a sort of all-in-one: I have the freedom to download tons of apps without having to squint at tiny smartphone screens, and I can watch films and videos on a screen that's a comfortable size -- all while keeping things separate from my laptop, which is a must especially when you're (supposed to be) studying. There aren't any frills to the design but the user interface is simple, no-nonsense and easy to use: on boot-up the 'home' screen/desktop immediately displays all of the apps you've downloaded. The touch monitor is sensitive and responds quickly, and there's almost a surround-sound quality to the speakers that you don't usually find in laptops or tablets, rendering things like gaming a really nice experience. Syncing takes place immediately on boot-up, so you can start right where you left off. The only thing that might be improved would be the addition of a battery, so the tablet can be moved around. College students aside, I'd also recommend this to people who've never used smartphones or even computers before; the simple, intuitive design is a lot less complicated than any computer or even smartphone, so it'd be a nice gift for, say, a grandmother or other relative I think!", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Weirdly Cool -- In a Niche By Itself", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "RHP4I10LPHXKR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Astak Neos is like nothing else I've encountered: it's not a true tablet because it has no battery, and it's not a true computer because its Android tablet interface has limited functionality.  After playing around with it for several days, I've concluded that it's essentially a semi-portable media device.The Neos looks like a giant iPad (18\" on the diagonal, including the black area outside of the screen) mounted permanently on a wedge stand.  It uses the Android Jellybean OS, and apps are limited to that platform.  It has built-in Onkyo speakers on the wedge in back, with the speakers directed outward on the right and left.  It also has a built-in camera for taking selfies or using Skype, and a built-in microphone.  The interface makes it easy to connect with your home wireless network, set the time, and create users.The sound quality of the speakers is pretty good -- better than most mobile devices -- but it cannot compete with many stand-alone speaker systems that stream over a home network.  Still, playing Pandora on the Neos is worlds better than playing it on an iPad and a universe away from streaming it on most smart phones.  The video quality is less impressive because the resolution just can't compete with Apple's products.  The fixed viewing angle can also cause problems.  If I'm standing above it slightly, even across a room, I can see video perfectly, but if I sit down, with an angle below the screen, I can't see it well at all.  The back has ports for an SD card, USB flash drive, or wired ethernet connection.  The user available internal memory is 11.81 GB.The Neos can retrieve email, steam music and video, can use Chrome to surf the web, has a touch screen for games like FruitNinja and Angry Birds, works well with Skype, reading media such as the New York Times, and can be used for viewing photos.But it's not good for everything.  The touchscreen keyboard, especially because of the fixed angle, is awkward to use, making answering email more difficult than on a regular keyboard.  A Bluetooth keyboard would be a great addition if you plan on using it for email.  Amazon Instant Video does not work with this, although it seems as though it will connect with my Roku, which can stream Amazon VOD.  (I haven't tested this.)  Belkin @TV works (download the app from the Play Store); however, the quality is terrible, especially when compared to my IPad and Mac.  This may be more of a function of the Android app, however, than the Neos -- I can't be sure.  Obviously, since this is an Android platform, iTunes libraries are not compatible, although you can move/use MP3 files from other sources.There's one aspect I truly dislike about it, and that's the seeming inability to remove a user.  I can see kids accessing parent accounts and charging apps to a credit card on file, or a hand-me-down Neos ending up accessing your email.  Or a house guest setting up his/her account for a quick email check and inadvertently giving you full access - and being able to access YOUR content.I've been asked by many people for recommendations for older relatives who just want to go on Facebook and answer email, and the Neos may be an excellent choice for them.  It also makes a great portable TV with the right add-ons and apps.  The user doesn't have to hold it (it's on a permanent stand), and its interface may not be as intimidating as a computer.  For others who are more familiar with technology, the Neos makes a good add-on to other devices, as long as you don't expect to carry it often from room to room.  It is best as an auxiliary device that sits in one place, on a large enough surface to hold it.

As well as my best friends. We love it. It looks pretty and modern, I can look up all the recipes I want fast, and I do not have to worry about ruining the screen. Before, when on my phone I was always afraid of getting it dirty or dropping it. The Neos is easy to touch and very easy to clean.It easily can sit up straight or lay flat depending what I am doing.

We came across something on Amazon that caught our eye the Astak Neos. It had larger dimensions than a tablet but many functions of one so I decided to go for it. When it arrived, I was a bit skeptical of it but have quickly gown to love it. I can use it in any room in the house and at night set it up on the dresser and put on a movie. We have been using it in our kitchen while cooking and I even took it to a conference to assist with registrations at the door. At first I was taken aback by it not having an internal battery however, this became a huge plus in a way very quickly. The kids cannot run around with it and drop it like other tablets I have had to replace in the past and someone cannot just get up and walk away with it in a business scenario as I tested at the conference.I love the touch screen and PC feel it has, and the initial setup ofthe Neos was very easy. It linked to my google account and I was on myway. Its tilt-able camera makes it easy to adjust the angle for videochat. There is an audio-in jack on the back for me to plug my phoneinto and play music through the Neos an option we enjoy. It is running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean as its OS so I am right at home as I use android phones.Only cons are I wish it had a longer power cord, support for akeyboard/mouse and some of the viewing angles are a bit hard to see.Overall, we are very pleased with the purchase and will recommend itto our friends and family and get one as a gift for our parents whoare not as tech savvy as I am.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great machine, great entertainment center", "Author": "jessie98", "ReviewID": "R29LGYEYYZWZ8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT MACHINE!I purchased a Neos last week and it has been GREAT!

tablet device, but is far more functional as a small smart television.The Neos is heavy and really not meant to be portable. The large screen is great for those who have difficulty with small tablet and smart phone screens as it is running at a fairly low resolution (which means everything on the screen is quite large and easy to touch).  The device can operate both standing up as well as lying down on its back, but the on screen keyboard is so large it's hard to type quickly in that orientation. There is on board bluetooth so keyboards and other devices should be compatible with it.The screen is ok.. The viewing angle on it is very narrow so the image will degrade if not looking directly at it. My review unit also had some dust particles underneath the screen. Two large speakers on both sides of the Neos are loud but lack clarity due to sound resonating in the back of the device.Performance is decent for video streaming and web browsing applications. It scores far below other current tablets on benchmark tests but a few games I tested ran at an acceptable framerate. This is likely because it is running at a relatively low resolution.The Neos runs Android Jellybean 4.1 - a few versions behind the current release. But it does have the Google Play story preinstalled so most apps should install and run well.So what's the best use for the Neos?  Probably as a Smart TV for the kitchen or another room where a small display is suitable. Note that it doesn't have a tuner on board, but it does run streaming video apps from Netflix, HBO, and others quite well. The speakers carry quite well in larger rooms.So why the three stars? The viewing angle is an issue especially if being used mostly as a streaming video player. It's also too expensive given its components.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good.", "Author": "Edward Chang", "ReviewID": "R2TPTYW4UNX37K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good product.

For the price and scene size, can't be beat!  The system keep locking up on me...the only resolution is to unplug the AC power cord and it boots up fine.Some gadgets close down for no reason?  Otherwise, it is very functional.I have mine on the kitchen counter.  I wish the contrast was better, but no control for that. I listen to radio and have a visualizer going, looks good.  For the price and things it can do, I'm impressed.  I left SkyFM playing last night and when I woke up, the computer was slow and non-responsive?  Said, no wifi, but I had wifi.  And the gadget wouldn't open.  I unplugged the power cord and started it back up, everything worked fine.  Either I\"m being hacked or there is something wrong with this machine.  But, unplugging the AC and plugging it back in seem to work. IT'S NOT RELIABLE AND CAN'T BE TRUSTED, BUT HAS PROBLEMS!!  ONE MORE TIME AND IT'S GOING BACK!!It's gone...kept dropping wifi signal, even thought it said 'excellent.  The concept is nice, sound iswonderful, but it kept dropping the wifi signal, that was only 20 feet away!!!
