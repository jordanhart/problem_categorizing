I just received the tablet and very impressed.  It came with a manual giving me step by step instructions and I absolutely love it.  I recently started a photograph business as well and this is perfect to take pictures with.  My 16 yr old son is already begging me to get him one.  When I started looking for a tablet I really thought it was going to be expensive and was a little leery of the price; however now that I received it I may have to order another one!  Awesome product AMAZING price!", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great beginner tablet", "Author": "Dibble", "ReviewID": "R21XSLMTJ061T4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the tablet as a gift for my daughter's birthday. I am helping her set it up. I was amazed when I saw the price tag on Amazon as I was expecting it to be well over $100. The tablet looks elegant, it's easy to hold, easy to setup and easy for my daughter to use. The manual that came with it was extremely helpful. I am looking to buy something for myself as well because I'm hoping to retire my  old tablet. I am wondering if there are options for adults who need more power--more gigs and battery power in the tablets at a similar price or a slightly more expensive price? Anyway, this tablet is more than enough for my daughter. Overall, very happy.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00K8K4IXM"}}
