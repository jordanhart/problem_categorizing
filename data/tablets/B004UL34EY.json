{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BlackBerry has done it again :)", "Author": "T Pressley", "ReviewID": "R1VZ8AE3DLVT03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very big on researching a product before I buy it, so I definitely wanted to make it a point to write a review on the PlayBook once I got some use out of it.I am in LOVE with this thing. Ordering it from Amazon made it easier and I felt safer than with any other site, and I think that the price for the 32G PlayBook was cheaper on this site than on BlackBerry's site (which would still charge a good bit for shipping and handling; mine was free. And don't even get me started on the in-store prices that would tax the initial price, which will be close to twice what  you'd find here, to kingdom come.).While some might buy it for the game play, and others may use it for internet and media sharing, some may use it for social networking, others may want to hook up a cable and use it for professional presentations...Whatever your use, the PlayBook has it covered.The initial setup WILL require, as stated on the outside of the box, a Wi-Fi connection to update the latest version of the OS (operating system). After that, the features already loaded onto it make it user friendly. It takes you through a tutorial of how to use the swipe feature to make shortcuts and navigate through the programs on the tablet; and don't let that overwhelm you, within 30 or so minutes,  I was already getting the hang of it.For all you BlackBerry Users out there, as soon as you have the chance to get into the app world, download BlackBerry Bridge. This nifty little app allows your smartphone and tablet to be connected via bluetooth. You can view files such as pictures, videos, documents, contacts, email that have already been sent to your phone - right from your PlayBook. BB Bridge also allows internet tethering, whether your phone works as a regular hot-spot or if you just want to use your phone's internet (**note, internet usage from internet tethering from your wireless phone must be done through \"bridge browser\" and regular wi-fi usage can be done from selecting a hot spot).The cameras are great, they do well with a considerable amount of light and there is no built in flash, but I do believe the quality of the camera makes up for it. The layout is very clean and easy to use. The resolution on the screen is amazing. Youtube can easily be played (and an app comes pre-loaded) and looks great and isn't as laggy as it is on most phones.For the gamers out there, I'm not sure how you would feel about a touch screen interface for gaming but it works fine for me. I am much more into puzzle games, but I did recently download (and become addicted to) a couple free action apps I found (Need for Speed, Asphalt Attack, and an FPS called Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus) run smoothly, have great graphics, awesome sound effects and music, and didn't cost a dime. Whether you're in the middle of a shoot-out, drifting in a race, or battling in a daring game of Tetris, the tablet can still run smoothly while running several apps at a time and most will pause automatically when the window its in is minimized or toggled. Kobo for eBooks comes automatically on it. Free to start up an account, easy downloads, pretty good library of good books. I love this thing. I never leave home without it.The only complaints I do have (though admittedly, I haven't been doing as much research for the PlayBook as I have been playing with it) would be that I have difficulty with getting pictures onto my PB from my phone. I know I could go through the process of going to my computer and hooking up the USB cable and doing it the manual way, but it could just be me and my device or devices, it would just be easier to be able to send them using Bluetooth to have without using BB Bridge. There is a video chat app, but it only works with other BB PlayBook users. I did do some research and there are a couple CrackBerry apps that will allow video chat with other PC users as long as they have the program installed. And this isn't a big deal for me, but it could be a deal breaker for some of you, there is no USB or MicroSD card slot on the device. I'm indifferent. I'd rather pick and choose what I wanted onto it from the computer or other device as opposed to having them all stored there. That's definitely subjective.Overall though, the PlayBook is awesome and I love it. It serves many purposes, it's comfortably sized, some people may complain about the lack of apps because it's not that giant iThing (yes I know the name of it, it simply burns my eyes to see it) but do some research. I've seen some videos about being able to use the Android market in an app but I'm just trying to cover the basics here. AND whether you're extra careful, a little unlucky, or flat out clumsy like I am, and/or especially if you have children, please do make sure to get an Otterbox! AMAZING! It will protect the device and you won't be out of a few hundred bucks...and literally crying over spilled milk!Sorry this is so long, but most of these are questions I had before I purchased that I had to go to several different sources to find out! Hope it helps!", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "An in-depth look", "Author": "Bruce W.", "ReviewID": "R12AIYK8UPK87L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my playbook for over a week now, and I feel like I can finally write an objective review.  I'll have to admit, I am a blackberry \"fan boy\", I have had a blackberry for years now, and I currently have a Bold 9700, so I am able to bridge my devices, but this is an in-depth look with as little \"bias\" as possible.Pros :--------------Hardware - This is truly an impressive piece of hardware.  The construction is fantastic, its easy to hold, its light, and it feels solid in my hands.  The screen is fantastic, very crisp and displays images/videos/text with very sharp clarity.  I loaded up a bunch of pictures on my playbook just so I can look at the beautiful screen.  Everything is so clear, its such a pleasure to look at.  The device is also very fast, launching applications, loading web pages, and switching between apps are blazingly fast.  The camera is also good.  The back facing one is 5 MP and it takes good pictures, and HD quality video (however no flash :( )Ease of Use -  I have to admit when I first tried it out at Best Buy, I had no idea what I was doing, and I couldn't figure out how to do anything.  I've had plenty of apple devices so I thought the missing \"Home\" button was an issue, and it left me scratching my head.  However, once I read up on it a little more, and found you can do everything with some simple gestures, I was hooked.  I multi-task a lot, and switching between applications is so easy, just a simple swipe from the bezel in and you're in a different app.  Bringing up the \"Home\" screen, closing apps, getting to the status bar are all easily done with some simple gestures.  I have to say, now that I've gotten used to it, I love it and could never go back to the \"Apple\" way!Multi-tasking - As I mentioned, I am really used to multi-tasking, so switching between applications is just what I do.  I might read some articles, then browse a site, change the music, and then go back to reading the news.  This is all a snap with the playbook, and the speed at which it does it is seamless.Form Factor - This is a preference but for me the 7\" form factor is great.  I don't really like watching videos on handheld devices (or even my laptop) so this was not a big requirement.  I tried out the Xoom and iPad 2 and I have to say, it was stellar at showing off videos.  But, I felt it was a little cumbersome, and if I wanted to just grab a device, check up on some scores, and look at some news, I wanted it to be easy to hold in one hand.  Also, due to its size, its very easy to carry, and I don't feel like I am holding a laptop.Browser - This is great.  Every page I normally go to loads perfectly, and with the flash support, I get the full web experience.  Also, going to foreign sites renders the characters properly as well.  The only issue I've seen is on some of the more advanced sites, the pages will complain that I am on an \"older browser\" but that also means I am getting the full version of the site, and not a mobile version.Battery Life - I wanted to call this out because before the 1.0.5 OS update, this was a HUGE issue.  The playbook would drain power like nobody's business, and I couldn't even leave it on standby overnight.  However, this was all fixed with the recent update, now I can browse around and use apps for a few hours, and still have plenty of battery.  Just the other day, I left my playbook on standby overnight, and it only drained a few percentage points.  So what was a huge negative has become a positive with a simple update.  This also goes to show you, RIM is committed to releasing updates quickly and getting the OS up to par with other devices out there.Cons :--------------Lacking Apps - This is probably the single biggest complaint you read about, \"not enough apps\".  This is a real issue.  A lot of my favorite apps are missing, including Pandora, Kindle, KeePass (password management) and SSH (sys admin software).  These are key apps I use on my bold every day, and without it, it is a big issue.  However, one recent addition to the app world has boosted the score for me, and thats the blackberry news reader.  I was using GeeReader since that was the only decent RSS feed reader available, but blackberry just released the news reader, and it is fantastic.  I do see new apps crop up everyday in app world, and the Android app reader is going launch soon, so I think this will improve.  (the FB app, word and acrobat apps are great as well)Lack of Connectivity - If you're on wireless, the playbook is great, but without it, it is seriously disabled.  I tried to take it to the gym to try it out while I work out, and I couldn't do much even when bridged.  The reason being, the bridge browser is so slow, I couldn't use it.  This could be partly due to my bold, but still, it was unusable.  I did get tethering to work, but I tried to install an app, and that didn't work either, so there were some limitations there as well.  I think if you're not on wifi, there will be some issues with using it.UPDATE 2-------I mentioned that the small power button was an issue due to coming out of standby, but there's actually a \"swipe\" shortcut.  All you have to do is swipe from bezel to bezel, and that brings the playbook out of standby, so no more fiddling around with the small power button!  Previous comment is below for reference(Small Power Button - When I first read complaints about this, I thought people were being nitpicky since how often do you use the power button?  Well as it turns out quite a bit.  The reason is, its the only way to come out of standby for the playbook.  I setup my device to standby after a few minutes to conserve power, and so whenever it goes to standby, I have to press the power button, and I end up doing it at least 2-3 times to get it right.)UPDATE-------I originally commented about the bad memory management, but it looks like this was also fixed in the 1.0.5 OS release.  Now, when there are no apps running, there is almost 700 MB of free memory, and even with the browser open, I still have 500+ MB free.  This should allow me to run way more apps at a time, and see less of the \"automatic\" closing that I saw before.  Previous comment is below for reference(Bad Memory management - This is a big sticking point for me.  The playbook has 1 gb of ram, so I didn't think it would be an issue but boy is it ever!  First off, when you start up the playbook, there's only 450 MB of memory free.  Then, if you launch the browser, another 200+ MB is gone right there.  So, if you have more than a few apps open and the browser, the playbook will just start closing apps automatically.  When this first happened, I thought pages were crashing because of the flash or lots of media content, but after some poking around, I realized it was because of the \"low\" memory.  Also, when I say \"low\" memory, its not like 50 mb, its more like anything under 150 MB and the playbook could start closing apps automatically.)--------------Overall, I love my playbook, and I want to give it 5 stars, but I just can't.  Once there are more apps available, this will be a solid 5 stars.  Also, for non blackberry users, the lack of a native mail client will be a big turn off.  But because the browser is so capable, it should ease the pain slightly.  The playbook is a great device for RIM to build off of, and I think the next coming months will be key for them, and if they can address some the issues, it will be a true force in the tablet market.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Most capable tablet, a hidden gem", "Author": "SM", "ReviewID": "ROX25DDZWGH2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a medical professional, have an iPad1 and iPad2, and use Windows and Mac extensively.  24 hours ago, I decided to purchase the Blackberry Playbook.  In 24 hours, I've discovered the Playbook with the current OS2.0 is a hidden gem in this crowded field of tablets, and in this Apple-frenzied society.Playbook when it was launched in April 2011, did not fare well because the OS was not good.  In Feb 2012, it has upgraded the OS to 2.0, incorporating the functions they should have incorporated in the first place.  Had they done so, the tablet marketplace may be quite different now in 2012.When the New iPad came out in March 2012, I looked at the marketing.  \"Retina Display\" required all my apps from iPad2 to be upgraded to use the new display.  The upgraded apps have ballooned in size, such that my 32G iPad2 (only 3 months old) has less storage for media.  As much as I've been an Apple supporter in the past, the planned obsolescence with a new iPad coming out every year, means the product life will be only two years before one has to upgrade.  In this case, as apps continually need to be upgraded, and upgraded apps take up more and more room in the iPad, I will be forced to upgrade my iPad every two years because the 32G of today will no longer be enough in two years.Enter the Blackberry Playbook.  Hardware is ahead of its times.  Since 2011, the display has been superior to iPad, with 1080p resolution; the speakers are stereo, there are ports for USB and HDMI, and it comes with front and rear cameras.  Now with OS2.0, it's functionality is comparable, if not superior in some respects, to the iPad ecosystem.\"Browser\" is fast, shows thumbnails of each webpage, and supports Flash.  The built-in \"Messages\" app will take care of multiple e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts all from one app.  Built-in Bluetooth allows for internet tethering to your mobile phone (if your phone supports it), so you don't need a separate dataplan for this tablet.  Those that use Blackberry can also use the Bluetooth to \"bridge\" to the Blackberry phone.  It comes with \"DocsToGo\" which allows you to create \".DOC\" and \".XLS\" natively; \"PrintToGo\" allows your computer (PC or Mac) to send files wirelessly to the Playbook, without having to use iCloud or Dropbox.I put the Playbook OS2.0 through its paces, and found it multi-tasks better than iPad (even with iOS5), so you can run apps in the background while performing other tasks in the foreground.One deficiency is that the Blackberry Playbook OS2.0 does not have native international language input support.  Apple definitely is ahead in this regard, at this moment in time, unless Blackberry rolls that out with the next OS upgrade.Playbook uses the entire surface - the display, the bezel - for gesture control.  iPad only uses the display portion for gesture control.The smaller form factor of the Playbook makes it easy to hold for a long time, for reading, or for web surfing.  The built-in HDMI allows you to plug it into a TV, without having to purchase an AppleTV for $99 or  an Apple Digital AV adapter for $39.The video and sound from the Playbook beats the iPad2; I haven't compared it to the New iPad.The New iPad 16G is $499, 32G is $599, and 64G is $699 (these prices are for the Wi-Fi only models)iPad2, 16G is $399 (Wi-Fi only); Apple no longer sells any larger memory sizes for iPad2.Blackberry Playbook is (as of this writing), 16G for $199, 32G for $249, and 64G for $299.  And if you need 3G or 4G, you can tether it to your smartphone via Bluetooth.Though Blackberry AppWorld has > 60,000 apps versus Apple's >500,000, what the typical consumer uses a tablet for, can be easily satisfied with the number of apps currently available in either app stores.  Granted, Apple has more variety (including their interactive textbooks), and more selection.  However, most people use the tablet to read ebooks, surf the web, perhaps video-conference, watch YouTube or downloaded/purchased video.  Considering the increased memory usage of the New iPad's \"Retina Display\", and the increased size of new apps designed to use the new display, there will be less storage available for media that use the higher resolution.If the consumer is vested in the Apple ecosystem, it would make sense to continue paying for the iPads.  Do be prepared for iPad obsolescence after two years.If the consumer can look beyond the sexiness of the \"Apple\" brand, and were to look at what we truly use a tablet for, the Blackberry Playbook is a clear winner.Just be prepared though... the packaging inside the Playbook's box, is not as sexy or sleek as that of Apple products.  I've kept my Apple boxes over the years.  Looking at the stack on my shelf, I'm realizing I've been paying a premium for those nice Apple boxes.( I do not own any stocks in RIM or in Apple )", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Please read before you buy this!!!", "Author": "Denny", "ReviewID": "R3S2WGJXFUBS8P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I don't ever write reviews for products, this is actually my first review. However, I think that after all I've been through with this product, I had to say something.I received my Playbook in January and I really did love it. I was not a big person on having a bunch of apps or games because I was mainly using it for work and school. It'd be nice, but it is not absolutely necessary. The best part of this tablet is multitasking. You can easily open a browser, swipe up, open your email, swipe up, open facebook, etc. It was 100% user friendly. So I thought this product was great for the price until...It just stopped charging. I have tried leaving in the charger for hours even days. I left in charged into my computer for hours. I even bought a charging station to charge it and it just flat out does not work. The WORST part about this whole thing is, they want me to pay for customer service since I am outside the 90 day range of purchase. I have had this product for about half a year and it breaks downs and they want me to pay them for a problem with their product.It is not just me, just google \"My blackberry playbook won't charge\" or \"won't turn on\" and you'll get a whole thread of people who have the same issue. The customer service is the worst part about it because there is simply a lack of any. I called a multiple numbers and they can only redirect me to the one that cost money. Why should I pay when I have had this product for less than a year and I did not do anything (like drop it) to keep it from working.Don't put yourself through this. There is an issue with the playbook and you can google it all. There is no help on their end so if you have troubles with yours, all you have left is a $200 coaster.

The reviews were so favorable I wondered if RIM had planted the reviewers.  Anyway, this will be my first ever product review.I got the Playbook tonight after work.  I had no problems setting it up. The \"blackberry bridge\" works great. The screen and display are unbelievable. The operating system is intuitive. The glass keyboard (I'm typing this on the glass) is the best I've ever used.

NO native PIM, e-mail or BBM, lack of apps, buggy Bridge support (more about that later), no autocorrect feature, etc.Sweet:  For users, I think reviews frankly miss the point.  The hardware is solid, very cutting edge, and the new OS is a delight to use.  Based on RIM/Blackberry acquisition of QNX (OS that power car media appliances, rockets, and a long list of \"etc\") it is ultra stable, a delight to multitask, browsing the internet is a breeze, even use all those flash based content \"other\" Tablet manufacturers say you really don't need (yeah right!), and now a LOT of new apps and games have been released via App World.Now, Blackberry Bridge.  If you have a BB smartphone, you're in for a treat.  The Playbook connects via Bluetooth to your phone and SHARES your data plan.  Yes, if you have an unlimited plan for your phone you don't need to pay another data plan for the Playbook.  Since OS update 1.0.7 (current OS) most apps can take advantage of Blackberry Bridge as well (think of Facebook, Bing maps, etc).  Also, you get all the PIM features and BBM from your phone replicated in your Playbook.  Whatever you write/send/receive on the Playbook will be in your phone as well.Now to really get your attention, this coming february OS 2.0 is coming for the Playbook.  This should include many new features including native email, PIM features and Android app player.  The last one lets you use Android apps seamlessly on the Playbook's OS (provided they have been repackaged for it, should be a no brainer for developers.  There are UNOFFICIAL ways to get apps to the Playbook though)  which should unleash many apps on the Playbook.  I don't give it 5 stars because of the current development of the OS, maybe if the 2.0 OS was around it would be 5 stars.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Playbook is for Pros", "Author": "Janet \"j huey\"", "ReviewID": "RQUMIFO3IWUET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to post this to due to the negative reviews.  RIM has no plans to ditch the Playbook according to their new CEO on April 10th, 2012.  I also read that Microsoft and Nokia had discussed a joint bid to buy RIM out.  But, RIM knows that they have what the other two companies can not readily do for themselves...a solid enterprise customer base for their smartphones worldwide and a professional grade tablet that rivals the iPad in terms of power, screen resolution, interface, sound quality, build quality, and much more. Like other reviewers, I for one am glad I no longer need to use the button on the bottom of the Apple products I own. The browser on the Playbook is so much better than Safari on the iPad.  RIM needs to market the Playbook better, but it's kind of hard when the Kindles have, for as long as I can remember, been on Amazon's front page (i.e Amazon owns the Kindles).  New apps are coming out regularly.  And, I can just as easily bookmark my most-used websites as icons on the Playbook's main screen or on the browser's main screen.  Plus the iPad is just big...I'd rather carry my small laptop, which has a larger keyboard, around.  My iPad would be collecting dust if it is not being used by my kids for games and Netflix right now because I'm now carrying my iPhone and the smaller Playbook for regular use.  If Apple provides a smaller tablet with a better browser, this may change.  But, that's not in Apple's plans right now. And, it would take a 3rd or 4th generation Amazon Kindle Fire to even catch up to the power that the BlackBerry Playbook has for professional use.

You will likely be frustrated with the lack of apps, especially email and contacts.  Shame on you RIM, this could be a real player and give Apple a little (very little) run for its money.I installed the non-supported side loaded Android player about a month ago. I could no longer wait for RIM to finally keep a promise and release it.  It works and so does Kindle for Android.  However, with their latest OS update RIM disabled the hacked Android player.  Nice.  Thanks RIM.  Actually, its not that big of a deal but come on RIM, release the dang thing already. Its Sept. 13 for God's sake!RIM has the potential for greatness but keeps fumbling the ball.  They are like the Cleveland Browns.  You want them to do well, they show potential and then let you down because of lack of execution.The Good:I just got back from Aruba.  I watched 2 movies on the PB while in-flight.  The screen is awesome and the 7\" size is really nice - very mobile.  Its one of the reasons I bought it.  I kept up with email via Google mail linked to my corporate mail (because remember RIM does NOT have a dedicated email app).  BTW, the missing email app was promised by Jim Balsillie, president of RIM, in April - said it was coming in no more than 60 days.  Came from the friggin president of the company! The guy has no problem lying.Back to the device.  I also used it in the hotel room as a media player and the sound is actually decent. Web surfing is nice and virtually as fast as my new laptop PC.  Again, no issues there.Apps are getting better but no where near what Apple offers. This is not a big deal to me. I don't use it to play games.The Playbook OS is truely a game changer (sorry Apple, it blows away your warmed over iPod Touch OS).  Its solid, fast and a pleasure to work with. No crashes...ever.  It will undoubtedly get much better over time.All in all, I did not miss my PC but then again this was a pleasure trip and not a business trip.However, because the Playbook is such a mixed bag and if I had to do it all over again since its now Sept. 2011, I would wait to see what the Amazon tablet looks like.  It should be coming out by the end of October and is stated to run Android.RIM's lack of execution is disturbing, as well as its deceitful marketing.  However, I have to say I do like the device and I really like the size, the beautiful screen and its solid build. The Playbook is not a cheap piece of plastic. Its really built well.

In fact I could tether it to my phone & use the regular browser or whatever if I am desperate without having the expense of an additional data plan to manage.Lack of apps was another complaint.

All in all, this is a nice feature that competes nicely with a much pricier Microsoft Surface tablet, for instance.The Playbook's digital voice recorder is first-rate. I've made a couple of digital voice recordings off an audio cassette player/recorder connected to some good-quality Logitech speakers and was very favourably impressed by the (apparently) stereo microphone's sensitivity - and, subsequently, the unit's playback via its own built-in stereo speakers (which do give my Kindle Fire's speakers a run for their money in terms of quality of sound output).The BlackBerry World shop is an excellent ecosystem that impresses me as being comparably secure to Amazon's for their Kindle Fire/HD lines of products. You can find additional apps covering anything from medicine to computer games, to general reference texts and apps to enhance the Playbook's functionality. (Since I'm not a gamer, I make no comment on the games available for the Playbook.)The Playbook has Bluetooth connectivity, which means you can connect devices such as a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (something which I've been known to do on occasion), in effect making it *almost* a laptop, just in a deconstructed form. If you live somewhere where people can relate to desktop and laptop computers, you'll see some heads turn in a coffee shop when you set up a Playbook to work almost like a laptop, in part because of its cool, sleek design.My Playbook is ruggedly built and has a very sensitive capacitive touch screen. If you want something that will last you, look at a Playbook and you will not be disappointed.The only really substantive issue I've had with my Playbook is the fact that the versions of Docs to Go and Acrobat Reader use a search engine that works fine for finding recently created and/or viewed files, but for my grad school uses I have to create folders in order to keep both my course work and course materials organised. The best solution I've found is an app that I recall being called File Folders in BlackBerry World for a bit over US $3.00 (tax included) that basically works like My Computer in Windows XP, for instance. With it, files that I email myself and end up on the Playbook's Temp folder (after downloading them) that's buried within the tablet's apparently Android-based operating system (OS). This app allows me to move such files over into the proper folder for grad school.What's rather quirky about the Playbook is the fact that I've had a deuce of a time getting the BlackBerry Desktop and self-install from the Playbook software to work on my netbook's 64-bit version of Windows 8. However, for my old Mac laptop with a Power PC chip running OS 10.5, the Playbook's self-install software worked like a charm, so copying and pasting files for grad school is no big deal all the same.Bottom line: If the only real quirk about using my Playbook is the last item mentioned above, I can say it's a pretty good unit indeed.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Tablet!!!!", "Author": "Gordon Shumway", "ReviewID": "R2K1J0NW758CPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading how these Playbooks will be upgradeable to the Blackberry 10, I did a little research and found MANY favorable reviews for them.  Since the price is definitely right, I decided to order one and...  I am SO glad I did!  This thing is nothing short of fantastic!  Yeah, I've read how people are complaining about the lack of apps, but there are still over 25,000 apps available for this tablet.  That seems small compared to the 100,000+ apps for an iPad, but let's be realistic:  This tablet has its fair share of apps and there is enough in there for everyone!  The size is a nice size which falls between my cell phone and my laptop, and it fits nicely in my hands.  Quality?  Second to none.  This thing is solid and operates great.  It's also VERY easy to use and operates smoothly.  True multitasking at its finest!!!  It can also be tethered to my cell phone, which is a nice feature.  It can link to my cell phone and I can use my data plan, using this tablet anywhere.  Google it online and you will see quite a few reviews about how this blows away the iPad Mini.  Apple snobs dislike this device, but for the rest of us who are not snobs, this is THE tablet to have!!!EDIT:  I have now had the Playbook for almost three weeks and it is fantastic!  I use it every single day and it's working perfectly.  Battery life is great (about 8 hours under \"normal\" use) and with the rapid charger, charges up in a reasonable amount of time.  As for apps, I have quite a few Android apps on it and they are working well.  Yes, it is a little bit of work to sideload some apps, but it can be done pretty easily and they do work.  Kindle?  Installed and working great!  The Blackberry App Store has MANY good apps to download, with many being free or 99-cents.  The Playbook is so great that my girlfriend bought the same one a few days after I did, and she can't put it down, either.  I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of Blackberry 10, but in the meantime, the current V2.1 OS is working great.  I honestly can't find one complaint about this Playbook.

And I definitely have to sit by my Windows Laptop/PC when I need browse websites extensively and seriously.Ok, here is my personal experience which I'd like to share:What I like (relative to other tablets):(1). The form factor. It is portable in reality, yet with workable/watchable screen size. Even it is only 0.9lb and 0.4inch thin, I hope, in the future, all tablets can be made lighter (say 0.1-0.2lb) and thinner (0.1-0.2 inch) if possible at all. For now, this playbook is the best for my personal preference;(2). The web surfing. The browser is very professional and extremely fast. It loads webpages EXACTLY THE SAME as a Windows PC does. No sacrifice being a tablet. This is the first tablet in it's class. Why other tablets couldn't have done the same thing? I don't understand;(3). The multitasking. I like to have a music or video playing in the background while surfing the web.(4). The high build quality and low profile looking. It's neat and looks just like a regular book when put in case. Very well built and very low profile in appearance.(5). The price. Moving forward, $299 will be what I'm willing to pay for a top level quality tablet.What need to be clarified:(1). Blackberry Bridge Vs. Internet tethering.  When you have Bridge setup with your blackberry smartphone, the  Playbook is nothing but a display. So, everything you seem to \"run\" on Playbook is FREE because in reality, it is your smartphone is running. I found in a couple reviews, reviewers said there is a charge from AT&T; for Playbook. That is because those reviewers were using internet tethering, not Bridge, on their Playbooks. I google'd and found the following link to be useful in solving the confusion:<[...]>(2). Apps. I downloaded about 20 apps for kids to play when we were out. I don't feel I am limited in any case. If you would like to be immersed by 1,000,000 available apps but in reality you only need 300, then you will have to keep your iPad for the best possibility.

That being said, I looked around for a while before deciding on purchasing the BB tablet.  Besides the Kindle Fire, you won't find another 32gb tablet from a major manufacturer on the market selling for less than $200.  I considered the Fire, but after reading reviews, determined it is more oriented towards media consumption (NetFlix, Kindle, music, that type of stuff).  The PlayBook is more oriented to business/travel, with lots of integrated tools (like conversion app, a scientific calculator, documents to go, etc).  Since I intend on using my PlayBook for \"mobile computing\" while traveling, it seemed like a better fit.I haven't used my PlayBook exhaustively yet, but I am very impressed by it's long battery life.  I literally took it off charging at 10am today and used it all day to write emails, read magazine articles, Google things, and play chess, yet over 12 hours later still had 60% of my battery.With the site goodereader.com, you can put Android apps on your PlayBook.  This is on top of the BlackBerry \"App World\".  That means you have access to the most apps of any tablet, since Android has the most and you get BlackBerry's on top of that.The predictive text on the PlayBook is excellent- it greatly speeds up the process of writing things.  I would actually say I am nearly as quick in composing things on the PlayBook as I am by typing on a keyboard.Altogether, the \"controls\" on the keyboard are fairly intuitive.  They are similar to what the Palm Pre used, and mostly involve \"swiping\" things.  You can have quite a few things running concurrently, and just cycle through them as is convenient for you.The internet access on the PlayBook is almost exactly the same thing as using a computer.  I can do my Spanish homework using my PlayBook, even though it runs through some special program.  I like how it also gives you the option to read a page as an article, so you don't have to adjust the size of the page to make it fit properly, or worry about inadvertently clicking something on the page.So, I highly recommend the PlayBook.

Everything I own is mac, from iphone to macbooks to Apple tv, but I just couldn't justify the enormous price tag for an ipad that's essentially a larger iphone. When I saw the playbook on sale at best buy I was skeptical at first... RIM products have never been on the top of my list since 2005, and I do have an outdated bb bold for work, but after playing with the playbook for 20 minutes I was impressed!  The release of os 2.0 adds both email client and calendars that can be synced from work, school, and Google Calendar makes it very convenient to have on a tablet. Dates on the calendar vary in size depending on how busy you are, making it very convenient for all those busy bodies out there. The browser is the best I've ever used on a tablet, way better than the safari I'm used to on the iphone. Some people complain that loading full web pages on a seven inch screen is too cramped, but I think it's perfect and the flash enabling makes viewing content like YouTube links a breeze. I like it so much that I'm considering getting a blackberry as my next phone! Apple products may be easy to use and convenient, but the playbook made me realize just how much is lacking in the ios platform.  I could never justify paying the exuberant price for the ipad, especially since I don't game much and just wanted a device that can read word documents and connect to the Internet. If you're cross shopping this with the ipad, trust me when I say it's worth it as long as you don't mind the lack of apps (really, most apps on the Apple Store are children's games anyway), the smaller screen, and imo, A far more intuitive interface and web browsing experience. Its made me glad that I shook the Apple disease and realize how much has been missing from their products. If you are a budget minded individuals who needs a device for viewing work documents, emails, schedules, and flash enabled sites, you can't go wrong with the playbook. Oh, and the small buttons up top aren't really a big deal breaker either.  Trust me when I say you'll know when your device is turning on by a nifty feature called the lcd screen...Some small gripes, but no deal breakers:1) currently no netflix or hulu+ support. Can be sided in from android marketplace, but who has the time to figure that out?2) no Google maps app. Important for those who do sales and need to keep track of their territory. Instead, uses bing maps which is about as intuitive as a slide rule. Can access Google maps through browser though, so not a big deal3) wifi only. Can be tethered via smartphone, but won't tether with an jailbroken iphone4) small power button, doesn't take away from the experience as a wholePros:1) calendar syncing and interface2) supports virtually any email client, can sync with a corporate blackberry without saving content to the playbook. In the corporate world this is a godsend, since most companies protect their content like bees to a hive.3) browser: tabs, flash, quick responsive scrolling4) graphic user interface puts ios to shame5) document viewing and editing, including power point, pdf, word, etc., wireless printing6) price... Think about it. Half the price of an ipad minus useless apps plus better tablet experience?  You'd be nuts or a teenager to pass on this dealReally very happy with this device.

It's worth a try though, to raise awareness on this awesome product.I'm a mechanical engineer, and whether by training or just personality, I study the crap out of everything I buy. I looked for tablet PCs for my side business of personal coaching for a long time so I wouldn't have to haul around my nice (but large) laptop. The things I needed most were: clean audio/video recording to record coaching sessions, productivity applications (I use lots of Excel tools and keep client files in Word), note taking tools for business and personal use, and a good browsing experience so again I wouldn't have to lug my laptop around everywhere at home either.Does the PlayBook provide solutions for those demands? Absolutely.You don't need 45,000 apps to have a rich user experience. This was never a gaming device for me, and I don't really understand why so many people are buying tablets just for gaming and browsing. I do own a BlackBerry smartphone, my first one, but I now love the brand, and the PlayBook has so far only enhanced that love. It doesn't even take the Bridge to make it very functional.The apps that are available for this (which is expanding now that the Android player inherent in OS 2.0 is out) are powerful. Splashtop Remote Desktop Manager gives me a great option for storing most of my files at home and connecting to it when I need it, and keeping only critical files on either my phone or the tablet itself. The Bridge remote in 2.0 is pretty slick, and I feel like if I ever have to make a presentation in whatever capacity, this will be the tool of choice. Docs to Go is a perfect addition for this product. They work simply, beautifully, and effectively.My one complaint is that I clogged up my RAM a few times due to the fact that sometimes when you swipe an app to close it, it doesn't seem to remove it from the memory. Maybe it's been fixed in 2.0, but I just make it a point to check my free memory every so often and if it's low with no apps running I just restart. Hasn't happened since I discovered the issue though, so likely it's fixed or just a bug of some sorts.Overall, at $500 this is probably still too expensive. Get it for $200-$250 and it crushes the snot out of the Kindle Fire.

I purchased this Playbook 16 G over Black Friday at $199 which to me is a no brainer over the Kindle Fire (which I almost prebooked few months back).Here's my reasons (for now):--7 inch size, very portable and light weight, will fit even in most pants pocket.  I used to travel with my netbook that weights over 2 pounds--primarily used for internet surfing, emailing in any Wi-Fi hotspots I can find.  Even at that weight it is not easy to lug around and turn on instantly.  Now with the Playbook (PB) with a leather protective cover weighs 1.1 pound, smaller dimension than netbook and turn on from sleep mode instantly.  For others who debate screen too small and prefer Ipad bigger screen-- that is strictly a personal preference.  I just dont see it suitable for me because it is not portable enough.  And 7\" screen size is big enough for me when I've been carrying an IPOD touch for last several years which I still use and love but screen a little small for surfing.--HD camera and screen.  I've browse through other 7 inch tablets: Acer Iconia A100 which was on sale recently for $189, but the color is just not comparable.  Samsung Galaxy is beautiful but cost few hundred dollars more.  PB is just beautiful in videos and have dual speakers on the sides (not the back that can sound muffled).  With front and back camera potentially I can do Skype when PB gets upgrade, and if it never gets upgrade-- la de da, who cares at $199.  Also can you imagine discreetly trying to take picture with IPAD 2?  With PB it is easier to do.-- which brings up the comparison with Kindle Fire.  There are already tons on comparison on google and I wont repeat it.  But I think from what I have researched so far at $199, PB is a steal for me.  Fire is sold at a loss too at Amazon but it is a win win for the consumer because it seemed like a sub-$200 tablet is the price point for most consumers as attested by first the HP tablet sold out and now the PB too (and of course the Kindle Fire is selling like hotcake too).It is a no brainer for me to get PB over Fire for the same price because it has dual cameras, microphone, a true multi-tasking browser, bigger RAM (1 gb vs 500mb)and storage (16 g vs 8 g).  And if in Feb PB gets upgrade and can access Android market, then it's a bonus for me.  In the meantime, not a dealbreaker.--Ease of use.  After reading a few pages into the Crackberry forum, I gleaned enough useful information for basic navigation and the more I use it the more I like it.  Learning curve is not that steep and it is a marvelous little device.  For those who have already purchased the PB and complained about hard to use, I said give it a chance and read up few tips on the forum and it is a wonderful device.-- Battery.  Great.  Charge fully with the wall charger within couple hours.  The USB-mini USB cord I found out dont really charge or charge at such slow rate I pretty much dont use it.  And battery is a much bigger capacity one over the Acer Iconia that I was considering at one time and can last pretty much whole day on frequent use.  When put on sleep mode, battery really does not drain much at all-- which brings up the loudly complained point of \"POWER BUTTON\" being way too small-- well, just dont turn off power button, put on sleep mode then you really dont have to fuss with small button.  For me, it is not a problem cause using my finger tip I can turn on or off with no problem.-- No native mail etc.  Not a problem for me since I just use my Gmail, AOL through the browser when I get to Wi-Fi spot, same as what I've been doing with my netbook.-- No Kindle app.  I already have a Kindle which measure exactly as my PB with Leather cover, the duo plus my IPOD touch make great travel companions and keep me occupied and entertained for hours on end.  And as I said before when BB do upgrade and include Android market then watch out a WHOLE NEW WORLD of potentials.  In the meantime, I am very happy with my sub-$200 device.-- Tethering.  Not a feature I am currently using but intriguing for me.  Read that a lot of user like it to tether to their phones to avoid additional monthly charge.The only CON so far which has been resolved:  For about a week since purchase I had connection problem with PB at home.  Connection was intermittent even with the WI FI signal four bars (strongest).  Cant figure out and talked to numerous techs at Blackberry.  Talked to my ISP and even Cisco who makes my router.  The strange thing was PB worked beautifully outside of home in various Wi-FI hotspots (Starbucks, McDOnalds, Whole Foods etc).  I deduced it may be a ROUTER problem and the last tech at PB had me reconfigured the Cisco Valet Plus router to wireless G as compared to Wirelss N and now PB worked at home without any problem.  And multi-tasking is a joy to use.I gave 5 stars for the solidly built device with a great OS that has a understated elegant look.

As of this writing, the 64g version is heavily discounted by as much as $450 and considering the quality and rising number of available applications, it is an excellent deal for anyone planning to use a portable tablet.As compared to the others, the Playbook's screen holds up in terms of brightness, crispness of text and smoothness of media playback. Two front facing speakers provide the volume and high fidelity not found in the more expensive units. The QNX OS employs more touch commands and one has to be more aware of this at first but just a few days of constant use will make the user feel at ease as the experience is retained in memory.One should experience the ability to record video at high definition, the screen is just the right size and brightness that allows the viewing of the scenes in real time. Playback is equally as impressive and video files can be easily exported as attachments to e-mail and sent via wi-fi.Though not heavily advertized, the Playbook is capable of communicating in two different frequencies because of its built-in dual band wifi hardware.

I own the Bold 9930 and from what I could tell, the playbook was going to extremely complimentary.Pros:* The small and compact design is great as a travel companion.* I own the 32GB playbook, which I've found to keep a great deal of music and info. I routinely use it as an external hard drive and copy files from my desktop to keep with me while I'm on the go.* Having the docs to go app has been great. Although they are not the full versions, they provide enough firepower to get the job done.* The bridge application serves as security for the playbook. Other Wi-Fi only tablets require email account set up. For instance, you set up Gmail and whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network your email is refreshed and calendars and contacts will reflect the latest changes. With the playbook, if you have a blackberry phone, you simplify bridge the two devices and you have instant access to everything on you phone. My phone has all emails, contacts and calendars so there is no need to duplicate efforts.* Now the playbook has access to many of the popular android apps. Because I'm not terribly interested in every app, the ones of necessity were readily available to side load on my playbook.* Using my bold as a remote control. I find that typing on the actual phone is a bit faster than typing on the notebook itself. To each his/her own, but when you've been busing a blackberry for a long time, you find that typing on it is second nature. I'm sure I'll come around to typing on the actual playbook for smaller tasks.* Being able to expand the memory of the PB by increasing the memory SD card in my phone. Since you can access your phones SD card, you can literally have 32GB on the phone and 32GB onboard the PB. The capabilities become vast with that amount of storage space available to use, and this is on the go too.* Using the \"view on my PB\" feature. How many times do you find a site that you wish you could view on a larger screen?  With this option, you can always utilize the PB full Internet browser to view anything of interest that you first received on your phone.Cons* Since the apps primarily come from the android platform, there isn't always seamless compatibility. For instance, dropbox will not all uploading from files stored on the playbook.* Music - this is a bit of a personal beef, but with all the music I have on my phone, I'd love to just make a playlist on my PB using the music from my phone. Currently, you can only access one song at a time from your phone to your PB.* Can only open one type of docs to go document at one time. For instance, you can only open one excel file at a time. You can have more than 1 excel file open. If you open a 2nd file, it will close your first. Wish you could have multiple excel files open at once.* Bridge destroys the battery life of the phone when using the tethering option. I guess you can't have it all.* Video store could stand to be updated.All in all, the PB does what every other tablet does. It hasta fast processor, front and rear camera with enough megapixels to take great shots, a video recorder, The ability to watch movies and listen to music, and has a great internet browser with flash.  I understand the beef that the app store is lacking. If you're into apps, and the apps your looking for can't be side loaded, then your right, this may not be the tablet for you. But if your looking for a tablet that has a fundamental ability to make you more productive, allows you to kill some time with movies and a few games, let's you read e-books and has the option to expand the storage space (via owning a blackberry phone) for an affordable price; I guess I don't know where you can wrong. Like other tablets, if you own the tablet makers phone, you'll be able to take advantage of a few more bells and whistles. No doubt having a blackberry makes this tablet more viable. Don't fall for the hype that there are no apps. And don't fall for the hype that this isn't a powerful tablet. I think for your first tablet, this is the way to go. You learn what you like and what you would like to change without breaking the bank. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how useful this tablet can be when you put it to task.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry PlayBook is a near Home Run", "Author": "Chris J.", "ReviewID": "RMTXT8LQQQTJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its a shame to see Research In Motion's lack of innovation in support, marketing & advertising, and business dominance cause the company to take a backseat to other phone and tablet companies. At one point RIM was on top of the world. Everyone had a BlackBerry. They were a great company with a fantastic and functional smartphone. The trackball was cool. Brickbreaker and BBM were all the rage. Now, they are a company that's lost 80% of its value, has continued to see declining sales in the US and worldwide, and it rapidly losing its kung-fu grip on the business enterprise consumer. Its a shame. But this is what happens when a company fails to adapt to change, fails to recognize the threat of competition, and fails to innovate and keep its once loyal consumer base happy. That all being said, the PlayBook is a near Home Run. But likely few will be left to realize it.  Enough with my RIM rant, on to the device.As for the PlayBook, if you are looking for a 7\" ultra-portable tablet that has bulletproof construction, an incredibly simple and user friendly interface and OS yet CPU-like accessibility, fantastic web browsing with Flash support, and the added ability to Bridge up to your BlackBerry smartphone for a fraction of what other tablets cost...then the PlayBook is the tablet for you.PROS:By now I think a good number of people out there have or at least know the basic benefits and functions of what tablets can do. I will only go over the Pros and Cons that set the BlackBerry PlayBook apart from the competition.-Size: you are either a 7\" tablet person or a 10\" tablet person. At first I told myself I would wait for RIM to release a bigger version. After the realization that could be years (and doesn't look like its going to happen until late 2013 or 2014 if at all) I decided to buy the 16gig PB. I fell in love with the size. Small enough to fit in just about any bag comfortable, use inconspicuously, and hold and type smoothly using both thumbs when holding in hand.  Size is going to be a personal preference in the end but I think the 7\" size is a pro in my book.-Web Browsing: Hands down the best out there. Full Flash enabled websites make internet surfing almost identical to being on a desktop/laptop. Bill paying, media playing, online shopping, or just surfing is incredible. This is probably the main reason I bought one in the beginning. I almost never go anywhere in my house without my PlayBook because of this. At the dinner table and realize you need to pay that credit card bill (assuming you aren't stuck in the stone age and paying by check)...no problem. Want to quickly change your Fantasy Football team and watch that video snip about the latest injury report while watching the game...no problem. Reading outside on your deck and come across a word you don't recognize and want to lookup...no problem. No longer do you have to wait an hour and a half for the laptop to boot up.-Freedom from Ecosystem: some may consider this a downfall but I see it as a major positive. BlackBerry doesn't force you to become part of their ecosystem. There is no iTunes that is forcing you to use their system to download songs in a weird, unlockable format that may cause issues for other non-Apple devices. Loading songs or documents onto the device is and has always been as simple as plug the device in and drag-and-drop what you want to the folder on the device just like an external storage device. The charger slot is a mini-USB. The HDMI slot is a mini-HDMI. There are no $100 Apple-to-USB or HDMI adapters required. Its the $3 universal adapter on Amazon. If you want to use Amazon's Cloud player for your streaming music, you can...unlike Apple.-Guts and Multi-Tasking: without boring the non-techie geeks out there, the guts and OS of this tablet are phenomenal. I will just say that the processing speed, ability to multi-task between applications, screen clarity and resolution are top-notch. I have never once had a complaint about speed or the tablet functioning slow. And right now my 16gig is almost completely full with music and files. The OS which will soon be coming in an adapted version to BB's new phones in 2013 as BB10 is an OS-killer in my opinion. Its their last chance but all early indications is that they nailed it. The PB has the ability to multi-task between multiple applications unlike any other tablet. Think about having the ability of swiping between the video player, Internet Browser, Map, Weather app, Game app, an Excel spreadsheet, Calendar, PDF file, and Slacker Radio app all at once with each app running in the background and not causing a slowdown to processing. Incredible. Makes doing multiple functions at once on the PB a breeze.-BB Bridge: this is a bonus Pro for those with BB phones. The ability to Bridge the phone to the PlayBook over bluetooth is really cool. You can access all files through the PB and also add/delete/change things in the contacts, calendar, memos, and tasks on the phone.  So if you are in an airplane and want a bigger screen to work in your calendar for example, its a nifty function.  You can also use your phone's internet connection to tether to the PB to allow internet when outside of a wi-fi zone. Another big bonus since there isn't a 3g/4g version of the PlayBook in the states. (They just launched a 4G/LTE in Canada)CONS:-Lack of App Support: this is lone elephant in the room and its a big one. BlackBerry just doesn't offer the apps on the PlayBook that are available on Droid or Apple. It has gotten much better and there have constantly been talks of bringing Droid apps into the system but I'm still holding my breath. This is shocking also because some of the \"no-brainer\" apps are not available on PB. No Pandora app...really?  Ok so use Slacker Radio...it is basically the same thing. No Bloomberg app...really?  As someone in financial services I use that one everyday on my phone. Now granted, the PlayBook's internet experience is so spot on that many apps are unnecessary but that's not an excuse. Sure I can go to full website but sometimes I want the App only.-Lack of Sales and adoption: this isn't a huge con but its worth pointing out. Because of the lack of app support above and a variety of other reasons, there aren't very many PlayBooks floating around out there in circulation. I remember the 2nd quarter the PlayBook was available they SHIPPED less than 250,000 of them to retailers like Best Buy when Apple's iPad SOLD 12 million that same quarter.  This means good luck trying to use some of the apps that are for PlayBook only. Video Chat...I bet it works great since there are two high quality camera eyes on both sides of the device but I will never know because I'm the only person I know on the planet who owns one. (truth be told, I actually did see someone walk by me in the airport with one...only time I have ever seen another one and I thought I should have said something or went to high five the random stranger as weird as that sounds.  That's how \"un-trendy\" they are and how few are out there.)Bottom line is the PlayBook is a near home run. If they had more sales success and adoption from the consumer base therefore having the app support, this device would be as perfect as any tablet could be right now. They could nail it on their next one but that's an uphill battle. For now, I am sticking with my PB and actually just bought my 2nd one. My 16gig I bought 6 months ago will go to a family member and I am keeping the 64gig for myself. I liked the tablet at full launch price but I love it at half off. It is basically a steal. I just hope RIM as a company is still around in the next few years so they don't stop supporting the device, I don't know if I can live without it.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "H.M. \"Captain Buddy Ahearn\"", "ReviewID": "R2OW3VZB55GAZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for months and it's difficult to imagine going back to my iPad 2. I haven't picked up my iPad since I bought this thing, no exaggeration. After playing with every tablet out there I could get my mitts on, I decided on the Playbook, and it was the best decision. I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size, the app store has everything I need and want, and, it goes without saying, the browser squashes everything else out there. The size is perfect. Even the on-screen keyboard (which I usually don't like) is smooth as butter. Uploading audio and video files from my desktop computer is easy as pie, and, as long as the audio track to the movie is in MP3 format, everything plays. There is no stuttering. The true multitasking is magnificent. Hats off to RIM for building this, the king of all tablets. I payed $300 for the 64GB version, and I'm still slack-jawed at what a steal this was, especially compared to Apple's offering. BlackBerry Bridge is brilliant. Both cameras are stunning. The display is stunning. The design is pure genius and accents functionality; imagine: front-facing stereo speakers...who'da thunk? A hardened rubber backing so it will not slip...who knew? Like all RIM products, it flawlessly does what it's designed to do, every time, all the time. The iPad 2 is like a French Bulldog...adorable, soothing, fun and a great way to get compliments. Not exactly the smartest dog out there, but a great attention-getter.

Then I found the volume is too low. I have to put in the Max position all the time when I watch Amazon instant movies. The speaker sounds poor. Not just too low to hear, but poor quality. The Amazon silk for the Web Browsing is painful to use, feel too much framed, more like a handhold device, such as a smart phone. touch response is not always work. hard to check battery level ... etc. I called Amazon customer service about the volume problem, but someone suggested me to use earpiece. After the call, I decided to return it. For Kindle Fire, it may have a good hardware except speaker part, but poor software user interface except for Amazon.com part. I'm not going to keep a device just for shopping with Amazon.com. I can not even watch Amazon's instant video comfortably due to the cheap speaker. Additional, the 5GB storage is too small to use. It is useless and nothing to do with my original plan.I bought a 64GB Playbook from blackberry website this month with a very good price. It exceed my expectations for both of hardware and software sides. when I do Web Browsing, compare with a phone like Kindle Fire, it's more like a normal high end laptop with pretty high speed. just smaller size and easier to carry during the trip than the laptop, the tool bar on the screen is very easy to use and hide, well designed user interface, quick touch response, because of the interface, I feel Playbook having a much bigger screen during web browsing than the Kindle Fire. Great hardware, very well built, great display quality and great SPEAKER quality. 64GB is big enough for me to load some movies during the trip. I tried to play some .flv and .f4v video files without any problem after I bought a $0.99 app MovieFlvPlayer. I feel missing the most is there is no Skype app yet. I wish it will come very soon. Then it will be a perfect device for my original goal. Camera, game and GPS parts are the bonus for me, ( I haven't try GPS yet). Only $100 more than the Kindle Fire. A supper great buy!

The Playbook QNX based OS is ridiculous, you can run 20 different programs, videos, games, etc, simultaneously and they will not even slow down a bit.  The buttonless swipe navigation one ups the iPads single button navigation in simplicity of design.Portability.  I can bring this device anywhere I go, no problem.Build quality.  This thing feels like rock-solid, much more so than any other tablet out there.Blackberry bridge.  If you own an iPad and an iPhone, you still either have to pay for a 3g plan for your iPad or you are limited to wi-fi areas.  With the Playbook and a Blackberry smartphone, you have internet, for no additional cost (provided you have an unlimited data play, as I do).  I can easily access all of my emails, calendar, etc.  When someone is calling me, a pop-up notification alerts me with the Caller ID information (which I love).Web browsing.  Due to seamless flash, Adobe AIR, and HTML5 integration, you can watch HD online video content on most websites (it is capable of video playback on virtually all sites, but some have blocked the content on this device, for reasons which I do not understand).  Sports highlights, streaming tv episodes, etc.Graphics.  One realm that is well supported in the App World is gaming.  Games like Madden NFL 12, Dead Space, and the list goes on, all have the BEST 3d graphics of any mobile device on the market.To summarized and address the lack of apps.  I thought it would be a big issue at first, and I hesitated to buy it.  I was incorrect.  Let me ask you a question.  When you use your desktop PC or laptop, are you bothered that there is no native facebook app (the Playbook had one before iPad, but I never use it)?  Or twitter app?  Do you find it to tedious to log in to news websites like Huffington Post, Time, or CNN?  Of course not.  Those companies don't need to develop native PC or Mac OS applications, because they have full featured websites.  They are bookmarks on your browser.  As I mentioned earlier, I never use the native facebook app. Facebook is a website, and the best way to experience it is as a web page.  The Playbook renders all of the websites you love just as it would on your desktop PC.  You can scroll through submenus on with your thumb, you can pinch to zoom many map websites.  Integrated multimedia plays back as it would on your browser.  You can play all of your favorite online flash-based games.  There is no reason to use a native app for most of these content providers, as the online version is superior.Here is a case in point to finish it off.  I live in the Minneapolis area.  the iPad and iPhone both offer an app to consume their content.  On my desktop, I use the web to access what is called the \"electronic edition\" of the newspaper.  It displays the actual print version of the paper, with clickable articles and zoom, and a great user interface to navigate through the paper.  I far prefer it to the website content.  The apps for the Star Tribune simply format the same content on the website for your device.  Since neither one of those has flash capabilities, they cannot run the electronic edition of the newspaper.  Android devices can load the electronic edition, but the flash is half-baked and the navigation features don't work properly, rendering it useless.  On my playbook, I can read the print edition of my favorite paper from anywhere I like, including non-wi-fi covered areas.I am not saying it is superior to other tablets in every way, but it has many advantages, and with the release of the new OS, those will only be amplified.  I suggest you pick one up immediately (especially if your a blackberry owner.

I looked at a lot of 10\" tablets and decided they were just too big.

I purchased a 32MB model five weeks ago and have gone through a couple of OS updates as well as a couple of  tickets with RIM tech support to work through early bug issues.  At this point the device and OS (v1.0.6.2390) are operating very nicely and I am experiencing no technical issues at all.I generally concur with the positive reviewers of the Playbook.  This is a fine piece of hardware, and its positive virtues are well documented in earlier reviews.

So I was a bit wary about going with a Playbook instead of the tried-and-true iPad for my first ever tablet.Well, I'm happy to report that the Blackberry Playbook is a winner.  The 7\" 16-gigabyte model meets my needs for reading PDF documents, YouTube and video playing, surfing websites, and other basic Internet functions.  The tablet is sleek and sturdy.  Navigating it is pretty easy, even for a novice like me.  The Hi-Def video is fantastic.  I love hitting a PDF or YouTube file and having the tablet automatically know that Acrobat Reader or the video player are the ones needed to execute.  All done with touching the screen, a nice change from having to 'click' all the time on my desktop or laptop.  Battery charging and life are excellent.  I bought the 16-gigabyte model and it's fine for my needs, but if you store lots of (HD) videos (I don't) you might want the 32- or 64-gigabyte models.  If you are mostly into much smaller Word or PDF documents or websurfing, this model will be fine for you.  My only quibble with the hardware would be that 2 gigabytes of RAM would be nirvana (2nd generation model?) since the OS uses up a chunk of the existing 1-gig of RAM it comes with now.That said, there are some problems.First, the POWER button is ridiculously difficult to turn on unless you have long/sharp nails.  Could they make a bigger/longer power button/strip that wasn't a fraction of your finger size ?  A minor inconvenience, but a notable one.Second, the customer service reps in the U.S. were terrible.  They were barely more knowledgeable than me.  They kept putting me on hold and talking to supervisors or going to PC's to Google the problem and see if someone on the Blackberry boards had an answer.  And my problems were not more advanced transfer or data stuff that longtime Blackberry users might experience.  I couldn't get the Playbook to show up on my PC for some data transfers, did not know I needed to download the basic Blackberry Desktop Manager before doing the transfers, and also had a problem with the WiFi.  The CSRs didn't seem very knowledgeable about the basic layout of the tablet as icons below the 3rd row were 'hidden' but they didn't know that (we both though they had disappeared).  Fortunately, I eventually got a tech-savvy CSR from of all places Singapore who sounded like he had spent more than 15 minutes playing around with one.  I got more done in 30 minutes with this guy than 5 hours with the American CSRs.  Ridiculous.Third, and this relates to my CSR problems, the Playbook needs more in-depth tutorials on how to navigate and find things.  They basically assume you are PC literate and have been using a Blackberry smartphone for years.  Well, some people interested in a tablet may only have been basic web surfers with minimal PC expertise.  Apple products are easy to use for first-timers -- my 75-year old dad switched from Windows to Apple and he's not a PC expert -- and if the Playbook wants to grab sizeable tablet market share they have to make this not only a winner for the Blackberry smartphone crowd but for the 1st-time purchasers who have never bought a smartphone or are not living on their tech devices 24/7.I'm giving the Playbook 5-stars for the device itself and the user interface, though the number of apps compared to the iPad might make more experienced tablet users give it 4-stars.  I'm also giving it 1-star for customer service, the tutorial, and lack of an intro manual (no, I didn't want a 50-100 page manual to read but then they need to have more tutorial and 'how to' stuff on the Playbook for newbies).  The only bright note is that you get 90-days of free customer service, so that gives you enough time to get up to speed on your own and find out if you need help from their Tech Support (if you do call them, try and get Singapore right away !  lol).Overall:  5-stars, with an asterisk, that being the CSRs.  RIM needs to realize some people buying their product are very non-tech savvy.  I know they have had a stumble the last few years but you can't skimp on customer service or ease of use (just ask Dell or Nokia).", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Purchase of 2011", "Author": "Ryan Gable \"rcg7347\"", "ReviewID": "R56H90AJ4GX6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a year I've been wanting to buy a tablet.

Quick and responsive menus and software makes web surfing, email and typing a breeze.4. All this can be yours for a bargain price right now.CON1. Lousy app selection.  The BB app market is pretty close to laughable, and the much vaunted ability to load Andriod apps is very overblown.  Android app selection for Playbook is very limited and requires a decent amount of technical understanding and patience to pull off.2. Uncertain BB future.  It remains unclear whether the company will be around in a year to support the device.  A lot is riding on their delayed new OS for phones and tablets.  You are taking a risk buying one now.3. Multimedia is a pain.  I like lots of music and video choices.  This is where I was particularly disappointed.  There aren't many streaming radio services that work on playbook, though there are some. Crackle, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon video mostly don't work (yes some have found hacks, but don't count on it). Loading music files was also a pain.  With no SD slot, it has to be done via a wired connection, though it does support Windows 'drag and drop'.For me: the bottom line is if you are a die hard Blackberry addict, take a shot at this. Returns with Amazon Prime are easy, the price is low for the features you get, making it worth a try. I like Blackberry, but am not dead set on it. Mine's probably going back for an Andriod tablet.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Value, Super Performer!", "Author": "Tommy Tom Tom", "ReviewID": "R2EPGE3VMCXQ0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the Blackberry PlayBook tablet very much (I have three of them) and overall, my experience with it has been stellar except for a hiccup at the beginning. More on that later. There are several great tablets in the market and I place the PlayBook among them. I think the PlayBook is the most under-rated tablet in the market today and for consumers, that is a good thing. They are inexpensive now and are an exceptional value for your money.The PlayBook is still the first generation PlayBook (I do not consider the 4G model second generation). Yet, its hardware and software are still as relevant and stands up to the new generations of the major tablets in the market. In other words, while the hot-selling tablets have released new models and are in their second or third generation, the major capabilities and features of the PlayBook have not been surpassed by them, such as dual HD cameras, front-facing stereo speakers, etc. The initial major problem with the PlayBook, i.e. no native email,  has been resolved.Anyway, here's why I like the PlayBook:1. True Portability- the 7-inch screen size is great. The unit is small enough to fit inside most of my jackets' pockets.2. Unobtrusive- it is not much bigger than some of the 5-inch smartphones and you can pull it out in public, like at a restaurant without being obtrusive.3. Cheap! - You can get the 64GB model for as low as $199.99 (recent Office Depot sale). It may even get lower during the year-end holiday sales.4. Promise of Things to Come - When the BB10 phone is introduced early next year, PlayBook owners can expect a major software upgrade that will have very promising capabilities and features. It's like getting a new tablet for free! BB10 may be revolutionary.5. Great Stereo Sound - the speakers are dual front-facing speakers for optimal sound.6. Easy Connection to TV - the micro-HDMI slot makes it so easy to connect it to my TV so I can watch movies, etc. up to full 1080p on the bigscreen. Believe it or not, I bought a 6-foot HDMI to micro-HDMI cable online for only a dime! With shipping, it came to about a dollar. I have since bought a 15-foot cable for a really good price online, so I do not have to get off the couch.7. Cheap Optional Rapid Charger - Since no one seems to want the PlayBook, I have been lucky to find PlayBook accessories such as the Rapid Charging Stand, Rapid Travel Charger and leather cases at clearance prices. Each of the rapid chargers can charge the PlayBook at least twice as fast as the standard charger which came with the PlayBook. I timed it and was able to charge it from 0% to 100% in 2 hours and 50 minutes. By the way, some users have stated that if their PlayBooks drained down to 0% battery charge, they could not recharge it until they found a solution to this problem online. When my PlayBook drained down to 0%, I immediately plugged in the rapid charger and took the opportunity to see how long it would take to fully recharge. In my situation, I did not experience any problem charging at all. Perhaps if I left it at 0% considerably longer, I might not have been able to charge it. That, I will not know because I do not intend to let it drain to 0% again. Incidentally, the PlayBook gives an audible and visual warning when battery level is down to 9%. In my experience above, I dismissed the warning and continued working until it suddenly shut down by itself, indicating that battery level was at 0%!  That was when I immediately plugged in the rapid charger and I was up to 100% again in two hours and 50 minutes.These rapid chargers use the magnetic port (the one on the right with three metallic \"dots\") instead of the micro-USB port for charging, thus saving wear and tear on the micro-USB port, which has been reported by some owners as having fallen apart after some use, rendering them unable to charge the PlayBook unless they bought one of the two optional rapid chargers. Incidentally, I used the micro-USB port to charge using the standard charger for more than six months (before I got my rapid chargers) and I do not see any damage on the micro-USB port. I always made sure the cable was not putting any stress (weight) on the port. I think those who reported damaged micro-USB ports were not careful and put stress on the port. Likewise, I am also careful when using the micro-HDMI port to make sure the port is not unduly stressed to minimize wear and tear or damage. The HDMI cable can be heavy, relative to the port, so make sure the cable is supported and no weight stress is put on the port.8. Dual Cameras - one in the front and one in the back, both high-definition (shoots 1080p video).9. Great User-Interface - I like the swiping gestures and the multi-tasking capabilities. It is fast and smooth. I did not notice any lag when multi-tasking and having several applications open at the same time.  Web-browsing was great, and felt like I was at my computer with the full web experience, except with a 7-inch screen. Thanks to Flash and HTML support.10. Good Battery Life - Battery life depends on what you are using it for and can vary very much. I find that I can get at least five continuous hours under heavy use, such as constant web-browsing or watching movies. When listening to Slacker radio (where the screen turns dark while the music plays), I measured the rate of battery drain at 6% drain for the first two hours of use. I kept the radio playing for an additional two hours and it showed a drain of 12% over four hours. Thus, it appears the drain is quite constant. If we extrapolate, then on a full charge, one can potentially listen to Slacker radio continuously for 33.2 hours before the battery is depleted.  The volume throughout my test was not at minimum, but at approximately 75% of maximum. So, the battery can last from 5 to 33 hours, depending on use. 33 hours is a lot more than even the \"up to 10 hours\" stated in the literature for the product. Some may not be happy with the 5-hour minimum, but I am plenty pleased. That's more than three average length movies of 90 minutes each.Additionally, I measured battery drain while it was put in \"standby\" mode, with wifi and bluetooth off. Standby mode avoids the almost three-minute boot-up from complete power off. By the way, the long boot-up time is a security measure of the PlayBook. It checks everything to make sure your tablet is secure.  When in standby mode, just swipe from the top downward and it wakes up the PlayBook. You're ready to go instantaneously. I did not use my three PlayBooks for more than a day to conduct this test. They were left in constant standby,  other than when I checked battery levels. Two of them started with 100% battery charge and the third one had 65% battery charge at the commencement of the test. Let's call them A, B and C, with C being the 65% one.  After 19 hours, A had 93% battery charge left. After 24.5 hours, it had 91% left. After 24 hours, B had 92% battery charge left. After 36 hours, it had 88% left. After 12 hours, C had 58% charge left and after 26.5 hours, it had 55% left. I started the tests at different times and checked battery levels at different times. That is why I cannot give the same interval information for all three tests. But you can clearly see that the \"standby\" mode does not drain the battery rapidly. You can leave it for days on standby mode and still have significant battery power when you need it.11. Blackberry Bridge - I have a Blackberry phone. If I do not have wifi service for the PlayBook, I can use my phone's data plan. I bridge the PlayBook to the phone and can access the internet. No additional charge from the phone company since I have an unlimited data plan. No need to get the 4G PlayBook and no monthly data plan.12. Screen display is very clear even if it is not full 1080p. It really does not matter when the screen is only 7 inches that it is not full 1080p. I do not think anyone can tell the difference when the screen is only 7 inches. If you connect the PlayBook to your 1080p bigscreen TV, it is capable of displaying 1080p video, and the cameras can shoot 1080p video.At the start of this review, I stated there was a hiccup early on in my experience with the PlayBook. Hic... here it is. Within a couple of days after doing the initial set-up with my first PlayBook in November 2011, I tried to change the volume on the PlayBook but was not able to do so. I called up Blackberry customer service (\"CS\") and explained my situation. I explicitly told CS how I was depressing the volume control keys to try to change the volume and asked if I was doing it right. I was told I was doing it right and since it was not working, CS subsequently wrote me up a repair order and sent me the box and documents to send the unit to their repair center. While we were on the telephone though, CS sent me an email to have me agree to the terms of their repair service. I agreed by emailing them a response to their email, though I told CS I did not read the agreement. After all, it was clear if I did not agree to their agreement, I would not be able to send the unit in for repair.After I responded to their email, I had a heated discussion with CS because they said that if the unit could not be repaired, they would send me a replacement unit. I asked if the replacement would be new and CS indicated it would not be new but a refurbished unit. I explained my unit was brand new and just opened two days prior to the call and demanded that if my unit was not repairable, that I be sent a new unit. CS remained steadfast in their position that only a refurbished unit would be sent. I was very disappointed with Blackberry/RIM at this point.Anyway, when I got my unit back, I checked and was relieved to see that it was my original unit and not a refurbished one. But when I checked the volume keys, I was shocked that they still did not work! I was too angry at this point to call up CS again. Since everything else worked, I just calmed down and used the PlayBook and got to learn its features and thought I would call CS later. I liked the product, but was highly disappointed the volume keys still did not work.After a few days, I played around with the volume keys again and after some attempts, lo and behold, they worked. I then determined what I had done differently and repeated it and it worked again. It turned out that you cannot depress a volume key and hold it to change the volume. You have to depress it and let go immediately. Then the volume bar appears in the middle of the screen and then you depress a volume key again (and let go immediately) to raise or lower the volume. So it just turned out that I was doing it wrong and the repair was probably not even necessary because it was not defective. CS was not able to tell me that I was not doing it right when I explained how I was trying to use the volume keys when I called the first time!One good thing did come out of that repair job though. The power button was flush with the top panel making it a little difficult to depress the button. While I did not complain about it, I noticed when I got the unit back that the button was no longer flush with the top panel but protruded a little, making it a lot easier to depress the button. They fixed it without my asking for it to be done.This incident though, is a big negative for Blackberry/RIM because I would have been a very disappointed customer if my unit had a real problem which was not repairable and I was given a refurbished unit as a replacement. No one likes his or her brand new product to be replaced by a used unit when it has barely been used a couple of days! Moreover, sales of the PlayBook were so poor and the company had excess inventory. I was appalled they could not keep a customer happy by promising a customer a new unit if the unit was not repairable. I would not have expected a new unit if I had used it for more than say, thirty days. But two days? Come on, RIM!I have had occasion to call CS several more times for various other issues, none of which were major. While I have spoken to one or two CS representatives who were knowledgeable about the product, my sense is that more than a few of the CS representatives are not very knowledgeable about the product. They frequently put me on hold while they consulted other personnel about my problem or reviewed a manual. I have noticed this more since about April this year when I had to call in after I got my second and then my third PlayBook. I wonder if in the process of cutting back staff at RIM, they let the more knowledgeable and longer tenured (thus presumably higher-earning) CS representatives go and kept the newer and less knowledgeable staff. I have had occasion to spend about an hour and a half on the phone with CS and yet not be able to get a solution to my problem. Fortunately, I use a speaker phone when I call so I am not that ticked off at the holds that I have to endure as I am able to do other things while I wait.I strongly suggest that if you have a problem with the PlayBook that you do some research and try to find a solution first before you call CS. Crackberry.com has very informative and helpful forums. Amazon reviewers also offer some very helpful tips and solutions. I also hope RIM will conduct more training and educational sessions for their CS staff to make sure they are familiar with the product. While at this time I cannot give a glowing account of customer support, I must say that the CS representatives were polite and they did try hard to help. I would say they have helped with 80% of my issues. As to the other 20%, I was able to find solutions online myself. Perhaps CS could have helped with them eventually, but I guess I got a little tired and impatient after being on the telephone so long that I told them I would try to resolve it myself and if I was not able to, I would just call them again.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Blackberry PlayBook. You get a lot for your money at current prices and it performs very strongly and impressively. Most negative information circulating about the PlayBook was due, in my opinion, to its premature release in April 2011. At that time, it was somewhat of a \"half-baked\" product. That is no longer the case, thanks to software updates, but I see many in the industry, including professional reviewers, continue to bash and denigrate the PlayBook. I suspect some do that because they are beholden to RIM's competitors. RIM is not blameless, as I hardly see any marketing done for its products. It keeps getting hit and insulted but just does not seem to want to fight back. It seems it is only layperson reviewers who sing the praises for the PlayBook while RIM itself just sucks up the punches.I stand by the PlayBook, but a word of caution - if you must have a zillion apps for your tablet, Skype and Netflix, then look elsewhere. The small number of available apps compared to the numerous apps for the hot-selling tablets do not bother me. As it is, other than a few I use regularly, I hardly use the hundred or so apps I have downloaded onto my PlayBooks. PlayBook owners are still hoping Skype and Netflix will be available in the near future, but I am not holding my breath. I believe that it is not that the PlayBook is incapable of operating Skype and Netflix, but that it is Skype and Netflix that have not released apps for their services for the PlayBook. If I am mistaken, please correct me. Skype is owned by Microsoft, and Netflix may be beholden to the hottest seller in the market. I believe there may be competitive reasons for depriving the PlayBook of these two services. It just goes to show how formidable a tablet the PlayBook really is, and competitors know it. Imagine what it might be with Skype and Netflix.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly nice tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"barryem\"", "ReviewID": "R1IPC9UYUI1NVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the Playbook several days before the release of OS 2.0, thinking that if the new OS was successful the price might go back up.  I've now installed OS 2.0 and, while it did add some nice features, including many that people had been clamoring for, I'm not sure it's really much better.  That may change as more Android apps become available for it but that's what it'll take.That said, even with the original OS it's a very nice tablet.  I use a number of tablets so I'm able to compare them.  This is certainly among the nicer ones in many ways.The biggest advantage it has over the rest are the really fine and loud speakers.  It's the only tablet I've seen that's louder than an Ipad and it's a lot louder.  And the sound is a bit clearer and cleaner as well.  This is with the speakers.  I haven't used the earphones yet.  I haven't felt any need.The screen is excellent.  It's not the kind of pop-out color saturation the Samsung tablets have but it's a bright, natural looking screen that's as good as any tablet I've used and better than most.  And it's the only screen I've used that's actually okay to use outdoors.  Some can be seen outside, sort of, if you don't mind it looking a bit washed out.  This one, even on a bright sunny day, is easy to read a book on.  They did the screen right.The OS is simple and intuitive and everything you need is always right there and never in your way.  It's easier to learn than IOS and easier to use, once learned, than Android.  The problem with the OS is that it's not very customizable.  You can change the wallpaper and put icons where you want them and that's about it.  Even IOS is a bit more customizable.  With OS 2.0 they did add folders but they're large and clumsy while IOS's folders are graceful and the same size as other icons.I think the changes in OS 2.0 made the interface a little less intuitive than it was, but it's still much more straightforward and easier to use than the rest.  For the non-technical person who doesn't want to spend much time learning the ins and outs of a tablet, this is certainly the best choice.  For the tinkerer (like me) it's still easy to use and I have to be content with that.  They already did a lot of the things I might do, so it might be said to be pre-tinkered. :)One pleasant surprise is that it plays every video I've tried to play so far, and I've tried a lot of formats.  it hasn't failed yet.  I was expecting that to be a problem since I use a lot of formats for various things and I thought that until a good Android video player became available it would require me to convert videos.  So far I haven't had to.  It plays them all.The quality of the apps has been very good, as have the prices.  Most of the Android and IOS apps aren't available but it's easy enough to find replacements and they've all been just fine.  Installing OS 2.0 caused a few problems with apps but updates have already become available for all the ones I've had problems with and they're all working fine now.  There aren't all that many apps but so far everything I've needed has been there, usually with a few to choose from, and they've all been good.  Hopefully now that Android apps are appearing there won't be any exceptions to that down the road.One thing they didn't do and should have with respect to Android apps was make them easy to install from sources other than the Blackberry App world.  The way it works is that developers have to convert them to be run on the Playbook and then upload them to the Blackberry app store for vetting.  That makes it all nice and safe and cozy but the fact is that a lot of my favorite Android apps have been converted by people on the internet and are available for download but there's no simple way to install them.  There is a way that I haven't tried yet but I will, that requires doing things that a lot of non-techie people won't be willing to do.  They should have made it easy to just copy over and install these apps.  The risk, doing this through legitimate sources such as xda-developers, is small.Transferring content to the Playbook is possible via Wifi from any Windows PC (and probably Mac and Linux as well).  You just turn on the Playbook sharing mode, give it a password if you choose, make note of it's IP address and then open a Windows Explorer window to that IP.  The Explorer window opens on the Playbook and you can simply drag and drop files to it.  This is the easiest way to transfer files that I've seen on any tablet.  It also works in the background.  No special mode is needed for the Playbook.  I've transferred videos while playing a game or watching a video on the Playbook.  This is the first tablet I've seen that takes multi-tasking seriously.The web browser is excellent, but so are those on IOS and Android.  Which is the best of those is just a matter of taste.  They're all very good and any advantage one might have is always temporary.  They're really all pretty much the same.  If anything, IOS is a bit behind without Flash but even that's temporary since Flash is going away.After saying all that good stuff about the Playbook I think I'm still faced with the fact that it's kind of in a world of it's own.  It doesn't really mesh with the rest of the world in the many little ways that Android and IOS do.  For the working person who isn't already using a Blackberry phone and working in a Blackberry environment and wants a tablet for utility purposes, this might not be the best choice.  For someone like me who wants it for consuming media and playing an occasional game and browsing the web it's an excellent choice.  I'm retired and a gadget lover and I play with these things and this is certainly going to be among my favorite toys.  If I was still working and I wanted the most useful tablet I think I'd go with IOS or Android.Barry", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Playbook is becoming very addicting.......don't listen to people...", "Author": "Amish R.

I think RIM did a very good job on the design and build of the Playbook but they clearly rushed the product because the software is nowhere near done.HARDWAREThe Playbook is a 7 inch tablet that is very well built. It is powered by a dual core 1ghz processor that does an exceptional job of keeping up with everything I threw at it. The display is very bright and vivid with great viewing angles. I can't say for sure what kind of glass they used to cover the LCD but I can tell you that its pretty durable, after 4 months of ownership I have yet to notice any scratches on the screen. The Playbook's body is made of mostly plastic but they coated it with a soft touch rubber (matted) that does a good job of giving the Playbook a premium feel while holding in the hand. At the bottom you will find a micro HDMI port, a micro USB port for charging/syncing, and a magnetic charging port for the optional dock. On the top you will find the power button (that is a pain to press), a volume down button, a play button, a volume up button (in that order, also tough to press but not as bad as the power button), and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There is also a 3mp front facing camera for self pics and video chat (which only works with other Playbooks, at the moment) and a rear 5mp camera that is capable of recording HD video. The Playbook's speakers are actually on the front located to the right and left of the display (a very nice touch in my opinion). Because of its smaller size, I found the Playbook a joy to use with one and two hands. Although it is a little on the heavy side for 7in tablet I never really found that to be an issue. One of my biggest gripes with the Playbook is battery life, RIM claims that the battery life on the Playbook is just as good as the iPad but I will have to call BS on that claim. After charging the Playbook to 100% and letting it sit in standby over night the Playbook will have lost 10% of the battery life by morning time (my iPad stayed at 100%). I find myself having to charge my Playbook much more than any of my other tablets (iPad, iPad 2 and Flyer). I enjoy taking the Playbook on vacation with me for videos and net surfing because it is so portable. Videos look great on the 7in screen but I found it annoying that the video player does not allow me to scale the video to full screen (UPDATE: to scale video to full screen, use pinch zoom technique). The speakers are fairly loud with little distortion and because they are front facing the sound comes right at you. The camera takes pretty good photos when there is good lighting, I must say that this is the best camera on any RIM device but I must also say most Blackberry cameras suck. As long as you don't plan on replacing any traditional camera with the Playbook then you will be fine.SOFTWAREThe Playbook runs RIM's next generation OS called QNX and I am totally impressed. If I had to pick my favorite mobile OS this very instance, I would pick QNX. It is very obvious that RIM blatantly ripped off WebOS when they designed QNX, however, I feel that they did it better. The one feature that QNX has over every other mobile OS out there is true multitasking. With the Playbook you can play a video, jump into the browser to surf, reply to an email, and download an app all while the video is still playing in the background. And best of all...there is very little to no lag. During my video play back test, the playbook was able to play both mp4 and avi HD (1080) videos with no problem. Navigating through the OS took a little getting use to but once you overcome the learning curve it becomes second nature (I find myself asking why iOS or Android don't do this). To launch an app, you tap the icon like any other OS but when you want to switch to another open app, all you have to do is swipe left or right with your finger starting from the screen side bezel. Same thing with going to the home screen, you swipe from the bottom up from the bottom bezel or from the top bezel down to access the settings. Once you try it out you will see how easy it is to navigate.So why am I not giving the Playbook a 5 star rating when I love the hardware and software? Thats simple; RIM screwed up by launching QNX when it wasn't ready. There is currently no native support for email, calendar, and contacts (these features are coming with QNX v2.0). These are must have features for any tablet to function properly because without them the tablet is nothing more than a media player that surfs the net. RIM tried to make up for not having these features with the bridge program that allows your Playbook to access email, calendar, and contacts via your Blackberry handset. However there is one problem with that approach...not that many people have Blackberries anymore. RIM successfully limited the Playbook's market with that move. The browser on the Playbook is good but it is not the best mobile browser out there (Mobile Safari is still my favorite). There were many instances in which I was fighting with the browser to get it to do what I want (I usually lost and went to my iPad), for example the keyboard will come up and go away, come up and go away when I need to input text or clicking on links that does nothing. The one thing that the browser does best is displaying flash content. Even though other browsers claim that it can display flash content (i.e. Android), non of them does it was well as the Playbook. I can't recall any instances where I was met with the \"no flash plug in\" error like I get on occasion with my Android devices.Despite what RIM claims, please do not buy a Playbook if you want apps. The Blackberry app store is extremely lacking in app support and whatever apps they do have in there usually suck. This may change with the new update because with the new update the Playbook will be able to run Android apps. But that will only work if the developer decide to port the app over to the Playbook.I will update the review once QNX 2.0 is released.Final verdict: (hopefully RIM gets it right with v2.0 because there is potential here) 3.5/5 stars", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Obsolete Perfection", "Author": "heraldofgabriel", "ReviewID": "R304WVXOPT0EZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, Research in Motion (Blackberry) is going under, the Playbook is no longer being ordered from the factory, and it isn't as \"modern\" or \"up to date\" as, lets say, the iPad, or Samsung's Galaxy series....but so what? Beats the heck out of the Surface (Microsoft) and gives HP's defunct Tablet parity. And what does one want out of a tablet, anyways? I'm not going to do any financial transactions or data research over an unsecure Wi-Fi network, nor any major speadsheet work, movie editing, photo editing, slideshow building and creating any specialized quantum mechanics investigation or nuclear exploration. All I'm going to do is, either at work or on vacation, read and respond to e-mail, view the internet, take a few pictures and perhaps compare some prices while shopping, and maybe check my destination weather. For that, the Playbook is perfect and much cheaper than a refurbished iPad, or cheaper than the virtually unusable (I just don't get it) Surface.Right size, right price, great picture, stupendous operating system, perfect weight, easy to learn and use (hear that, Microsoft?) - it just works exactly the way I want it to work. Yeah, it may be obsolete...so what! I have 4 Intel Cord 2 Duo powered laptops that I got second hand because they were obsolete and ran Windows way to slowly. Dumped Windows, loaded Linux, and these \"obsolete\" notebooks scream!

However with the few knowledge I have about it so far I must say that in my opinion it is among the best tablets out there. I dont know how they did it but this thing is a real work horse capable of doing a lot of things at the same time with no negative effect on it's performance. I mean you can open games, pictures, email, app world, web browser and watch a 1080p video with no difference at all. Tell me how many tablet can do that. I have never used an Ipad but I heard it is the best out there however I just sold an Asus Transformer that I had for six months and I can assure you that the Playbook is more superior when it comes to performance in my opinion. The screen quality is spectacular making web pages appear almost real. 1080p videos and pictures are just the way they are suppose to be and if there are any short comings I have not and may not be in position to notice them. The sound quality put the Asus Transformer to shame. Sometimes I wonder if the two front facing cameras are not surround sound. Build quality is great with a rubberized back that care less about where you put it. I used to prefer 10' tablet but after using the Playbook I may have changed mind. It fits just fine in my hands. The keyboard is the best touch screen qwerty keyboard I have ever used. Well laid out, very responsive and just gets the job done with little to no errors.CONS: The biggest issue and drawback for the Playbook is the lack of apps. I'm not talking about having hundreds of thousands of them but making sure the popular apps that people cannot live without are available and work well. The lack of an sd card slot may be a big con to those with the 16GB or even the 32GB version but not much to worry about if you have the 64GB version like I do. I just cannot see myself needing anything bigger than that in a tablet.OVERALL I have more good things to say about the Playbook than otherwise. I must also say if Blackberry 10 upgrade becomes true then I plan to keep this tablet for a very long time.

I was so glad when the BB PB was released because I had tried other touchscreen smartphones thinking that I would join the touchscreen revolution. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with each one. The BlackBerry PB offers so much along with the stability of it's operating system. I decided to write this review because of I'm fed up with the online articles and reviews from people who aren't BlackBerry smartphone users. It was obvious when BB designed the PB they had their current users in mind and they also had in mind the future capabilities of the operating system and how both the phone and tablet would work together. BB has always been for the business professional and not about games. And I'm cool with that because I get things done with it. And if I want to play games or let my children play games the BB PB app store offers enough game apps to satisfy (many of the android apps are now available) So let's go down the line,1.)I love that it bridges seamlessly with my smartphones files, contacts, calendar, messages, BBM, tasks and memos. If I add or make changes on either device it's automatically updated on the other.2.)I can't say enough about the sharp high definition screen. The size of the PB some would see as a negative but I deem it a plus. It fits anywhere and when held in the vertical or horizontal position typing is done with ease. But if that isn't enough for a BB phone user, now you can type using your BB smartphone keypad. Yes, no need to purchase accessory keypad.3.)Also, there is no need to purchase an additional Internet plan through a mobile provider due to the Wifi and bridge capabilities. When you can't access a Wifi connection, no worries it bridges through your BB smartphone browser (no addt'l charges)Although I have the option to purchase a tethering plan I have no need.4. For presentations... This connects to most displays and tvs and renders hi-def picture quality every time. And your able to use your BB smartphone as the remote control for presentations from anywhere in the room. My son and I have played the NFS undercover race car game with it connected to our HDtv and I must say it was really cool. The tablet is the steering wheel. And it's the perfect size.5.Unlike other tablets and pads, PB has flash capabilities. PB has adobe reader for PDF which was lacking with my smartphone unless I buy it from the app store. So that's awesome.6.)Ability to transfer and buy music to PB, create, edit and download word, excel, and powerpoint files, chat with PB users, print to go feature, social apps message integration, camera and video, access to any of my BB smartphone files, and the list goes on and on.7.) the battery life is great. Sometimes I can get a full 2-3 days out of a full charge. and it charges quickly on the charger that is provided with it.I almost forgot I downloaded the Kobo ebook reader. And I'm always reading books on my playbook and I also have Kobo on my desktop if I want to read my books on a much larger screen when I'm home. I've had my PB for about 5 months and I'm still finding new capabilities everyday. I bought a new desktop a couple months ago. And because the PB does so much I may only use my desktop once or twice in a week. I am more than pleased with this purchase. If I were you don't let the discounted price fool you into thinking this isn't a great quality product. I purchased the 16g from radioshack at $199 and later a 64g directly from BB $299.If you dont own a BB smartphone, I think you will be pleased with it's functionality but you will get the most out of it if you are a BB owner. And unfortunately there is so many people struck on a product that creates products that force their user have to purchase new hardware every few months or so without any discounts. And what do you know? they conveniently have a new product being released just in time. But if the consumers don't see it, all I can say is more power to that mega company. I can only hope they will wake up before it's too late.(this review is being posted via youngentreprenuer's playbook)", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this thing", "Author": "Donald E. Fulton", "ReviewID": "R39G41HO1KHG9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this thing!----- (update) ------Tip to improve WiFi receptionThe 2.4 Ghz WiFi antenna is in the upper left hand corner in landscape orientation. Wrapping your hand around this corner to hold Playbook, as I like to do, reduces WiFi signal strength a lot (a bar or two, factor of x100 or 20 dbm), which can be the difference between getting online or not when traveling. A simple trick to get good WiFi reception while still holding Playbook with the left hand is just flip the Playbook over so the 'Blackberry' logo is on top. This puts the most commonly used 2.4 Ghz WiFi antenna on the right.Check out the 'SANOXY Bluethooth Keyboard for iPad'. It's a very inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with Playbook.---------------  7\" screen size is fine, sharp as a tack (viewed with reading lens of bifocals), bright and colorful, sound good, screen responsive to touch. Swipes easy to learn.On browser homepage  On my desktop browsers I have all my frequently visited links in a single custom .html file that I set as my homepage. To me a custom .html homepage is essential, it makes bouncing around the web fast and easy. I first tried copying my custom .html file into the 'Document' folder, but found it was not visible under 'Document' icon, but later going backdoor I got it installed as the browser homepage. Here's the procedure:Type into browser:  file:///accounts/1000/shared(note 3 ///)This brings up a simple file manager that allows you to see what files are in memory and even to launch them. In the Document folder was my custom html homepage file, which I had earlier copied over via USB. Tapping the filename loaded it into the browser, and holding my finger on it allowed me to copy the filename (via the copy box). Finally going into the browser settings I was able to paste the filename into the homepage window. Now every time I start the browser up comes my custom homepage.Another neat trick is to have alternate start links for the browser on your home screen. This is done by clicking the star+ button and selecting add to home screen. For example I have a icon that will start the browser at the New York Times and another for local radar.On media filesMP3 files can simply be copied over and will play. Video files are more difficult. I have a library of captured .flv files and captured TV shows in .ts format, some of which I would like to put on the Playbook to view when out of WiFi range. However, neither of these file formats is supported directly on the Playbook. In principle there are two options: copy over the file and use an app that does on the fly conversion, or two, preconvert the file to a supported format (like .avi or .mp4). I experimented with both.  There are several apps that claim to allow you to play .flv files on Playbook. I bought one for $0.99 and while it played .flv files, it was not clean (position slider did not work). I tried a couple of converter programs, which you run on your desktop before downloading. The best (by far) was Freemake Video Converter, not only is it free, but it's simple to use and will convert a batch of files in one shot. I found it shrank the file size of .ts files, which are initially quite large, by roughly x3 and expanded the size of .flv files, which are initially small, by roughly x2.-------------update  My tests show HD (1080p) videos taken by Playbook are quite large, about 6 Gbyte/hour. I found running them through Freemake Video Converter with NO change in resolution, file type, or video quality reduced file size to 2 Gbyte/hour, a factor of 3. Very handy if you want to keep lot of Playbook video stored on the Playbook.-------------Before converting a lot of files I did several tests comparing file formats and resolution. Freemake Video Converter makes it easy to reduce file size by lowering resolution. Tests with a sharp HD video showed no difference that I could see between 1080p and 720p on this small screen, so I decided to go with 720p. This resolution reduces .ts file size by a factor of 4. Reducing quality to TV level, still very watchable, reduces .ts file size by a factor of six.Quick tests of various formats (avi, mp4, wmv) showed no significant difference in quality or file size and all seemed to play fine on Playbook, so I choose avi and began converting. This turned out to be a mistake. Not one of the first three converted TV shows (1 hr) would play correctly on Playbook. One refused to open and other two gave an error when the slider was moved, though all played correctly on my desktop. The only reason I can come up with is that Playbook has a problem with long files in avi format. My quick tests had been with short files. I then noticed that it says in the Blackberry document, 'Supported Media Types on Blackberry Tablets', avi. wmv, and mp4 are \"supported\", but the \"recommended video format for local playback\" is mp4. So I reconverted the same three TV shows to mp4, also lowering the resolution one step to 720p, and now all played fine on Playbook. So my recommendation is stick with mp4, which is the format Playbook uses for its own videos, and reduce resolution to 720p (1280 x 720).WiFi file transfer  A neat trick to easily transfer files to Playbook from your computer over WiFi (no cable!) is to put a shortcut to Playbook on your Windows desktop. Set the 'target' of the shortcut to either the IP of your Playbook (found under About, Network) or the 'Tablet Network Name', which you can change (found under Storage and Sharing, Network properties) preceded by \\\\ (two backslashes). When you click on the shortcut, Explorer opens and Playbook will appear as a Network device. Click the Media folder and you now have access to all Playbook media folders. For this to work the Playbook 'WiFi Sharing' setting (in Storage and Sharing) needs to be ON. Transfer rate is a little slower than with a USB cable (about half), but perfectly usable.(update) For some non-transfer operations, like file rename, I find USB more reliable than WiFi.Html files, pdf files and File managerThe Blackberry (so called) \"File Manager\" doesn't show file details, and critically (for some weird reason) it hides local html files, though it does show local pdf files and allows you to open them. Real file managers are available in App World. A pretty good basic file manager (free) is 'AIR Browser' and better is 'File Browser' (a buck).'Air Browser' and 'File Browser' provide a way to work with local html files, they show them and will open them in the browser. Once open in the browser local html files work well, all the internal and external links work. I find it frustrating that Blackberry doesn't provide direct support for local html files, because I have a whole library of such files that I want to use on the Playbook.PrivacyA useful app for file privacy is 'File Shield' (buck). It provides a simple way (without passwords!) to hide videos, photos, and documents. In the app directories and individual files can be toggled between private and public. When set to private, files and directories effectively disappear, visible neither to Blackberry applications nor file managers.Bugs and weirdnesses  I bought just after OS 2 release and my OS upgraded to 2.0 when my new tablet initialized. Here are the bugs and weirdnesses I have found in a week or so of use.-- I initally wrote that my volume up/dn buttons had never worked and assumed it was a software bug because I read someone else reported volume buttons stopped working after an upgrade to OS 2.0. See comments where Ronald kindly set me straight.-- Video application has a couple of drawbacks, one is no folders. In the pictures application if you organize picture files in subfolders, the opening screen shows only the subfolders. Not so with the video application. You can put videos in subfolders, but the video application still displays all your videos files on the opening screen. Primitive and inconsistent. Even more surprising the video application displays videos (with the formats it supports) regardless of the folder. Put a video in say, Voice folder, and it still shows up under Videos.-- The video application provides two display views: Downloaded Videos and Recorded Videos. Videos uploading to the Camera directory are displayed in the Recorded Video view ordered by the file time stamp, so some separation of videos is possible. Videos in the Downloaded Videos view are ordered alphabetically, No other sort appears to be possible.-- Document mode of the browser does not work right in portrait orientation (tested with New York Times articles)-- a Hotmail text message in browser would not finger expand-- Adobe's pdf reader come installed on the Playbook, but it is not well integrated with the browser. When a pdf link in the browser is clicked, instead of just opening the file your only option is to download the file.-- 'Power Off' is a built-in Blackberry app with just three power buttons that are the same as under the battery icon. 'StandBy' in the app does not put the tablet to sleep (as it should), it does a ReStart (locking up your machine for two minutes)! You have to wonder just how much testing Blackberry does when a trivial app like this does not work right after a major OS upgrade.-- As I discussed above, it appears the video player has a problem with long .avi files, though this format claims to be \"supported\".-- With Blackberry emphasis on security it is surprising its OS does not directly provide support the hiding of files.-- After a week of use the browser crashed (gray screen) requiring Playbook restart to fix it.-- On my 2nd day with Playbook it crashed (it first refused to open files, then it hung with Shutting down splash screen displayed). There is a way to hardware reset the Playbook, equivalent to holding down the power button on Windows desktops, but I had to search the web to find it. It's hold down three of top four buttons (vol up, vol dn and power) for 10-15 sec (or until you see red led). This restored my Playbook to good health with no loss of data. I took off one star (5 => 4) for the volume buttons not working (whoops, see comments) and for a system crash in two days of use.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "IPAD SAY WHAT???", "Author": "DARNIELL THOMAS", "ReviewID": "R22Q1C7M95KGQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I JUST GOT THIS PACKAGE YESTERDAY AND I AM ALREADY IN LOVE WITH IT.THE BLACKBERRY PLAYBOOK CAME TWO DAYS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.

Lee", "ReviewID": "R1ZUFYJE64MVR1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up the Playbook last week and have been using it all week, and here are my thoughts for those who may need some information about it. And as the title states, I am NOT a person who has a career that a tablet would be useful for; I'm not taking business trips, not always on-the-go, etc. I bought this purely as a consumption device for very common leisure tasks.First, I got it in a Staples in Canada, where they sell the Playbook for 199, 249, and 299 for the 16, 32, and 64 GB respectively. For THAT price it is an absolutely great buy. That said, it definitely has one major drawback; the apps.Now I know many people have made the argument that most apps on the Apple Appstore are useless, but the \"App World\" for the Playbook is seriously lacking; there is a limit to the \"quality vs. quantity\" argument.Some key apps that are missing that I've found are: Skype, Netflix, Kindle, a proper VNC app, proper todo apps, and of course, email and calendar (though they did say it would come in an update, OS 2.0). Again, I am a casual user; I want to watch movies and shows on this device, and it baffles me that netflix has not developed an app for such a beautiful device. Same applies for all the apps I've mentioned; I can't talk to people on skype without some broken web-browser workaround, I can't read the many books I've bought on kindle, I can't use VNC for remote desktop without some glitchy app, etc.It REALLY is a shame, since everything else about this device is PERFECT. I've never expected the hated Playbook to be this great, but it really is. From the multitasking to the brilliant gestures to switch apps/return to home screen, and the easy to access WIFI/Bluetooth that Apple refuses to put on their device, I am very happy with my purchase. I'd love to give it 5 stars but again, the lack of apps is disappointing.

The upgrade should defuse many complaints about the product - the native email and calendar features are superb. Some Android apps were ported over to the Playbook App store - altho I have no idea which ones they are. I don't own a Blackberry phone and have no intentions of buying one. I bought this to read email on the go, to have GPS reference (available from App store, need WI-Fi access if you don't have a Phone w/data service) and, hopefully, to be able to read digitized books. So...my biggest complaint is the lack of a feature for reading DRM-protected books. You can get an app that does a nice job on the classics available from Gutenberg, etc., but I can't even download books from my library - at least I haven't figured out how yet. That and the lack of a Netflix interface seem to be the biggest complaints. The suite of apps that comes with the PB provides everything else I need.To answer some of the issues raised here - I have no problem with the \"on\" button. I can see how someone with very large fingers might have trouble, but I suspect the eraser end of a pencil would work fine for those who are digitally challenged. And, once you turn it on, there's no need for the button again. It will put itself in standby, and you just swipe the screen to wake it up.  Also, I have no complaints about battery life - it seems OK to me, but i have not had experience with other devices for comparison.I think RIM could have a real winner here if they can get past the idea of using it to sell more BB phones. I don't think that will happen. If they develop it as a stand alone product with lots of potential, then the PB might get them on the right track again.Quick update: I have found the Overdrive app that allows me to download library books - so I would add half a star to my rating.Update #2 - also found a website that is converting free Android apps to PB format. I now have a Kindle reader and it works quite well -- occasional freezes, but nothing I can't live with.

My only major beef with it is the current lack of a sufficiently featured PDF reader.The details of my experience:Hardware, Setup, Performance & Quality: Initial setup of the PB was easy with setup wizard. Note that you'll need access to a WIFI network for this setup to be effective. The PB operating system sports a very elegant and easy to use interface; you interact with it via touch screen finger taps, moving gestures, and a pull-up keyboard. The touch screen is pretty responsive, though there are some buttons with a small fingerprint size that can require precision, resulting in the occasional unsuccessful tapping. Video graphic quality is excellent, the UI is beautiful and HD videos play crisp and smooth.Apps: The PB comes standard with about two dozen apps: a web browser, camera, OfficeToGo, facebook, youtube, twitter are just a few of the main ones. The blackberry appworld allows you to download more, many of them free, some of them very cheap (one to two bucks a apiece), and some nicer ones more expensive. For instance, the PB doesn't come with a file browser, but appworld provides the Air browser for free and several other file explorers for pretty cheap. While the PB appworld library is probably nowhere near as extensive as the IPad's, there are nonetheless apps for the vast majority of needs out there, and certainly a lot of great business and investment related apps.One fascinating feature for those with a Blackberry phone is Bridge, which allows you to link your phone and the PB via bluetooth. This permits syncing of email, calendar, and other data that is already on your phone. Additionally, there is a limited web browsing capability through Bridge, though it is pretty slow. You can also tether your PB's internet through the higher data stream of your BB phone, though depending on your carrier, there may be a separate data plan and additional cost required for it.I think PB's greatest chink in its armor is the lack of a good PDF reader. I have a lot of PDF references for my job, and this shortcoming was a real arrow to the knee. It does ship with Adobe Reader, but this version of the reader is virtually featureless, allowing paging and scrolling through a PDF with no option to search for text, create or find bookmarks, or make notes. There are e-readers available in appworld, such as Kobo, but none that can open PDFs. In search of a compromise, I found converting PDFs to EPUBs to be only about 20% successful. The end result is that the PB is a poor solution for interacting with PDFs at an enterprise level, which is really surprising considering the market RIM has been catering to for the past 15 years.But... the future is nevertheless promising for the playbook. Despite the reduction in production and pricing, RIM is continuing to develop and upgrade the PB operating system. Next month, the new OS2 is supposed to be officially released, and with it the Android Marketplace, which should open up PB to a wider variety of apps, including a number of superior PDF apps. I'm really looking forward to that day. There is also a lively community of users and app developers at the blackberry and crackberry forums, with tons of great information that can lead you down a rabbit hole of tweaks, jailbreaks and troubleshooting methods for the PB.A final word: considering the price of a new 64gb IPad 2 as of this writing (about $600 before tax/shipping), I'd say the Playbook is a hell of a deal. I'd also recommend shopping around and looking for the best price on the 64g PB. Best Buy discounted all models to the same price (and I am told is almost out of stock of the 64gb), as did RIM. I ended up ordering from RIM because they didn't charge me shipping or tax, the grand total was 299.99.EDIT (2/18/2012): I discovered by looking around the crackberry forums that the Repligo PDF reader is available as a sideload app. This requires your PB be updated to OS2 beta, and then you have to sideload the program BAR files using an installer like DDPB, but once that's done, this reader is amazing and provides all the features that I need to utilize my PDFs! Once the full OS2 comes out, hopefully Repligo will be provided in Appworld so you don't have to bother with sideload methods, but in any case, a PDF solution for the PB does exist.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Christmas gift to myself!!", "Author": "sawyer", "ReviewID": "R24WID5MIWD586", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have one of the first Kindles ever sold.

To be honest I would trade my iPad in for the PlayBook in a heartbeat.Here is what I like about the PlayBook:  - video recorder is 1080P and the cameras are 3 and 5 mega pixels  - Flash works and I don't need to download apps just to properly view a webpage  - browser loads fast (I think faster then the iPad 2)  - folders are set up and it is easy to move and find what you want (I have the Torch and the set up is similar)  - easy to navigate and I love how intuitive it is to useSo far I haven't come across anything I haven't liked.  For my use a little bigger screen would have been nice but having said that I'm traveling tomorrow and will take the PlayBook instead of the iPad because it is more compact not to mention I like it better.

But after using it for only a few days I was really impressed and knew it was a keeper.  I've been using it for about three weeks and overall I have been very pleased with my purchase.PROS-Battery life has been GREAT!  Over two full days with many hours with Wifi on all the time and B/T on sometimes and I still have a little under quarter battery left.  Wow!  I think it was rated for 8 hours of use and I definitely have logged more hours using it.  Turning of the Wifi and B/T when not needed really extends the battery life.-The Blackberry Bridge works much better than expected.  I get all the PIMs from my phone plus email and BBM to mirror seamlessly via B/T.  I can even access the SD card content in my Blackberry phone.  I wish it was a little faster, but it's via B/T.-Tethering works well.  Been able to browse w/out Wifi tethered to my Blackberry data plan at no extra monthly costs. This is an incredible advantage of this tablet.-The screen is absolutely gorgeously brilliant and navigation is very seamless with no lag time.  Took just a few minutes and one how-to video to figure out the gestures (very easy and yet powerful).-Web browsing is very fast and efficient-New QNX OS multi-tasking is amazingly good.  I can have multiple apps running at the same time in the background or foreground without any hiccups or lag time.  Very powerful!-Built in Word, Excel, PDF, etc. is a big plus, but I don't see myself typing a document on the touch screen with my shaky hands.  Maybe a b/t keyboard is in order.CONS-Lack of some apps that I expected would be there.  Surprisingly Amazon is missing from the arena (even though they had said they would have Kindle for Playbook at release).  Haven't found any Google Apps either (instead RIM partnered with MS for Bing).  Lots of app in the app-world but not the ones I hoped for.  Hopefully over time app developers will catch on to this new tablet.-It seems heavy for it's size and gets tiring to hold it for a long time.  I expected it to be much lighter (maybe I need to work out more).  It's a solid piece.  I just hope I don't drop it since I was too cheap to flip for insurance.-Biggest con is that an SD card reader is badly needed here.  It's a shame it wasn't include it.  Too bad they tried to copy Apple with their silly tiered memory approach.I think overall the initial negative reviews have been overly critical of this tablet.  There's definitely room for additional functionality and I can see RIM has rushed it out without some integral pieces (missing native apps like email, calendar - but bridge makes up for it connected to a Blackberry cell).  However, being RIM's first tablet on the brand new QNX OS it is very impressive overall and a solid design.  I'm hoping that the next big OS release will add lots more functionality.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best of two worlds", "Author": "Anthony F.

Last December I purchased an Android phone, HTC G2 and lived with it for 3 1/2 months.  My phone is used as a communication device, talk, text & e-mail.  The Android was primarily a tiny screened tablet with apps and - a phone secondarily.  Oh, and a HORRIBLE battery life. I came to the conclusion my perfect world was a BB phone and a 7\" tablet.After reading some scathing reviews by some tech nerd types, I took the leap of faith and purchased the Playbook.  Some of those reviews are just plain wrong.  Yes the switch on top is a pain in the neck.  But you only use it to turn on from a cold boot (off is on the desktop). I keep my unit on standby and have no battery life problems.  The only time I'd turn it off is for some extended period of time.The browser is quick and easy to use.  The Blackberry Bridge is great for me with business data on the company server and personal data, calendar etc. on a Blackberry.  Since it's a 7\" tablet and very portable the Blackberry Bridge (when traveling) gives me the internet at no cost. The desktop synch program works flawlessly with the Playbook and the Blackberry phone.  Apps aren't a big deal for me. Battery life is fantastic on a Blackberry and very good on the Playbook.If RIM's OS updates are as represented, the combo of a Playbook and Blackberry phone give me the best of both worlds.I'll reserve a 5 Star rating for post update time.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Playbook - AWESOME!", "Author": "SailorGirl86", "ReviewID": "R6Q2YKGDATM3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got my PlayBook two days ago. So far . . . love it!!! I am super impressed with the graphics and how easy it is to use. The set up was so simple. I connected to BlackBerry Bridge and my home Wi-Fi in just a few simple steps (I have a BlackBerry smart phone). My husband has an iPad and for me, the PlayBook beats it anyday. I love how the internet displays pages just like you would see on your computer. I took a few pictures with my device and the HD is just crisp. As for apps, it has what I need (I use mostly free apps). I love that it is small enough to fit in my purse. I'm still exploring all the features, but like I said, so far I am blown away!The only con so far is that you have to press the power button really hard in order to get it to turn on.UPDATE: I have had my playbook for four months now. I still like it; however, I agree with the complaint of not having many apps available. I have found that App World does not work unless I am connected to my home Wi-Fi. Another problem I have had is that the playbook has frozen a couple times. For this reason, I changed my previous rating of 5 stars to 4. Overall, I would say that it is very convenient being able to tether the internet to my Blackberry phone. As for e-mail, I am able to e-mail pictures and files from my playbook using my yahoo account.

Gonsalves", "ReviewID": "R3L6LBC7KLXXJE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Playbook now for a couple weeks, and find it to be almost (but not quite) perfect for my use.It's very fast, perfectly tailored for multitasking, and the OS/User interface is designed explicitly for the tablet hardware (not a cell phone or a laptop).  I love the bezel gesture system; it allows the screen to be used entirely for apps, meaning no screen space \"wasted\" on OS buttons/menus/status bars.  If you need to see the status bar on the Playbook, you simply swipe down from the corner of the screen bezel and it appears.  If you need to access the App's menus, you simply pull down from the top bezel, otherwise it's off screen entirely.  Going back to the \"home\" screen is a simple swipe up from the bottom bezel.  Everything is off screen until you need it, and accessing it when you do want it is easy and natural.The size of the tablet is another huge plus for me, as I find smartphone touchscreens just a bit too small to be comfortable, and larger tablets too clumsy to hold and too large to be truly portable.On the negative side, there's still no native SDK (software development kit) for the Playbook, and most current apps are built with Adobe Flash/AIR.  There's a definite difference in the quality of the many of the Flash/AIR apps, with many of them being a bit sluggish or feature lacking compared to apps built by RIM or with Webworks.  Also, the power button is every bit as bad as you may have heard, being very difficult to press in the best of circumstances.  Luckily, you'll almost never have to use it, so it's not a huge issue.My final grade: A-/B+, hopefully becoming a solid A when the NDK comes out and more apps are released.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "averageconsumer", "ReviewID": "R1RP4FD8C4A2VY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, so great.I never wanted a tablet before.  And I am one of the people Blackberry doesn't even think about: the completely nontechnical type.People like us learn how to use whatever we are interested in, but we have no innate flair for it. We just slog slowly and carefully through directions until we understand each part of How To.So I bought this with a fairly good idea of my inevitable learning curve for a new ecosystem, as well as the rewards for my efforts later on. So far, I am extremely pleased.Between the tutorials on the Blackberry site and the generous enthusiasts at Crackberry.com, I was able to find out all the little steps I could not have guessed.(Patience at the beginning is the prerequisite virtue for those who have no idea how anything from Blackberry works. It is not that hard to learn.But if you have no knowledge, and no patience for learning either, then you have nothing to work with at all. In that case, buy an Apple.)The Playbook hardware is very well-constructed, and a real pleasure to use. The screen and the sound quality are exceptional, and 64GB is fine for my purposes.This combination is why I bought the Blackberry Playbook, and why I am glad I did: it has wonderful visual clarity, great sound and decent storage at a very good price.The app aspect is obviously extremely important: you have to know exactly what you want this tablet for, and what the available apps will and won't do.So far, my basic software needs have been easily satisfied. In this, I am in a minority. I wanted a simple browser, decent audio and video software, a good file manager, and an epub reader.And in particular, I wanted to be able to play my personal audio and video files from different sources- which is working well so far.Then I added a few extras, as everyone does, according to interests. I'm all set. But before buying this lovely little device, make sure you can use it according to your needs.I am delighted, rather than disappointed, because I knew what I wanted before I bought it.I read about the screen, but that didn't prepare me for just how clear and beautiful it really is. I knew the sound quality was very good too, but I was still surprised at just how good.Battery life is excellent so far. WiFi has been painless, and browsing has been easy. My desktop installed the device drivers and set up the Playbook without any problem.The included charger works just fine, and I ordered a separate rapid charger too, along with a good case.I know I have barely touched the surface of what this device is capable of, but I'm not in a hurry. I enjoy leisurely meandering around in the world of possibilities.All in all, I find this device somewhat astonishing: the sheer quality of it has exceeded my expectations by quite a bit.Having said that, I will add that if anything goes badly wrong, I will come back here and report it.

I did not buy it on Amazon but elsewhere and I just wanted to give my comments on it.PROS:1- Integration with my wife BlackBerry was easy, she can use her BBM, BB Calendar, BB email, documents right there on her Playbook after sync. She can use her phone data plan too on the tablet without any extra $$ cost or requiring reconfiguration.2- The Office App is the best I have found on a touch device (Docs, Excel and Presentations), she uses it every day and she can decide where to save them, on the Playbook himself or in her BlackBerry.3- Perfect size for her needs, nice bright and DPI screen, I love the speakers (2 of them put in front of the device: some other brands only have 1 speaker placed in the back the sound doesn't feel right).4- Apps, well some say there are no apps in here but there are a lot, maybe not the same quantity than Apple Appstore or Google Play but you have all that you might need... Comes with 3 big games (Need for Speed, and 2 others I don't remember cuz I dont play -my wife doesn't play too- that much :-P)5- Best internet browser I have seen on mobile devices or tablets, yes I think its better than Android and Safari its is fluid and can render Flash without any problems, Its really like browsing on a full Desktop PC.6- Multitasking way better than iPad, and maybe even better than Android ICS, its so intuitive to pass from an open App to another one, to close them, to chose another one. Trust me, its amazing what this little tablet can do.7- Playbook OS 2.1 its a nice piece of OS, RIM needs more developers to put more apps in here ... and the better part is that now if you don't have any BlackBerry phone, it doesn't matter because you have Calendar, Email, Docs, Facebook, etc without needing a BlackBerry (the phone its a plus, but not necessary)8- Battery life is really good, I have used it on a trip for more than 5 hours watching movies and at then end, battery was like 55% - 60%9- Nice back camera, taken videos and pictures with it and really nice.10- Standard connectors Micro USB and Mini HDMI that you can hook easily to you TVCONS:1- It feels a bit heavier when compared to other 7 inch tablets (I compared the Samsung 7 inch and this before buying)2- Maybe more Apps... well to be honest the only real one that I want and can't find is Skype so I can use the front camera3- No expansion card..I can say that it is the best 7 inch 16GB tablet you can have for $199, yes now there is the Nexus Tab 7 for the same price but its a 8GB ... if you have an extra $55 go buy Nexus Tab 7 16GB or Samsung 7.0 only if you are worried about not having apps, but for me and my wife the Playbook cover all our needs (Office apps, Browser, Twitter and Facebook, some casual games, watching movies, pictures)", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does its job but has its problems. (Updated)", "Author": "Jared", "ReviewID": "R1NBO2WT9VG5QG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this back in February used and was in great condition, except for the one dead pixel but they allow a certain amount in all screens so I guess I just got unlucky getting one with a dead pixel, its annoying. As soon as I got it I loved the form, weight, feel, and texture of the back casing. The screen is beautiful (aside from the dead pixel) very crisp and 7\" is fine for me, very portable and practical. The main reason I bought it was I wanted a tablet very badly and couldn't afford any ipads or good androids so when I saw the 16gb Playbook available for $200 I couldn't pass it up. It serves its purpose, is very portable, and is capable of most of what a laptop can do. The first major problem was that I noticed it will not work on ad hoc networks which is a problem for me because I use my friends wifi and share it from my laptop to devices in my room. I was able to use a program called Connectify which can create access points which the Playbook can connect to so I was able to use it at my house that way, and I use a Mac in school and the Playbook is compatible with a Mac's version of internet sharing. The next problem was I noticed a piece of dust somehow got under the screen, I kept it in the sleeve (now in a case), clean it often yet the piece of dust is close to the dead pixel and makes that part of the screen annoying to look at, over time I have noticed other pieces of dust getting under the glass somehow and can't be blown out. Doesn't make any sense to me, my 4 year old ipod touch is in my lint filled pockets everyday and there isn't a single piece of dust under the glass on it. The operating system is very fast and has full flash and multitasking. 2.0 is nice but I think more can be done, it still takes way to long to boot up, uses nearly 500mb of ram without any apps running and the android player sometimes crashes. The ram is a problem to me, I thought 1gb would be fine but nearly half is always used by the os, so that degrades the potential of multitasking because only so many apps can be run at once. The browser is the biggest hog. One of the problems I had was trying to dig for an old post on the browser facebook and running out of ram and the page just froze, I was hoping it would just get rid of the top of the page and keep loading where I scrolling down to, luckily since 2.0 I haven't had that problem so it must have been fixed. I'm not very impressed with the battery life, I'd say I'd be lucky to get 5 or maybe 6 hours. It needs charged every day (charging is rather fast atleast.) Note, I always have bluetooth off and turn wifi off when in standby and after using it for about 2 hours in school it needs charged when I get home or I won't have enough to use it for the rest of the day. Plus it looses battery life overnight, every morning its down between 5-10% from where it was before I went to bed which is garbage because my ipod touch can last over a month in standby. I'd shut it off but with the terrible boot time I just deal with the nightly drain. The last problem is App World. It has gotten better since 2.0 but still needs many more apps, lacks a lot of big apps on ipad and android, however there are a few good android apps being ported over. Over time I have found the productivity and utility apps I needed so now I'm satisfyed with what I have, but you aren't overwhelmed with many choices like you are in the app store. (This can be both good and bad.) A lot of good apps cost money and I don't have a credit card and as far as I know they don't make app world cars like itunes prepaid cars so I won't be able to buy any apps. I know I stated a lot of the problems but I just wanted to tell you what I don't like about the Playbook, thats it. There is much good to it, I use it everyday in school, its very portable and I like the form factor. The cameras are excellent, among the best, especially the 2mp for a front camera is going above and beyond. I appreciate the flash browser, adobe reader, and the file browsing ability with both the os browser and air browser. It feels more like a \"my computer\" being able to get that access to your devices files, and using that you can delete songs on the device, unlike the ipod. I like the blackberry desktop software for your computer, I've only used it once but I like how it's set up. It was a great idea to put the speakers on the front and they sound great. The bezel gestures is the best idea yet I've seen on a tablet and it works very well. I don't have a BB phone so I can't tell you about the bridge but the newly added email, contacts, and calendar apps are very nice. Most of my email accounts work fine but for some reason my earthlink won't work, I tried everything and used the same addresses and ports that it uses on my windows mail. I guess earthlink just isn't supported but it isn't a big deal. The volume and play buttons are nice and have different functions if you hold them down which is nice. Of course the flush mounted, tiny power button was a terrible idea and needs pressed very hard, and if you don't have a case on it you'll need to use your nail to even be able to push it down. Luckily the touch gestures can be used to wake the device and while it's on on the taskbar you can put it in standby. I have RIM's convertible case on it and it fits perfectly, looks very sharp and professional, is comfortable, and functions as a nice stand with multiple angles and ways to hold it. Although it does have its issues and disappointments I use it everyday and its a very good deal for the price and I can say it's the best 7\" tablet out there as of now. The Playbook won't be replacing my laptop and I plan on getting a quad core 10 inch android or iPad in the future but if you're on a budget or just want a full featured 7\" tablet the Playbook is the way to go.**Update 5/31**For the last several weeks my Playbook no longer charges and now no longer syncs to my laptop. I charge it daily since the battery sucks (I take great care of the thing) and one day it just did't charge. I tried it both while on and off and the charge icon won't show up on the battery. It must make contact though because if I plug it in while the screen is sleeping it will wake it. It still had been syncing to my laptop (and that was how I had to charge it too which is extremely slow that way) over the USB cable to my laptop. Then my laptop os crashed and I had to reinstall windows, since then I put the desktop manager and desktop software back on my laptop and even though it detects the playbook is connected it can't connect it and won't show up in my computer as a storage device. And I have the latest Tablet OS and managers on my laptop. So now I'm unable to charge it and unable to back it up to try wiping it. I can't tell if it is a software problem or a hardware problem, since it wakes up the screen when I plug it into the wall and when connected to my laptop it says it's connected on the Playbook even though it won't show up on my laptop. Does anyone else have this problem. I'd contact RIM but the 90 warranty is over and I will NOT pay RIM anymore money for a repair or shipping for this piece of garbage that keeps causing me problems. I liked the device (aside from the mentioned problems) but after this I will never buy another Blackberry device again.**Update 6/12**From reading the reviews on here I have figured out it is indeed a hardware problem (miniUSB port) which I was gentle with so it was just poorly designed. The battery totally died and it won't even charge off of my laptop now. Yes I can buy the rapid charger (which in the future I will) but I need the USB connection for backups and sharing media. So I will need to get it repaired, since the warranty has expired and I'm sick of RIM's careless efforts on really perfecting what could have been a great device I'd much rather not deal with them and just take it to best buy or something if it can be done cheaper and quicker. I want to get it fixed but when I have the extra money I'm just going to decide on an iPad or Android and keep this as a backup and a smaller, more portable one.

I also have found more than enough apps to suit my interests. The value factor of this excellent tablet is 'off the scale' as well, and portability is fantastic. If I could only find 1 fault with it (and this is true of many tablets), it's that the battery is not user-serviceable or replaceable. If RIM and other tablet makers would manufacture tablets with pop-out, user replaceable batteries, they would triple their sales. I would hate to think that I have to toss this gem of a tablet out in 2 or 3 years if the battery stops holding a charge, which often happens with today's electronics.

If you want a great portable tablet for a great price .. this is it.It comes with Office Premium to Go (full editing for word, powerpoint, excel); the best integration out there for native email, contacts, social networking (facebook, twitter, etc.) and calendar organization better than any other tablet out there; 2 HD cameras (records true HD video); very high dpi resolution screen; portable; predictive/corrective typing; full true multi-tasking; plays 1080p videos piped out to your HDTV via a microusb cable; fantastic sound speaker system; full HTML5 internet browsing INCLUDING flash and java; many apps and games (android included) and its growing; fast file and folder integration; GPS/WiFi/bezel gestures, and bridging/full integration to a BB phone if you have one so I don't have to go with 2 carrier plans.Bottomline .. it does everything I need and I hardly use my pc now.  When I come home my BB phone goes on the charging dock and I access everything (email, BBM, calendar, surf the web, etc.) on my Playbook using the built-in bridge function.Oh yeah, almost forgot did I mention the PRICE is great :) !", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "A solid B+ for the Playbook!", "Author": "Radical Technoid \"We know we're right, we hav...", "ReviewID": "RN3V49Q1AGB25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with all of the good things the other reviewers have posted. I'd like to add the following:Pros1. You can access your Playbook wirelessly over your wi-fi network. (I'm loading music onto mine this way while I type.)2. You can also access it via USB, which is faster than wireless, but does require it to be physically connected to the computer.3. The web browser is awesome! It has full java and flash support. Face book, You tube, even Drop box work as they do on a laptop4. Professional Documents To Go (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) come pre installed, and they work very well.5. Video playback is great, it will play mp4 and Xvid/divx based avi.6. If you load your pictures in folders, the folders appear as `albums' on the tablet, very handy for organizing7. It has resources enough to allow true multitasking and switching between applications is great.8. The music player is great, and it supports random play9. Audio, video and display quality is excellent.10. The virtual keyboard is excellent. If you don't get along well with touch screens a capacitive stylus works wellCons1. It won't play wmv, won't decode Dolby AC3.2. It does not support Bluetooth A2DP.3. It does not have a file manager on the tablet; you have to do this via your PC. You can delete files on the tablet but that's about it.4. It does not yet have an e-book reader. You can convert e-books to PDF and read them but the PDF reader is pretty bare bones.To date RIM has pushed one OS update, which installed flawlessly via wi-fi. I hope there will be additional ones to resolve the above issues. In the meanwhile I'm VERY pleased with my tablet, 7\" is the perfect screen size and it does everything I expected it to do.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Charged it for 7 hours / PlayBook battery won't work", "Author": "Troy Amazon", "ReviewID": "R35S85U5HWUAN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros:1 - The BlackBerry packaging was nice and professional.2 - Tablet looks brand new w/ no scratches or blemishes3 - Price on a refurbished unit is so low I had to give the Playbook a try.4 - No capacitive buttons to accidentally press during operation.5 - While you don't need to own a BlackBerry Smartphone to go out and buy a BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, if you do own both BlackBerry phone and tablet you can take advantage of the BlackBerry Bridge, which connects your tablet to your phone, allowing your tablet to act like a big touchscreen for your phone providing direct access to your phone's email, calendars, BBM files and other data.Cons:1 - Doesn't work2 - Battery won't charge (even with the official micro USB wall charger from BlackBerry)3 - No expandable memory4 - Limited apps available on BlackBerry App World5 - Side loading Android apps (convert APK to BAR) is unreliable.  Some apps still won't work properly.6 - Very small power button7 - Must use official BlackBerry PlayBook charger.  Other micro USB chargers won't work, effectively making this a proprietary device.I saw this BlackBerry PlayBook on sale for $129.99 for a refurbished 16GB unit on another site.  I had passed on this tablet when it was released because it was so expensive and the were very little apps available for it.  This low price made me change my mind.  So I went ahead an ordered it and just got it in the mail yesterday.The tablet feels very sturdy.  This is not a flimsy, plastic frame on this tablet.  It's all black and actually looks very nice and professional.I plugged this refurbished unit in and it won't charge.  When I plug in the wall charger, the indicator light turns red for about 10-15 seconds on followed by 5 blinking green lights. Then the light just turns off and nothing happens.  I've tried the different tips like doing a \"stacked charge\" (2 minutes plugged in / 2 minutes off done six times) , but the PlayBook still won't charge.  I tried doing a hard reset by holding down the power / volume buttons, but the PlayBook still won't charge.I left my BlackBerry PlayBook plugged in overnight to see if that would help.  It was on the official BlackBerry USB wall charger that came with the unit for SEVEN HOURS.  I got up this morning and tried to turn it on but it still won't work.I Googled \"BlackBerry PlayBook won't charge\" and found that this is a well documented problem on several websites and forums.  BEFORE you decide to buy one of these, check it out.  The prices on these 16GB BlackBerry PlayBooks are getting cheaper, so it may be worth the chance.I'm sending this refurbished BlackBerry PlayBook back as a RMA. If I had known that this tablet wouldn't work out of the box without having to go through all of this hassle just to get the battery to work, I wouldn't have bought it.  Now I know there are some BlackBerry fans who really love the PlayBook, but charging a device, no matter if it's a tablet, cellphone, MP3 player or laptop should be EASY.  Just plug it in and it should work.  I have bought a lot of electric devices over the years.  I even have cheap MP4 players that have been sitting around for months and I can pull them out, plug them in and they work without a problem.I think that it's absolutely pathetic that RIM sold a product to consumers that The battery won't charge if it gets too low.  It's bad enough that you don't have access to all of the available Android apps on Play Store, but this is even worse.  I bought this tablet knowing that BlackBerry's App World only has a limited about of apps available.  While less functional than other 7\" tablets, at the bare minimum I expected to use the BlackBerry PlayBook as a ereader, web browser and PMP.  I was planning to go to goodreader.com and try to get a few Android apps missing from BlackBerry's App World like Nook, Aldiko, iReader, Audible, MoboPlayer, PlayerPro, Empire Defense 2 and Myth Defense.  I also know that side loading apps is pretty much a hit or miss proposition because even if you convert a APK file to a BAR file, there's still no guarantee it will work properly.  But at such a low price, I thought I'd get by until a better Android tablet hit the market.  But I had no idea that there was this problem with the battery.  The last thing I expected was to not even be able to turn it on.RIM did post up a couple of knowledge base article detailing the low battery state of the BlackBerry PlayBook. RIM tells us that:******When the battery level of the BlackBerry PlayBook reaches a level 0%, the tablet will automatically turn off.  The LED will blink in a sequence when attempting to Power On the device indicating a low charge, red blink and then followed by 5 yellow blinks.This is because the BlackBerry PlayBook battery does not have enough charge to power up the tablet.It is recommended to connect the BlackBerry PlayBook to the Rapid Wall Charger that came with your BlackBerry PlayBook, or one of the charging accessories listed:BlackBerry PlayBook Rapid Charging PodBlackBerry Rapid Travel ChargerBlackBerry Premium ChargerPlease leave BlackBerry PlayBook plugged in for about 40 minutes or until full charge is achieved.  Connecting to a PC to charge via USB will not be sufficient to charge the tablet.******RIM is obviously aware of this issue with the battery. Instead, RIM made the calculated business decision to NOT fix the batteries in the BlackBerry Playbook devices that they are manufacturing. Apparently it's cheaper to just tell consumers to go through overly convoluted steps like doing a \"stacked charge\". Seriously, this is where you have to press buttons, plug it in and unplug it for 2 minute intervals for half a dozen times and hope the battery will start working.  The frustrating thing is doing this \"stacked charge\" takes almost a half hour of plugging and unplugging.  I've never owned a electronic device where somebody may have to spend half a hour just trying to get the battery to work.Here's another article from their knowledge base:********KB26808 - The BlackBerry PlayBook tablet is unable to charge when powered offOverviewThe BlackBerry\u00ae PlayBook(tm) tablet requires software control in order to charge. This means the BlackBerry PlayBook must be powered on in order for the battery level to increase.If the BlackBerry PlayBook is plugged into a power source while powered off it will automatically power on in order to accept the charge.If the BlackBerry PlayBook is powered off while plugged into a charging source it will not continue to charge.[...]Note: If the battery level is critically low, the BlackBerry PlayBook may remain on the boot screen until sufficient charge has been reached to fully boot the BlackBerry PlayBook.*********** Edit 8/9/12 - I got trolled when I posted my initial review, so I had to update this review with additional information that came up in the comments section.**I'll do you a favor and let you know about some of the threads on the official website for BlackBerry about problems with the battery.

I base my reviews on what happens in the real world when I test the device. Real world reviews help consumers understand what to look for in making the decision whether or not to spend their money on a BlackBerry PlayBook.

I only buy things after careful consideration and that's why I bought the PlayBook.Within a few hours of having my new PlayBook, I connected it wirelessly to my Windows laptop, Mac Mini server and to my good old Nokia N900 mobile phone. What I am saying is that you do not need to have BlackBerry phone to use the PlayBook.Furthermore; BlackBerry have recently opened it's OS 2 to have Android applications installed on the PlayBook. There is already a plethora of applications that were ported and are now available to be installed on the PlayBook such as Amazon's Kindle, Pandora's Internet Radio and others which I have already installed for free and are working like a charm.I personally prefer the 7 inch screen on the PlayBook, perfect for holding it with one hand like the Kindle reader, the screen is sharp, the browser is fast and it supports latest version of Adobe's Flash player.There is a lot more I can write about the PlayBook but you get the picture.Oh, get the 64GB version, you will need it, just think of all the movies, music and games you will have on them to show your friends and family through the HDMI interface on their HDTV.If you can't bring yourself to buy one for your own use, get it as a present and give to someone you love, it's a great gift.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like it more & more every day...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SR2J5MJGNJJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I use an iPhone (which I like), I borrowed my brother's iPad2 for a few days to see if I liked it, bought 2 android tablets close to this price point which I returned, and I have a Nook Color that has been rooted to make it a tablet. I didn't really care for the iPad2, its price point or its size. For me it was like an oversized iPhone, and I already have that. The Nook was not quite what I was looking for either.  So, I decided to give this a try.  I read all of the reviews about the apps,email, and calendar prior to my purchase, so I knew what to expect there.Out of the box, I was very pleased with the fact that the browser was just about as fast as on my pc.  Then I began to check out the apps.  At first I had buyers remorse, not because I use many apps, but because that is when I realized there were no commonly used apps like Netflix, Kindle, etc. I thought Oh No, I should have tried the Kindle Fire. However, now that I have read its 1 & 2 star reviews by some, I am glad that I didn't because I know that it wouldn't have been what I was looking for either.Unlike some others though, I was determined to give the playbook more time to prove itself and for me to become more accustomed to using it because I refused to believe that Apple is the only other alternative...lol... And I am glad that I did because even if RIM never fulfills their \"promises\", for me this is the best at this price point.I wanted something that I could manage the kitchen/ household with. I needed something not too big and not too small that I could hang on the wall in the kitchen. I wanted something that felt sturdy, had an accurate touchscreen, and that seemed or at the very least gave me the illusion that it would last, and that I wouldn't have to buy another one in 9 months.  For me this delivers.  I wanted to be able to bookmark recipes for cooking, easily done.  I wanted something that I could quickly look up something on the internet, again it delivers.  I wanted something that I could keep a family and my husband's business calendar on, done using google calendar, and buying an app for 0.99 that links straight to it.  I wanted to use it for grocery lists and errand list, done with an app that backs it up \"in the cloud\" and I can retrieve it from my iPhone while shopping.  Listening to music, done! Since I can watch movies from Amazon then I guess I will just have to find movies there & keep Netflix for my kids to watch on my phone! As for reading, I suppose I can use Kobo on the playbook or pull out my Kindle or Nook.Almost all tablets out there have bad reviews, including this one.  Most just have to choose which company has the product that meets their own individual needs.

I was looking for a tablet that could get me through a solid two/three years of college with out breaking the bank. I have been grateful I ran across the Blackberry Playbook. It is perfect for what I need.Pros:  -Solid construction: won't break when dropped from considerable heights without case (i've dropped it from about seven feet without its case a few times and it only came up with two small scratches in the corner cause I dropped it concrete)  -Memory: Memory on this is crazy. I can have like every Breaking Bad episode on this bad boy and still have room left, I love the memory availability on this baby. I have 32 GB and it plenty enough. I love this aspect of the Playbook  -Camera/Video: Honestly it is pretty up there compared to most tablets. I don't realize a problem with this at all. I am an avid photographer and although I don't use the tablet for taking pictures, I do on occasion with great success.  -Can run many programs at once, which is really helpful, like really, for me cause I use it for school.  -Price: Since the Blackberry Playbook has not hit the market like what was expected, the price of it has dropped by hundreds and you'll be getting a good quality tablet for the price  -The Playbook has programs similar to Microsoft's Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, so for me it was a breeze editing and looking through powerpoint slides, writing notes, and looking through spreadsheets that I need for college.Cons:  - Apps: The Blackberry store for the Playbook is absolutely horrible. Nothing compared to other android tablets. But this isn't a real problem for me because I really only use the Playbook for note-taking and surfing the internet, facebook, etc. There are some games and other decent apps, but I would research the different types of apps you'd want before buying this product. Again, for me, not a problem, but for avid gamers, it may pose a problem.  - Software: This tablet is a few years old and has since fell off the band wagon so-to-say, so there are no more OS updates for this tablet, so you're stuck at the current version. Which is not too much of a problem, because the current version is fine. It's not slow, even when several programs are running at once.Overall, I would buy this product all over again if I had to.

Dowling", "ReviewID": "RXKQ6N2Q73NSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing much research and having tried all the premiere tablets on the market, I landed on RIM's BlackBerry Playbook. I tried out the iPad 3 and I was not terribly impressed.  It felt very fragile in my hands, like it could break if I squeezed it too hard, the speakers truly suck as they sound tinny, and these are problems are significant given the money Apple charges.  I have a BB smartphone and I have always been impressed at how well-made their products are.  This made the playbook a no-brainer for me...I had no idea just how superior it is...the QNX processor is lightning fast and can easily manage several open windows.  You can edit word documents, spreadsheets, and it has flash player which iPad does NOT.  The screen and video camera is HD.  I opted for the 64gb model, as the price difference between the three sizes is negligible so it's worth it to upgrade to 64gb.  Though, with cloud storage, for most people, 16gb is probably plenty.  The touch keyboard is exceedingly comfortable and the most intuitive I have ever used...it really does learn how you write and anticipates your word choices.  It has a port for a micro hdmi cable so you can enjoy your downloaded content on your hdtv.  I bought this cable (sold separately)for only 4 bucks on amazon.  The PB is comfortable to hold as the build quality is immediately apparent.  It does not feel like it's going to fall apart if you drop it.  The processor is faster than any laptop I have ever used. The web browser is like flipping pages in a book.  If you have BB phone...it open up a flurry of additional features called BlackBerry Bridge.  The bluetooth connection syncs the two devices so you can manage appts, contacts, view, receive and reply to your text messages using your BB smartphone as a transmitter.  Your phone can be used as a remote control when watching a video or listening to music and you can browse the website for your phone's keyboard...it is a really amazing set of features...and best of all you can use your BB phone's data package to use 3/4g connectivity if you do not have access to to wife/hotspot so you do NOT need to sign up for a data service.If it seems I am gushing over this product, it's because it's that good.  So those of you who may think BB products are out, this will remind you as to why BB has such loyal fans.  And finally, it is simply priced...nowhere else will you find a tablet of such superior quality, enormous storage, awesome features, great versatility (ideal for home and work) and just plain fun for the jaw-dropping low price as I purchased it for slightly over 200 bucks (reg 700). Do not waste your money on the iPad...RIM has outdone themselves with this tablet. Outstanding product.Note: just to recommend some accessories to maximize your enjoyment...make certain to get a case of some description...there are many which come with a bluetooth keyboard built in...I opted for the Otterbox Defender as I have 2 year old twins and this case can take a beating and perfectly preserve your tablet. It has a built-in screen protector and a tough outer protective layer.  Its an amazing case which provides a complete solution.  I also recommend a micro hdmi to reg. Hdmi cable and extra charger.

After trying all contenders, the Blackberry Playbook 32G won by a nose and this is why.The case is sturdy metal, feels substantial, and does not flex. The screen is gorgeous, brightness and contrast make text crisp and color images pop.Finger response is first rate right out of the box, not overly sensitive, and can be tweaked. I like the intuitive fingerswipe sideways to close an app, as well as open program page pulldown from screen top.The system upgraded at first start, took only a few minutes, and now more apps than I will ever need are available. FB, the browser itself, and my email client (gmail) work perfectly, and tethers with bluetooth to most cellphones, mine is an older samsung 3G.Wi-fi is strong, connecting, and maintaining a connection at home or on the go without a hitch. The sound is very loud and clear, with nice response- great for gaming, music, movies, whatever, frankly puts apple and nexus 7 to shame, and there are 2 speakers, not 1 BTW.I have the rapid charging stand which is twice as fast(a charge lasts 10+hours btw, days on standby), and provides a nice pedestal to perch while not in use. I did not have any issues as some mentioned with the standard plug in charger, it was tight and secure, but I could see where the connector could break if bent or forced at the insertion point. I purchased the playbook because of past experience with the brand, the perceived quality, nice price, software updates, processor speed, and just a general balance of design and function. Many will underestimate blackberry, and I think apple already has. Schools and businesses are snapping up the playbook for a reason, these are sturdy and secure. I realize the market has many choices, the hd nook, the kindle fire, and the nexus 7 I feel were close in usability, and may suit those who will spend more time in the B&N;, Amazon (with ads), and Google worlds. The nook hd felt sleek and light but flimsy, the nexus has only one weak sounding speaker, and the kindle hd was slow and heavy. At present PB has no netflix, skype or kindle apps, but it will video chat with other playbooks, and has a kobo app. There is no app for gps function that really functions, and no sim card slot to allow direct access to a data plan. BB will soon offer new models that will. What the playbook does, it does well in my view. With the next software update, it will be even better.

I visited the Blackberry site. I found an instruction manual online and I read it. I made  judgments on which reviews are constructive, and which are just plainly absurd. I settled on the Playbook. So, I wasn't disappointed when I got my Playbook in June this year.I took it on my trip in July to the Canadian Rockies. I was pleased that I could check both my personal e-mail on Yahoo and my work e-mail on Outlook. I took pictures using the Playbook (I had the camera on and put in in the pocket of the car door) when I couldn't fire up my Sony Hx9v fast enough to snap pictures of mountain goats, sheep and elks. (Almost took a picture of a black bear crossing the road. Kathy: Look, a bear. Bear: Oh #$%^, humans).I have since been able to side-load some android apps, which now has become a bonus. I am now able to read magazine from our public libraries. All in all I am happy.A side note: Blackberry people, you need to market your products better!Updated on August 25, 2012OK, so I didn't expect to do heavy-duty work on the PB. I did use the Print to Go feature, as well as sending myself word, pdf and PPT docs by email. I am able to work to the fullest extent that PB is capable of. Then, I do back to work and immediate hit the road running. That makes my Mondays are more prepared and pleasant.My Sony Hx9v is my dedicated camera, but I also take \"duplicate\" pics and videos on my playbook for sharing them with my co-workers. It's more handy and discrete than putting them on my work computer, and the Sony scree is too small anyways.I also take the PB to off site meetings (we have WiFi at all our sites). I bring the PB instead of lugging my labtop to allow access to work e-mail and essential documents in the PB, if case I need to refer to them.August 26 update:I wasn't sure what apps are in the App Store, so I just enter an alphabet in the search box.

Simply because it doesn't read flash, it's too big, and I think the price is a little ridiculous to pay for something that's a larger scale of what I already have and doesn't do everything I want it to do. However, I still wanted something aesthetically appealing, sleek, sturdy, and about $200. I looked at the kindle fire but it lacks a camera and I looked at the nexus 7 but at $200 you get 8g instead of 16g. I had seen the PB at Best Buy and a few minutes playing with it I wanted it .. After further research and reading the reviews (good/bad) I bought it for these reasons: The screen quality is awesome and makes the screen look bigger than 7inches, the fluidity of the platform is so sleek, and I really like the swipe up/swipe down feature (instead of the home button on an iPad). It has a rubberized back for a no slip grip and is light. Sound is great n doesn't sound cheap. I read the battery life was long and it definitely is!  After the first charge I didn't have to recharge for 3 days .. I suppose if you use it all day long it'll last about 9hrs.Apps:If you're an app maniac don't buy it! The PB does not play Netflix which is a bummer but I honestly watch Netflix only on a TV, it doesn't have instagram but I'm not trying to whip out a tablet to take a picture, that's what my iPhone is for, and as far as games go, everytime I've DL one on my iPhone it becomes a waste of space and I usually delete them after a few days . As a college student, Docs to go and adobe reader (comes standard) is great,  it will definitely come in handy for lecture when I have to write or retrieve PDF and word documents. It also comes with the essential FB, twitter, and YouTube apps. From what I have been reading on the net there are ways to sideload android apps,haven't tried .. Not sure if I will.Internet and wifi:The wifi connection is strong and picks up signals my laptop can't..Im sure the Bluetooth connection is just as strong just haven't tried it. The Internet browsing is crisp, clear, and fast! I REALLY needed a tablet that read flash I shop a lot online and a lot of sites use it and my online class requires it for viewing homework and since the PB reads flash it's perfect and runs smoothly with no freezing. Other reviewers say its like browsing on a desktop and they're right!Accessories:Not very many and kinda hard to find.

RIM's tablet packs the power of a mini-laptop in a pocket-sized form.Pros:- It has crystal-clear display- Very resistant and stoutly built- Fast, with more than enough power to run heavy applications and games.- Feature-rich with HD rear facing camera, a chatting front-faced camera, GPS, Wi-fi, HDMI and Bluetooth.- GPS apps don't work while connected only to BlackBerry Bridge but they work while tethered to a BlackBerry phone or connected to a wi-fi mobile AP on Android (see below) The included app Bing Maps does a good job similar to google maps, and can even give me driving directions (in my country, Google Maps doesn't do that)When partnered with a BlackBerry phone (I have one) the result is more than the sum of its parts. The tablet can function as a big screen for the phone, and the phone works as a wireless modem for the tablet (over Bluetooth)If you have an android phone v2.2 or above (I have one too) the phone can share its  internet connection with the Playbook via Mobile Wi-fi AP. Also, I can transfer files between the phone and the tablet with an android free application installed on the phone called AirDroid.Cons:- A little bit on the heavy side, but still lighter than any 10 inch tablet.- Battery life isn't spectacular, when I used it through the day, I must charge it overnight, every night.- A certain lack of applications, but this is an item that gets more value as more people buy it.

You can shut down or hibernate the playbook via a control on the screen and awaken it from hibernation with a swipe gesture from the bezel onto the screen. The gesture controls in general are quite intuitive to learn and really make navigation efficient and easy.The Cons:I am not overly impressed with the battery life, compared to my Ipad it's actually quite poor.No native e-mail and calendar support is absurd, this will hopefully be a non-issue once OS 2.0 is released later this month.App store really is lacking in quality apps, I am hoping that RIMS push to have android developers port their apps to the PB plays off.A lot is riding on the release of OS 2.0 this month, I think if RIM executes it properly the Playbook will see some life, it really is a great device.

I neede the thing that would be more convenient to use than ipod Touch (nice'n'handy, but the screen is too small for anything serious) yet something smaller than my laptop so that I could take that newcomer with me while my backpack stays at home.First of all, I was really impressed by the multitasking implemented in that baby. For the first time I see it working as reliable and easy as alt-tab :) Second, it's really powerful, I tried many things to push Playbook to the limit but it never let me down, be it video streaming, browsing or gaming (and yes, there are plenty nice games released for it, hence the name is correct :) ). Playbook is rock-solid in terms of both hardware and software, lightweight and just plain beautiful.It has decent software options as of current and the guys from RIM are working on it constantly, so I don't feel like I will be left behind (plus you may run Android apps on it). Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and believe it will keep me busy (and satisfied) for quite a long time.P.S.

I also have a generic 7\" android tablet for comparison.  The BBPB is really nice.  The interface, the response, the touch and feel, are superior to the android tablets.  It makes deleting apps and updating apps so much easier.  The Ice Cream Sandwich on the android tablets is ok, not sure what the big deal is about, it's still a bit cumbersome to get around.  The BBPB is much smoother and nimble, especially when it comes to web browsing.  I tried 3 different browsers on the android tablets and they crash quite often whereas the BBPB gives me much more confidence in its stability.  I thought after the past few years with the smart phones and tablets that Android tablets would be stable, but with so many different hardware variations, it's still a bit of a Wild Wild West - It's akin to Windows XP versus Windows 7 on a PC.  The only drawback to the BBPB is the apps that are available.  It's still a bit thin and I do not think BB will introduce a Android run-time environment so that you can run android apps on your Playbook (even though they said they would oh so long ago).  On a positive note, you can side-load 1/3 of the android apps on your BBPB.  You can look that up.  Finally, the BBPB just feels like a serious piece of hardware.

Sure it had great specs on paper but without the app to support it, it's pretty useless. Let's face it, the majority of people who get tablets are looking to it as a tiny entertainment center on the go or at home. Sure, RIM's App World has some apps but most of them are not useful to your every day users. I'm not speaking for everyone here since this is my own review but I find the lack of apps really depressing. I loved this tablet, best tablet I've owned so far but it was just missing something about it. It's like if you built a robot and you add parts to it so it can do anything but you forget to add the software for it to function and just doesn't do anything at all.

I shall confess i thought i was kind of closing a big deal when i get this playbook for an unbeatable price in the market, but it turned to be just a bait. Where should I start? first, lack of applications. Lack of interesting applications, of course, playbook hosts plenty of insignificant, nonsense and useless applications, but not the interesting ones. No Skype. Not a single decent PDF reader. It has a powerful camera, but of no use without convenient applications. It's simply the same as nothing, i hold nothing in my hand. It is well built, yes, it got this classy feeling you perceive when holding something solid and well constructed. But lacks features so simple and common sense as, for example, a \"hold\" button to prevent the device from starting when cleaning the screen's surface. Result: annoying cleaning session. The charger lasted less than a month, i had to purchase another. The device now doesn't keep the WIFI settings when restarted, i have to insert EVERYTIME i restart it, the WIFI settings again. Wasn't like that at the beginning, but seems that aging has done bad to it. Visited hundreds of forums searching for answers, but nothing could solve the problem.

She got about $200.00 for her birthday. The only apple product we own is my daughter's iphone 16gb which I got her for Christmas. I checked her memory and she was down to about 600mb left. She deleted a bunch of apps now she has 3.4gb left. A 16gb ipad mini is about $400.00 so I did some research on 7 inch tablets and came upon this blackberry playbook. I checked reviews all over the Internet especially you tube. Try searching blackberry playbook vs I pad mini. Well besides an amazing hd display and far superior microphone and speakers and great reviews I went with this 64 gb playbook. My brother bought his son a 64 gb ipad mini for Christmas and paid $600.00 plus tax from best buy. What a sucker!! I paid $219.00 for this 64 gb playbook along with a screen protector and a leather case totaling $244.00 with free shipping with prime and received it the next day instead of 2 days. As far as apps and games there are plenty. Really how many apps do you really use anyway. My daughter is very happy with this tablet and so am I. I am writing this review on the blackberry tablet buy one you won't regret it. As far as apple products I think they are over rated and overpriced. If you want to pay 600 bucks for a 64gb ipad mini go ahead. As far as the playbook I think for the price it is a far superior tablet than the mini. Can the mini multitask? Not.

I must say, for people to give this tablet a bad name because of the \"lack of apps\" are idiots! Android apps can be downloaded to it.This is a GREAT, AMAZING tablet and it is worth every penny. I have a 7\" Samsung Galaxy Tab and an iPad 2. It's so much better than my Samsung and I'm still debating on whether it's better than my iPad, but i KNOW it's better than the iPad Mini. Just on flash alone, it's a great tablet. The HD screen is GORGEOUS and I love the gestures/UI. It's not too much. I also love how the buttons are on the top. They are small and you aren't able to press them (for function) easily when using the tablet. I find when using my Samsung tablet, I easily press the sleep/wake button when I'm just surfing the internet, so those buttons are a plus on the Playbook. The only downside to ME about using the Playbook is if you're using it for a long time, it can get a little heavy in your hands, so it's best to have it on a flat surface if your wrists get tired easily, but that's the only problem I have with it.

I have just completed setup on one of the two I bought.  This one is Not Easy.  For example:-No content behind tthe Get Started icon.  That left me searching for some instructions on what to do.-Dead end instructions: More than once I followed a link or instructions only to find either they didn't go anywhere or required some other action that was unspecified.  For Example: When I typed the URL for Bridge it just gave the errof message that it was not configured for my device.  No instructions on what to do next.  This kind of thing happened over and over.-Help is nearly useless.  It will instruct the user to find information in a specific heading.  But that heading is not there.  Also, Help is only available online.  With 64G it would have been easy to put it in the machine so users could learn the machine without having WiFi available.(Some of us travel and WiFi isn't always conveniently available.)-It is S L O W to turn on.  It takes Two Minutes to turn on after pressing the On Button.  Once On speed is satisfactory.-Downloaded Owners Guide is a .pdf file that is not interactive and is not consistent between index and content..  In this day and age?  Really?Well you get the idea.  This machine is not easy out of the box.  Guess that may not be unique.  The person next to me was setting up a Kindle.  She was asked for Port information for WiFi setup.I have only used it a wee bit.  Operational speed seems to be good.  Bridge works like a champ. Predictive text for email and data input is very good.  Screen quality is excellent.In short: I bought it because of advertising and price.  Initial problems have more to do with manufacturer's attitude and failure than the machine itself.  I think in the end it is going to do the job.  A further report later.ADDED:Now I have had the Playbook for a week and have used it quite a bit. Bottom line it is a capable book reader and music player.  The screen display is great.  But; Blackberry customer suppport is at least 20 years out of date.  I wasted hours following instructions while thinking that somehow I had done something wrong.  In fact the instructions were wrong and/or misleading.There are some surprising gaps in how the Playbook works.  For example each Bookmark must be individually entered instead of transferring as a group from another commputer.  Only certain email, calendar, contact information can be synchronized or transferred.  That fact isn't clear from setup or synchronization displays.If you want a book reader, a good music player and movie player and limited email it is a good value at the Amazon price.

No tablet is a computer although some, like the Acer Iconia W500, do come close; however, the Playbook falls into the leisure category and is no a computer by any stretch of the definition.As such, I'm not going to compare it to computers as that's unfair.  Like the vast majority of tablets the Playbook uses apps, not programs, and there is a world of difference.Now for the nitty-gritty:What You Get:The box comes with the unit, a suede like pouch (which, truthfully, provides zero protection), a wall charger, a mini USB to USB connector for file transfers and trickle charging, instructions and a cleaning cloth.That's all folks.Looks:You've undoubtedly already read the measurement and weight specs so we'll dispense with that.  From an aesthetic standpoint it's a much better design than most with a glass front bordered by a rather thick black bezel and a rubberized back (which makes it easy to hold).  Due to light weight and small frame it's no problem to hold or carry and much easier than the iPad (which is twice as big and heavy as the Playbook).Now for the Pros:Easy to handle and holdEven the base 16GB unit has enough space left over for tons of apps and files (I figured that nearly 14GB was left over after the OS was installed)Once you learn the drill, the screen gestures become second nature and I found it easier to use than the iPad methodPinch to zoom works flawlessly without Apple's problem of \"checkerboarding\" where the screen develops a checkerboard pattern while it attempts to render the area you just zoomedVolume buttons are up top which keeps them out of harm's way and also keeps users from pushing them during normal useFront camera has decent quality images, sufficient for chatting but the rear camera has much higher resolution and takes surprisingly crisp pictures and videoThe browser is quick, very quick.  Much faster than even the iPod or Kindle Fire.Flash laden sites are no problemVideos play without stuttering or skippingConsistent wireless connectivityOnce you set it up you can transfer files from your computer to the Playbook and vice versa wirelesslyNice, colorful and legible screen.

May be difficult to type with but it never once mistyped or failed to register a key I pushed.The app store isn't that bad although prices were a little steep in my estimation.  This will change once Android apps are ported in mid-February.Stellar battery life.  Never less than 9 hours.It can be tethered to your Blackberry Smartphone for connectivity should wireless not be available but check compatibility with your phone before jumping - some won't workComplaints about the recessed power button are unfounded.  It's recessed and small so you don't power of the unit while holding it.  Guess others just haven't figured that out.Now for the Cons:Inexcusable boot times of a minute or more.  Kind of hard to justify given the flash drive and limited depth of the OSTake my word and kill Bluetooth unless you're using it.  That function is a horrible power suckerLooking for Kindle Reader or MSN chat?  Sorry, isn't happening right now although Android's app porting may change that.  Does come with Facebook chat, though.  Oh, and there's no email or calendar functions built in, either.By the time you read this Android apps should be available but they were not for quite a while and this irked quite a few usersToss the included cover and get one with padding.  I can smell an accident waiting to happenNo NetFlix although that may change.  Hulu videos in basic mode play just fine but those desiring Hulu Plus will find out it's not geared to Playbook.No serviceable parts is this puppy.  No way of upgrading drive space or RAM (which is about par for tablets)Mini USB is for charging and transferring files and that's about it but the charging is a 1:1 proposition from what I've seen (meaning nearly 9 hours of charging to get 9 hours of use).  The wall charger cuts this back substantially; however, if you use the unit while charging it almost uses the same amount of power thtn you're providing (meaning you're going forward very little).Occasionally would flip the screen upside down for no good reason and I couldn't get it back without powering off.  After a couple times I merely flipped it over and worked upside down.Keyboard is largely for hunt and peck typists only and those used to texting will find it easier to just put the unit in portrait mode and use their thumbs to typeDropbox, where art thou?  You'll have to install Bluebox, a Dropbox simulator if you wont to park files and retrieve them from the Cloud.Not Linux friendly.  Works well with Windows or OS X but Linux required I shut the unit down, plug in the USB port, and then boot Playbook while Linux was running.  Even then it was treated as an external drive and you'd better know where to put your files as not to ruin the OSRear camera is great but auto-focus is largely a matter of luck and there is a delay when taking pictures.  This means you can't move the unit after pressing the onscreen shutter button or you'll risk a blurred pictureIt's not iOS nor is it Android so what happens if RIMM tanks?I could go on but you've probably got the picture by now.So is the Playbook worth the price?  Depends upon your needs.  Forget typing documents of any length and while video playback is above average it soon became apparent that the Playbook is just like any other tablet - good in a pinch but of limited usefulness otherwise.For $200 it's not a bad deal and cheaper than even the bargain basement netbooks, but it's still a play toy and not a serious instrument except for those that use or require Internet connectivity on a constant basis; however, at the original cost of $500 for a base unit it's just not worth the expenditure (you can get a halfway decent notebook for that much).", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "First in class hardware unfortunately hobbled by lack of software", "Author": "David Pearlman \"sound fanatic\"", "ReviewID": "R2D9EY8UGXFT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll make this brief: I've owned or used pretty much every significant tablet out there: iPad, Samsung Galaxy, Amazon's Fire, HP Touchpad, Motorolla's Xoom, and offerings from HTC, Lenovo and others.In terms of build and performance, this tablet betters them all: Super responsive, fantastic vibrant high resolution screen, extremely good built in cameras (for a tablet), decent (especially within a 7\" tablet form factor) battery life, etc.In fact, if this tablet were running Android or Apples iOS, I expect it would be a major contender.Unfortunately, it is not. It's running RIM's QNX operating system. Now, this isn't a bad OS. In fact, it's a very good one. But there aren't a whole lot of third party apps available for QNX--and it doesn't appear there ever will be, with most development efforts being applied to Android and iOS.So you're kind of stuck with the app set that comes in the box. That's OK for some stuff (the browser is very fast and good, the YouTube app is outstanding). But other stuff is missing entirely. For example, this unit has a built in GPS. But it doesn't provide any apps to use it. Huh? The camera app that's built in is fine, but pedestrian--a shame given how good the camera is. There's no Skype app, though it has a front facing camera that should be used there. There's no Netflix support, either, to name another popular tablet app. There's also no support for the most popular book readers, like Amazon's Kindle or Barnes & Noble's Nook> That means that even though this is a WAY better hardware platform than Amazon's Fire (and, currently, at the same price), you can't actually use it for that purpose.The good news is that RIM has been promising support for Android apps in the next major update of QNX. (The bad news is that they've been promising that update since last Summer--but there's a developer version of the new OS that some have tried that actually makes good on the promise). But there's a catch there, too: You'll have to get the apps through RIM's own Android store, not through Google's Market, and not through Amazon's AppStore. That means, presumably, you'll only have access to subset of the Android apps, and possibly at prices that won't make you smile. (Especially if you already own a bunch of paid Android apps, and aren't able to use them directly on your PlayBook).In the end, this is a truly first class piece of hardware, but sadly not first in class with respect to software support.If you can deal with the software limitations (and with a 7\" form factor), this is a great deal at RIM's current blowout pricing.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bought at best buy today for $199", "Author": "Marc", "ReviewID": "R2WUPMDRRTRSHP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just wanted to share that I just bought this at best buy online today for $199.

The computer geek I was sitting on the plane with pulled out a Nexus tablet and I asked him how he liked it. He said he wished he had waited a little because he would have bought the playbook which is now selling for under $200. It had better memory, screen, and sound. So I took his advice and bought the playbook. The setting up of my email, contacts and calendar from outlook was easy. I love the documents to go function. Now I can load on some excel spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations and some word documents that I need while traveling. This really made it very usable for more than just a movie viewer. The only disappointments that I have is that gotoassist does not have an app that will work on this so I can connect co-workers computers to solve problems and that there is not an SD card slot.

I also like the UI, the way the app drawer appears below the main screen and the way the apps open in the middle of the screen and then expand to fill the screen. In short, the Playbook has almost become my favorite EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!!!!! That one thing is the disappointing sparcity of useful applications; there just are not many. I'm not comparing the raw number against iOS or Android. A few really good apps are all that are. necessary, and those are sorely lacking. I have not found a good search engine, browser or office suite. I have heard that RIM will begin making Android apps available for the Playbook \"SOON\". RIM seems to have \"SOON\" as its company motto! Everything is GOING to happen SOON; RIM just does not deliver on its promises of \"SOON\".I think it's a lamentable shame. The Playbook is such a well-built device, but RIM does not seem to support it well.. If it had the necessary support from RIM, the Playbook would definitely merit five stars. However, because of the lack of support, three stars is all I can justify,", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Terrell K Coker", "ReviewID": "R26LQFU59HLZFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy my Blackberry Playbook.

Our needs are fairly basic - mostly e-mail, web browsing, e-books (Kobo + PDF's) and playing music and videos.  The Playbook works very well for all of this, with good speed and quality.  It is especially good for playing anything on YouTube - we are very pleased with this.  The sound and video quality and the speed and functionality of the e-mail and browsing are good enough that we all expect to keep our Playbooks for some time yet, sometimes alongside other tablet devices.  It would have been nice to have had Blackberry 10 ported to the Playbook, but I had always been skeptical about how well this might work, as Blackberry 10 needs more memory and a faster processor, and the performance of BB 10 on the Playbook would likely have been marginal and sluggish.If your needs are fairly basic, as ours are, then the Playbook could still serve well as your primary tablet device - otherwise, it could be very useful as a second device, especially for music and videos.  For YouTube, in particular, it is simply excellent.  If you can get a Playbook at a discounted price, it may well be worth it.

It may not be Retina display but there is a preloaded HiDef video that looks stunning and everyone I have shown it off to thinks the same. It also has stereo speakers that certain other \"i\" products do not have. It also has the HDMI out. I believe hardware wise it is up to par with any Android tablet and clearly surpasses the iPad. The operating system is elegant and the multitasking is great. The latest iOS requires you to double-click to bring up tasks, then keep your finger until the icons wiggle and press the - red sign to close background apps. On the BlackBerry just swipe to reveal all apps and click the X. And you have the choice of not leaving them running on the background, you can just close them and they will stay closed. I believe the Playbook is superior in almost (more on that in a bit) every way to the iPad and comparable more to the Android competition.Now, having said that, the Playbook is not for everyone (at least hopefully until BB10 gets to the Playbook). I see it more as a work tool. It allows for Bluetooth communication with a Blackberry so that you don't really need a data plan SIM on it, just use your current data plan on your Blackberry phone. Although it requires you to have a tethering plan on your phone to allow full use of the data plan, it does allow you to browse through the Bluetooth connection with the Blackberry Bridge Browser. And if you already have your email accounts on your BIS or BES Blackberry, you can read, reply, forward, etc., any email through the Playbook. So you can relegate your Blackberry to your pocket and use the Playbook for everything you would normally use your Blackberry for. It also has Print to Go which basically allows you to print anything through the WiFi to your Playbook. So you want to avoid carrying your plane itinerary on paper, print it to your Playbook. It also has Documents to Go built in so you can view, edit and create Word and Excel compatible documents. You can also use it as a network storage location so you can have a Word checklist on your Playbook and have someone else or yourself access it through the WiFi network.Now, the downside. Playbook apps range from bad to few. There are only a couple games worth playing, unless you are willing to pay for them, and even so the selection is not great. This is the one point the iPad and Android tablets beat the Playbook and why it has not sold. The good side is you can find it very cheap online.I use it every day and I can certainly say it is a rugged, capable product. I do wish it had a better app selection, but it does everything I need it to do. And it is cheap. I have the 64GB model for less than what you would get a comparable Android tablet with far less memory, and of course way cheaper than an iPad. The 7 inch form factor is also very comfortable and easy to type in with both hands and I find myself thumbing like in my Blackberry with ease. I am tall and with big hands but doing that feat on a 10 inch iPad would not be possible. A more comparable unit might be the iPad mini but the Playbook still feels more rugged and overall a higher quality product.So if you are looking for a cheap, capable tablet and use a Blackberry phone, the Playbook is a no-brainer. If you want to download free apps and want a huge selection of apps where everything you can think of already has more than 10 apps to choose from or want an expensive toy for the kids, then go for something else. I think RIM (now Blackberry) did not market this well and should have gone after corporate for this product. Now with BB10 we will see if the tablet can actually do both things. It certainly has the horsepower so here's hoping the tablet picks up, since I do think it is a good product.Just one more thing, mine said New but apparentely was refurbished.

I do minimal typing on it. I've paid a bill or two on it and all I can say is enlarging the screen really helps! Further, if you have a BlackBerry, you can use it as a remote control for the PlayBook so you can type on the PlayBook using the keys on your BlackBerry! It is fast too. You can't do everything you would on a netbook or laptop but it isn't meant to.

I've never given up on RIM because in reality its more likely the competing companies that aren't \"ready\". Nobody dares to give this company ANY credit for any breakthroughs they've made within the hardware division. Sure, they didn't invent texting but they sure came up with an idea to make it a whole lot easier. Being able to write notes, keep a schedule and a calender with you at all times. Apple has achieved at basically taking over your entire life, creating hardware/ software compatibility issues so great that i refused to buy into the sham beyond the iPod Touch 1g. I would rather have a Zune which everyone knows is no longer alive. the iPhone and iPad quietly but surely followed the iPods footsteps. Now starting with the iPad, it's a rather nice device but we the consumer took a heavily under-devolped piece of equipment and somehow turned it into the holy grail. If it wasnt for Apples grand marketing scheme, which might i add RIM refrained from for years and was still a VERY successful company, alot of people would still have no idea what apple would actually have to offer today. I know more people that have cut their ties with iOS and Android, either to find a new found love for Blackberry or even downgrade to a non-smartphone device altogether! Now that's how you do it!! Are these companies truly that horrible? Let's see, iOS unique UI, horrible compatibilty issues. Android?, terrible UI totally dependent on the hardware. Phone, Tablet or Media Player, SAME ISSUE!Now to be fair i don't hate Apple or Google, but i can honestly say i do not like any of their mobile products. //REVIEW HERE>> (OS2.0)With that being said the playbook is amazing companion to any owner of a blackberry device thats capable of BB-Bridge or anybody looking for a solid tablet that isn't worried about being \"connected\" 24/7. Since i was never a HUGE fan of mobile gaming, the lack of solid games on my bb phone was never an issue, an issue that is no longer being ignored within the world of PlayBook. There are more console quality games available for the playbook than you probably have time to play. Online multiplayer a HUGE bonus for most Gameloft titles, more on that later. The device itself is a solid piece of hardware, very sturdy and feels good and secure when youre holding it. Someone said the buttons were an issue but i can fully agree with that. The button scheme is no different than a iOS/ Android tablet, plus they even added dedicated media buttons, PLUS! The screen is nice and crisp, very detailed. when it comes to media, its no different than any other device with a screen, it all depends on the source. i wouldnt recommend anything under 720p, you get the same effect as if you were watching a analog signal on a HDtv. pro compressed 720p files look just as good as FullHD, you can search the web on how to achieve that. And in response to the complaints made against the screen, i feel they are useless. If you want superior clarity, maybe you should look into 30in. or 50in. tablets(the PlayBook has a miniHDMI port to connect to flat panel monitor or tv). The touchscreen is super responsive and most will not encounter problems just using their fingers, but i have found it more productive to also have a stylus handy and use both. the homescreen works well in portrait and landscapes, let me say that while using some apps it might be a good idea to \"lock\" orientation due to the sensitivity. As most reviews have stated the browser is awesome, being able to run flash as you would on a desktop/laptop, ex. YouTube videos play directly inside the browser with the option of expanding to full screen view. Adobe Reader and Docs To Go are built in and work flawlessly. PressReader works like a charm. The Music Store is powered by 7digital and it rivals any music service out there. the facebook and twitter apps are okay for the lightest of users, but thats okay with me. Most of us use 3rd party apps anyway. Now on to the Android app player, its perfect for expanding the playbook into new territory. The apps that have been ported and accepted work well, 50% of sideloaded apps work but it can be quite a task to set up for most basic users .The games flow really well from Modern Combat 2 & Asphalt 6 show quality that are on par with Playstation 2 and Xbox. the ability to change the control schemes are a major plus in my book. Alot of voice overs breaks away the average mobile phone gaming, it puts you in the game. Would like blackberry develop a 1st party bluetooth controller or at least license one. The sound is one of the main strong points on the playbook, hoping that the source is properly mastered and not over compressed. For mp3s i would stay around 160kbps VBR for the best quality:storage ratio. The PlayBook has stereo speakers, and while listening to quality mastered files the PlayBook speakers create sort of a sweetspot. It has some low/mid freq definition but nothing below kick drum range, but what more can you expect? It might not be a bose sound system but its far from tinny sounding, it has life. The OFFICIAL accessories are a complete line up, rapid chargers, rapid charging dock, bluetooth stereo gateway, a mini keyboard. Add that to a bunch of other licensed 3rd party accessories and you have quite a few to pick and choose from. No sd slot, no prob when you have a 32gb or 64gb model. I have almost 10gb of apps alone so a 16gb model would of been a bad choice for me. But not a bad choice for someone who wants a superior web browser/media player/ ereader(the 16gb model is the same price as the kindle fire might i add) OVERALL the Playbook is showing strong signs of promise for people who would of never thought RIM would budge on security issues.

A new owner finds out quickly that the Playbook is a proudly Canadian device. And that's kind of cool. No pun intended. Why? The supplied apps are Canadian-centric! Like the Film Board of Canada video app, Kobe bookstore or the ING.ca banking app in App World. Eh?Research in Motion is pedaling hard right now. We all know that.  Android and iOS rule the roost with Microsoft threatening to move Windows into position that might someday translate into a reasonable tablet. In the meanwhile, RIM's foot is stuck on the railroad tracks hoping some RCMP Mounties in the form of a Pandora or Skype can rescue it before the train arrives.And while the Mounties may, indeed show up, I'm betting they'll be in the form of independent players, Pandora SDK in hand, hunkered down in a cabin on the shore of Chaleur Bay in a flannel shirt hoping to get an app into the market that can stop the train. In the meanwhile, based on the recent RIM leadership shakeup and much needed Playbook upgrade to QNX 2.0, I think that the train is still very far away.I now have two of these $199 Canadian slabs sitting before me. One for me, one for my wife.  So for less than the price of one 10\" 8GB iPad, I have two 7\" 16GB Playbooks complete with USB, Bluetooth and HDMI support - connectivity features that, while unimportant to Apple in the era of `The Cloud', are important to me and lots of others.From a hardware standpoint, the Playbook is a lot of kit. When compared to a similarly priced Amazon Kindle Fire or the new 8GB B&N; Nook Tablet, just the connectivity features alone clearly give value-added benefits to the Playbook. Being a lazy writer, I'll spare you the rundown of the specs but I'll just say that this thing is solid. Really solid. Battleship solid. A bit heavy for small hands solid. And, with its metal chassis, a little cold too. If you like to cuddle up in the bedroom with your tablet perched on your mid-section, a B&N; Color Nook tab might be more comfortable. However, if you appreciate survivability, this thing is tough. But lacking Gorilla Glass, not that tough.A while ago I had the agony of owning an awful HTC Droid Eris running Android 2.1. While I'm not comparing apples to oranges or phones to tablets, I am calling out Google for the lack of stewardship of its Android OS by letting the phone manufacturers and carriers have their way with it and generally turn it into a fragmented, insecure cheeseball of an OS. It's so out of control with fragmentation and OEM customization that it reminds me of current day Las Vegas after the Mob lost control of the casinos. It's an overblown OS while Apple's iOS looks like it was designed by a New-Age artist at a Yanni concert.  I have a Windows Phone 7 which I think is the most usable mobile OS available. Looking closely at QNX, I saw that it was designed in the same spirit of OS usability, purity and security as old WebOS or Windows Phone 7.So let's talk about that operating system, QNX. A while back when HP was dumping their tablets for $99 bucks, having WebOS rather than Android or iOS was seen as a compromise to be made for the pleasure of scoring a nice albeit cheap tablet. What is sad is that WebOS is a very good OS. It's the same for Playbook's QNX. A very nice, secure and fast tablet environment bereft of malware and Android security fears. Using it gives you the impression that you are dealing with an extension of the quality build of the device's hardware. With the upgrade to 2.0, all of the previous dumb RIM management decisions melt away and you're gifted with a highly-functional tablet experience that doesn't need a Blackberry phone to provide integrated email and PIM features. In fact, QNX 2.0 gives the Playbook the smooth, effortless and snappy feel that is lacking in the Amazon Kindle Fire for the same money.Reading to this point, you'd think I'm really sold on our new Blackberry Playbooks. Well I'm certainly not going to put them in the box and send them back, but I have one serious concern that would have prevented me from buying the pair had they not been such a deal at $199 each.  Lack of apps.Now I refer you to back to my second paragraph. The section where I expect a Canadian Mountie in the form of a big player like Pandora or Skype to pull stuck RIM off the tracks before the train comes. Having business tools like Documents To Go is great, but it's not enough. Pandora says no. Skype is waiting to see if it's worth their while. But some like Zinio who see the promise of small but growing market are jumping in.Lacks of app was an issue with Windows Phone 7, and the outcry for Pandora was met by Indy developers creating SDK-based apps like MetroRadio to fill the hole. I think this is where Blackberry needs to be very proactive in supporting and fostering independent developer interest in Playbook and QNX. Just the ability to use some Android apps doesn't cut it. I've loaded a few. Feh. Playbook-native, quality apps built by RIM-supported developers are the only way to go to make RIM a true contender for your tablet-dollars.I'm keeping my Playbook. My wife hasn't put hers down since she got it, so I think she is too. But proactively I've put both Google and Bing on news alerts looking for Blackberry Playbook announcements. I'm reading Crackberry.com every day. So for now, the apps I have along with the great WebKit browser are satisfactory. But without a rapidly growing App World inventory, the future will be dim indeed.I have faith that the freight train heading for RIM will either derail or turn back before insuring a tragic and unnecessary ending to a great Canadian company.

I'm using this device as a stand-alone tablet, mostly for going online, reading ebooks and docs, creating docs, watching youtube and other vids, and playing games.First, the not-so-good, why I didn't give it 5 stars. There is no way to expand memory. No micro SD card slot. You can't connect a flash drive, even with an adapter. You need another computer to sideload.There is no Kindle App avaiable and you are tied to Kobo for DRM books. There are apps for purchase that can read non-DRM books. If you already have books from Project Gutenberg, you cannot read them on the Kobo reader on Playbook you need to buy an app.There is a free app to read Open Office and Libre Office files, but you can't edit the files. The Playbook cannot read or edit LO/ OO files that I switched to .doc, so I am unable to edit any of my previous files. This is more than annoying.I use Firefox browser on my laptop. There is no FF app for Playbook and it doesn't look like there will be any time soon. I'm used to being able to block ads, and sometimes that lacking feature gets annoying. You can block script on the included browser, but only globally. You cannot name/ rename bookmarks, although you can name them if you put them on the desktop instead of on the browser. No Hulu support, at least yet...Even with all that, here's why I like Playbook. The browser, outside of what I mentioned, is pretty good. It has some security/ control features that I like. It runs very smoothly and very fast. It has Flash support for youtube and other sites!Some complain about lack of apps in the store, but it suits me OK, with  the exception of the LO/ OO issue. I don't feel a need for a ton of apps, so it's OK. by me. Oh, there is android app support, but you can only really use android apps you get thru the Playbook store. This doesn't bother me, but I thought I'd mention it.The OS is great! Runs fast, fluid, easy to use and the screen is wonderfully touch-sensitive. Pinch and zoom is fabulous. Very sharp images and wonderful color for movie/ youtube viewing. It's light-weight and feels good to hold. The back of the Playbook is grippy, so I don't worry so much about dropping it. I've found some good games at the app store, most are a pleasure to play. The app store continues to grow.I'm hoping that some day that the issues I metioned will be fixed.

The promise of using Android apps on the Playbook has not come to bear and developers are moving away from developing applications on the playbook.

How could I resist? Well, I went ahead and bought it and I do like and dislike a few things about it.I really love the hardware quality of this tablet. It feels so whole and sturdy. This is the first BlackBerry device I've ever used, and I can see why they have such a loyal fanbase even in this day and age when Google, Apple, and Microsoft are eating away at their market share. I especially love the play/pause button on top of the tablet. That's quite useful. The matte finish on the back of the unit really gets me, because I love matte finishes on high quality devices. It certainly does not feel cheap, either. This is a well-put together tablet, and BlackBerry is even nice enough to include a neoprene sleeve with your PlayBook to give it basic protection.I was a little surprised at the lack of buttons for functions like forward or home, but I got used to the gestures rather quickly. They make a lot of sense, or at least for the most part (swiping from the bottom upward to close the app drawer is the only gesture that makes no sense to me, because swiping from the top down when the app drawer is open only opens the (very useful) settings drawer).The built-in apps are polished and well-made. Browser is very reliable, as well as the onboard camera, file manager, picture browser, video player, and more. It also does a wonderful job with my calendar sync and it syncs my contacts and emails quite well. Standby battery life is also very excellent. I had it sitting in my messenger bag for the past 8 hours and it still has 92% battery left from light use. The built-in keyboard is quite nice and makes a very nice, loud, satisfying tap sound when you press a key. When you type in certain apps or in the browser, the keyboard opens up this prediction system that reminds me of SwiftKey on Android, which is also rather nice.The built-in storage amount is by far the best feature of this tablet to me. So much space for so many videos, songs, and pictures. It's wonderful. You can go crazy with 64GB of storage. I have several videos in the .wmv format inside of it right now, but there's definitely more space available, and other supported formats. You could also use that space for games, which BlackBerry World seems to have no shortage of, as far as I can tell.Now, there are a few things I dislike about the item, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't like the item as a whole.First of all, the app selection is awful and even non-existent to some degree. A lot of big names are completely absent on this platform for some reason. No official Dropbox, Netflix, Springpad, Kindle, nook, Pandora, Feedly, and a whole lot of other apps are missing. On a platform like Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8, whenever there's no official app, there's at least a very good third party app that is good enough or even better. That is not the case on the BlackBerry Playbook. If there's no app, chances are you have a questionable third-party app that actually costs money and has bad reviews, or nothing at all. You can sideload .bar files, but judging by the ported apps I've tried, they barely work or are poorly optimized for the PlayBook. It makes me wish people other than just game developers had given the PlayBook more of a chance. The hardware is definitely nice, but the software support from third parties was definitely not there.I also own a Nexus 7, and the app selection on the PlayBook (unfortunately) pales in comparison. I think that's a shame as well, because I like the look and feel of the PlayBook's hardware more. I don't play a lot of games, either, but it seems like the apps that are most plentiful on the PlayBook (or just about any tablet) are the games. There's even a few preinstalled on the PlayBook, like Tetris or Need For Speed, in case you want to get used to the UI on it.I'm not a fan of the security on the tablet, either. I'm not talking about stuff like viruses or any of that. No, BlackBerry's very much on the ball when it comes to that kind of security. The security I'm talking about is locking the tablet. If you have a Nexus 7, iPad, or just about any other device, you can set up a convenient and rather easy way to unlock the device so that only the owner or those who know the password/pin/pattern can get access. Well, if you only like password lock screens, then you will have no problem at all with the PlayBook. This is the only way to lock the device, to my knowledge. I looked around in the settings and can't find anything else. Instead of being able to quickly press a few numbers, or draw out a pattern, I have to use the entire keyboard and type something out, and after that, reach for the \"OK\" or \"Enter\" key. You can just use a pin for the password, but it's still more effort than it needs to be. I wish this required a bit less effort, although it's not a deal killer for me. It's partly a problem because this is a tablet instead of a smartphone, so the screen is bigger and takes more effort to type a simple password on.Lastly, some of the UI is a bit counter-intuitive to me, or at least at first. This is my first BlackBerry device, and I am willing to admit if I just found it counter-intuitive because I'm unfamiliar with BlackBerry's UI standards. It took me a while to figure out how to set a wallpaper for the tablet. I kept searching the settings thinking it had to be close, until a Google search showed me I had to go to the pictures app and do it from there. Also, it seems like to get settings on any app, you need to swipe from the top down, which isn't too obvious unless you've used the tablet for a long time or just already know what to expect.Although this tablet has shortcomings and is aging a bit, it is still an unbeatable value for its storage and out-of-box media capabilities. Good luck finding a new 64GB tablet at that price. I store tons of video on mine and use it primarily as a dedicated media tablet. For media playback and capabilities, this tablet is more than adequate for the job. Just don't count on using too many apps. If you want to watch videos, play music, or look at pictures on the go, and you want a lot of storage to do so, go for the PlayBook. You won't be disappointed you did.EDIT: I've been using it a bit more lately with sideloaded apps I've put into the tablet myself. Some of these are a bit wonky to get working (older versions, free apps only, etc.), but some of them do work great or good enough. RetroArch works perfectly on the PlayBook (to my knowledge, I haven't actually opened up a ROM in it), and the Dropbox app I sideloaded as a .bar file works fine, too. But the strangest thing is that you probably need to sideload apps to get quality compared to the ported apps on BlackBerry World. For example, I use Electro Droid on my Android devices, and there's an app called Electro Tools in BlackBerry World that looks like a ported app. The ported app in BBW is terrible and barely works at all, but if you sideload Electro Droid as a .bar file, it works perfectly.Sadly, you can't sideload everything on this tablet. I've tried sideloading SpringPad twice already, but it doesn't even show up on my apps list. Still, your results may vary on this, but it's quite capable on running sideload apps. I partly wish that sideloading didn't require setting a password on this tablet (a password is required for using the tablet in development mode, which you need to sideload anything).", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got one that was supposed to be new but was not", "Author": "Mary Garvey", "ReviewID": "R2QCHOXX20QOX3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to return it..I got it from Time to Save..perhaps there is a glitch but I could not set it up or register it and called Blackberry Support..they said serial number had a valid registration and this was not a new item..it looked new..no scratches etc....I went back to web site to see if it said refurbished anywhere and did not see it.I am sending back and hopefully will not have further trouble with another one.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's the best I come across", "Author": "Avelon Manswell", "ReviewID": "R23UAM4YUJCE1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't get enough of itCan't put it down go out and get one.

The small form factor makes it easy for even a six year old to run around and capture action shots like a pro (it's survived being dropped a few times).  On vacations it fits in the same camera bag along with my 35mm SLR so it's very easy to bring along. Of course the good games like Angry Birds and Need for Speed come in handy too.-sent from my playbookPS - I'm a Ph.D. Computer Science not an MD", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Totally UNDERrated", "Author": "F.

However, at these price points, I don't think there is a better tablet for the money than the Playbook.  Yes, the Playbook isn't as fun and sexy to most like an iPad, but it can do so many things very well.  The web browsing is fantastic.  The music and video options are great.  In fact, I just sync it with my iTunes.  The camera is super and the video chat is great.  The video chat is limited between Playbook users, but man is it sweet!  Too bad it isn't expanded.Bottom line if you are shopping for a tablet, give the Playbook a good, hard, look.

Problem with YouTube and other apps.I have used the iPad 2, iPad 3, HP TouchPad and now this Playbook.  In terms of build quality, it is solid.  you have this metal shelf feeling once you hold on to it.However, it seems the apps is worse than HP TouchPad.  I use it mainly to read email, browse the web, track stocks and watch youtube.Let's start with my worst experience, the YouTube.  The layout seems ok, until you start do a search on video.  It cannot find video that exist when using web browser.  I am talking about the browser on BB.  That's pointless, right?  it is not just one instance.  It happens a lot.  So, I end up using the browser to go to YouTube .  Secondly, the \"related\" video and the authors link feature doesn't work!!  So, after you watch one video, and wants to find the related video or author button.  It just won't allow you to do it.  Even WebOS is better, what is this?Second main comment is the lack of good stocks, options tracking software.  It isn't hard to program.  Since RIMM is targeting business users, they should include more finance related good apps.Third, the screen and video quality is not as good as HP TouchPad.  the pixel density seems less.  Comparinng with the TouchPad.  It seems the pixels are larger.  however, the sharpest seems a little better than the TouchPad.I think the screen is on bar with iPad2.  iPad 3 screen may be a little over rated...", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most under-rated technology product", "Author": "Mitchell O.

The most common complaints about the Playbook were the power button being too small or too hard to operate and the \"lack of apps\". I found both of these complaints to be unfounded.  The power button is easily pressed without any head scratching, frustration or need for a sharp object.  As for apps, there are far more than I expected.  Many hundreds, mostly either free or ranging up to $1.99.  There are a few that are more expensive, including Angry Birds at $4.99.  One small complaint that I hadn't seen documented is the longish boot time.  It takes my playbook about a minute and a half from button press to ready to use.

But, what you will notice is that the Playbook actually works well like a fine crafted tool and becomes an extension of your desktop away from your desktop.  I use gmail, and since there is no native email application for all mail, RIM provides hyperlink icons to gmail, hotmail and yahoo.  On the gmail application, it works better than the desktop PC version.  It has \"swipe to refresh\" gesture for immediately checking emails, and the Google calendar also works well.The UI is fluid.  You have swiping gestures to move around the \"home pages\" instead of having to find and hit a special button.

I have seen some apps written for the ipad or android that I want.  I'm often put off that more android apps haven't yet migrated to the playbook or that android apps do not load transparently to the Playbook.  BB does a great job insuring security, but they need to speed up the app approval process.  The only area that has frustrated me in using the internet is that some, not all, drop down menus do not work on the playbook.  Hopefully, this will be resolved soon.  The above reasons are the only items that keep me from giving it five stars.  Movies are easily downloaded from my pc and I find the screen size decent for watching while flying.

Perfect size and did everything you wanted, later I found out that you could throw it against a brick wall and the phone was unphased (try that with an iphone.). Since I have discovered RIM products I am very impressed with they're quality. I came in late, therefore I did not have this iphone first mentality. I have used a ipad and thought it was very good piece of equipment. Having the experience with blackberry over the last year I was interested in the playbook because I am a small business owner.

I have been using it for about three months.The short: The Playbook is a capable device for what you need it for: Reading and consuming content. It has great form factor (7\" screen) and a fun interface complete with secret gestures to switch between apps or to reveal menus. Unfortunately the device itself is only half the utility of owning a tablet: You need access to apps and content to make that experience useful and interesting. The Blackberry App World store has a long way to go (as of September 2011) to be adequately populated with useful apps. But if everything you want to read is online, then you'll be fine with the Playbook.What I liked about the device: I liked that the Playbook was compact in size (smaller than the iPad) and was ideal for reading webpages. You don't really need it to be any larger. The shape and weight feel nice in your hands -- it feels high quality. You'll probably hear about the gestures like side-swiping the bottom of the screen to switch apps, diagonal swiping from the top left to access settings, and side-swiping to switch tabs. I think Blackberry did a great job at creatively organizing their interface. It's fun to use because of that, but it can also be frustrating if you don't have the gestures down.I've heard that the integration with a Blackberry mobile device is pretty hot, but unfortunately, I don't use a Blackberry for mobile so I didn't get to experience the instantly synched emails and other features I saw in a demo.What else worked:-Battery life was ok (about 7-10 hours of use on a charge, full brightness)-Camera on front and back sidesWhat needs improvement:- More apps in the App World. A search for what I think are some very broad categories of apps you might want on a tablet were found lacking (note-taking apps, video messaging). I mostly relied on web apps such as Gmail, Twitter, and Google Reader.- Type ahead. I never realized how much I rely on auto-correct on my iPhone until I experienced the frustration of my own inaccurate typing on the Playbook. It was frustrating to not be able to type emails of great length because the process was too slow trying to correct my mistakes. This basically makes the Playbook a device suited for consuming content rather than creating it.- Sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I'd like. With clean fingers and a clean screen, I might get 1 length unit of page scroll for every 1.5 length units my finger swiped.If the pricepoint is right for you and you are primarily interested in reading stuff online, then the Playbook may be right for you.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "not working", "Author": "Jorge Martinez", "ReviewID": "R2OS5CNAW5WD46", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I need the guarantee of blackberry tablet as I do, please inform me where you communicate. thanks, need not be as warranty and return", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am very happy", "Author": "MARIO AUGUSTO BARBI", "ReviewID": "R2P4WZBAOKZKR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Exactly what I was looking for; the packaging was very good and working perfectly; I would recommend to my friends", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good!", "Author": "Luisare84", "ReviewID": "R1RMNY8WUBI1YL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The item was at a perfect condition. works great with no defects or scratches on it!

If you have a Blackberry phone, it can now function as a mouse and keypad giving you more precise control than any other tablet. I bought this thing because I have a Blackberry phone and it was only $199.99.  The 7\" size is superb saving weight and space--holding this lightweight device is easy even for extended periods. I cannot imagine why anyone would want a larger screen--this one is incredibly readable. I've been using the device for at least a month and rather than reaching for my laptop, I use the Playbook instead.  I'd tried all the other tablets (including iPad) over the past few months and was uninspired by all.  Obviously when the Playbook is selling at a $200 price point it's being sold for far less than manufacturing cost--Blackberry is trying to clear the warehouse of reportedly millions of unsold devices--better buy yours before they're gone or the price increases.

Everything is hard.Seeing as the entire point of a tablet is simplicity, I found this aspect really odd.An example: You can download your photos quite easily from another computer, which is nice to cart around old pics you like to have around. But while with an ipad or galaxy, then viewing them, and moving between them, is ease itself, with the playbook, it's a struggle. There might be an app that makes this work, but I've been through four and nothing is satisfactory. I never for a minute considered that this might be a problem. It isn't with anything else I own. after all.And there are the truly bizarre, no Skype, no Netflix, both you'd think would be included in any product today.The technical support is poor.

I don't know if what I did made the difference, but .... with wifi on and connected I enabled pop-ups.  Then I used the cloud reader link on the \"app/link\" page I'd created earlier, went to downloaded books (I'd \"downloaded\" four)and opened one and read some.  Pages don't turn well but it's doable if not fun.  Then I turned off the wireless but did NOT close the browser and was able to go back to it and continue reading.  However, I found that if you close the browser app you're done for; poof, it's all gone when you reopen it and you have to enable/connect the wifi and start all over again to get back to your book.  Oh, and Bing maps has finally more or less located me - twice and briefly - a few blocks from my actual location.Update:  Upon further reflection I'm going to upgrade the rating to .... 3 stars, I think.  It does a nice job with photos and videos (and music) and I don't expect something of this size to be much of a \"work machine\", just more of a fun \"take along\" as RugRat says, something in size between my iPhone (too small for much photo/video stuff) and my iPad (too big for a purse)and with somehow a sleeker feel and a little more easy versatility than my Kindle Fire.  Yahoo (sbcglobal) and gmail access work, web browsing is fine.  BUT - the location service still doesn't work, Blackberry tech support gets NEGATIVE stars, and the biggest problem - a deal-breaker really - is that I can't read my Kindle books without internet access.  I'm not going to carry around TWO 7\" tablets, and in the war of Books vs Videos Books win hands down.Original Review:  I've had this for two days and so far I like the look and feel but not much else.  I've done two hard resets and made three calls to tech support who were if possible worse than useless.  On the first call I got a live person, I asked a question, was put on hold and disconnected after 6 minutes.  The second call disconnected AT the transfer, and on the third call I got a human again who mostly said things like \"yeah, maybe\" and \"I don't know\" and couldn't even explain or walk me through some of the basic steps I'd already done.  So far Bing Maps cannot \"locate\" me - at all - even though the other GPS-less but wifi devices next to it can.  Granted they are sometimes a few blocks off, but the Playbook just says \"unable to locate - please try later\" (I think trying repeatedly over two days is enough). And, try as I might, I've been unable to read - or even find - my supposedly \"downloaded to the device\" Kindle books while offline despite hours of searching and trying possible online \"solutions \" or work-arounds. They may have worked for some, but not on the unit I have.  When I asked the Blackberry rep for help with this issue he clearly didn't have any idea and first had me go through a bunch of things I'd already done that didn't work.  When I really pressed him on the subject - because if I can't figure out a way to do this I'm most likely returning it - he put me on hold for a few minutes and came back to say there was \"no way I could read the Kindle books on the playbook.\"", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be aware of extra charge to tether to your phone", "Author": "ColoMom", "ReviewID": "RZVAFGQYQ78PP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently bought this from the manufacturer on sale.  I have been looking at various notebooks for a while but no way would I pay $600 (I got the 32 GB) for any of them.  I really wanted it for travel so I would not need to take my laptop with me and didn't necessarily need to find a wi-fi hotspot on the road.  I chose the playbook for a couple of reasons--1)  I really like the size of it (about as big as a half-sheet of paper)very easily fits in my purse 2) I liked the idea that you could tether it to your Blackberry phone for data (the idea, of course, being that I didn't have to buy a separate data plan.)  That second reason for buying it is why I am only giving it 3 stars--what they don't tell you (or, at least I never saw anywhere, is that you have to PAY EXTRA to tether it to your phone for data (or at least with ATT you do)--so much for not having to buy another plan!!  I don't know yet how much as I haven't had to travel since getting it and have just been using it with wi-fi, I just thought I'd try it and that is how I discovered the need for an extended plan.  This is fairly annoying to me!!  Otherwise, I do like it, it does easily sync information (like notepad, etc) with the phone and if you're on a wi-fi network, connects and browses well on the internet.  As other reviewers noted, it is a little short on apps but there are still quite a few--enough anyway to make me happy enough and my kids have had great fun playing on it.  So anyway, even if I end up not paying extra to tether to my phone to it, I guess it can provide entertainment when we're traveling!  Just thought a little heads up on the data plan would be nice.**update**  haven't tried this yet but another reviewer recommended looking at crackberry.com/playbook-bridge to get around the tethering issue.  I looked at it and think that will probably work for me.  If it does I will likely be back to raise my rating to 4 or maybe even 5 stars.  This really is a neat little item!**more update**well, I've tried several workarounds to this issue none of which worked for me.  Probably who I should ding is ATT not the playbook but anyway this isn't going to work for right now the way I wanted it to so I'm not really happy either way.

The primary reason for buying it was the promise of android apps. I thought that the OS looks good, and with a choice of apps, it is a steal, considering the hardware. How very wrong i was!The hardware is indeed great for the price. You get 2 cameras, a stunning display, a 1ghz dual core processor and 1 gig of RAM. The OS, for the most part, does a great job of using this hardware potential. So what's the problem?Apps, as you might have guessed. What use are 2 cameras when you don't even get skype, or any other video chat app, coming to think of it. Yeah, there is the official video chat, but it is works only with playbooks playbook,rendering it more or less useless.Appworld is a joke, seriously! I did see a lot of new apps after the release of OS 2.0, but most of them are completely useless. Most look as if devs made them only to get a free playbook.No kindle, no netflix, hulu, no decent note taking app except evernote, not even google maps. What they have, like angry birds, are overpriced. $4.99 for angry birds,really?? It appears that devs are not too interested in making any apps for the playbook.So comparing to iOS or android, the apps selection is ludicrous.Problem is, no improvement is in sight.The android apps were only the ones devs submitted, which does not seem to be a large number.There are some games, but the collection is very limited.The android app player can get temperamental at times.On the plus side, the OS is actually snappy. Closing an app is as easy as it gets. The video and sound quality is pretty good, so is office app.If all you need is a device that you could put in your pocket and use for email, reading and editing word and excel docs and surf the net?( with wifi), this is the device for you. If you want something which can be versatile in use, with a big app selection, look elsewhere.

I have had my 32GB wifi model for about a week.  (I bought it from Staples.)  The physical tablet is four and half stars.  It is a perfect size, the screen is beautiful and the weight is ideal.  It is roughly the same size as a 3d generation Kindle.  Half a star deduction for the top buttons which do not feel like they are very high quality.Included in the box are some brief instructions, a folding blade charger, a micro-usb cable, a nice foam pouch case, and a screen wipe.There are a few negatives: (1) a lot of websites think the browser is for a blackberry phone and auto-direct you to the mobile version of their website; (2) the browser does not allow you to rename bookmarks, reorder bookmarks, or put bookmarks into folders; (3) the GPS is not yet functional - it's in there, but has not been enabled by the firmware - this feature is \"coming soon\"; (4) there are two very high quality cameras, but no videochat software; (5) there is no Kindle App.When linked to your blackberry smartphone via bluetooth you get a mirror of the email, contacts, calendar, to do, and memo pad found on your phone.  You also get access to files on your blackberry (even the microSD), but cannot open video or audio files - just documents.  There is something called the \"bridge browser\" which allows you to surf the internet through your phone's web browser and 3G connection.  This is different from tethering because the carriers don't charge for it.  The PlayBook also allows tethering which gives you full data access (although not to app world for some reason).  Some carriers charge for tethering, some don't.  Apparently AT&T; doesn't even allow their customers to use the Bridge - which is a HUGE drawback if you happen to have AT&T.;The lack of apps is the largest drawback.  As of this writing, there is no Kindle app (a huge drawback), no Skype app, no Netflix app, and no MLB app.  You cannot watch Netflix videos on the browser or your MLB.tv subscription.  You CAN watch amazon instant videos.  They look beautiful.There is a huge amount of potential, but unfortunately a lot of that is \"coming soon\" - and isn't there right now.  When is \"soon\"?  Nobody knows.  One good thing is that firmware updates come out every few days and each adds functions.  Since there are no carriers involved in rolling out firmware, RIM has full control and can do it quickly.Some have mentioned problems with battery charging - I haven't had that.  My battery charges pretty quickly and goes to 100%.  I can use it for nearly 15 hours before I get a low battery warning with about 10% left.  Some have complained about the power button being hard to push.  Mine is small and recessed, but I can easily push it.The screen is absolutely beautiful.You can use your existing blackberry charger, but it will take much longer to charge.  The included charger can charge your existing blackberry (micro USB) without harm.  There is also an available quick-charging stand.The BlackBerry PlayBook could be an amazing tablet - five stars.  However, it is now a bit of a work in progress at this point and I can only give it three stars as it currently stands - It is only OK.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "High hopes dashed to bits", "Author": "BB Fan", "ReviewID": "R2U07EKOXYRBP6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I waited almost a year before getting the 64GB Blackberry Playbook.  In Jan 2012 Blackberry put it on sale for $299, a $400 drop in price.  Since I am a Blackberry diehard who has had one since the monochrome sidewheel days and my whole family is on Blackberry devices I figured that it would fit nicely in my ecosystem.Before purchasing it, even at 57% off the regular price I laid out some reasons for buying it:1) Play audio2) Play video3) Browse web4) Use Blackberry Bridge to do emails to stop hurting my Blackberry thumb!I received it on Friday and here's how it went:1) Audio: It won't play about 5% of my MP3s.  The screen shows that it is progressing through the song yet there is no audio.2) Video: It won't play about 30% of my videos.  None of the .MKV videos work and some of the .AVIs won't work at all while others show a silent movie that I attribute back to whatever it is that won't play audio files.3) The fastest loading page on the web is arguably the Google home page at [...]  On the Playbook this page takes 3-4 minutes to load with the Playbook within arm's length of the wireless router. The Playbook is touted for having Flash support but only after I turned Flash off and JavaScript off would Google load in a few seconds.4) Blackberry Bridge: Doesn't work for me. Although this not working may be attributable to my using a Blackberry that's a few years old and doesn't have as much memory as the latest, the bottom line is that it still didn't work because my Blackberry phone did not have enough memory to run the required software and I'm not about to go out and buy a new Blackberry phone just to make the Playbook work.and more5) Screen sensitivity: Almost half the time the screen would not respond to my finger swipes and pokes.  Very frustrating.  This reminds me of when I first excitedly tried the Blackberry Storm and the onscreen phone dialpad would not recognize pokes at the \"3\" digit...for 20 minutes straight.  But that's a different review.6) App World: I downloaded just about all the free programs I was vaguely interested in - a dozen.

Typing an email or document?  Nope.  It is too cumbersome and the fat finger effect is too rampant.  It doesn't self correct or auto capitalize or self punctuate the end of a sentence.  It will let you know that a word is misspelled, but then what?  I've double clicked on it and it doesn't offer a substitute for the misspelled word.  Even my Iphone is more user friendly in this respect.  The PB is fast and I do like the ability to move from app to app without shutting the app down, but I could do this with my $300 laptop.  The picture display and resolution is great for watching videos or movies but once again my laptop's screen is bigger.  Gaming would be great if the app store was as big as Apple's, hopefully it will get there one day as so many of these units were sold due to the drop in pricing.  I will give it this, the speakers blow my laptop's speakers away (maybe because it is a $300 laptop)!  It excels as a ereader but once again the pickings are slim.  I'm sure it will make an excellent travel companion since it's lighter than a laptop and easier to manage and it's a great tool if you can tether it to your phone or you must be in a wifi friendly environment to connect to the web.  Speaking of which, the browser is pretty user friendly but has frozen up on me a few times.  So if you know what you need a tablet for and can get good use out of it you could not go wrong with the PB, it is fast and user friendly and has a great picture quality.

At the price I got it at, you can't beat what I thought was a decent little tablet!I'm not gonna say it was a bad choice but I can say that it's not a great one either. This is my first ever review and I've bought tons of stuff on amazon. I'm a gadget geek and in the IT industry so I get a lot of exposure on all products. I have 2 iPads, a windows tablet w Windows 8 on it, an android tab and now a blackberry play book.The play book is a great size and perfect for travel, it's light and responsive to touch and launching applications. I'm not 100% on how to access android apps if that's even possible but I've read you could... Although I'm not able to figure it out yet. In the blackberry App Store there are a few things that are cool, but it's limited. Right off the bat, no Netflix! Probably not a huge deal for some but for, I watch a lot of Netflix stuff.... There is an app but it only allows you choose a movie, then you gotta buy an app to watch it... Fail!I was attracted to it due to their neat commercials about the OS. The OS is not that great, it lacks a lot of luster and basic features you see on an iPad or android. I know it's geared toward business but in my opinion and as it turns out for RIM, it's not the opinion of most, it needs to be geared toward the largest crowd w available business-centric apps. Sorry blackberry play book, not doing so hot!I love my iPad and its not my everyday piece of computer technology, I use it at home, if I'm taking a trip that's not work related or taking a poop! (Honestly!) The OS is super smooth and you can't it's consumer friendly-ness.All in all, if you can buy the play book for $100, go for it! It's a nice little tablet, but if its not on sale or a low price and your thinking about paying over $200 for it, save your money and buy the iPad mini that just came out, same size and way more bang for your buck.

After playing with it I fell in love.  Unfortunately, I loved my BlackBerry too, and didn't want to switch to the IPhone.  When the PlayBook came out, I couldn't have been more excited.  Not only did I expect to get the same functionality from it that I got out of my IPOD, but now I could Tether the too devices and really get productive.Okay, so as far as the Tethering (BlackBerry Bridge)function goes, I really do love the tablet.  I'm a 6'5 with large hands, and pushing small buttons has never been easy.  Needless to say, this is not a problem when using the tablet.  Additionally, the browsers is great, and the speeds are pretty good, considering everything has to boune off the phone.As for the apps, and functionality from the business side, this thing is REALLY disapointing.  First off, the BlackBerry Desktop Software is entirely under developed.  So much so, that I think BlackBerry may have actually hurt themselves by releasing this tablet.  Secondly, the available Apps are pretty poor, and most developers are really focused on the Android and IPOD/IPAD.  Third, a HUGE number of the BlackBerry Apps are not supported on the Tablet.As for Media and Music, it appears that only Apple can support protected media files.  If you plan on playing some music, or any major motion picture, you will need to purchase a software to crack the files before you can upload and play them on your Playbook.Finally, if you bump into trouble good luck.  I spent nearly 6 hours trying to resolve a simple problem, and finally gave up.  The frustrating part wasn't that the tech support guy was weak, it was that getting a number to call them was just about impossible.  If you buy the PlayBook, make sure you register your product during setup so that you know how to reach tech support.All and all, I think the Playbook is worth about $200 (tethering function is seemless).  Quite frankly, I'm planning on returning mine and spending the extra money for the IPAD.

The BlackBerry Bridge functionality is slick but very slow at times, taking seconds just to display an email or BBM message, randomly, and also quite buggy, frequently requiring me to close the particular app (Messages or BBM, for example) and restart it to get it to work correctly.

Maybe I just got used to the iPad, but I sincerely believe it's a much better tablet despite its hefty cost.  10\" in my mind is minimum that any tablet screen size should practically be, and the Playbook for this reason doesn't cut it.

However, I have played with it considerably in the form of its software emulator.  I can speak of the hardware itself, since it was emulated by my desktop PC, and I can't speak of the apps themselves, since there were none; but what I was able to see was the web browser and user interface.  In that regards, the Playbook seems well laid out and organized, and it seems easy to use.  Compared to the iPad (which I've used only in the Apple store), there are neat gestures that increases the efficiency of the interface.  It took a while to realize that some actions are activated by gestures, but once you get the hang of it, the tablet becomes very fluid.  It would be nice to have a keyboard that can be reconfigured in terms of size.  It does take up a considerable portion of the screen, but given the intrinsic touchscreen interface and gestures, the keyboard is not going to be of primary concern.  Before I got involved in the developer's program, the Playbook didn't really interest me, but once I got a chance to use the software emulator, I have to admit that I'm looking forward to getting mine in the mail.  Hopefully I will be able to update this review soon, once I get it.UPDATE:  I got my free Playbook.  It is as fluid as I had expect, but having it my hand gives me a better feel on how it handles.  RIM went the 7\" format which both pros and con.  Obviously it make the UI smaller, but that is not necessarily the end all or be all of the design.  The smaller size makes this a very mobile, hand portable platform.  Moreover, the smaller screen size make everything much more smooth and crisp.  Given the landscape layout, rather than thinking of the devise has having a small screen, I think it's more appropriate to think if it as just the upper half of the iPad in portrait mode.The hardware is fast and smooth.  There is no lag, even with multiple apps open at the same time.  And the gestures make moving from app to app smooth and efforts.  The playbook still need some way to scroll, as with a trackpad, but otherwise this is a easy to use device.  My only wish is for a built-in GPS to make this a perfect travel companion.The software does need some tweaking, but this is not fundamental limitations.  Of course, the lack of an native email viewer is noticeable, but this is not a permanent situation and is a very fixable problem.  And, as so many have pointed out, there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android, but the number of apps is a false issue.  The real question is on RIMs strategy to attract developers and how does their hardware make app useful.  On the first, as a app developer myself,  my one concern is that RIM has a very awkward process to upload and maintain have apps.  It's no worse than Apple's, but Apple is in a position to maintain their arrogance.  Hopefuly RIM will cleanup their process as they go from \"catch up\" mode to \"polishing\" mode.  However, on the latter question on the hardware, I can say the the hardware and UI is very powerful, much better than that in iOS, and it should enable very, very nice apps.  And given RIM's enterprise level infrastructure, particularly with security, I think this could be a truly powerful business platform.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "The product is not user friendly.", "Author": "Wendy H Wang", "ReviewID": "R1CE3IONMAHB0U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the size.

Not only is blackberry app world lacking in polished applications, but most of what is offered costs 99 cents and up. No skype or any of the popular FREE apps available for android or Apple and NO NETFLIX!!!!!! You can't even watch in the browser because there is no silverlight support. Don't be fooled by the reviews that say \"it now has android support\". This means nothing because you are limited by blackberry's weak application offerings....there is no android market here.I spent $199 for this and it doesn't get much use (my ipad gets used often). Battery life sucks with the playbook (3 hours max) and my tablet arrived with one green stuck pixel which looks lovely on a black background.The browser does play flash well however flash enabled sites often become tiresome to navigate because of the limited screen space and tiny controls. An example of this would be zillow.com. Try pinch, zoom, and scroll without opening advertisements or other content. Unless you have dainty hands it's impossible. Another reason applications are important, so the user can easily control what they are trying to accomplish.This review comes post install of the 2.0 update which has been waited for with bated breath by many and was suppose to \"change everything\" in terms of this tablet's usability (or lack thereof). With the 2.0 update you get a native mail app and buggy \"android support\". Pretty insulting for my $200 dollar investment.The volume (sound volume) rocker on top of the device lags horribly. Push the up or down buttons to change the loudness, and the effect happens 5-6 seconds later, along with a volume slider bar that appears on screen. You either end up turning the volume way too high or way too soft because of this.The OS software on the playbook takes about 3 or 4 minutes to boot up. Quite possibly the longest boot times in mainstream computing history. Reminds me of the old days with windoze 98 on an i386.These are my observations about the device based on my usage, and in comparison to the iPad/iOS and Android powered tablets (of which I also own). Some people seem giddy with excitement about the playbook while others are in my camp of disappointment  (based on review readings here and elsewhere) so your mileage may very based on your level of standards, and whether or not you are a RIM fanboy or employee (the not-so-good reviews for this device are trolled by such people if you look closely)I have no allegiance to any device or company but this thing was clearly rushed to market. Lovely colors, smooth swiping, and 1080p mean nothing if utility is lacking. Software wise it's a joke, an expensive joke on ME. You can decide if the bargain basement price is enough to make the same mistake.If blackberry can fix the battery life and volume control with another update and give me Skype and Netflix for F R E E (don't nickel and dime me with your app world!!!!) then I'll change my review to 4 stars. The hardware has promise, The software as of today (even after the long awaited v2.0) does not.HINT: F R E E GPS software, to take advantage of the unutilized GPS capabilities of the playbook would get 5 stars. Why not sweeten the deal for those who do not want to play games like asphalt 6 and moden combat 2, of which you are also giving away.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "damaged, i knew it is used but i just want this works", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R1SDNALMMDOWCT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "yo queria una playbook y decidi comprar usada por la diferencia de precio pero recibi una da\u00f1ada.al comprar usada pense q eran de poco uso ademas en las descripciones dice como nueva pero no fue asi.era suficiente que funcionara bieni wanted a playbook and decided to buy a used one because the price but i got a damaged playbook.i thought buying this means pretty used, the descriptions say like new but it wasnt!i just wanted this works", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "looks pretty good", "Author": "compgirl", "ReviewID": "R3AJCBWSIO678R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This looks like a pretty good tablet.
