Just get this tablet fully charged when you take it to a coffee shop and you are good for 7 to 8 hours even if you are watching videos intermittently. The fact that this is windows 8 tablet, you can be productive where ever you are - use word, excel, do programming, install software etc.,stuff you can't do with Android or iOS based tablets. In short, if you are looking for a tablet where you would like to do what you do at work, then I believe this tablet will not disappoint you. Just a word of caution - avoid using this tablet for long hours as it may strain your eyes since the size of the screen is small compared to your desktop computers.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Bargain Outlet\"", "ReviewID": "R1UKPVP5874U5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent tablet. It performs well for all Apps from the Windows store.  It easily upgraded to Windows 8.1.  I love the keyboard docking station.
