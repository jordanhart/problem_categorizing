{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good budget tablet-- just don't drop it!", "Author": "William Adams", "ReviewID": "R1BTIWVD4N6Z4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this tablet for a little over 24 hours so these are my first impressions...The Coby Kyros MID9742-8 is part of Coby's 3rd generation of Android tablets. I also have one of their 2nd generation tablets, the MID7022-4G, a 7\" capacitive touchscreen tablet running Android 2.3, but I wanted a bigger screen.  The 9742 is an upgrade in many ways:* larger screen (9.7\" vs 7\")* higher resolution (1024x768 vs 800x480)* more memory (1GB vs 512MB)* more storage (8GB vs 4GB)* newer version of Android (4.0 vs 2.3)The processor is clocked the same (1Ghz), but instead of the old Telechips ARMv6 chip used in the 7022, the 9742 uses a newer Allwinner A10 ARMv7 chip.  It's still not a powerhouse, by any stretch, but clock-for-clock the newer ARMv7 chip is more powerful.  For example, my old 7022 can't run Netflix without the video looking like a slideshow.  The new 9742 can run Netflix with only the occasional hiccup.The Allwinner A10 CPU used in the 9742 uses a Mali-400 MP GPU (same as is used on the Samsung Galaxy SII), so it should be able to run pretty much any current game, though I haven't tested it in this regard yet.I can confirm what another reviewer said, that com.adobe.flashplayer_111115007.apk works to install and run Adobe Flash. I found this version for download at 1mobile.com.  This was the first one I tried and it worked so I didn't test any other versions.As others have mentioned, Coby tablets do NOT have access to the Android Market (now called Google Play) nor does it come with any of the Google apps (GMail, Maps, Talk, Voice, etc).  Instead, the 9742 comes with a GetJar app, but the selection is pretty thin there. You can download the Amazon App Store app, though, to get Netflix and Angry Birds.  You can also download apps from other sites like the aforementioned 1mobile.com where I found Adobe Flash and a few other apps that weren't available on the Amazon store.The only big downside to this tablet for me is that it feels pretty flimsy.  The screen side is nice and rigid, but the backside is made of very thin plastic.  You can feel it flex beneath your fingertips with minimal pressure.  And occasionally you can feel/hear a creak along the edges when you grip it, like the two halves don't quite fit together.  True, the thin plastic body contributes to the tablet only weighing a pound-- about 30% less than most other 10\" tablets-- but I think I'd take a little extra heft in exchange for an aluminum or thicker plastic body.  I don't have much confidence it would survive a fall.All in all, for around $230 (as of April 2012), I think the Coby MID9742-8 is a good value.  I wouldn't pay any more than that for it, though, since you can a get dual-core Acer A200 tablet for around $300 (again, as of April 2012).UPDATE (May 3, 2012): After having the tablet for over a week it turns out that I've been unable to get any version of Adobe Flash to work properly.  They seem to install, and sometimes they will load in the browser and start playing videos, but they all inevitably crash within minutes, hanging the browser and requiring a force stop within the \"Manage Apps\" settings menu.  From searching various Android forums on the web, this seems to be a common problem among Allwinner A10-based Android 4.0 tablets.  I'll update again later if I can find a working version.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "AVOID COBY ELECTRONICS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!", "Author": "Frustrated Mom", "ReviewID": "R19HNH2CZXGONI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My 9 year old daughter saved her money for months because she really wanted a tablet.  We researched all the tablets online and thought with the great reviews and great price this was the one.  WE WILL NEVER BUY FROM COBY ELECTRONICS AGAIN!  They are the worst company in the whole world.  They DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT!  I have never written a review on a product before in my life and hope I won't ever have to again.  I don't want anyone to go through what we have went through.  We have sent my daughter's tablet in 2 times.  We had to pay for it to be sent in the first time.  We are still waiting for it to be returned this 2nd time.  I have turned them into the BBB and the Attorney General.  All my daughter wanted was a tablet she could use.  It has been such a disappointment and so frustrating!", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor man's version of the iPad", "Author": "piratesmvp04", "ReviewID": "R3B36CJMUTGX5H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already had a Dell Latitude ST tablet (upgraded to Windows 8) that I use for doing real work and school, but after seeing my friend play games on her Galaxy Note 10.1, I decided I wanted to get a tablet for gaming. My budget was less than $150, and I wanted a large screen (not a 7\"). I had read about Coby devices before, and when I saw this tablet in the Amazon Warehouse for $120 and free shipping, I was sold on it. Here's a brief overview of some of the things I use it for.GAMESThis is the primary reason I bought this tablet, and surprisingly, it is not a bad performer. It runs on an Allwinner A10 CPU which surprisingly features the same GPU as the Galaxy S2. I notice that in the 3D performance; it is much better than what you would expect for a sub-$200 tablet. Currently, I have Contract Killer, Family Feud & Friends, ShadowGun, Temple Run 2, Blood and Glory, and World at Arms. All run pretty smoothly, though certainly not as smoothly as an iPad or Galaxy Tab/Note. Touch responsive was very good. The only downside is that some games take longer to load, but once it has loaded, it runs fine. All of these games I obtained from the 1Mobile market; more on that later.DESIGNThere is nothing special about the design of this tablet. It is completely made of plastic except for the glass touchscreen. There are three buttons on the top: power, volume, and a back button. The back panel has a stereo speaker grill, but the speakers are very close to each other, so there's not much of a stereo effect. The ports include an AC adapter, micro-SD card slot, micro-USB which you can use to connect to a computer or external media via the included adapter, micro-HDMI port, and 3.5mm headphone jack. The tablet does feel heavier on the right side due to the battery placement inside the tablet.SOFTWAREThis tablet comes with Android 4.0 which is really nice because it is more designed for tablets. Google clearly tried to bring as many elements of a full desktop computing experience without compromising ease of use. However, the major flaw in this particular tablet is that it does not come with the Google Play store. A such, it also does not come with Google apps like Youtube, GMail, etc. Fortunately, you can download third party app stores. The tablet comes with GetJar which is totally useless in my opinion. I installed the 1Mobile market which has just about every free app from the Google Play store. Installation is simple; you just go to [... ]in your browser and click the big button to download and install. As long as you don't need any apps that you need to purchase, you should be just fine with the 1Mobile store. If you do need any of the paid apps, you can get a few from the Amazon App Store, but I have found that most of the best apps on that store are designed specifically for Kindle Fire devices and will not work with any other Android device.MEDIAI usually use my Latitude ST for watching movies because it has the 16:10 display. However, I did try connecting to my media server with this device, and it streams it perfectly. The only downside is that you get the black bars. However, it still plays. The ES File Manager connects to my Samba folders on my Ubuntu server seamlessly. It actually works much better than I was expecting.REAL WORKAlthough I did get this tablet for gaming, I do plan to use it for some school-related stuff. I downloaded the Kno app, and textbooks look pretty decent on it. The tablet has the same resolution as the iPad 2 (1024x768) so it should definitely be serviceable for that. The Chrome browser also works pretty well, but it can be laggy at times. It is still usable though.CONCLUSIONOverall, I am very pleased with this tablet. Gaming performance is great and battery life is not too bad either (about 5-6 hours) for the price. This tablet has the same screen size as the iPad and is definitely a good cheap alternative for those who want and iPad but cannot afford it. All in all, my $120 were well spent. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because of the lack of the Google Play store, but as I stated earlier, you can download the 1Mobile store and get just about every app that Google Play has. If you're looking for a cheap tablet, this is definitely one I would recommend.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "bought for our kids instead of DS", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R2QK14SGV6XJAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, we`re not new technology pros. We never owned a tablet before and had to search a lot about this new technology in order to choose a tablet. We had heard the name android maybe a month before we decided to look into this stuff.We bought this tablet instead of a DS for our 7 year old. So it`s mostly for games and reading. We`ve had it for 2 months.We`re very happy with it. We`ve downloaded about 20 kids mostly educational free/lite games and some free e.books and everything works great and we have 126 Mb used for 855 MB free. Why is there only 0.98 GB available for apps ? not sure, but it`s enough for us since we can also use the SDHC card. Some apps can be moved really easily to SDHC card from the tablet directly, some won`t (we try to avoid those, and it`s not so hard). Books go on SDHC card.We only go on the internet to download games or books. We buy our apps and e.books on amazon.com.It takes some time to download, but not sure how much more it takes compared to other tablets.We got a child protection app for 1 $ so our kids wouldn`t be able to go everywhere (does the job it`s supposed to, but not 100% happy with it, for detail, see my comment on it - I gave it a 3 stars : KidsCare - Child Lock )We also tried to go with the 7 inch 2.3. But not happy with it, we ended shipping it back and bought another 9742. In the end, it`s cheaper than a DS, since the games are MUCH cheaper and still very educational and fun.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good one", "Author": "Pravat", "ReviewID": "R3AHDPWO8DEXJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No good , not able to down load most apps for the android. very slow. hangs up in the in the middle of the operation.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the greatest tablet out there", "Author": "Brian Edwards", "ReviewID": "RFK29IYJRKIT5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I originally purchased this tablet because of the price and it had Android 4.0 (ICS) OS.

I've read most of the reviews and I agree with most.  I have ran into a few apps that aren't supported, such as the google chrome browser (that's really a shame....firefox works though), but the number one complaint isn't actually a problem....access to the google market. It's not already on there but you can do it without rooting your device...here's how to do it and please read all the instructions first because it's a little different for the newer coby tablets. 1)  Follow the link below. (or type \"how can i install google play on my coby kyros tablet\" in the youtube search window).  2) Expand the window below the video and click on ALL OF THE LINKS except the first one (it's the original google play .apk I think)  3) Once you chase the links and download them it will ask you to install them....Click install (that's where it's different from the video.  For whatever reason, it's not a zip file so you can launch them as soon as you download them)  4) Once all of the files have been installed, you have to reboot (by simply holding down the power button and choose shut down).  5) Power it back on and once it comes back on, you will get something that asks you if you want to use the launcher or setup wizard (it may even ask you that sometime during the install).  At whatever point you see this screen, check the \"use this by default\" box and then click launcher.  6) Once back on your desktop, go the the apps section and you should see the google market icon.  Everything from there is the same as any other android device, with the exception of a few non-supported apps.  Netflix will install but won't launch.  That's also one of the links under the video, but I haven't got it to work yet. If you do, please reply let me know how to do it.  Here's the link:  [...]All and all, I'm pretty happy with it.  Yes, it's  a little jerky and, yes, sometimes it lags.  I haven't taken a picture with it yet, but the settings look like a joke (I mean really...2MP)!! I have better quality with my phone so I take pictures with my phone.  I did download the \"watch espn\" app and watched the Clemson vs South Carolina game on my tablet while watching the Oklahoma vs OSU game on TV. The picture quality was outstanding (although I'm sure it depends on your internet speeds).

Aesthetically it is beautiful, all black, Android 4 is very nice. The 16 ounce (1 lb) weight is VERY nice, noticeably lighter to hold compared to the ipad or Toshiba Thrive. In fact, I decided 16 ounces is the sweet spot for what I will tolerate in a table, thus today I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 inch (same weight as this Coby tablet). Good battery life, lots of ports and memory expansion capability. But the HUGE negative for me involved three things: music played off the internal memory would regularly stutter-- I suspect because this is just a single CPU, not dual or quad core CPU like more expensive tablets; noticeable lag when trying to do some simple sketch drawing with a simple drawing app-- unacceptable because i wanted a tablet for sketching and learning to draw storyboards. Again, the lag when drawing almost certainly caused by just having a single CPU processor. What made me return it though was that it does not have the Android Marketplace, now known as Google Play-- so I was unable to get some apps that I had already purchased off Google Play, but heck I would have been willing to even buy them again off the Coby marketplace app but the apps I wanted were not available through the marketplace app Coby has on the tablet; I wanted Sketchbook Express or Sketchbook Pro, but no way to get them. I found the installed marketplace app woefully lacking in useful apps. In summary-- too slow a processor to even enjoy listening to music, and lack of Android Marketplace means you are locked out of some of the best apps available, or not available in the case of this tablet. Why did Coby decide to not allow the Android Marketplace (Google Play), I just do not get that, because many other tablets allow that (Samsung Galaxy Tablets, Toshiba, etc). So glad I returned this. You get what you pay for. I decided to fork up the cash and today I ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 inch.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "I had such high hopes for this tablet", "Author": "J. Morgan \"Professional amateur\"", "ReviewID": "RWBGCTDHUMC6L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, mom can't use her computer, so I thought I'd get this for her in hopes that she would be able to use it.  It is definitely simpler then the computer (which she has problems turning on), since there is no mouse or separate monitor to worry about, and has a very straightforward UI, so for $200 I felt it was worth a shot.  She doesn't need BT (and wouldn't be able to figure out the pairing anyway), so that isn't a problem.Upon unboxing the tablet I was, at first, delighted.  It comes with all of the necessary accessories, including earbuds (not really necessary, but nice), screen wipe, protective pouch, and TWO USB cables, one extension, and the other normal.  The tablet itself is quite attractive.  It is roughly iPad-thin, and roughly iPad-weight.  I don't know the exact dimensions, but it feels a lot like a gen1 iPad in your hand.  I charged it, as requested, and powered it on.First thing I noticed is that the lighting is uneven along the bottom edge of the display.  It is an unfortunate quality issue, but certainly no deal-breaker since it doesn't affect the usability of the device.  It is merely unattractive if you pay attention to it.  For $200, I can deal with that.  If you want an iPad, or a Galaxy Tab, pay for one.I loved ICS.  The UI is very nice, although it takes a little getting used to coming from Gingerbread/Cyanogenmod which is what I use on my phone.  But, very nice.  The cameras (front and rear) are low quality, but work fine.  The display size is perfect for mom.  I would have got her an Amazon Kindle Fire, but feared it would be too small for her old eyes.HDMI works well, much better than on my DroidX, which (stock anyway) offered only HDMI out of certain videos.  After rooting and Romming it, I can mirror anything, but only to the TV, the screen of the droid is blank when doing this.  This tablet, on the other hand, allows you to mirror the entire screen, internally and externally, which is very nice.  High-quality video is no problem at all.  It never stuttered once, even playing an HD video that my DroidX could not seem to handle.I did not test this, but the tablet allows you to plug in (via the short USB extension pigtail that comes in the box) an external keyboard or mouse.  Nice!Then the screen started glitching on me.  I couldn't swipe, because the screen kept registering taps.  No matter how smoothly I swiped/dragged across the screen, I continued to see this intermittent issue, especially when the device was warm.  That is kind-of a dealbreaker.Then, I tested the microSD slot. It wouldn't recognize my card.  I put the card in the PC - just fine.  Put it back in the tablet and it told me it was damaged.  Fine, format.  Still wouldn't mount.  Put it back in the PC - still fine, and not formatted at all - contents still there.  What?  Tried a different card.  Same thing.  Sometimes, if you hold your mouth right, it will mount the card.  Usually, it will not.  Plus, every time I format it, it not only formats the external SD card, but the internal as well.  Pictures and all.  Nice.  Of course, it won't let me copy the pics off of the internal card to the external.  Finally I managed to share one with dropbox instead of copying it via the file manager, but this isn't simple or user-friendly to do, since there is no obvious way to share it from within the gallery app.Once when I tried turning it on it told me the battery was dead.  Plugged it in, and it said the battery was full?  Powered it on and unplugged it, and the battery is, indeed, full.  So why wouldn't it recognize that and power on prior to plugging it in?Ok, it doesn't have access to the Google Play market, but you can install the Amazon App Store on it.  Not as good, but better than the built-in GetJar app store.  And I was looking forward to rooting it and putting the Google Play store on there when I finished testing. Never got that far.ROMming the Coby Gen3:[...]I'm so sad.  I really, really wanted this tablet to be good.  But, I need more than a pretty chassis.  Beauty really is only skin-deep.  From a quality-control standpoint, this device is really, really, really really really bad.

The 1Mobile Market has everything Google Play has plus more. Also for the voice search you can download the .apk file off of the internet and transfer it to your SD or internal memory.  Great HD, but it has a micro HDMI not a HDMI. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a budget buy or people with not so much experience in the tablet world. Advanced users with a larger budget should not get this tablet. I took away one star because Google does not support this tablet, but that's not really Coby's fault. Other than that it is a very sturdy tablet that I think I will get a good ten years out of.  Gaming is great on this tablet, it has never lagged yet. Angry Birds Space runs nice and smooth, looking great. After a week and a half with this tablet, I absolutely love it. I also recommend getting Chrome instead of using the pre-loaded browser.  P.S.

The reviews I read appeared to indicate that it was a pretty good tablet, but it does not come with the Android Market app installed, nor can you load it on for some reason. They must have something in their OS that prevents your Google Gmail account from syncing to the PlayStore. When you create a Gmail account and look at it in the settings it shows that you can sync all your emails, ie, msn, yahoo, etc... but not Gmail. This is probably what is preventing the Google Playstore from working. So, what this means is that Colby has a proprietary OS that won't allow certain android apps to be installed. This probably because they want to force you into purchasing from their market the \"Getjar\" market. What kind of a name is that? It's a pretty lame market and does not have 1/10 of the apps I'm accustomed to using. They claim there are over 38,000 apps available, but Android Market has over 450,000. I bought two Colby tablets at the same time, this one (MID9742) and a MID8125 for my wife. After spending four days trying to get just a few of the apps to work that I really need for church and office I returned them both for a refund to Amazon and immediately bought two Zenithink tablets with android 4.0.3 OS and android market preinstalled. Have no problems with the Zenithink tablets. Up and running immediately after opening the box. After 4 days of fighting with the two Colby units and after researching the web I discovered that the only way I would be able to make these crummy things work properly was to root the tablets and install a different OS. Well, I wasn't about to do that and felt that the amount of money I paid for them that I shouldn't be required to do that. So, I returned them and got a much better tablet that I love. Oh, by the way, I also tried to contact Colby USA via email. I sent a request to their tech support email listed on their website asking for help to load the android market. That email was sent on 4/15/2012. I still have not receive a response from them. Some tech support they have. My recommendation is that if you want a cheap tablet that doesn't do much and that forces you to purchase from their lame \"Getjar\" market and has crummy tech service, buy a Colby tablet. If you want a cheap tablet that is worth the money and can access the android market, but something else.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "unacceptably SLOW, apps crash unexpectedly, featureless and limited app store", "Author": "D. Small \"dnpsmall\"", "ReviewID": "RSSUTLT2V1TW8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Initial Review: 9/22/12I got my new Coby Kyros MID9742 (8GB) as a reward/gift (didn't purchase from Amazon) so it was a freebie...I already have iPhone/iPad at home and was very interested to see the Android 4.0.3 OS (I had a droid 2+ years ago).  Well I have concluded Android 4.0.3 OS itself is fine (though borderline underwhelming) and not anything that impacts usability, however the unit is so slow/sluggish and with limited apps that I can no longer tolerate using it!If you don't mind taking 5 minutes to start up, unlock, navigate to a web page and begin enjoying content this is your device (this same process takes me <30 seconds on iPhone/iPad).What do I think IS the problem?? .....it is the Kryos hardware (and lack of key features) that is to blame.  To me the top six (6) drawbacks with this device are:(1) hardware is pathetically, unacceptably SLOW(2) touch screen is \"selectively responsive\" and very slow on refresh (jitters when scrolling)(3) apps (mainly Browser) crash periodically and sometimes won't work even after reboot(4) critical design error to omit \"Google Play\"(5) lack of future OS/firmware updates(6) No Bluetooth=== Detailed ===(1) hardware is pathetically, unacceptably SLOWYou must recognize that this is a \"budget\" tablet that is in a different class than an iPad. I could tolerate *some* latency (as I click between apps or web pages) with a \"budget\" device, however I found this device to be maddening...to the point of abandoning it and going back to my tiny iPhone for email/news/facebooking/etc. (which to me is the ENTIRE POINT of getting a larger tablet!!)(2) touch screen is \"selectively responsive\" and very slow on refresh (jitters when scrolling)I find this is a POOR user experience.  Also as I click/select a link on a web page, it seems the visual queue (visually highlighting the region I just selected) is \"slightly off\".  Perhaps this is Droid Browser issue but it gives you the impression that what you selected (and what the browser THINKS you selected) are different.  Generally it loads the link I intended to select but maybe 1/3 of the time it is not...and becomes a 30-40 second \"penalty\" as I click \"back\" and wait for this slow unit to catch up.(3) apps (mainly Browser) crash periodically and sometimes won't work even after rebootMostly it's the installed Browser that has problems.  I realized that it wouldn't play FLASH content (can't stream videos on Amazon Prime Instant Videos w/out it).  Tried searching for Flash player on GETJAR (app store for this unit)...couldn't find it...finally read forum that suggested going straight to Adobe website and I was able to install it.  I was utterly amazed that this was successful and I can now watch videos on Amazon Prime (probably the ONLY thing I will ever use this device for until I can sell it).  Oh, the browser won't play videos on Vimeo  (it crashes if you try), even after Flash update.  I tried to get Firefox browser but that requires Google Play (my next gripe...see #4).  So for now I'm \"stuck\" with a crappy browser.(4) critical design error to omit \"Google Play\"I'm not a \"Droid expert\" and thus had no appreciation for Kryos reviews that indicated \"this device doesn't support Google Play\"...well turns out that's a critical feature (Google Play \"app store\" that has the best/most selection of apps).  Why Coby thought it was a good idea to PROHIBIT this feature in the device!?!  I hate GetJar....sometimes 1mobile.com is good alternative though.(5) lack of future OS/firmware updatesWTF!?? Ok in this day and age devices need to have some ability to UPDATE itself to fix issues or add/unlock functionality.  Again I look to Coby....no doubt future support is costly so they can sell more for less if they drop all product support.  (note to self, never purchase devices that don't have some form of support)(6) No BluetoothWow, Coby really missed the boat on this.  To me it's like making a TV w/out HDMI port (or a power plug).  This would have been a great selling feature and would definitely have made the difference to some on \"do I buy?\".  Tablet feels very lacking w/out it.If you have any standards/intolerance for a slow electronic device, DO NOT punish yourself with this device.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "MircoSD Card", "Author": "Michael Chan", "ReviewID": "R2GTDVJII0MF3H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't buy it, just waste of money.
