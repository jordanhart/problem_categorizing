I purchased a square trade for it and when I thought it would be replaced I am told it will have to be reordered.  This means 2 days after the tablet arrives at the company they will refund my card, however, my bank has 30 days to refund my card. Then I will have to reorder it and have it shipped again When you have school and business and need to be portable and mobile this isn't a good policy.. Why not just replace it.

Video is for pink version. Here color is different. ProntoTec 9 inch PT9 series is an All Winner Dual Core A20, Cortex A9 at 1.5GHz and is a very good value in price per performance. It has 512 MB RAM and also has a GPU. This runs Android 4.2.2 Android. I will go into the specifications and review based on my user experience. The dimensions are 9.25 x 0.43 x 5.91 in and weighs just over a pound. The screen resolution is 800 x 480. Please see my video review for details on performance - I do Temple run Oz and YouTube which are best indicators of the performance.Most of tablets have ARM based processors. This makes sure all of the Apps in Google Play ecosystem available. If you look at my video review, I have screenshots showing the CPU speed and other kernel details. The screen is 800 x 480 Pixels. This supports a wireless with Wi-Fi (802.11 BGN). Tablet has 2 cameras - front and back. This has 8 GB storage and you can use an extensible SD card slot as well as cloud storage. Though not built in, the tablet supports external 3G/WCDMA dongle. Battery, 4200 mAh came for a good 8 hours with moderate usage. Battery usage really depends on how heavy you use the system. Overnight it drained very less. Mobile Networking was on by default. I switched off as I was using only Wi-Fi mode. I suggest you go to Settings and tweak things which are not required. Developer Mode was enabled by default. I turned it off. The capacitive touch screen was really good, some occasions I had to press little harder and at right locations, but pinch-zoom, highlight, Copy-Paste all worked very well.It is great the tablet has micro USB Port, 3.5-mm stereo Headphone Jack, built-in speaker, microphone, micro SD card slot and a DC Input Jack. Note that for powering through wall adapter you need to use the provided DC input jack. Speaker was loud enough. In a room, once I keep the tablet in a stand it was good. Speaker is on the backside, so you don't want to lie this down on back as it will hamper the audio coming out. This is a design I hope changes in Android manufacturers in future. Android tablets are really customizable to your heart's content. It is here where Prontotec shines. Using a native Android 4.2.2, they have achieved something at a low cost. This can have a very wide reaching audience. In many countries, where affordability is key, having a tablet like this with Wi-Fi is a big boon. Imagine having entire Wikipedia at your fingertips for a child. I tried few educational applications on this. I consider this as a big hit with educators than gamers.I tried Google Voice Search and asked \"what is capital of United States\". The voice recognition part was great and it was able to recognize and dictate the answer. I also tried Wolfram Alpha and asked bunch of questions. E.g., what is world population, what is population of China etc? The microphone picked up correctly and answered through Wolfram Alpha. Apps like Calculator, Gmail performed flawlessly. I watched multiple video through few applications. Obvious first choice was YouTube. Was able to search and watch videos. I used TwIT.TV app and watched some segments of a podcast (video streaming through Wi-Fi). Again smooth playback. Handholding is really easy given the weight of it. It was a colorful blue; no heat observed handholding the tablet. It is plastic, and buttons are made of plastic. For a kid, this is perfect also though the feature set is equally appealing to an adult. I was so enamored with low cost computers in late 90s and it seems I am reliving them with tablet. If you want to listen to podcasts/watch video then this is perfect. Just keep it in a stand and connect to power. See my video review to get an idea of what I am referring to.The keyboard dock makes it very easy to type documents in Google Drive or other note taking apps like Evernote. The USB attached keyboard is rugged and keys are smooth to type. This is an excellent innovation and dual serves as a case + keyboard combo. It also serves as a stand for watching playback videos.For a computer geek, it is a challenge to design something with minimal resources - screen resolution, RAM, storage, chipset. Prontotec has designed a tablet with budget conscious customer in mind. Out of the box, it worked to my satisfaction given the specification and price. Once powered on, it directly came to a working condition. No need to setup account prior to using. I signed with Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi router was in one bedroom. I configured in another room separated by two rooms. There was no issue with Wi-Fi signal. Once connected, I created a Google account as well. I generated a Application Specific password as I had 2 factor authentication. Once signed on, I updated applications like YouTube, Google Keyboard etc. I also downloaded few applications like TwitT.TV, Tetris from EA, etc. I downloaded Chrome and browsed few websites. Listened to Audio / Watched Video. Out of the box battery needed a full charge. Initially without charge, I did a video stream and wanted to see how device shutdown. Sure enough it shut down as battery drained. Powered on after charging and everything was fine.Chinese chip-maker Allwinner's A20 is a dual-core design with 512KB L2 cache, dual-core Mali 400 graphics and 2160p HD video playback support. This tablet has 1080p support. The Allwinner A20 CPU has 2 core(s), resulting in good multi-tasking when compared to a single core processor. As a result of following the Harvard architecture, the CPU has a separate Level 1 instruction and data cache leading to a slight improvement in performance over a unified Level 1 cache. The instruction cache is only used for storing instructions and executes in a sequential manner. The data cache stores data used by instructions; the point of access or storage is generally specified by an instruction. This processor is based on the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) design strategy enabling instructions to execute faster, as opposed to the Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) design strategy, which is generally slower at executing due to lengthy instructions.I am impressed enough at the engineering for the price/value/budget it delivers. The ARM Cortex(tm)-A9 processor is the power-efficient and popular high performance choice in low power or thermally constrained cost-sensitive devices. Cortex-A9 is available as a single processor solution offering an overall performance enhancement of well above 50% compared to ARM Cortex-A8 solutions. Cortex-A9 MPCore offers up to 4 processors delivering when needed, on lightweight workload as well as peak performance. Its configurability and flexibility allows Cortex-A9 to scale across a wide variety of markets and applications. This is from ARM specification. Prontotec has pulled in many off the shelf components and assembled at a terrific value. I was particularly interested how it performs to streaming video. That is the golden test and it performed beautifully!", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Died on me in the middle of reading", "Author": "Loria Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3OESOSK0UO95H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased the tablet as a gift for myself.
