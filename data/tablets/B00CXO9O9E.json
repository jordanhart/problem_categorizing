I have not had any problems w ith it at all thst were not us issues. I am not the most techy person. If I play a lot on it I have to charge it every day. It only takes a couple of hours to completely charge.  Which is is nice.  Reading doesn't seem to drain it as fast as the games. I haven't used it for school yet, but that is the plan. I have used the calander planner, I like that it syncs with my s3 mini phone, so when I don't have my tablet I still have my planner.  With multiple schedules to juggle it us great to have. I am sure that I have just started to tap into everything this tablet can do. Iplan to plsymore with the note taking feature w hile I am on my winter break, so I will be ready in the spring.  I have already recommended this tablet to family and friends.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 Tablet", "Author": "Nita", "ReviewID": "R22D6LNE6LNR7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love It!

My only gripes so far are to do with the battery life (which I can only assume is due to it being refurbished) and that it has crashed a few times already.
