I kept one and so far pretty impressed with the quality.  The clarity of the HD screen and the overall performance of the 1.5 GHz dual-core processor are impressive.  Netflix and Crackle works great on the tablet.  The battery could last longer (around 4 hours of use, similar to laptops, but half as long as an iPad) and the screen is not IPS, but what do you expect for under $100.  Too me this was a great purchase!  Saved a lot of money compared to the name brands (Samsung, Asus, Dell...) without much sacrafice in quality or performance.Pros:1) Fast duo-core processor2) HD screen (1024 x 600)3) Good wifi (better than my Asus T100TA tablet)4) Loud audioCons:1) Short a battery life (after a full charge, almost 5 hours or regular use (checking email, surfing web...) or around 3 hours of intense use (watching Netflix or Crackle over wifi))2) Screen is not IPS pannel (viewing angle from one of four direction is limited)Overall, I gave it 4 stars becasue of the value I got.Video review link:[...]", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great inexpensive Android tablet", "Author": "Fred J. Love", "ReviewID": "RFMH9I1YYA26G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet if you are looking for basic features.  I am very impressed with the look and feel for it being a $70+ tablet.  It was one of the only tablets inexpensive tablets that that I could find video review one (I won't post the link since the reviewer uses some potty language but you can find it on your own on YouTube).  I found it to be very responsive with no delay to any user interactions (starting apps, any swiping gestures, volume up/down, rotating from portrait to landscape, etc).  The screen is very clear.  It also has a Micro SD slot which I added a 32GB card. This is huge plus over other tablets (iPads) that don't allow you to add more memory.  Please note that this tablet DOES NOT have Bluetooth.  I also like that it comes with a nice little travel pouch, lint cloth and noise isolating earbud headsets. Thus far I have not found any apps that would not run on it.  The only issue that I have found is that when I wake it up it does take a few seconds to connect to our wifi access point but once its connected its fine.  When comparing this table to others be sure to note that this one has a dual core processor and 8GB of storage.  I have seen a few in the <$100 price range that are single core, processors  <1.5 Ghz, 4GB (or less).Pros:-1.5 Ghz dual core processor-Clear HD screen-Highly responsive-Micro SD slot to add more memory when you need itCons-Delay in connecting to wifi on wake up.(Update)Not all 7 inch tablet cases will work with this tablet based on the location of the buttons.  I picked up the Visual Land Pro Folio Universal Case and Stand from Fry's.  It works ok as it has elastic bands to hold the tablet in place.  The only issue is that I can only use 3 of the bands due to the location of the volume button.  Using 3 bands still keeps the tablet snug in the case.  It appears that Amazon carries the Visual Land Prestige 7L tablet case which has clasps that hold the corners of the tablet which should work for this tablet", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Died at 35 days", "Author": "Izzy Hood", "ReviewID": "R12RA095CKJJVB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "At 35 days, the unit never got past the post screen and booted into the android OS.A factory reset was attempted after this, but the formatting screen never proceeded after the text which read \"Formatting\", even after letting it work for several hours.Unfortunately, this is outside of Amazon's return policy. We contacted and left a message for the manufacturer via phone and email.

We ordered two, the blue one and the red one. The colors are beautiful (albeit the red is a little darker than I expected, but it looks much better than the red in the pictures). The tablet is very fast and it goes just as fast on my mobile hotspot as it does on the regular wi-fi hook-up. I haven't had any problems with it thus far! The only con to this is that I kill the batter pretty fast because of a few of the games that I play, watching movies (screen is VERY clear!) and using my kindle app. I think we made a good decision because the tablet really does out perform my mother's RCA tablet, and my nephew's Nextbook!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than coby", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2ZVOQIO73HJ47", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was given to me as a gift.

He already knew how to download and install apps on the phone so this was an easy trade off for him. There are parental controls that you can get for free from Google Play Store, some are very controlling such a time frames, apps and internet access, while others just control time usage. As for the tablet itself, it was quiet impressed. I'm used to paying more for my electronics, but I thought since this was for a kid, it shouldn't be more than 100$.For the price, this is down right amazing. The screen is bright and clear, can watch videos seamlessly, there is a headphone jack, a USB and even a mini HDMI connection. I haven't found if the USB can power the tablet yet, it does come with a DC Power jack connection and power cord.  That might give it 4 stars if it doesn't, because honestly, that's just universal at this point.Like all androids, the interface is simple and easy. Plenty of apps and games.It does seem a little slower than I expected sometimes, but most people wont even realize it unless you are used to having an much higher price tablet. Honestly I expected less for the price, and this is a great gift for the value. I even thought about getting it for myself.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "MEMORY & CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CZ9R66YPVLB9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After about a month, my EM63 tablet\u2019s 1GB system memory was 100% full.  I could not download any apps & none of the installed apps would update. Conversely there was still 4.63GB of the total 4.73GB of on-board storage memory available for apps and files. The specs for the EM63 tablet show * 1GB of system memory and 8GB on-board storage memory*. It does not appear the on-board storage memory is being used correctly.Generally technical support can be accomplished directly with the user, but I was forced to send the tablet back to Double Power at my expense, ($15 shipping and insurance), to have them \u201cfix\u201d the system memory full problem. They refused to deal with the issue via email or phone.When DOPO returned the tablet, system memory had 900MB available. I logged into Google Play Store and all EM63 pre-loaded apps started to automatically update. Within minutes the system memory was again \u00bd full but the available storage memory stats had not changed. Next day when the system memory was still \u00bd full, I attempted to contact DOPO technical support to find out why this was happening. I have continued to follow up with DOPO every few days, but they refuse to provide any help with this issue. I refuse to return this tablet a second time when the system memory is again 100% full.It appears that apps and app updates download to the system memory only. This causes the 1GB of system memory to quickly fill up and render the device unavailable for any additional apps or updates.  Although I can save pictures and music to the external micro SD card without problems; for me, the device is really nothing more than a 1GB tablet \u2013 useful as an e-reader but not a good choice if you like to download and use many apps.I cannot recommend this model or company.  Specs are inaccurate, device is unreliable, and customer service is extremely poor. I accept that some products will have issues, but I will not accept a company that doesn\u2019t stand behind its products.

Tablet responds very quickly, graphics are awesome and it seems to run any applications or games that I could want. I have a friend who spent several hundred on her tablet and she thinks mine runs better, yay me. I have several applications installed on the tablet, Netflix runs really smooth on it. I do however suggest getting a micro sd card though, so that you have more space. There isnt any bloat ware on the tablet, so essentially it comes with very little on it. It does have google books, but I downloaded an app called cool reader instead, that I like better. Without the micro sd card (which mine is coming in the mail soon).. i have installed netflix, cool books, draw something, polyvore, live backgrounds, facebook and there is still plenty of space.. so dont feel a need to rush on the micro sd card.

But when I did, it was awesome.It arrived waaaaay earlier than I expected; only two days after I ordered it, even though I went for the standard 5-8 day shipping. I don't know if it was because I ordered it on Christmas Day, but it certainly made the end of last year great for me.I haven't had a problem with the battery life yet, but I always have it plugged it when it's off or not really in use. It has a lot of storage space, but with all the apps I put on it, I'll probably have to get an TF card for any music or pictures I want to put on it, but that doesn't really bother me, either, since I was planning on that already. My only real concern is how hot the back gets when running certain apps. Once, when I was playing music from a music streaming app, it got so hot it felt like I burned my hand on the back (I didn't actually, so no worries). I think this has more to do with the apps themselves, however; I have since switched to a different music app and it doesn't get nearly as warm.Also, even though I saw nothing listed about it, it came with a drawstring case, a pair of headphones, and a cleaning cloth, as well as the USB cord and AC adapter. I don't know if this is a common thing, but it certainly surprised me.3/20/2014 EDIT:Okay, so after writing this review, I had a whole ton of problems occur. First, after getting a micro SD card for it, it stopped working properly, so I hard reset it as per the instructions in the manual. This caused it to become completely useless, and it acted as if all the essential files to make it work were gone. The launcher stopped working, and the settings could not be accessed.I contacted the manufacturer about what had happened and I got a response after a couple days, with instructions to send the tablet and the charger back. I did, and luckily the shipping cost wasn't bad at all since I live relatively near them, and within a few days I got it back; or rather, I got a replacement. This one was 4GB, nearly half the space I had in the other one, but it did seem to work better. I tried setting it up with my micro SD, but it caused some problems and I had to soft reset it, which actually fixed it and didn't cause any more issues as long as I kept the SD card out of it. Now it works fine, with some minor app crashes every now and then (usually after updates so I don't think that's the tablet's fault), but still great.Today the AC adapter broke. The little 'metal' pin that plugs into the tablet itself literally broke off like cheap plastic. I have to charge it primarily through the USB cord now, which can be a bit of a hassle considering my desk setup. I don't think I'll have any problems getting a replacement, but this is just getting ridiculous. I don't think I'll be buying anything else from Double Power. My friends and family all suggest that a tablet that is a bit more expensive and sturdier would be a better investment, and I am totally inclined to agree.3/24/2014 EDIT:It has crashed completely and will not boot past the splash screen. There is no option of entering a recovery mode and I have tried every button combo available.

Those were my main interests when purchasing a tablet. I found a considerably well priced tablet during one of the sales for cyber Monday. It was this tablet.  The tablet itself is a pretty sturdy tablet. The plastic is nice and hard. It doesn\u2019t look cheap and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019d crack easily or become funky with time. The printed letters on the back letting you know what the details of the tablet were did fade rather quickly though. All outlets seemed to work as well as all the buttons. The sound works and is clear and loud.  The touch screen itself is, I\u2019d say, a normal setting of sensitive. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to change it but I found the factory setting to be fine for me. Not overly sensitive but not too hard to use. The time it takes to download games is less than a minute. All games I run on it as well as movies look great. The camera could be a little better and I would\u2019ve preferred it had both a front facing camera and a camera on the back. The front facing camera is a little bit of a hassle but you can work around it\u2019s not something you\u2019re majorly interested in. When taking pictures with the camera they come out fairly blurry so it\u2019s not the highest quality camera.  Video playback is 1080 p which is fine by me, it looks great visually so I don\u2019t miss much when I\u2019m watching movies or shows on it. The tablet itself isn\u2019t overly heavy and I find it the perfect size to carry in my purse. The gameplay is pretty smooth, rarely does it freeze or skip or anything. It comes with google play so there are a lot of great apps and everything is really easy to download. The battery lasts about 4 hours of constant use, it can last more but it depends on whether you have the wifi feature on or off. If you have it off you get more battery life out of it. The memory is expandable to 32gb which I find to be completely awesome and gives me enough room to do everything I have to do.  The only problem that I\u2019ve run into is that sometimes it turns off by itself and you have to start it up and when you start it up you find that it has no battery and you have to recharge it but this is usually of having it for a full day and toting it around in my purse. Another problem that I\u2019ve run into twice is that sometimes when I unlock it the touch screen doesn\u2019t respond to touch so I\u2019d have to force a shutdown but after that it would be fine. I don\u2019t know if these problems are specific to my tablet or maybe it\u2019s a program problem but I don\u2019t find it to be too cumbersome.  Overall I\u2019d say I really like this tablet. For what I use it for and what the price was I think it was definitely worth it. I was doubtful at first because the price was low and it\u2019s not a very popular brand but I\u2019m very happy with my purchase and have used my tablet for over 3 months now and in that time I\u2019ve encountered very few problems. It definitely keeps me entertained which is what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this tablet for anyone who was looking for a reasonably priced tablet to use more for entertainment than for work.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Piece of JUNK", "Author": "M.

From what I've read the Galaxy also works the same way, so I'm assuming that's the way it works with all tablets. This one also has been having issues when I click on a link on the internet it either doesn't register or it's really lagging because of the internal storage issue. I have to click and click  before it will do anything which is very aggravating. I'm writing this review from this tablet right and it seems to be working pretty good so far today though.  I'm still not sure if I'm going to keep it though (or any tablet). My Samsung Note 2 phone has everything and more than I need.

The dual core and 1GB of RAM is great for the price. I purchased 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my girlfriend.However, here is where the tablet, or company lacks.I've only had this tablet for a little under a month when the screen cracked from me doing nothing to it. I had it on my bedside table charging over night and when I woke up in the morning the screen was cracked. I contacted customer support to see what could be done and the manufacturers warranty doesn't really cover anything. From my gathering of the email sent to me, it only covers hardware defects. Apparently sub-par glass on a defective tablet does not constitute warranty returns. The email stated I have to pay ~$50 (On a $70 tablet) to have it repaired and I have to send it in to be repaired... That's all well and good however, all my banking and business information is on it and I can't do a factory data reset as I can't even use the screen. I can't very well allow them access to all of my information while they repair it. So, for the price, it is a great tablet. But customer support is severly lacking.Pros:All the ports you'll ever need.Decent display.Under $100.Dual core and 1GB of RAM.Cons:Glass easily broken.Tech Support is moot at best.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised!", "Author": "DARON PRUSSE", "ReviewID": "R17TM9T2MG806Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet for my son last month for Christmas.

That worked for less than 2 weeks and now it won't load at all. I am sending that tablet back now for the second time (charging port issue and won't load). The tablet is only 3 months old. I am now at $60 in return shipping costs. Save yourself a headache and buy another brand. The tablets are great when they work but they are unreliable. Only one of the four I purchased has not had a problem...yet. To contact customer service you have to call and leave a message and wait for a call back or send an email through the company website and wait for a response.
