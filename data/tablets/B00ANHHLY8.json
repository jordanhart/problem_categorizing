It can be fairly slow, and the headphone jack doesn't really work well. Still good value. If you want amazing performance, save up for a more expensive model. This is functional and has enough features(Android Jellybean, Google Play Store, 2 cameras, etc) to be worth the money though. The size is good because it's in between the usual 7 and 10 inch sizes, but I'm still debating opting for a better(albeit pricier) device. It's decent though, especially for kids.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "sd card slot failed", "Author": "James Krause", "ReviewID": "R2HJAAVWARS1IJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The tablet worked fine except the micro sd card slot would not let a micro card seat properly so that you could not use a microcard to increase the GB available to store apps ,etc, The vendor, outlet pc, had great customer service and I was able to return the item and get my refund. Nice people there.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Danny Nisenoff", "ReviewID": "R1LLFB9PNYCWW5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "tablet is good, but not as fast as they made it out to be.
