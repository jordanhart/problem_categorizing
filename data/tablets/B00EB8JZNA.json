Mcgill", "ReviewID": "R1GMP2W4WW9BPO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted a tablet for my kid who is almost three and he broke and cracked the screen on the ipad so I was looking to get him a kid centric tablet to replace it. I ended up with this afunta af705 with the dual core cpu. I can't really tell it is a dual core anything though and it is a bit sluggish and I hate to imagine the single core model. I mean this thing is not awful for a $60 tablet but it just looks and feels like a $60 tablet which is a letdown no matter how you look at it. I mean they seemed to try, the case is cool and all but the awful low res screen and crappy kids software that confused my kid more than helped him. Why for instance does it remind us every time we load an app from the kids screen that we can press home to go back with a big arrow pointing to home. That makes my kid want to just push that button before the game even launches. But the real problem here is the simple unavoidable fact that the apple ipad in any form is a far far far better device for kids. The apps are super top notch and actually keep my kid entertained and learning for long periods of time. The apps on the afunta and even most of the crap I found on the wild west app market they call the play store only kept my kid interested for a few seconds. I mean the quality difference for toddler apps is astonishing.  Granted this is a 60$ device and the ipad is at least 250 and likely more, I am just stating my own observation that this device is no replacement for an ipad for my son, not even close so I am sending it back.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would buy again", "Author": "joshworld22", "ReviewID": "R28A9LZZU3GZXF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really good kids tablet, she loves the kid mode..

After charging it for about an hour took it off the charger to use it and noticed the battery was very hot and the tablet was very glitchy. Then after about another 30 mins it completely froze,shut off  and would not come back on. Let it sit over night and tried to turn it back on the next morning and nothing happened. I called Amazon later that day and had it returned the following business day. I would not recommend this product!", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EB8JZNA"}}
