I FOR ONE WANT TO KNOW WHO THE HELL VIEWSONIC THINKS IT IS. IF I DESIGNED A POWERFUL TABLET WHY WOULDN'T I GET GOOGLE APPROVAL(i smell fraud in the market). a large part of this is goolges' own fault. they created android as a open sourse for programers to use(anybody). now they want control of what you are able to get(the good apps). it seems to me that all factions here are at fault. if google,tablet makers and apps programers don't get together and straighten this out asap people will get discusted and not buy android anymore.  IT ALL SOUNDS LIKE A BIG SCAM. I AM NOT A LAWYER BUT I FEEL ALL FACTIONS SHOULD BE SUED. WHY BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT THE MONEY BUT NONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY PEROID. MEANING YOU ARE THE SUCKER WHO BOUGHT INTO ANDROID. BUY THE WAY GOOGLE DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHINA SYNDROME IS. IF YOU DON'T YOU MAY SEE ONE SOON IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD. I THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING ME A SUCKER.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005HF30KA"}}
