They sent a new charger in good time, and kept their ears open for a result. The unfortunate problem is that the new charger did not fix the problem, however I am confident their Customer Support will fix the issue. It seems more people are popping up with a similar issue with charging, so I may assume the battery board is indeed the culprit.For now I will give four stars.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Turns off  while playing games like angry birds.", "Author": "M.

However, it turns off randomly and will not restart even if the reset button is pushed.  The only way to get it to turn back on is to plug it in to the charger even though the battery has plenty of charge left and may even be full when this occurs.  I called  Latte tech support and I am still waiting for them to call me back.  I am very disappointed and will be sending this back.  I may get an Ipad mini next time because I don't know if I  can trust another Android tablet.

I've now bought 3 of the 7\" Latte Ice tablets and paid anywhere from $123 to $135.  Basically the white version looks like an Apple 7\" clone sort of though is inferior to the Apple Mini in hardware specs..  The IPS screen looks great, like a higher end cell phone.  It has all the standard stuff though does lack an HDMI slot.  I compared it to a 7\" Dragon Touch tablet and both brought up and played youtube video's at about the same time though with the IPS screen the video was much sharper and colors more accurate.  The front speaker provides decent sound though none of the tablets have that great of sound that I've heard.Note - I ordered a couple more of the 7\" version since my initial review and the last one I received came with two plastic screen covers and a nice case that doubled as a stand for displaying the tablet on a flat surface.  It must of been a Christmas special cause I didn't specifically order these items but was happy to receive them.  Or maybe they just were rewarding my repeat business :)1/23/14 - I'm unable to get any of 3 different bluetooth mice to connect and work reliably on two different tablets.  Revising to three stars until this is resolved.3/7/14 - Revising to ONE STAR as there is 0 product support.  I requested help with the Bluetooth issue twice through Lattezone and once through here regarding the Bluetooth problem and did not receive so much as an email except the automated email right after I generated a support ticket.  If you buy and have a problem there is no help, do not recommend purchasing from Lattezone.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "Mike Park", "ReviewID": "R1K9VOIVFONHNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Look.  I read some of the bad reviews but decided to still try due to the low price.  I can honestly say this tablet has exceeded my expectations.  I own quite a few china tablets (ramos w30, hyundai T7, etc).  Performance is very snappy and the screen is quite lovely.  The battery life is very impressive (over 8 hours of HD movies) on a single charge.  Some people (reviewers) just ask for too much.  A great tablet for a little over 100 bucks.  I am impressed.  This has become my main tablet now.M", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super-good tablet, but not quite great", "Author": "Jackie L.", "ReviewID": "RTL6HMVUY5MBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The I-muz Q9 is my first tablet. I've had mine since 01/2014. Comparing \"apples to I-muz,\" this android rocks. Great antutu score, and beautiful display. Some orientation bugs, but this can be somewhat corrected in settings>>accessibility and remove the check mark next to auto-rotate screen. Not a perfect fix, but it helps. You can change it back at any time you wish. I have rooted mine and I love the freedom to change and tweak settings. Something that is hard to accomplish on a \"branded\" tablet. It appears that www.lattezone.com has all but abandoned its customers, which is really disappointing. Some information can be gleaned from www.i-muz.com and www.rock-chips.com. With a minimal amount of effort, you can turn this tablet into a customized fun machine. The physical build seems well thought out. I like the covered ports, although the ports themselves, are a bit flimsy. If you handle them with a modest amount of care, they should last throughout the tablet's useful life. The case and buttons seems sturdy enough. The cameras are not the best in the world, but they suffice. One thing I would like to see more of are accessories for the Q9. For the money, I believe this is a great starter tablet, as well as a good daily user. I hope this helps to ease the minds of those who may be, \"on the fence\" about buying this tablet.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "IMuz Q8 : : Beware!!!

She played with it sporadically for less than a week (leaving it in a newly purchased case) and it stopped working all together. It was fully charged but wouldn't turn on or do anything.

Come the New Year in 2014, I was surprised that the price dropped significantly to $199.99. Wrote in to ask about this in hope of some kind of courtesy refund but got no response. Highly disappointed that they do not price guarantee even for less than a month!The unit have a trouble recognizing the inserted micro-SD card even when all data was erased by another device. It could not determine this inserted 8GB micro-SD at all, and did not ask to even reformat it! Had to do a complete formatting of the micro-SD card using FAT32 on my PC before it could recognize this external memory card inserted. Still a bit of a problem with this tablet if you should drain the battery of this tablet completely - plugging in the charger and rebooting the tablet will once again fail to recognize the inserted micro-SD. You will have to physically re-insert the m-SD card after the amazingly slow boot for the tablet to recognize it.

When I saw the specifications of the Latte IMUZ Q9, I exchanged the Samsung one for this one.Honestly, I don't know how this tablet is so bad with such good specs. I feel like I've been lied to, tricked into buying it.First,  to scroll,  you have to do it in a quick back-front manner,  or else it'll send you in the wrong direction. It also doesn't have infinity scrolling. If you don't do purposeful, calculated scrolling, it sends you back to the top or side.When I click something, I have to do it a 2nd time 75% of the time because the screen doesn't respond well even on the most sensitive setting.Also,  it's not holding charge anymore. I disconnected it 30 minutes ago and it already went from 85% to 30%.You have to type very carefully, too,  because the screen isn't very responsible,  especially on the right side of the keyboard.The 5 megapixel camera takes much less impressive pictures than the 3 megapixel camera on the Samsung tablet.Last thing from the top of my head is the display brightness. Even at its brigtest, this tablet is not at all bright.I feel so bad about getting this thing. From the very beginning, not one thing has impressed me and countless things have disappointed me.
