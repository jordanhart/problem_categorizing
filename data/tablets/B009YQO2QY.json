The screen is 7 inches wide and seems a bit smaller than other 7 inch tablets, however it is TRUE to the its size. It comes preloaded with Jelly bean 4.1.1 and Google Play (USA) version which I have had no issue when it comes to syncing to my Google account and downloading apps, free and paid. As for the apps they all seem to download and work, except need for speed shift, however that could be something I've done when it tells me to update the game, but all other games and apps so far have downloaded and work. It comes with Google voice however I prefer Alice (AVIC) which works seamlessly on this tablet. Standard feel is good well built not very heavy compared to the Nexus 7. The screen resolution is not as crisp and pixel free as the Nexus 7 however it's pretty close and again over 100 dollars cheaper and the HDMI works well when connected to my TV's to watch Netflix's. The Wi-Fi seems to have good range as I can connect outside my house compared to my Galaxy S3 phone it has a little weaker signal but not much. I do not have a 3G dongle so I cannot comment on that but I assume like all of those it's carrier based that will make a difference.There are NO standard USB ports on this only 1 Micro USB which is not an issue as this tablet comes with a Micro to USB cable, so you can use flash drives and USB hard drives as well to load apps and watch movies. I have only hooked a 128GB drive to the machine so I could not tell you the full read capacity for the little tablet. When playing movies off USB there is no noticeable lag time. The Players that come preloaded are junk I recommended the free app MX player as it works in HW.SW and Fast SW mode to convert movies from AC3-Divix formats (Mp4 as well). When watching a movie if the screen brightness is all the way up expect to get through 1 full movie and a little of another movie. With the settings low to half way two movies should be within the spec of this tablet.Alright for web browsing, it comes preloaded with Google Chrome, which I've had no issue using. All my pages allow me to sync perfectly to them, along with all my book marks. The push to laptop function works well and no complaints. I've not used the YOU TUBE app yet as I just use YouTube in desktop mode on the Chrome browser with no complaints.I've not use nor do I have a need for the GPS function so I will skip that however Google maps worked well for me and it found my location at home just as fast as my Acer A500 and my Galaxy S3 did; when using share location or Find my Device it picks my location up within 500Ft of the device which is good for a FREE app. Again works well but never used the Driving part of the GPS.Amazon Kindle reading app works well although some of the text is hard to read without zooming it. Again it's not unreadable however if you wear glasses like me it could be a bit of a challenge for you. But as this is a true 5 point Multi touch all zooming gestures work well.Playing Angry birds or other games this tablet works well and does not kill your arms to hold it up. The 5 point Multitouch works excellent and the screen which seems to be MVA(multidomain vertical alignment) allowing you to see pretty good detail in the game. Not as good as an IPS but again price is a factor here. When playing with your friends everyone can see the screen as the off viewing angles are decent, they compare to most mid 2000's laptop's.Now the only bad I could find about this thing, is the Lack of space on the 8GB version, 8-16 GB of internal memory (storage) is really too little these days. But it does have an expansion slot that offers another 32GB of space per card you use, and remember you can save movies to USB as well as an external drive or Google Cloud.So to wrap up this review if you need a cheap Sub $100.00 tablet for use with work, entertainment or just to have to get into the world of tablets this is an excellent buy, as it supports most games and the movie quality is good (Worst being cheap Micro Cruz tablets, Better being Mid pad tablet, Good being Pipo-S1, Best being A500 and Outstanding being Asus /Galaxy S) Google Chrome is excellent and reading/watching daily news is not as great as a 10 inch but better than using most smart phones. I would give this product 9 out of 10 only due to small battery and low internal storage (they do offer a 16GB version as well). I will try to post an English speaking video (USA so I should say American version) soon to go along with my review. Again I try to keep this simple and semi short, but if you want something that works well and is not over priced buy one of these you will be surprised at this little 7 inches power.Side note: All 3-D games I've tried work well and the G-accelerator seems to be very responsive no lag.

However I don't like the price and not having the easy to add sd cards.  That said I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this one.  I have other smaller android devices so i'm familiar with them.  They are average.  This little guy stays head to head with the Ipad.  And runs virtually every app I typically use.  And at 1/5 the price.  Bottom line skip the $80 tablets (junk) and the $200 tablets (pricey) and get this.  This unit has about double the power and memory of any other tablet in it's class. 1gb of ram and 8gb of storage with space for a 32gb sd card.  The dual core 1.6 processor and quad core gpu scream.

(previously known as: odd tab-charging experience)", "Author": "Zippy Shells", "ReviewID": "R2PZTFBGRIU98K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "***Update 10-2013:  Didn't last a year!  Crashed twice, lost all data and video-pics..recently for good maybe.  Meanwhile our Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7inch that I paid $169 for is going strong...perfectly...good as new.  I thought I should get on here and let people know before the holiday season is upon us...if I could go back in time, I would have paid the extra $70 for another Samsung.  At least my son would still have a tablet. Its stuck in some weird loop again and this time I can't seem to remedy it at all.***UPDATE***7/5/2013 Just want to pass on that our tablet is still running great.  It doesn't have all the features or slick resolution of a Samsung, but for the price, it still amazes me of what it does for under $100.00.***update*** 12/13/2012: my Tablet is now working fabulously.  I will leave the details regarding my charging and temporarily dead tablet drama in case it helps others.  In a word, this tablet is lightning fast, responsive,thin, lightweight and fun to use.  The speaker is rather quiet - a little too quiet for movie rentals - I will be plugging in extra speakers (or one person can use headphones) when we use it to watch a movie.  Its up and running out of the box in minutes, BUT be sure to start charging it right away and use the manufactur's usb charger to acheive a full charge. Keep working at keeping it plugged in until you pass 99% charged and hit the actual 100%.  The screen is grainy and the lettering for reading is considerably fuzzier than my Galaxy Tab2 which I paid under 200 for. I bought this as a 2nd tablet for my family. I would get a headache reading Kindle with it's low resolution, but for apps, web browsing, e-mail, netflix, streaming Pandora etc. its a great bargain. Android Tablets DO drain quickly.  Even when fully charged - it seems my kids can only have continuous use for 3-4 hours on my Galaxy Tab2.As far as buying a case- its precisely the same shape-size as the Galaxy Tab2 but the ports, speakers etc are in different places. Also- I'm unclear if this is gorilla glass on this tablet - my other Galaxy's surface feels like really sturdy, hard glass - no clue what the Pippo has or the scratching risk, but it does feel different-my fingernail tapping on it sounds like its plastic,just fyi.***update*** late 12-11-2012:For those who need help with Pipo tablet bugs:  I 'may' have discovered some issues and fixes--my dead tablet is ON again and working!!! I believe after much reading online,fiddling and consideration -that I simply received a faulty wall charger.  It was just placed outside the box--separate from the manufacturer's packaging--perhaps the seller was feeling generous and thre it in--the charger does not say Pipo.If you are having troubles try the fixes I have listed. Keep in mind also, that I have discovered a extremely tiny \"reset\" button on the back of the Pipo tablet.  I fiddled around with the following fixes- sometimes pressing the reset button for 10 seconds.  I dug around and found an old 5 volt charger that I just happened to have with the correct plug -and low and behold, the bugging screen stopped and within 20 minutes began to stabilize.  So then it occured to me to try the usb charger that was supplied and ONLY when I used the usb charger provided did the charging light stop the strange bugging and the screen finally, finally came back on.  So those of you with strange battery issues--consider the possibility that a simple switching out of chargers- might work. Wall chargers have always charged faster than usb in my opinion and it seemed to be charging well that first night-so i never tried the usb until tonight.  I hope this helps someone and I hope to add an update tomorrow that this tablet indeed works as well on day three as on day one! Also, you might consider using a good quality usb adapter to plug your provided usb cord into to convert it to a wall charger as I seemed to find a trail of owners who have had issues trying to use the wall instead of a computer which really limits the portability-the whole point!  I have experimented with THAT tonight too and my Pipo says \"charging\" apparently succesfully.Earlier today, 12-11-2012I spent some time online searching around through android tablet forums.  I tried this and it \"seems\" like my tablet is at least charging again (but still has a buggy flashing screen) - I am going to let it \"charge\" overnight (If that is what its in fact doing right now) and post my observations- if it miraculously performs normallly after this \"trick\" reset, I will be sure and give an honest review:  Plugged the Pipo into my laptop using a regular usb cord (mine came with a wall charger-interesting that others' did not) then held BOTH the volume and power buttons down, then after 40 seconds let go only of the volume buttons, continued to hold down the power button for another 40 seconds.  It seemed there was no response, BUT when I then immediately plugged it into the wall with the wall charger and held down the power button it went into charging mode with no buggy, flashing images.  Then the flashing stuff started again.  I don't want to mess with it until tomorrow, when I know its fully charged.I tried this process the day it worked great and then died however, (and this is important) the android forum posters explained that one must often just *wait,* it seems, until the battery completely looses all charge before this reset trick will work.  Perhaps that is what happened to my tablet between last night and tonight, I don't know.I'm really happy for those who have had no troubles with their Pipo tablet- I have to admit I was excited to see how well it was competing those first few minutes with my Galaxy Tab2 (bought in the fall at Costco $189.) (except for screen resolution-the Galaxy is incomparably more crisp and clear-the Pipo is noticably fuzzier).  The Samsung Galaxy S2 only gets a few hours of gaming or movie time before it needs to be recharged if that helps anyone out there.Original review 12-10-2011:I waited and waited for this to arrive.  I was about to give it a glowing review (except for the grainy resolution) because it DOES stream Netflix, play angry birds and its FAAAAST, til it DIES.  I got to use this for a hot ten minutes, was called away for an hour and upon return: no dice.  Won't turn on. (And yes, I did charge it for several hours in advance). Screen and charger light gets all buggy with the wall charger plugged in.  I've tried the trick I use on my Galaxy Tab: hold your finger down on the screen while turning it on and: NOTHING.  Once I had the key phrase \"wont turn on\" to couple with \"Pipo\" in a search engine, the trail of problems with this device became apparent. Numerous others have had the same catastrophe and describe the same odd behavior after using 1 to a few times.  I am contacting the seller for a refund.  Darn. If I have a positive experience with the seller I will update this.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stuck in a BOOT LOOP!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R34DCYMT3L7HPS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I received the item we were pleased with it at first.

Having played with their tablets (I am in IT so we are all computer and electronic geeks), I finally decided to make the plunge and buy my own.  However, many of them bought the more expensive tablets, where I only wanted to spend around $100.  Anything more than that I could not justify because I would just use my laptop.  Additionally, I wanted a 7\" screen so that it was easy to carry around.  Most of the tablets that I found in this price range were not duel core and had small storage and memory specs.  Hence, I have been looking for a very long time.  I happened across this tablet and it had everything that I wanted.  For the price, you will have a hard time finding another tablet with these specs.  I decided to take a chance and order it.The tablet arrived quickly from the seller.  The unit was in the original packaging and was in excellent shape.  I would recommend the seller.  I also liked the letter that they included stating that they put an emphasis on customer service and to contact them if there were any issues.The tablet itself is perfect for me.  It matches the performance that I have seen on my friends iPads and more expensive Android tablets.  I was able to easily figure out how to use the tablet, though a user manual is included (what is the fun in that?!?)  In a short time I have everything customized to my liking, hooked up to my home network, downloaded a number of apps from the Google Android App store, and was having a blast.  The tablet is very responsive.  I have streamed Netflix with no issues and have not had any issues streaming music either.  All of the applications that I have run have worked without a hitch including my Fantasy Football League.  The battery life has been very good for me.  The original charge that I did a week ago just now ran out.Overall, I think this is a excellent product which seems to have bery good quality.

You MUST use a 2 amp charger to charge these. If you don't, they will charge, but at some point if the power gets too low they will go into a \"boot loop\" when you try and charge them (where it knows it has enough power to boot while plugged into the low power adapter, but reboots before it can get to the main screen, over and over and over, and doesn't get a good charge). Using a 2 amp charger fixes the issue completely (Belkin makes a good one).

It got stuck in the boot loop recently that others have mentioned and I almost threw it in the garbage.  But then I figured out why it occurs and how to resolve that problem.  For me, the boot loop problem is caused when I let the battery run down too low and it just shuts off and starts the never-ending boot loop.  It doesn't have enough power to continue booting and will shutdown over and over again, even when plugged in.  The way to recover from this is to use a paper clip or something similar and poke it in the little hole in the back that says \"mic/reset\" until you feel the button depress.  With the unit plugged in, hold the reset button down with the paperclip for about 5 minutes or until the battery gets enough charge to continue booting (>1%).  Once the battery gets enough charge, the boot loop will stop and it will boot to the normal screen.  Let the unit charge until full and then it will operate as normal again.

The processor is astonishingly fast. The Quad core graphics card is super quick. Playing NFS Most Wanted, it really gets the job done and it runs it without a hick-up. Plus with 1GB of ram it will run programs really nicely. The screen looks good, it is very responsive and HD video looks great! It comes pre-installed with lots of great APS. (Including Google Play Store which a lot of cheap tablets can't do.) Another plus is it has a mini-HDMI port so you can hook it directly up to your TV.The 8GB of internal storage is kind of bad and runs out quickly but you can add a micro SD card. The battery life is short at about 5 hours (working hard) and the camera is ok. The speaker isn't very loud so you may need to bring speakers or headphones with you.All-in-all, if you are looking for a tablet, buy this.  It isn't like the other cheap tablets, it is very comparible with other brand named tablets and possibly even better than the Kindle Fire HD.

The device was in great shape with protective clear tape on the back of the device which one should be careful removing as to not tear away the serial number.The front was protected with clear screen protector (2 more included).The device turned on just fine and had plenty of battery power to poke around and see what was installed. There were many Chinese type apps and widgets which are easily removed by accessing the information of each application/widget and forcing them to shut down and clear data. There are also other apps that do a great job of removing apps too. After the removal of unwanted apps I went to town downloading apps from the Google App Store, I went to Amazon from Chrome and installed the Amazon App, installed Kindle and other apps from amazon after changing some security settings. I ran a benchmark tester (ATunTu) against it, the results were great. it easily compared to many of the newer and more expensive models, performance and 3d rendering are awesome. The resolution could be better but for 100 bucks you cannot go wrong. I have been playing tons of games, streaming music, videos, watching recorded videos all within the last week that I have owned this. (note, this is my first android device, first tablet)Issues that I have had: The device comes with a DC cable for charging, this will not charge with a micro USB cable. There is a micro USB cable to attach to the computer and transfer files though. It also has an adapter cable to tie two devices like USB or two tablets together (I have not tried).Issues I had were: when charging using a wall USB jack, the battery looked full but after about 30 min, the device just shut down\u2026no power. Once i plugged the DC jack in to the USB of my computer, it charges and last at least 4 Hours with continuous use. (I bring it to work with a full charge, use it to check email, play games during lunch, check web sites throughout the day, after 9 hours i still have 50% battery life). Some reviews state not to use a MicroSD card as it kills the battery... I have not experienced this issue at all.Overall: I think that this is a great little inexpensive device and i hope to get my 100 dollars out of it. So far so good! I am pleased with its performance and battery life and the expansive collection of apps from both Google and Amazon. I am glad i did the research and looked for a great alternative for a nexus or similar device. There is not back camera or Bluetooth, but for a net saving of close to 200 dollars, I can live with that.

Although it did arrive sooner then expected and in excellent shape, the initial problem is that it comes with an European charger with an American adapter plug, additionally the accompanying manual was in Chinese. Neither is a problem if you are a techie to begin with. However, the unit had difficulty charging and staying charged, at times appearing to discharge as fast as it was charging or indicating it was not charging at all. As a result it has not been useful. I informed Amazon which forwarded the complaint to the manufacturer, who responded quickly. For the charger that is the only one available, but after several contacts and having to flash the tablet, it still did not charge properly and as long as the charger was connected, would continually turn itself on, even if it wasn't charging, draining the battery further. I was informed to ship it back to the manufacturer, at my cost, awaiting a new or repaired unit. At this point I would not recommend this and would wait for the new model of the Coby Kryos to come out. When I had the opportunity to test the new 7\" Kryos at the 2013 CES, I was very impressed and at the same price point as the iRulu, I will buy it the next time, unless of course there is a difference when I receive my tablet back.

Because I'm blind, my primary reason for purchasing the tablet was to test the screen reader, TalkBack. Upon getting it out of the box, I noticed that the tablet didn't feel very durable--plastic that gives if you squeeze it even a little. That said, though, the tablet is small and very light, easily tossed in a backpack or small bag. I like the fact that it comes with a screen protector preinstalled.Unfortunately, when I took my tablet out of the box, I was dismayed to find that everything was in Chinese. It took us awhile to figure out how to switch back to English and even then, the fun wasn't over. TalkBack (the Android's screenreader) hated the Chinese characters and refused to play nicely with them. This tablet, which I had been so excited to grab, became so frustrating that I just ended up setting it in a corner and walking away for a couple of days. In that time, my mom, who is sighted, picked it up and played with it some. She, too, said that the chinese characters and the odd layout of the menu were confusing. She gave up on it too. Then I had the idea of looking to see if there was a US firmware for the tablet. Low and behold, it's not hard to find if you do a bit of Googling. I regret that I downloaded it on a campus computer and no longer have the link, so I can't share it here, but like I said, ten seconds on Google will find it for you. If you're techy, which I am, rooting the Android is straightforward and simple. If not, you're in for a bit of a harrowing experience, as a misstep will leave you with a $99 paperweight.After rooting and reflashing the tablet with the US firmware, menus are straightforward and everything is in English. Now I could get to using the actual tablet.I like that the tablet has a micro SD card expansion slot. I had a bunch laying around from old cell phones that I used before the iPhone, so tossed in an 8-gb one and now have a 16-gb tablet. I also don't mind the speaker and sound quality--it's a little tinny and quiet, but for a $90 tablet it's not half bad. What I don't like is that there is a separate, proprietary USB cable for charging. The tablet already has a micro USB port. why did we need to add another port only for the purpose of charging, when that could have easily been handled through the micro USB port as with so many other tablets? Another thing that I don't like is the short battery life. You'll be lucky to get a solid 3 hours of use out of this before you have to charge it. If you travel and want to watch videos or play games on long road or plane trips, look elsewhere. This is not the tablet for you.Ultimately, despite its shortcomings, I decided to keep this tablet because it does what I need it to--lets me play a little with Android and familiarize myself with the operating system, as well as letting me test apps. It also, however, made me realize how very much I love my Apple products, and I have since gotten an iPad mini to use as my primary tablet. So let's sum up.Pros:*Nice, portable, inexpensive tablet that is good for getting to know the Android OS and light app usage*Micro SD card slot offers easy expandability*Over all, good tablet for the priceCons:*I needed to root and reflash this tablet before I could use it properly*Micro USB port does not charge the battery*Short battery life", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "My son loves the Pipo Tablet...", "Author": "Shri", "ReviewID": "RDKOT8P4MHSZH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My son loves the Pipo tablet & he has already played all the games downloaded on it.

So I went in search of an inexpensive, reliable tablet which could easily be attached to my HDTV.  After exhaustive research (I'm a big researcher, even for a hundred-dollar computer), I decided to try the Pipo S1.  What a great choice!  At 1/8 the price of an iPad, this is a perfect solution for a tablet which will live most of its life sitting next to the TV and streaming programming (including Flash videos) or websites to the big screen (which it does beautifully).  The mini-HDMI connector makes it ridiculously simple to connect to an HDTV (just buy a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable and plug it in) and the picture quality on the HDTV is outstanding.  Importantly, there is nothing cheap-feeling about the Pipo tablet:  it is small, but has the heft of a quality product.  (Many reviewers complained that the $50-$60 tablets were made of flimsy plastic.)If you're looking for a small tablet for everyday use (web surfing, e-mails, games, etc.), the Pipo is perfectly fine (and, at this price, would be a great tablet for kids).  If price weren't a consideration (for you Rockefellers out there), would I recommend the Pipo over an iPad for everyday tablet use?  Of course not -- unless, that is, you want to watch Flash videos, which the the iPad cannot play.  Being Android-based, the Pipo doesn't provide the highly refined user interface which has made the iPad a worldwide phenomenon; however, I actually find the Android system kind of charming, in a primitive sort of way.  The fact that the Pipo is about $700 less expensive than an iPad tends to magnify that charm.I'm going to order a second Pipo and an easel stand to use as a bedside alarm clock.  There are lots of great alarm apps (many of which are free), including one which says good morning to you by name, tells you the weather and reads you the headline news.  Okay, it's a little geeky and maybe even corny, but for a hundred bucks, it'll start my day with a smile.Reminder:  The Pipo doesn't come with a USB wall charger so don't forget to order one.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tablet", "Author": "zuno", "ReviewID": "R3VK7VP4GFYZ3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet for a great price love it and all the apps I have tried wok on it, its just great!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing product, quality build, perfect price.", "Author": "I LOVE MUSIC", "ReviewID": "R3VAL5G320XGYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently own a Galaxy S2 phone, a powerhouse pc, a laptop, and I am a qualified techy/gamer.

You can not update the firmware directly (but it already comes with Android 4.1.2, semi-recent firmware), My 2nd con is it only has a whimpy 0.3 meg pixel front facing camera. You get pics of yourself unless you hold it facing away from you, ackward? Pics in bright light or sunshine turn out the best. Low light pics at .3 megs are crap and all black. My 3rd is the screen resolution....Its low 800x400, but not horribly so. It would be comparable to your old tv set. It could play a dvd movie really good but regular channels were not as clear or as sharp. This processor is fast!!!!! Most of the time it is faster than my S2...REALLY!!! With 1 gig ram, dual core cpu @ 1.6ghz; and a QUAD core gpu for games!!!!  The Pipo Smart 1 tablet is fast....there is not a 3D game I can't play on this tablet. I have tried many. People complain about battery life.....I put Juice Defender power app on it, set it to aggressive, and I get 8-10 hours of actual use. I could get more battery life out of it if you could adjust the brightness down even further. Even when brightness is all the way down it is still plenty bright. As for freezing, I have not had that issue at all. In fact quite the opposite, it is very responsive and fast to execute commands or open apps. Its menu and settings tree is pretty basic. As with any new device optimize settings for you. Downloading over wifi is a little different. It can connect just fine to wifi networks but.... remember this, when you click download, WAIT....it may seem like it is not going to download and then whoosh off you go. It seems to be slow in requesting the download but once it starts it goes quickly!! Fast wifi speeds. I have tried it over several networks and results seem typical. There is not an app I have not been able to install, I have all formats of all kinds of media....documents, pdf, music, pics, videos, and dvds in mkv file formats, etc. Plays everything perfectly. Takes standard Micro SD cards. I have a Samsung 8gig class 6 Micro SD in it now with music, movies, and pics on it. Speed playing a movie is less than 2 sec start up time from SD card. Now as for the charging. Yes this device only charges thru the charging port. It does not charge thru the data cable at all. However it will charge thru the usb connection off your computer using the round tipped charging cable as the other end is a usb port. Construction is well made of hard plastic that is light weight and comes with an included screen protector. If your looking for a truly HD picture experience for games and movies then pass this tablet up. If your looking for a tablet that's fast, with a little less picture quality then look right here. Full android market, and third party apps. Minus the screen resolution its a perfect tablet. I am buying more of theses.

It is just sitting on my desk unable to be used because it can not keep a charge at all. So until they do what they said they would do I am going to be honest, I can't use it so it is not a 5***** product.

The display has a poor 800 by 480 resolution but honestly it doesnt look that bad in person, however its outdoor visibility is fairly poor.Hardware however is excellent for the money and the device feels REALLY fast, not as a quad core but much better that the single core equipped competition. And the addition of Jelly Bean and Project Butter is really nice.However is not a perfect device, theres a strange problem that makes the device reboot itself without explanation, sometimes the screen does not respond to touch and you need to reboot it. But again thats not a dealbreaker at those things dont happen every time.The USB OTG feature works really well but the HDMI output does not and seems to output the same resolution of the tablet, so it doesnt upscale to HD. Thats pretty sad knowing that the tablet has a pretty cool app that lets you do the same thing as Pop Up Play on the Galaxy S3.Tablet market is changing and high quality products are getting cheaper, while I can still recommend the PIPO S1 you must know that in the near future tablets that are equal or even better than the PIPO will be avaliable, so its your choice.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "review of product", "Author": "Daniel J.

One thing that annoyed me right off the bat was that there was no US wall charger just a USB power cord. So I plug into my other USB phone changer and tablet charges up. I log on to internet via WiFi no problem and signed on to Google play to download my favorite apps and games. Download Fruit ninja and start playing. BAM!!! the system crashes and goes into a system reboot cycles that the tablet wouldn't come out of! So I think OK I need to reset the tablet? Well I press the reset and it is a NO GO! Tablet will not get past start-up screen. Went to Amazon printed out a label and sent back via UPS. I checked with a Mobile Phone tech and he told me it probably was problem with game stressing CPU cooling with cheap tablets and they are not able to dissipate the heat like a better made tables, but he did not say this definitive. In the end he told me \"what do you expect with a hundred dollar tablet\". It probably would not have died if I had not played any games on the tablet but fruit ninja is not that powerful a game come on!

I was NOT aware before ordering that it was being shipped from China, but I was cautiously optimistic it would still be a good tablet. I did get the package relatively quickly considering it came from China, but did have some hang-ups with the FedEx guy too.I opened the tablet, was pretty excited about how sleek and shiny and pretty it looked. I tried to remove the protective clearcoat sticky cover from the back, and it was peeling off the serial number, so I had to use a small craft X-acto knife to cut around the sticker and peel off the rest of the covering.I noticed upon power-up that it was at about 63% so I left it in my computer usb charge-up for several hours. At bedtime, it said fully charged 100%, so I put it directly into sleep mode and left it for morning. When I came back to try it out not even 10 hrs later, the battery had already gone down to about 82%. I also was having a very hard time trying to get it to change from Chinese to English language, even when I correctly selected the English and the location being NY. I noticed as I was trying to figure these menu options out, that the battery was literally draining at 1% PER MINUTE. At that point I figured there is NO WAY I am keeping this shiny paperweight that was over $100!I have requested a full refund and am hoping that it is honored!
