I'm almost embarrassed to admit I had to go through two other tablets to get one that, so far, seems to be working right.  The first two tablets had some serious screen issues, ones that no reviewer or forum touched on, the first would have a blue screen flash on the screen then the picture would start twitching uncontrollably.  The second tablet I got had some serious screen flickering like the old TV's just before they went bad.  I would like to mention that both of the tablets had the 'crunching' sound on the screen so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it.  The last tablet I got seems to have a much better screen, there is no 'crunching' and the build seems solid.  You would think after having such a hard time I would give it a lower rating but this tablet is great.  It's responsive, it looks cool, it's fast, it has an optional keyboard dock (which I'm using now to type this review) and it has the potential to replace my laptop (I'll have to use this more before I can go that far).  I would recommend this tablet, but if what I have been reading is true the TF300 is just as good but without the HD display and Gorilla glass and a slightly slower CPU.  I hope I don't run into more screen (or other issues) with this tablet, it's my first time buying an Asus product and though initially I was disappointed I hope to get a better experience with my third tablet.**************updated 10/7/2012 previously a 4 star review******************So here I am with tablet #3 and my screen is going AGAIN, it's flickering and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the screen goes bad like my previous two.  Unfortuantely for me, I'm well past the 30 day return period so I had to go through Asus support and will be sending my unit in for repair.  I don't think that a piece of equiptment that costs $500 should be giving this many problems and I can't recommend anyone buy this tablet (at least not sight unseen and being able to test the edges for the crunching clicking sound) though it is great in most other regards why would you want to deal with such a hassel.  It really is unfortunate and i'm not sure if I'm just very unlucky, but something tells me this is not a 'just me' problem.  This has been my first experience with an Asus product and will probably be my last.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE Customer Service", "Author": "Erikka Bohm", "ReviewID": "R3DCLC9RDLLWGB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Lucky me! I bought this product and found a hairline crack on it four days after purchase. Didn't drop it, kept it on their dock and literally have no idea how it could have happened unless there was problems with the dock like other users have reported on tranformer forums dot com (would link multiple forums but amazon doesn't allow it). Did some research and read about other's grief with their tablets such as overheating, weak spots on the left corner of the tablet (where mine cracked--so this isn't an isolated incident), and stress put on weak parts of the screen from the rubber rests on the keyboard. And no help from ASUS. This was not a spider web crack, rather a single thin one extending down the entire left side of the screen. And after researching it seems like I'm not the only one dealing with this issue--crack in left corner after docking.So closing the unit on the keyboard dock station made to coordinate with the product amounts to \"customer induced damage\". Good to know.Gave ASUS's incredibly unhelpful customer service a call and got a hold of someone who gave canned responses. ASUS decided they would give me the privilege of paying $220 to fix the problem after I paid out of my pocket to send it to them (oh, and they offer no confirmation of receipt--the onus is on you to nag them and check on status). Less than one week after purchase, I'm supposed to shell out more money. Once again, lucky me.Their customer service is so bad. Don't believe me, google Asus and customerservice scoreboard (amazon won't allow me to link it here) to see a list of customer complaints with their canned responses, and check the article in Huffington Post by Michael Russnow.Does the software on this tablet function? It's fine. But if anything happens and you need service you are up a creek. Buy it with some sort of insurance or with squaretrade, ASUS won't help you if anything goes wrong.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid performance; Amazing screen; and Jelly Bean!", "Author": "Charlie White \"Tech-Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RLYX7ZZARJN4N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After having my owned my Asus Infinity TF700 for one month, I just got the Jelly Bean OTA update -- no rooting required.  This is a solid update, to a excellent tablet.  I usually like to wait a bit before posting my technology reviews, so here's my review:Pros:+Firstly, Amazing screen.  While it might not have the pixel density of Apple's Retina display, it offers Super IPS+ screen is very nice OUTSIDE in direct sunlight.  (Apple can't say that.)  It also features 16:9 resolution which is perfectly suited to widescreen movies.  Others who have seen my screen agree, it's nothing short of spectacular.  And in my everyday use, the Gorilla2 glass has kept my screen scratch free.+Secondly, the Android install is clean.  It comes with ICS (Android 4.0), but an update to Jelly Bean is available over the air, with no fuss.  The few Asus apps installed were actually useful -- like a file explorer, an excellent backup utility, and some cloud storage.  I prefer this to the bloatware, and modified operating system that other vendors offer.  (Asus' partnership with Google on the Nexus 7, is evidence of Asus' expertise with Android OS.)+Thirdly, an excellent camera that rivals my Point and Shoot camera.  It features a  F.2.2 lens with a 28-mm equivalent focal length.  Okay, I'll admit a tablet is a bit large for everyday photography.  But if you have with you, this device camera will outperform your smartphone.+Micro-MDHI port allows me to natively export the screen image to my LCD widescreen.  I use both direct-HDMI and HDMI to adapter for screen outputs.  (I had a problem with 1 older VGA projector, that couldn't handle the 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.) Overall, this feature is one more step toward using this as a laptop replacement.+Battery: I set my WiFi to turn off when the device is in sleep mode, and go DAYS (not hours) of casual use.  Even with non stop use, I still get over 9 hours of battery.Negatives:No device is perfect.  And while these are shortcomings, these are minor and don't deter me from giving the device a full 5 stars.-Speaker: good quality, but it's not loud enough for anything more than personal use.  I compensate with a good Bluetooth wireless speaker.-Wifi: Although it works at 802.11n speeds, I still have some dead spots in my house...in the same places where my laptop works fine.-Android App EcoSystem is not large for tablets.  There are some fine apps out there, and I was surprised that a lot of business productivity apps are there (like WebEx, Citrix Goto Meeting, Juniper and Cisco SSL clients, etc...).  But as an example, Disney has ignored Android apps, so you'll see apps available for iPad that aren't available for Android.  Google knows this is a weak spot, and I see more tablet apps showing up.I'll wrap up by saying this has been a very addictive device -- quickly replacing my laptop for day to day use.  The default browser supports Flash, which allows me to view most web sites natively.  I've had no quality issues reported by other reviewers.  I purchased mine from BestBuy (sorry Amazon).  And I would have no problem recommending this for anyone looking for a top-of-the-line, Android based powerhouse.Update: after accepting all three OS updates from Asus, since buying this, my device has become painfully slow....like, \"I can't possibly use this for anything\" slow.  I'm beginning to wish I had gone with an iOS device.  With keyboard, cases, and unit, there was a lot of money invested into this purchase.  Now it's functionally useless.  I'm going to try doing a factory reset -- but the point is I shouldn't have to do that.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product and great service !", "Author": "nuno", "ReviewID": "R36UADAAL7OQ5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my first one last week on Thursday. It was a great but had one minor white spot (which I initially thought was a speckle of dust) which happened to be a LCD leak/cloud/pixel dust/whatever people call it. I noticed it only after a couple of hours. It was really minute, very difficult to make out, as it is noticeable only when looking straight right above it, only on a complete white background. It almost got blended with the white background at certain brightness levels. Well, I'm very particular about my screens. I applied for replacement in the night and by the amazing super-fast service of both Amazon and Asus, I got my replacement next day! Really happy with the service. And yes! my new infinity is perfectly defect free and awesome !Talking of review of the product itself:1. Fantastic performance - The four cores fired up and Nvidia tegra 3 kicked into play when in turned on Horn - butter smooth gameplay, great textures, rich world detail, smooth edges. can run songs on youtube/ music from library while surfing on net, or even minimizing that to change screen to supernate/polaris for taking notes. No slowdowns noticed.2. Brilliant screen: Anyways the human eye cannot process iPad's resolution n ppi - screen would need to be 40inch+, neither can it process the infinity's reso and ppi on a 10.1\" screen. Great clarity and color contrast. IPS + ROCKS!3. Camera - The 8mp on the back with flash, surpasses my expectations! though the front camera is really important for me as I would rarely/never use a back cam on a tab. The front cam amazed me to with pretty decent clarity - it being 2mp. Works great for Skyping!4. Body and design - Haha! I fell in love with it when I saw it online for the first time. Great design, very thin and light, sturdy, well-built, elegant... all 9 yards...5. Battery backup (without dock) - After charging it to full, I used it with heavy applications running simultaneously on full performance n IPS+mode for 2 hrs, and heavy gaming (Horn, Batman, Nova 3) for 2hrs - I still had 22% battery left. Its good enough for me.I also bought the dock.

Do not use this review as the instructions to do the unlock/rom install, there are better instructions.If you're not willing to do this then I can't recommend it. Get the Note 10.1 or Nexus 10, even if they are a little bit more money.  Or, buy it and be prepared to return it within a short time if your browser thinks it's from 1997.This thing was decent when I first got it.  Then the first update came and slowed down the browser to a very frustrating pace.  Like the worst computer you've ever used. Like an Ipad 1 which is what I had bought this to replace. The second update came and it was no better, maybe slightly worse.  There is something wrong with either the latest versions of Android or the lack of ram in this machine or Asus' ability to create their own ROM.  My 2GB Samsung Note 2 blows it out of the water in wifi or LTE. Samsung knows how to fix stock Android.I was really about to chalk this purchase up to a bad decision and just retire it after less than 2 months.  I couldn't in good conscience sell it to someone else.  If it was a horse I'd have to have shot it!  Then I figured I'm going to stop using it anyway, might as well try one of the \"mods\" that are all over the internet, especially xda developers site.  So I spent an evening reading about how to do it and the next day spent an hour doing it.  There is simple software available where you just choose some options and it magically does it.First I \"unlocked\" the bootloader, did not select root though it may have done that anyway, then did a backup, then installed the ROM (Cleanrom Inheritance) which is a slimmed down version of the actual Asus ROM.  I got to pick and choose default apps as well as the ability to add some additional ones during the install.  The additional ones are things like different home screens like Nova, ADW, etc, as well as different file managers, etc. Make sure you download browser2ram also and run it after install.  Quite a bit of good stuff.  Then I pressed install. I also chose to clear cache.  I recommend clearing ALL cache options because...Then came time to reboot. Then I waited.  And waited. And started freaking out that I may have \"bricked\" it.  It wouldn't get past the Asus spinning wheel.  Give it 15 mins. Googled it and found out that if I got this far, it wasn't bricked. Yippee.  If it doesn't work, hold the power button down until it shuts down, go back into the bootloader (hold volume down and power until the 3 icons come back up). Then clear ALL cache (3 buttons I think) and reboot normally again. Seems like after a time or two doing this it came up just fine as if it was a new tablet asking me to log into my Google account.Guess what?  It was a completely different tablet.  Now it works like it should.  The browser is fast, maybe not quite as fast as my Note 2 but then again my Note 2 has 2GB ram. I never get close to 1gb of ram used (sits about 6-700mb), so not sure if the Samsung is just faster or better. Could also be the lower resolution and screen size of the Note 2 vs the 1080p screen.  It's just fine now though, not the frustrating machine that gave me the worst post-purchase dissonance I've had in quite some time.In the future if desired, I'll no longer get over the air updates (fact of life if you unlock the bootloader).  Thank GOD (and Asus) for that! I'll take these xda updates or simply leave it as it is forever (3 years it will probably be long in the tooth anyway).Luck..", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best android tablet so far", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3AEYI7CQAWNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is incredible and I don't even know where to start. It does everything as advertised and fulfills its specs. It's very fast and responsive, although rarely it does lag and freeze up for a few secs. Once I did receive it, the battery was dead. Upon reading the manual it says charge it up to 8 hours before use, which I did. After turning it on, a few minutes later you will be prompted to update to the latest firmware. After updating you will receive all the latest update for it and the latest version of ice cream sandwich. Unfortunately at the moment jelly bean isn't available yet, but Asus has declared that the do plan to bring jelly bean to the tablet. The new version of Android doesn't include flash player since Adobe has discontinued it. You can still install flash player by downloading the latest apk file and installing it using the file manager on the tablet. It does come with a few bloatware that can't be uninstalled unless you root the tablet, but some of it is useful. For those who are looking to game, the Tegra 3 processor is for you. You can play games like Grand theft auto 3, Max payne, and even emulators from the market place. As for the hardware, the display is very nice and delivers true HD. It does come with a cleaning cloth for the screen and cleans it very well. The rear camera records and takes pictures in a very high quality while the front is good quality, but much noticeable than the rear. It does read and accept a 64GB micro sd card. Many people have complained about the speaker placement. It does affect the sound since it's going away from you and will sound muffled if your hand is in the way. However, it does deliver great and precise volume. The battery lasts a very long time, but will drain faster if you have the tablet in performance mode rather than power saving mode. An option of a docking station is available to you which I got and I'm very glad I did. It turns the tablet into a netbook. The dock give the tablet another 5-6 hours of battery and works by when the tablet's battery falls around 70%, it will start to be charged by the dock. The dock is just like a laptop's keyboard. It includes an sd card reader (not micro), a USB 2.0 slot, and a charging slot. The price the tablet sells for is definitely worth it.

Nichols", "ReviewID": "RMGYCLSKT6BZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my first tablet was an ipad2. a great device but far from perfect. my second tablet was an asus transformer prime. a great tablet also. it was new and innovative, but bugs like poor wifi and gps reception. Oh but this one, the infinity is from the perspective of tech geek nothing short of magnificent.  it runs on the android jellybean operating system which is stable, fast and very intuitive to use. battery life is phenomenal and unlike others this has so much power in part due to the underlying tegra 3 chip set which enables to choose you power options low, balanced or full performance depending on what you are doing and can easily stretch out that battery life from the tablet alone to around 12-13 hours.  it has second gen. gorilla glass that even the newest ipad is lacking. the screen resolution is just a hair shy of the retina display of the newest apple tablets. that said it is a after all a ten inch screen so side by side viewing you cannot tell a difference.  it does have something no other tablet maker has and that is a super ips screen. that means if you need to use it outside in the sun you simply touch the ips icon and you can make the display brighten so much it is easily used even in bright sunlight. if you hold the tablet in your hands it feels rock solid, excellent build quality. software, os and app updates are sent out periodically any you need do little or nothing as the process is so smooth and automated for the most part. built into the tablet is a micro sd slot which i can tell you from experience it can handle a 64gb card just fine. note, if by chance you get a card check the formatting first as most come fat32 or exfat. you don't want either though the fat32 will work, but really you should change using another device, pc format to ntfs for best results.  i also have the docking station/keyboard and even though it cost around $140 bucks more i consider that essential. reasons being for one a second battery built into that which provides another four hours of up time. you also get a usb 2.0 connection, a regular sd card slot(good for up to 128gb), a micro hdmi connection, besides std microphone, headphone connections. the tablet slides into the dock so simply i don't see how they could improve that aspect. it locks firmly and no fear of coming loose. it also detaches just as easily, slide the button and lift. typing is a bit cramped but it is a ten inch tablet/ultrabook depending on your needs at the time. wifi and gps issues with the out of production tf201 are long gone and work very will with the infinity. there are also as of this writing more than 700,000 apps to choose from in the android store e.g. google play store. though you don't need it as cross platform office apps and good ones are already available and play well with msoffice, keep in mind office for android is set to be released this coming march 2013. so if you want the best, one that will stand the test of time and will set you apart from every other tablet owner, the infinity is the one to go for. you absolutely will not be disappointed. normally i am not nearly so long winded with my reviews but it is rare that i get something and am so very satisfied with it and fyi, the ipad 2, i gave it to my daughter.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS TF700 Infinity", "Author": "squall-leonhart-8 \"Gamgee\"", "ReviewID": "R1QGJV8R9K2KEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet to replace my Kindle Fire (it worked and wasn't old, but I wanted a full-sized tablet). I have had the ASUS for 2-3 months, and it works great. I can do everything I did on the Kindle Fire, read books, play games, watch movies, browse the web, etc, and all on a bigger screen, which is nice. It also has a camera, though the back camera takes the same clarity pictures as my phone, which is smaller and easier to take pictures with. My sister has an iPad, and from what I saw it appears that the ASUS can do everything the iPad can. However, the ASUS has a bigger 10.1\" screen instead of a 9.7\" screen, and the memory can be expanded via a microSD card.There are only a few cons I have with the tablet. The first con I have is that it goes slowly or freezes up once in a while, but it does not do it so often to create a problem. And it usually does that when I'm browsing the web, so it might be a problem with my web browser, Firefox, and not the tablet. Another con isn't really a con with the tablet, but that Amazon has not created an Amazon Video Store app for Android. You're forced to stream Amazon Instant Videos through the web, and I felt the built-in Amazon Video Store app the Kindle Fire had made streaming videos much nicer than using a web browser. Also, I would have preferred the champagne color, but when I bought it in September the champagne color was not sold by most sellers.I do not feel the cons are that big of a problem, and would recommend this tablet to anyone wanting to read, or watch movies or browse the web on the go. It is one of the best Android tablets out there at the time this review was written, and will no doubt last for years into the future. Currently, the only tablet I know of that has better RAM and speed is the Google Nexus 10, and it is not a significant improvement.Finally, a piece of advice I have would be to strongly consider what you want for a case before purchasing a case. The first case I got was a rooCase Dual-View. I found the rooCase Dual-View to be bulky when using it, and preferred using it outside of the case, and decided that I would prefer a sleeve since if I'm going to take it out of the case to use it anyway, I'd prefer something that would completely surround it and not leave parts of it exposed to possible dirt when I'm not using it. The sleeve I ordered does not seem to be very thick, though, and I am worried that it might not protect the tablet well enough, so I am currently looking at getting a third case/sleeve/bag for it. So, the lesson I have is that you should strongly consider whether or not you mind having a bulky case around the tablet when using it, and if you do not want it exposed to dirt/etc when not in use, and other factors so you do not spend a fortune on getting different cases for the tablet. (Will (probably) update the review once I find a case/sleeve/bag that works well).Update January 30, 2013 (on Cases):As far as cases for the TF700, I recommend the IVSO slim-fit case, or a similar case. The IVSO is very minimal, with just hooks on the corners, and the back and front covered. However, it seems sturdy and is protected in all the necessary places (namely, the corneres). It is much thinner than the rooCase was, and the front cover is much easier to fold behind the tablet than the rooCase. I also store the tablet in the IVSO case inside a Targus Impax sleeve, which is also a high quality sleeve that I'd recommend to give extra protection to the tablet when not in use. It is a little bigger than necessary for the tablet, but it is made for 10\" laptops, and there are very few sleeves made specifically for the TF700.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Android Tablet I Have Been Waiting for", "Author": "J.

Needless to say, it was not Amazon.  I love Amazon for their return policy and I wish it had been them.Thank goodness though that I finally have an Android tablet that I did not want to return within a very short period of time.  This TF700 does have its glitches, but most of it is due to Android as I have seen the same problems on every other brand.The first thing you will notice is the beautiful screen.  What makes it more beautiful is that so far, everything is responsive.  I finally was able to swipe the screen and it changed without stuttering.  No dead pixels and the one irk is that yes, there is some very little light bleeding going on.  Very little though compared to the other tablets I have owned or tried.  Frustrating, but not enough to return it.This TF700 is very light weight.  Much lighter than most I have ever help in my hands.  Makes my iPad 3 feel very heavy.  The weight makes it feel fragile indeed, but only time can tell how well it holds up.  My case is still on back order, so I have been treating this like a baby.Many of the apps I use or want to use unfortunately are made for Android phones and not for tablets.  So many of them look bad.  A nicer tablet means nothing without updated apps.  Hopefully more of the apps I like to use will become tablet apps as well.  Most of those same apps are made for the iPad and look wonderful on it.Another device with a proprietary plug for it.  Need I say more?My volume control seems to click funny and I hope that does not become a problem some day.  I am hoping that is just the way it is, but it does not feel quite right.With my one processor intensive game I have played for a couple of years now on Android, I get about 4.5 hours of battery life.  Which is a lot compared to other tablets i have tried.  Without playing that game and just doing other things, I got about 9 hours twice.The TF700 is a great device. Whether or not is it worth this much is completely for you to decide.  I think it is a little on the high side, but doable.  The biggest issues are what most tablets experience: ICS.

I stay away from iEverything, and prefer to root my devices and modify them to my choosing soon after purchase. Hence, why I tend to hate Apple and love everything Open Source. That being said, you'd EXPECT this review to be overwhelmingly in favor of Asus, right? Well, let me tell you the story of how one of the world's largest tech manufacturers is losing ground in the war for tablet supremacy due to some of the world's DUMBEST mistakes.Here's the lowdown: this is a product page, I'm reviewing the PRODUCT, not the company, not even an isolated negative experience I had with THIS product. What I'm writing here reflects the opinions of hundreds if not thousands of dedicated ASUS tablet fans who are incensed and disappointed with their latest foray into the tablet market.It all started a few months ago: I wanted to make the upgrade from my aging (aging WELL let me remind you) TF101 that I loved so dearly, to its successor, the Transformer Prime. Originally, I ordered it, only to find out literally 4 days later that the Infinity had been released. I issued a return on that unit easily with Amazon, as there was quite a bit of noticable light leak as well as the inherent GPS/Wifi issues. Satisfied, I returned the Prime and waited anxiously for my Infinity to arrive while I hastily (And foolishly) sold my TF101. At this point in my review I'd like to instruct all current owners of the TF101 to HOLD OFF on your upgrade, and don't be so willing to give Asus any more of your money.I received my first (OF FOUR, so far) Infinity...*sound of crickets* and I was devastated by the lack of quality. Where I had once gotten a perfect Transformer, and convinced MANY of my fellow tech enthusiasts to either purchase one or switch over from the inferior iPads, I was now faced with one severely flawed Infinity. Light leaks all around the bezel, some as large as a half-penny. Creaks along the edges of the frame, thankfully though, no dead pixels. Then I started to USE the tablet, and it all went downhill from there. ANR errors, freezes, performance hiccups...this thing NEEDED root. It's rare that you're able to say of a manufactured device that its Stock experience is literally SO UNSAVORY, that my recommendation to even the most technologically challenged consumer would be to FIND someone to root it for you. And yet, despite the buttery smoothness of the stock kernel on the original Transformer, I found myself unable to deal with the stock experience on the Infinity TWO generations above it. This has been my experience with EVERY REPLACEMENT I'VE RECEIVED to date. Every single one, had light leak issues, and performance bugs (those varied). And only two of them had properly fastened bezels with no give/creaks.My OG Transformer had no light leaks, creaks, hiccups or performance issues out the box. I actually wrestled with the decision to root it! Until of course the Prime ROM was released for it (Before ICS, when Honeycomb still held sway on the Android Tabs), and I had to upgrade.This Infinity has so much potential, and I think that's the reason I NEED to give it one star. Because NOTHING is as sad, as when a product with the hardware and software capability needed to rival and in some cases DEFEAT anything Apple can throw at it, FAILS to live up to its expectations due to extremely poor QA/QC Departments and TERRIBLE product/kernel architects. How hard is it, really, to tell your manufacturer to REALLY bear down on the assemblers to ensure that EVERY tablet bezel has a uniform fit and finish? How hard is it, to source IPS Panels that don't have such AWFUL amounts of light leak? When you have more than just a few hundred complaints on light-leak for your tablet, that's not a bad BATCH, that's a bad product.Same goes for the lagging/kernel speed: Am I a disgruntled customer? Yes. But this goes beyond the subjective. Anyone can do a Google search for \"Transformer Prime/Infinity Kernel I/O issues\" and see what I'm talking about. It's THAT simple. Either search will net you hundreds of thousands of results regarding the inferior flash memory that ASUS used on these tabs (to cut costs? on a $500 tablet! Give me the best! I'll pay extra!), and how it affects the I/O Performance in such a way as to make this MORE capable (theoretically) tablet, LESS speedy/capable than its predecessor! One exclamation point at the end of that sentence is not enough to express the outrage and shock I feel due to the lunacy of this entire situation. Really ASUS, How hard is it to fix these problems? Do you have your Devs working on a BETTER kernel for the release of your Jelly Bean blob, to address the I/O issues at the software level, as so many Custom ROM developers have already done for you? I hope so, and I hope that in doing so, you also willingly remove the CMClient software that allows you to remotely access/administer/track your devices and users so clandestinely. Google that also readers, \"CMCLient Tracking\", again, it's THAT simple to dig this stuff up.These are such SIMPLE fixes on the side of a multi-BILLION dollar tech company. I still own and continue to use some of their components in my PC's today! And yet, the word from ASUS has been suspiciously mum: not even a simple apology, or would that be too much an admission of guilt? I can't in good conscience continue to give this company my money, if the feedback concerning their poor QC doesn't improve. What we NEED, is for your QC people to get up to snuff (As they did with the original Transformer, I KNOW they can do with this superior product), and make it so that these units are in good enough uniform shape to PHYSICALLY challenge the latest iPad. In addition, we need your Developers to either hand-write enough code themselves to address the shortcomings inherent within the kernel/flash memory, or begin working more closely with developers on XDA who have already made headway on the issue.Either way, you CANNOT expect to retain the loyalty of your base (Read: Geeks, nerds, PC enthusiasts) if you continue to alienate them with such boneheaded mistakes. This Tablet is a DUD, and though on paper it should by all means be laying waste to the competition, it will never succeed in reality if ASUS continues to give it the half-hearted response to complaints/improvements that they desperately need to address. As a reviewer, consumer, and seasoned IT Professional, I simply cannot give anyone my recommendation to purchase this product until these issues are addressed/resolved. In the event that anything changes, I will update/change my review.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "Luke K.", "ReviewID": "R2K33DJV8WPTGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the past few years when tablets were just starting to become the new \"it\" thing to have, I shunned them quite a bit.  To me, they were nothing more than really expensive toys with very limited functionality.  Well, tablets have grown up quite a bit over the years, so my inner hypocrite shined and I decided to go out and get one.  The Asus Infinity TF700 was not my first choice actually.  Originally I wanted to get the Asus Vivo Tab Smart, which I did end up getting at Best Buy for a pretty good price.  The Vivo Tab Smart runs full Windows 8, and only runs for around $499 which isn't that bad at all.  Everything about it is pretty solid, except one thing... If you have never owned or used a Windows 8 tablet before, please keep reading.  Windows 8 in itself is not a bad OS, it is an OS I believe is strictly made for tablet devices, but that's just me.  The problem is this, when navigating your Start Screen it is a great device, but problems lurk the further you dive in.  For instance, when you are navigating through your main desktop on a Windows tablet it is freaking nightmare.  The main problem is you are in the end navigating your way through an OS that is meant for use with a classic mouse and keyboard.  The Start Screen = Great.  The Desktop = No Bueno.  And there is really no way around not using your desktop at least most of the time you're on your Windows tablet.  So that is what did it, just using your fingers to navigate outside the Start Screen is more aggravating than anything.  Even on a screen with a res of 1366x768 everything is STILL to small to try and touch. You go to click on something and you have to zoom in A LOT to hit the right button or link.  And you can't do that everywhere.  I even had a stylus I was using and it didn't always work the way I wanted it to.  I think Windows 8 needs A LOT of work.  The Desktop screen should have been optimized more in tablets especially, and the Windows Store needs to expand very fast and maintain functionality if it has any hopes at competing with the Google Play and Apple Store markets.So, after I returned my Asus Vivo Tab Smart, I went on to my fallback.  The Asus TF700 Infinity Tab.  I was less than excited about getting a tablet that only ran Android OS, but I was open minded about it.  And all I can say in the end is, WOW!! This is an experience 10x better than I had with the Windows 8 Tablet.  EVERYTHING is touch optimized, because well...Android is a mobile based OS, so it kinda has to be :D  The Full HD Screen is absolutely stunning, the build quality is strong and solid, the OS is incredibly easy to navigate through, even for a first time Android user like myself.  The cons on this thing are, well...there are really only two as far as I'm concerned right now.  One is the battery, Wi-Fi eats up A LOT of juice, even on power-saver settings.  So I can at best stretch the battery life to 8-10 hours.  Second is the volume/power buttons.  The edges on this tablet (like most tablets) are beveled, or rounded.  I wish that tablets were made more squared on the edges with very sharp slightly rounded edges.  This would make button issues go away, by placing the buttons on a flatter as opposed to rounded corner surface.  But because the buttons are positioned on a beveled edge, they are a lot more cumbersome.  They are difficult to press at times, and feel slightly loose on occasion.  That is it though in way of issues, for me anyway.In all, this is a GREAT tablet, Asus makes wonderful products and this one doesn't disappoint.  This tablet is great for photographers, graphic artists looking to showcase their artwork, light gamers, the e-book enthusiast, and social network guru.

There are hundreds of amazon reviews and dozens of professional ones so I'll just give a quick pros and cons list. So far I've enjoyed playing a lot of game apps and netflix works pretty damned well. I use the Poetic folio case witch is okay and an Init sleeve I got for $5 which I love. I'd say all said and done I'm out all of an additional $20 in accessories (not including the dock).Pros:Resolution is perfect for the apps in the store, don't get sucked in by the higher resolution tablets if it means losing out on other benefits you really want.I love having the low power consumption mode, it allows longer usage and a much much longer standby time.It looks phenomenal, build quality/fit and finish is top notch. I get no light leaks around the edges and everyone I hand it to falls in love while holding it.Constant OS updates, I was on Jelly Bean a month after it came out and it isn't skinned to death. I have absolutely no longing to root or side-load a custom OS which was the experience I was hoping for.It comes with Polaris productivity sweet, it's not perfect but it'll get you by in a pinch. If you actually need to do work with your tablet expect to buy a decent software package no matter what tablet you get.THE DOCKING STATION...  I won't go into the docking station here but it is tremendous... just the fact that it's an option is a plus in my book. Best $100ish tablet upgrade ever!Internal 32gbMicro SD slotI have yet to not be able to run anything I want without a problem or any lag. I'm not saying there aren't any out there that could cause a problem I've just not come across any myself.Cons:you can't put it to sleep with a magnet in the cover like you can the ipad... that is a super nice feature and I really wish it was included. There are times you wonder if you remembered to put it to sleep or not before you closed the folio case.I really wish there were more accessories i.e. the folio and case options are pretty limited.The speaker is horrible if you are any distance from it. I like to watch netflix in the kitchen while I cook and the speaker is just useless for that so the only solution is to get something external. when you are holding it the speaker is fine though.The power port placement is a bit of a hassle.

Bender", "ReviewID": "R15TRSRR9X3HO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated for a long time about getting a tablet. A couple years ago I'd have sworn that I'd never have one. I've been a laptop guy for a long time and love the PC, but it gets cumbersome some times. You can't do everything with a tablet that you can with a PC, but for most people it can fill most of your needs. Smart phones are nice but they're just to small for my eyes and big fingers. Besides, my view of cell phones is something to make calls with and talk on.That said as I read and looked at different tablets, I realized the potential for their use. I've got issues with Apple and didn't want to go the ipad route for a number of reasons. I did some research on the new Windows tablets and I like the idea, but they've got a way to go. I think they rushed it to get it to market. I like the ideas behind Android and although a lot of the apps are designed more for smart phones, apps optimized for tablets are increasing and all the other smart phone designed apps work. The open source design makes for all sorts of obscure market apps. Plenty of developers out there. You can find some weird stuff for Android that you won't find on other platforms. Lots of pretty good free apps and plenty of cheap stuff too that is impressive.So next I had to decide on size. For 99% of my uses, the 10 inch seemed to be the better choice and with a number of these with docking key pads available, I went that way rather than the smaller versions. So then I had to decide which one. It didn't take long to realize that ASUS was probably the leader in the field and known for very high quality products. Likewise it only took a bit longer to see that the Infinity TF700 with 64GB, was the machine to have. I also opted for the docking keypad.The tablet is very impressive. The screen resolution is right up there with the best ipad. The NVIDIA quad core CPU is a screamer. Can't get much better. Cameras are very good. Battery life is good and amazing with the dock which also has a battery in it. With all the features together, I think this is the best Android tablet out there today and most pro revues agree.As a new user to this scene, I'm sure others may have different ideas that got me to this choice, but I can say that I am completely satisfied. That said, as a \"newbie\" I suppose you might think anything would seem that way, however, I did a lot of research and hands on comparisons and I'm comfortable I bought the best.I am 99.9% thrilled with it. If it has a flaw, it's probably the speaker which faces the wrong way in my opinion and doesn't have quite the volume and sound quality I'd like. It is fine in a quiet environment, but if there's any background noise it leaves a bit to be desired. I have found that if you hold it with your hand somewhat loosely cupped behind the speaker, the sound level improves dramatically as your hand reflects if towrd you. It is fine with ear buds and I also recently picked up a great little bluetooth speaker, (Clalrity HD by Monster), that kicks butt.Everything else about the Infinity TF700 seems perfect. The only other way to make it better would be built in 4G and phone capability. If I'm mobile I use mine with a Verizon Jet Pack, which is an awesome device itself. Even on 3G it works better than my built in mobile broadband in my laptop.Do your own research and get some hands on time if you can to compare because all tablets are not equal. There is no doubt that as far as tablets go, a lot has to do with how you will use it and what for. But if you want the best Android tablet in the 10 inch size range, you can't beat the Infinity TF700.

The WIFI and GPS are flawless on the one I have. The new update is super fast and I absolutely love it! I cannot wait for Jelly Bean to come out because it will be even faster. Those who say it's expensive compare it to the Nexus typically because they both have a Tegra 3. Don't be fooled they are not near the same chip. The one here can go from 1.7GHZ-1.9GHZ. That's really fast compared to any other tablet on the market. Many of the tablets that have 32GB in it are going for $600+. The iPad is stupid compared to this. Let me explain. I bought a 32GB SDHC card on Amazon for $20 making my tablet now a 64GB for $519.99. Can't beat that because the iPad cannot be upgraded with any type of memory. Now the update they just did allows SDHC cards up to 64GB which they run for about $45 making your price for a 96GB tablet $544.99. You really can't beat that compared to the iPad. I will give you one further. Get the Keyboard! It extends the battery life further than the iPad and it's a keyboard/stand/screenprotector. I bought the Prime's keyboard TF200 if you don't know. It was $99 at Best Buy. So for $618.99 I bought this, the keyboard and upgraded it with a 32GB card. Still better than any other price on the market and the keyboard features a usb port which I can place my giant 2 TB harddrive and play my DVR shows and they look the same when played on my friends iPad 3. Don't be fooled by the HD screen you can't tell the difference between the HD screen on this compared to the HD screen on the iPad it's too small of a difference.

Don't get me wrong. I love apple products and own a MacPro, Macbook, iPhone 4S, iPhone 3GS, Airport Extreme, Airport Express, Keyboard and Magic Mouse. But it is nice to get away from the iOS. Though unflawed, it has become a bit boring. I couldn't imagine just having a larger iPhone to play on after playing on my iPhone all day....na mean?The battery life is AMAZING!I charged it for the first time on a Monday night, and normal use (not constantly using it all day long, but all throughout the day) with the keyboard attached for the most part, and it lasted until Thursday night! One of the main reasons I held off on buying a tablet is because I figured that with its bigger screen, in comparison to the iPhone, and considering how much I have to charge my iPhone (about 2-3 times a day), that I would be charging a tablet all day long.Not the case with this tablet. Its a powerhouse! And the brightness is so AMAZING that I barely have to turn it up much. But when you do turn up the brightness...WOW!Overall, I probably keep mine set around the 30% area. This is probably why my battery life lasted for so many days. And as they say with all electronics, the battery life gets better as you go, so I can only imagine!If you plan on buying this tablet I recommend getting the keyboard attachment as well. Not just because of the extended battery life, which it does so well, but also because it doubles as a screen protector when it is closed and a nice stand to hold your tablet up, (although, it is a bit top heavy, so just be careful it doesnt fall over).I winded up buying the Dark Grey colored tablet, but I decided I wanted to get the light gray keyboard instead of the matching color keyboard. I'm glad I did. Not only was the price $50 less, but I think the keys are more visible with the lighter gray background than they would be with the dark color background and dark colored keys.I was afraid it would look stupid at first, but it looks Really good with the contrast of both colors. So even if they were priced the same, I would still go for the lighter gray in the end.I opted for the older 'Prime' keyboard (Asus Transformer Prime TF201 Mobile Docking - Champagne (TF201-DOCK-CG) used...works good as new) after reading reviews that it works with the Infinity despite the claims of Asus that it will not work. I can confirm that it does work and it fits perfectly. I don't feel like I am forcing anything into place.As for the touch responsiveness, some things can be annoying at times, like when surfing the web and clicking links. It seems to press the wrong link a lot. My smaller screened iPhone knows what I am trying to press better than this bigger tablet does at times.Ive been saying this since day one, and it still holds true that nothing compares to the touch sensitivity of Apple's line of touch products. But this isn't too far off. Hopefully I will see even better improvements when Jellybean is released for the Infinity. Fingers crossed.The sound, as others have said, is not that good. I am not a very picky person, but I could barely hear some videos I was watching at times. Especially if there's a YouTube video that was recorded low.I am overall impressed with the app selections. I like that I have an iPhone and an Android Tablet. It makes my world of app selections that much bigger.I recommend this tablet, especially to anyone who owns an iPhone and is in the market for a tablet. Its a nice escape from the usual and it opens up your arsenal to both Apple Apps and Android App worlds.Hope this helped!

This is the best finger print removing cloth I have ever owned.

Considering this beast has quad core processors and a high count of pixels, this should be no surprise. But don't expect 10+ hours of battery life as one would expectfrom an iPad. The flipside, however, is that it takes less than 3 hours to fully charge from 0%-100%.Speakers. Not loud enough for me.

I bought the SquareTrade ADH (accidental damage and handling) warranty with it and I'm glad I did because of this.  I can't use the warranty until that issue causes some performance problems (which it may if dust or water gets in there).  Also as mentioned in a later review for some reason it doesn't have a 5Ghz wifi radio.  That is sort of disappointing as even my Galaxy Nexus supports 5Ghz.The rest of the device is solidly built and it is fast.  I was originally looking to get the Acer A700 as I got the wife the A100 back in February, however the heat issues mentioned in the A700 reviews worried me.  This device stays cool.  I even watched the Reds game using MLBatBat and there was no noticeable heat.  A case is highly recommended though as it's a little difficult to hold since it's so thin.

They estimated a delivery date of 8-3-12 but I received it on 8-2-12. Its pretty nice to order an item online and have it the next day. The first day I was able to sit down and use the tablet was that Friday. From the very first time I used it I had problems with the screen registering a touch when I was not touching it. The problem got progressively worse the more I used it, until Saturday when I decided to call ASUS technical support. The guy on the phone was as helpful as he could be, but the cold reboot and the factory reset that he had me do did not fix the issue. At that point he told me I need to send it in for repair and possible replacement to ASUS. But ASUS requires you to send the tablet back to them so the can inspect it before they will send you the repaired item or a replacement. Knowing that most people would be upset having to go without their brand new tablet for at least a week he suggested that I try and return to Amazon as they are much faster sending out replacements. Within 5 minutes Amazon had a replacement item ordered with free 1 day shipping. Also you do not have to send back the faulty device  before they send the replacement. Once you receive your new device you send the bad on back in the same box. Although it is upsetting to spend upwards of $500 on a tablet that I have literally been waiting almost a year for, Amazon once again steps up the to the plate and makes the return and replacement process as quick and painless as you could possibly want. So for all you people trying to go through ASUS for a replacement just skip them and go straight to Amazon. A big thank you to customer service representative Angelica B for being so helpful and polite in my time of great need. And all you tech nerds know what I mean lol.And as much as I am impressed with Amazon and their customer service, I am just as impressed with this Tablet. Even with the screen issues straight out of the box, everything about this tablet blew me away. From the awesome HD screen to the screaming fast CPU to ICS preloaded, this thing is just an absolute pleasure to use. Cant wait to see this with Jelly Bean.

Clear picture.  More flexibility than its iCompetitor.That changed a few months later when I started having screen issues.  At times, the screen wouldn't respond to touch.  Or it would respond, but not the way I wanted it to.  I would touch a link on the bottom of the screen and a link elsewhere on the screen would be activated.  Or I'd be typing and get to a letter and the tablet wouldn't accept that letter (but would accept other letters I touched).  And then came the frequent rebooting.  If the tablet was in use and I would plug in the charger, the tablet would often reboot.I tried hard booting it.  I returned it to factory settings.  Nothing helped.  So, since it still under warranty, I contacted ASUS.  I shipped my tablet to them (at my expense) with a detailed description of the problems I was having.  About a week later, they sent it back.I opened up the package and turned my tablet on.  After it powered up, I started to re-enter my information - only to discover that the screen still had the same issues I sent it in to ASUS to have repaired.I contacted ASUS support and was told basically that they changed out my charger, but couldn't get the problem I had to re-occur, so they just sent it back with the new cord.  I was told that I could send it back in again to be looked at.I will be shipping it back, but I don't have my hopes up that anything will be different the second time.Disappointed in ASUS's product and their \"customer service.\"------------------------------UPDATE----------------------------------I sent it back a week ago and apparently, it was fixed.

Starting out: At first, the interface seemed pretty neat with all the apps available. The functionality and user friendly factor is unfortunately not present. If you want to disable certain apps from operating such as email, it poorly effects other applications. You would'nt expect an email app to degrade your \"Play Music\" app, but it does. Also, it seems like you can never rid any program on the tablet. It sneakingly finds it's way back on your tablet even though you don't want it. The 100 usless apps constantly update causing the user to manually select that you don't want these apps to update automatically and most apps of which you cannot uninstall. Switching between different apps is also upsetting. When I press the back key, expecting to re-visit the last page I was on, it goes to the home screen causing the user to now finger through your recent apps. I find that this sleek, thin, attractive ASUS tablet is not at all complemented and dragged down by the poor Android software. I also believe Android/Google does not make this \"Your\" tablet.

The tablet is so thin that I find the edges a bit sharp when reading a book.  Again, not a big deal since I can always change my grip or put it in some sort of case.3.  The built-in speaker is a bit tinny and doesn't put out a lot of volume. It does the job but not much more.  To be fair, the Xoom is my reference point and had some pretty good built-in speakers.4.  The speaker is on the back.  I much prefer the speakers on the front because that's where I am.That's it for the bad.  Not so bad though is it?Now the good.This tablet absolutely screams.  It is incredibly fast.  The display is awesome and easily handles even the highest resolution videos I can throw at it.  It's got a micro-SD card for extra expansion and a micro HDMI connector for connecting directly to a TV or monitor.  I believe the audio through the HDMI port (I haven't tried a headset yet) is much \"bigger\" than the Xoom.  The basses sound quite full and the high frequencies \"snap (that's good).Battery life is good but I wouldn't say it's exceptional.  I'm using the keyboard dock which has an extra battery.  I charge both devices every other day.  I'd say I'm a tablet power user so that's not too bad.  All in all, I'm happy with the battery life.The Infinity is very light (compared to my Xoom) and seems to have a comparable feel to my wife's iPad Retina.  It is very stylish and I find the controls to be intuitively placed on the device.With the exception of Scrabble Free (come on EA) all of my apps work very well on the Infinity.

It replaced my Kindle, since it is has a backlit display (my old Kindle does not), and because the display area is so much larger that it feels like a real book.2. Watching movies. Speakers are a bit weak if you have to fill the room with sound or if there is any background noise. If, however, you are using headphones or have a portable rechargeable speaker (many are in the $10-20 range), you will do just fine.3. Browsing the web. Stock browser seemed slow to me, so did Chrome. I switched over to Dolphin for a happy medium of performance and feature set (use the same for my Android phone).4. Emails.What I like:--------------Sharp looking tablet.I have a dock, which makes typing emails a breeze.I downloaded remote desktop equivalent for Android, so now it doubles as a small laptop (Ultrabook-like), which allows me to use Windows when I need to.What I don't like:------------------I had an issue with it latching properly to the dock, and I had to send the dock first, and, subsequently, the dock and the tablet to ASUS for repair. They replaced the latching mechanism in the dock itself, and did something in the tablet (all mechanical), so now it is all good.I think the battery life is a bit shorter than what is claimed (I have not done the \"marketing test\" of watching the streaming movie at X brightness) but overall it is quite acceptable, and the dock does do miracles at ensuring the tablet's battery does not drop below 80% until the dock is completely exhausted.Tips:------------------1. If you load up a new app, do a cold boot (not just a reboot).It will prevent many of the white/black screen freezes that some people have reported. Most installed apps are fine the way they are, but it does not hurt to do a clean boot to be sure.2.

ASUS doesn't lard up their system with shovelware the way the phone manufacturers tend to.There are a few flaws, though. The top buttons feel a bit cheap and press very easily, occasionally leading to accidental locks when I bump the train seat in front of me. The screen glass is very glossy. It shows reflections enough to sometimes make it hard to work in bright lit areas, despite how bright the screen itself is.

When I finally made my purchase I read about the tablet pretty much non-stop until it arrived (I may have been a little obsessed) but this is how I make sure I get what I am looking for and that I get good quality products at a decent price. I received my tablet and so far there are no issues with it. I purchased the optional keyboard dock which is definitely worth the money. You can convert the tablet basically into a netbook like device and add upto an additional 4.5 hours of battery juice. It is unfortunate for those who have had issues with their tablets and I hope Asus will resolve any issues. For those of you who are having issues with your tablet here is an email address from an actual asus customer support representative. I found this email address on newegg's website from reading customer reviews there. The email address is cl-tien@asus.com and the person's name is Tien.***Read Below my extensive review why I purchased this tablet***Before I purchased this tablet I did some extensive research on various tablets. I also read up on benchmarks for them within the specifications of what the Asus Transformer Inifity TF700T has. Some of these include the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1\", Ipad 3 and 4 (including those with retina), Samsusng Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Google Nexus 7, Google Nexus 10. These other tablets have very nice specifications and I was thinking about getting the Nexus 7 or 10. The Ipads are too expensive for what I want (10\" and 64 gig). The thing that made me come back to this is the optional keyboard dock and the 1080p display screen. It's very rare to find a tablet that offers a dock that has a USB port, full size SD memory card slot and has an internal battery to offer an additional 4.5 hours of battery power on top of what the tablet's internal battery provides. The other nice thing about the full size usb port is that you can plug in a regular usb drive and have literally unlimited amount of storage space on a tablet. This is almost unheard of for many tablets. Sure, other tablets do have some kind of memory card slot and once they fill up you have to either clear some space or by another one. It's definitely cheaper to by a regular external harddrive than it is to continually buy memory cards.Asus also offers  a USB dongle accessory so you can plug usb drives into the tablet without the keyboard dock. You can plug PS3 and I heard xbox 360 controllers into this dongle and play games this way. I haven't tried it myself but I have seen Youtube videos of this. This tablet has very many features and is definitely reasonably priced.One of the specs I came across that isn't really listed on any sites is that this tablet has a 12 core GPU (graphics processing unit) card. The Ipads have a 4 core GPU. On several benchmarks the Ipads had better scores but I think it's because the one thing they are good at is optimizing their OS for their devices. The android developers do have some improvements to make but overall they have done a pretty good job especially with Android 4.1Jelly Bean. The nice thing about Asus is that they provided a firmware update so that this tablet can get the latest Android OS and Asus is pretty quick about releasing updates. Just a side note Asus makes the Google Nexus 7.Speaking of android market I haven't found anything that I couldn't run on this tablet yet. I needed a program to SSH into the server at work and I found a good free one (without ads) no problem.

The 2Meg front cam is good for Skype. The 8Meg back cam produces really nice quality pics.

Recently I went to Europe for vacations and my nine hours companion at the plane was this tablet that allowed me to see four movies and not to be worried about how long the trip was.In fact in France and Spain I could access many hot spots that allowed me to be in contact with my family and friends using skype and some other messangers.This Asus has become my partner, my companion anywhere I go. I purchased also the keypad and found a nice leather bag with handle and like I said it goes anywhere with me.Now that I have a hotspot phone from Samsung attached to T-Mobile I can be connected on the internet everywhere I go with them, phone and tablet, what a marvelous thing to have these modern technologies.I will recomend this tablet to anyone who will like to own the best tablet on the market today.HP in Florida", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hot lil Tablet!", "Author": "Witners", "ReviewID": "R1Q775M6RDL58I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though there are ipads and surface tablets out ....I would still buy this one.

However, I was looking to replace it with something a little larger and so the quest began... I found myself being lured to the dark side, aka. ipad, so off to the store I went in search of my dream machine. I spent hours pouring over reviews and videos trying to find \"The\" machine. I must say I really wanted to find something that used the Android os, however, I was not going to let that keep me from finding the holy grail so I was open to an ipad.Going to the store and actually being able to put my hands on both the ipad and the Asus TF700T gave me the answer I needed. The smooth as silk imaging was crucial to me and that was definitely what I found in the ipad. My finger glided over the screen and the responsiveness was amazing. Then I went to the Asus with the Jelly Bean operating system and to my delight I found the same responsiveness. The brightness of the screen is amazing. When I am indoors I have yet to put the brightness over 75% and the only time I have used the IPS+ is outdoors and it was more than adequate. Ipad can't compete with this screen for brightness and as far as the resolution, unless you are looking at them side by side under perfect conditions it's almost impossible to tell the difference. Personally, it is way more important to me to be able to see the screen under bright conditions and loose a marginal fraction of resolution than to not even be able to see the screen at all outside.Another reason I have for not choosing the ipad is the most affordable version is the 16gb with no capability to expand the memory. Why would I want to limit myself in the future when, with the Asus, I can get 32gb on board with the ability to expand with a micro sd and with the docking station I can expand with another sd and even more important with a usb port you can add an external hard drive or any other device such as a mouse when you want. I am currently using an additional 8gb on the tablet itself and will be getting another 32gb on the docking station. This would be impossible with the ipad.My hats off to Asus for developing a quality 10\" tablet with an exceptional battery life (with the added docking station a whopping 14+ hours) and a screen that works in a wide variety of environments. Knowing that it also has a Gorilla Glass screen gives me the peace of mind to know I am not going to easily scratch the screen and with it attached to the docking station it makes a very secure and compact package.I would highly recommend this to anyone who plans on using it for outside or inside work or play.

For now I don't need a keyboard and will wait until the prices come down. I have a Galaxy S3.I am very impressed with this tablet. No form, fit or finish issues. Very solid/dense feeling. I had two firmware updates (started at 4.0.3); the JB update went off without a hitch. I would make sure you have a good WiFi connection and even plug it in (overkill) to ensure you don't have any issues during the updates. The few negative comments about JB updates and the aftermath are not being seen by me.The damn thing is addictive! I've got HBO GO and WatchESPN so I am untethered for any TV programs I like. I've added the SwiftKey for Tablet as I found it worked much better than the standard keyboard on my S3. The voice to text works great too. I connected to my home WiFi (secure) with no issues. Only problem is that it did not store the long security key for my upstairs dLink WiFi.  However, it seems to love my downstairs Amped WiFi repeater and I get good signals all over the home, so I haven't looked into whether it can store security keys or not.I ordered a Bobj heavy duty case for it. That is not one of the more elegant cases but it looks very functional and has the ability to work as a stand.

It works smoothly and has few lags, in spite of using an active desktop (I am not one for frills usually, but the floating ice cubes one shows battery status by the water level on screen, which I thought both cool and useful).Sure, there is the odd thing that is not perfect- stability when using in the docking station, a very slight sponginess on the screen at one point on one edge (very minor and causes absolutely no problems, but just noticeable).I am using the Infinity as primarily a work machine, so I have not delved deep into things like video support and playback. What I can say is that it does what I need it to, and what I bought it for very well. The screen resolution is great- I can rdp into my desktop PC at full resolution and work in a visual studio like environment. It is obviously not as good as being in front of the PC, but the ability to pinch and zoom the view means that it is actually more productive than the wide screen Laptop it replaces. I am using the Jump rdp software, and have worked 3 rdp sessions deep (rdp to pc to server to VM) with no problems.Another thing I have found surprisingly good is the Supernote software that came pre-installed. When combined with a stylus pen this has made taking handwritten notes viable. (I had tried earlier versions of tablets and found them to be insufficiently responsive to properly write on).Battery life has been everything promised. I was caught at home having run down to about 10% battery only to find I had left the charger at work, then had two overnight support calls which took somewhere between 30 min and an hour in total to resolve. The Infinity coped with this and still had some charge left to check email in the morning.On its own, I don't know if I would have gone for the tablet- for what I am doing, but when combined with the keyboard dock it is a real winner. The keyboard is not fantastic, but is about what I would expect given the size- more than adequate for what I use it for. Having USB is great, as being able to use a mouse for fine RDP work is a bonus.All in all, if the rating system allowed I would give a 4 1/2 star to the product.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Tablet", "Author": "Z.

When it arrived, it came loaded with ICS.  Soon thereafter, Asus pushed Jelly Bean and I am now running Jelly Bean.Let me start with the positive points: fast; powerful; clear high quality screen; good graphics; great optimization potential; and moderately OK battery life.  I selected this device over the iPad since it has a micro HDMI port, I can add memory cards, I own an Android phone, PCs, etc. . . For me, an iPad made little sense since I have no apple products.  What I sought was a quality product that could do what I need without having to purchase an iPad.  I loaded a graphic heavy Tegra THD application (ahem, game) and the graphics are fantastic and it runs well.  For the most part, it does everything well, but there are some downsides.  The downsides have nothing to do with the quality of the product, but with the application market as noted below.Negatives:  it has WiFi but no 4g/3g (but I didn't want that anyway), and the only glaring negative relates to applications, or better yet, the lack of applications that are available and optimized for this or any Android tablet.  For example, there is no Amazaon.com application available for this device.  Ironic considering where I purchased the product.  That is not the only missing application.  My cell phone has a number of applications that do not exist for tablets or are not optimized for an android tablet.  It is rather frustrating to try to load an application that is on my phone, but unavailable for my tablet.  It is less frustrating, but somewhat annoying that some applications that work on my phone work on my tablet but are not optimized for the tablet; therefore, the graphics on the application appear fuzzy and \"old-school\".  The best example is the Safeway application.  It looks and works great on my phone, but on the tablet, it looks like I took the application with great graphics, blew it up in size about five times, and then pasted it onto the tablet.  It looks horrible.  The GUIs are fuzzy, it does not rotate when I rotate the screen, etc. . .Conclusion:Overall, it is a great product EXCEPT the application market is weak.There are prior updates about quality control.  My device has no issues.  QC issues may be limited.  Finally, Asus was very quick to push Jelly Bean onto this device.

I jumped on the iDevice bandwagon with iPhone 3, 3gs, then 5.  But, iPad?  I just couldn't get into Apple's heavy-handed approach to chaining their devices to our necks with a padlock which only they could open.  The iPad has no sd sockets, no expansion memory, no USB.  Other features such as video output comes only at the expense of additional black boxes.  Apple does not permit us mere mortals to save a file from the Internet.  The clincher came when they began censoring some of the apps which I had already purchased because they allow access to the web where (gasp) a dirty photograph might be posted.  Oh, enough already!I've never seen Android before.  With names like Ice Cream Sandwich and Jellybean, not really installing a lot of confidence in me.  But, ok - let's take the plunge.  I bought the Asus.  The worst thing I've heard about them is that the x.26 firmware is having problems with WiFi and updating to the newer x.30 - which fixes the WiFi and connection problems.  But, how do you get the firmware onto the tablet?  Asus suggested a factory reset.  That didn't do it.The firmware is available on their website, but their own website could not identify their own tablet.  (sigh)  I needed to enter the serial number to find the downloads available.  Careful: Asus states clearly that you can turn your device into a paperweight by loading the incorrect file.  It seems more likely that you will use the wrong language file and your device will come up in Chinese when you reboot.  So, choose wisely.I downloaded the x.30 firmware which was zip file inside of another zip file.  No instructions.  Asus tech support wouldn't even tell me the procedure!  So, after some google'ing, the trick is to put the second zip file onto a micro SDHC card, press the vol down and power buttons for 8 seconds and wait for the tablet to reboot.  A notification will come up in a few moments once the system recognizes the update.  Open the notification, follow the prompts, and sweat it out for 10-15 minutes.  Oh, be sure you have a fully charged battery before you begin.Getting that far took several hours - it should have taken 30 minutes, but instructions are scarce.  I only know of iPhone, so this is my first exposure to the Android platform.  And I say, \"nice.\"  I see why Apple hates Google.  After installing an FTP client and server app, I just dragged my iTunes music folder onto the root directory of the internal storage card.  Music.  Done.  It will play non-protected Apple-encoded files, so I didn't need to convert to MP3's.  Sweet.  Video?  Same thing, just drag and drop.  The resolution is higher on the Asus (much higher than iPad) so some re-sampling is in order.  I paid for a good video player app and it all looks great.Netflix streaming.  Nice.  Now I don't even need to copy movies.  I can just WiFi them.  Speakers are ok - well, kinda ok in a pinch.  The camera is just awful, but I'm not using it for taking pictures.  I saw a firmware update fly by for the camera.  It didn't help much.  Most apps for iPhone had counterparts for Android, except none of the banking apps are compatible.  ah, but for everything else there's a real, full-sized web browser.  No sense developing an app for a tablet when the browser does it already, probably better.I forget sometimes that I'm not on a laptop until I try to do something \"advanced\" like examine my cookies.  Then, ah - where are all my settings?  This tablet is replacing my old IBM Thinkpad for travel.  I did look hard at Apple's McAir notebook, but it's so expensive and overkill for travel.  I just want to surf, email, play movies and music, maybe FTP or SSH for emergency IT situations.  This tablet has you covered.Screen response to touch varies with the application.  It lags a bit, but not too annoying.  The text is clean and crisp with great fonts.  Not quite up to iPad retina display standards, but I'd rather have function over looks.  If you've never seen an iDevice you'll never complain about this screen.Doing some research I've read there's some confusion over the t700 dock (keyboard) being a re-labeled 201 keyboard.  Asus is denying it.  Now the keyboard stocks are dwindling.  What's the word for that?  I am not... confident.  I did not buy one either.  If you want to sell me a t700 dock, it should say t700 all over it - on the package, in the firmware, and in the part number.  No?  Keep it.Despite a few flaws, I've rated it 5 stars as \"best for the price.\"  It's not iPad, nor is it over-priced as one.  It requires a special charge adapter, as all tablets do these days.  Asus says you *can* charge it with a conventional USB port, but only with the unit sleeping with the screen off.  And, the chargers are over-priced.  You'll also need a special cable to connect to the charger.In less than a day I had my tablet customized with music, video, and a handful of apps.Don't like WiFi and say you want LTE?

Overall I consider it the best tablet on the market.  High screen resolution paired with top of the line graphics and processing capability and the best tablet OS family around make this the tablet to beat.  If you're looking for a high end tablet capable of the best games, fast internet cruising, and problem free use then look no further than the Asus TF700.HardwareThe build quality is really great, nice metal exterior, scratch resistant glass, buttons have a nice feel.  The tablet feels solidly built, but is surprisingly lightweight and very thin.  The screen resolution is amazing, once you use a tablet with this resolution for a few days going back to the lower resolution of other tablets is hard.  Also the screen is very bright, and very responsive to touch input.SoftwareIce Cream Sandwich is a great OS.  Android has consistently improved their OS and this tablet is in line to get upgraded to Jelly Bean sometime soon.  The appearance of the OS is nice and crisp, and with the high resolution screen it really pops.  One issue though regarding software.  Because this is one of only 2 or 3 Android tablets with this high resolution some apps don't take advantage of it.  For example a magazine e-reader I downloaded had a tile only occupying the middle portion of the screen because it was clearly written for the smaller resolution and did not resize on this tablets high resolution.  That being said, most apps and games not only use the entire screen, they also utilize the high pixel count.  You can tell some games are transitioning from low res to high res images in their games (Plants vs Zombies).  Also included on this tablet is a nVidia app called Tegra Zone which acts as a portal to new and upcoming content that utilizes the Tegra 3 chip.  This is a great source for high end games, both FPS and addicting arcade games alike.Keyboard DockThe optional keyboard available for this tablet is a great accessory.  When on business trips this tablet with attached keyboard replaces my laptop 90% of the time and would replace the other 10% were it not for CAD related work that I sometimes need to do.  It would not replace my laptop though for functions such as email if it did not have the physical keyboard.  Although a little on the small size it clearly mates to the tablet well and has dedicated tablet function keys such as a home key and a back key.  Also unlike generic bluetooth keyboards this keyboard when plugged into the tablet adds ~50% more battery over the tablet alone.  It also adds a full size USB port.  When the keyboard is attached to the tablet the keyboard battery is the main power source, draining it first.  Also if left closed for some time the table will charge from the keyboard.CoversRelated to the tablet is a tablet cover.  I have tried several and the one I like the most for the tablet alone is the \"MoKo(TM) Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case for Asus Eee Transformer Pad Infinity TF700\" which is slim but protects the tablet effectively.  Unfortunately there seems to be only one form factor available for the tablet with the keyboard attached.  I purchased the \"Poetic ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity Case TF700\" and have been fairly disappointed with it.  The cover is thick when used (more than doubling the thickness of the tablet/keyboard) and it can pull the tablet from the keyboard just enough so that it doesn't work.  If you don't mind the extra bulk of this cover then it might be an alright case for you.ElectricalOne note is that unlike many other tablets this tablet does not charge with a standard USB cable.  Instead it uses a charging cable with a proprietary plug on one end and a USB 3.0 on the other end.  It will charge with the USB end is plugged into USB 2.0, but it does so slowly and the tablet never acknowledges it's plugged in.  However using a USB 3.0 source works fine.  The tablet and keyboard charge very fast when attached to a USB 3.0 source.  Also you can charge both just by plugging into the keyboard when they are attached.PackagingThe packaging for the tablet was poorly designed.  The first tablet I received had a small dent on the box which I assumed would not impact the tablet.  However upon opening the box I realized this seemingly small dent had damaged the tablet because it has no padding other than the thin cardboard box between the tablet and the outside of the box.  Also the screen is placed very close to the top of the box only protected by a thin layer of foam.  This is only an issue if you receive a damaged one, at which point Amazon will replace it but it can be frustrating when you were eagerly waiting for the tablet to show up.

I'm sure I'm a lot like everyone else who's read reviews and then pulled the trigger and purchased this ... then held their breaths hoping everything would work like it's supposed to. Well I've had this tablet for a little over one month and have absolutely no problems with the function of the tablet. It's pretty quick and totally responsive. The screen in the super ips mode is really quite good for outdoor use and otherwise the display is outstanding. I've had no issues of any kind with the wifi. It found my router and connected without issue and I get a strong signal.I didn't purchase the keyboard and I might still do that but at present I only do a few emails so it's not that critical. I guess depending on what you're going to do with this tablet that would be a consideration. I do mostly browsing, reading and emails and such. I usually get a good day of battery life. The biggest downside is something that most have already mentioned. The app department is still lacking. Many of the apps are better used on a phone and not a tablet but if you know that going in then you're not going to be surprised by it. The apps function fine and there are many to choose from, they just don't look that great all the time. It's not been a big deal to me though.All in all I'm happy with my purchase and have had zero negative issues. Whew!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Durable and beautiful. Watch out, iPad!", "Author": "Devon D. Lozano", "ReviewID": "R1ORZDR15CV7RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Or should I say watch out Asus? This is the first (and so far only) Android tablet to be just as good as (in my opinion better) than the iPad as far as specs are concerned. That said, do we now expect Apple to sue Asus for making a perfect tablet? *ba-da-TCH!*Alright, before I begin my review I want to point out that if you want the champagne color, there IS a way to get it. As Amazon is - at the time of me writing this review - only \"pre-selling\" the 64 GB version of the Champagne version, you CAN find it for sale from BestBuy.com. DO NOT GO TO THE BEST BUY STORE SEEKING THE CHAMPAGNE COLORED TABLET. You will only be met with disappointment, as I was told by a sales rep that the stores only carry the gray color. Now then, moving along.The tablet is fantastic. I am a junior college student with a weakness for technology and video games. First off, the battery life is amazing. I bought it with the keyboard dock, but I only use it for taking notes in class. Otherwise, I just use the tablet as what it is: a tablet. I play Grand Theft Auto III and Mass Effect Infiltrator on this beast and it can handle it all at max graphics settings. Other people have noted how wonderful the screen looks and yes, it is truly HD. Even with full brightness and graphics cranked up playing a high-end android game, the battery has held up for two hours of constant use, and had about half battery left.I love using it to watch Hulu and Netflix. The video just pops on the HD screen and it is a truly wonderful experience.The screen itself is built in such a way that the tablet is not rendered useless outside. I'm not sure how Asus did it, but they have managed to defeat the sun. Normally, as most of you probably know, using a laptop or a tablet outside is next to impossible. The glare from the sun makes it so that you have to strain your eyes to even make out large text.This is not true for the Infinity.I was outside today in the middle of a bright August day on campus reading an eBook with no problem at all. There was no eye strain, no squinting, nothing. Just turn the IPS up a bit, and you're good to go! I read a full chapter of fiction before class with no problems from eye strain.Every Android tablet I've seen can run flash, yet this one is the first one I've seen that can truly run it as smoothly as your PC or laptop can. There is none of the jittery, bumpy lag during flash animations. They play out smoothly and naturally on this tablet.Durability:I'm sad to say that I have performed a unintentional drop test on my Asus. I was walking down the sidewalk reading a book on my way to class and was bumped into by a careless student on a skateboard (in college? Really?). Much to my dismay, my slim Infinity fell in slow motion to the concrete down below, landing face down.I scooped up my precious, which I had only had for less than a day at the time, fully expecting I would have to send it in to Asus for repairs and discovered that, remarkably, the screen was unharmed. There were no scratches, no cracks, nothing! Just a bit of dust! I wiped it off and it was as good as new! Well, with the exception of a minor ding on the corner of the metal, but everything still appeared to be in working order. Headphone jack still worked and played wonderfully, machine still as snappy and responsive as ever. Whew!Truly, the tablet is everything I could want and more. It's got style, durability, and portability. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that there is no stereo audio. There is only one speaker on the device and, while the sound is very clear and high quality, with only one speaker on the side it feels a bit.. off to my ears.But this is only a minor problem for me as I usually have a pair of headphones on me at all times anyway. But for some people it may be a larger concern.All in all, a great product with great engineering that I'm sure will last me for years to come. If you're looking for a solid, well-built tablet to finally stick it to those snooty iPad owners, this is the one for you!----EDIT----I took a bit more time and compared the New iPad to the specs of the Infinity, in case anyone was considering buying one or the other. So, how does the Infinity compare to the iPad? I took the specs directly from Amazon. As I do not personally own an iPad, I cannot test the Infinity against it for things such as battery life and other hands-on trials. But there are still some other technical details that need to be considered to make the smartest purchase...Screen:The Apple iPad has a screen size of 9.7 inches, versus the Infinity's screen size of 10.1. I personally prefer the larger tablets. I mean, if you're going to get a large tablet, bigger is better, right? Otherwise there are smaller, 7 inch tablets. The iPad does beat the Asus here in terms of screen resolution (The iPad's res is a whopping 2048 x 1536 versus the Infinity's 2048 x 1536), however I have compared my Infinity to my friend's new iPad, both of us watching Transformers. There is a difference yes, and the iPad does appear slightly more crisp. However, I did not test the iPad for outdoors entertainment so I cannot say how well it handles under the sun.Processor:iPad: 1 GHzInfinity: 1.6 GHzThat's a huge difference there. That means for more multi tasking and a faster device overall. Both devices run on quad core.RAM:iPad: 1 GB DDR2Infinity: 1 GB DDR3The Infinity is using a newer, more powerful DDR chip.Hard Drive:While the iPad is available in a number of sizes, the 16 GB size is already over $500, compared to the Infinity's 32 GB size being right at $500 (slightly cheaper on Amazon). So, you are basically getting twice as much memory for cheaper. Of course, the Infinity is available in a 64 GB size for $100 more to match the larger iPad sizes that run well above $700.Item size:This is not largely significant, as the iPad weights in at 1.4 pounds and the Infinity beats it at a whopping 1.3. Still, if we are getting into the nitty and gritty, the Infinity is still lighter and slimmer. The iPad used to love to brag about being the slimmest tablet. No longer can that be said. The iPad has a width of .37 inches, while the Infinity has a width of .33. Again, this is not significant and will likely not impact anyone's buying decision, but it's a fun fact!Rear Webcam Resolution:iPad: 5 MPInfinity: 8 MPThis is no contest. 3 megapixels is a significant change in picture quality. While I don't suspect anyone is going to replace their digital camera with their tablet any time soon, the Infinity has nevertheless beat the iPad once again.So there you have it. That is the specs as I see and understand them. Feel free to contradict me. I'm not pretending to be a computer engineer. I'm just a nerd. But from where I'm standing, as far as the specs are concerned, while the iPad does have a higher resolution screen, it would not be able to out perform an Infinity in terms of processing power, memory, and price.And of course the Infinity has something the iPad could never have: PORTS. Let's not forget the mini USB and mini HDMI ports that they have managed to squeeze on this ultra-slim device. But wait, where is Apple's on their beloved iPad? That's right. They don't have them, because they don't want anyone else gaining access to THEIR device.And just because I have to: Apple is seriously still not providing Flash support on their devices? Get with the times, Apple. Flash is no longer a problem on tablets.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first Tablet", "Author": "Irene", "ReviewID": "R2BO8ZTM7404", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a techie person at all. I have always used my desktop and never even owned a tablet before, or any other android device either.It was easy to set up and use right out of the box, which is a good thing because it comes with very little instruction other than a diagram that shows you where to plug in the cable and pictures of what the buttons are.Within a few minutes I was checking my email on it, posting on facebook, transferring music files to it from my PC, downloading apps and streaming videos.I was a little disappointed that I was unable to use a couple of the apps I installed because they require flash, and flash has been removed from Google play.It is a gorgeous tablet. I have glanced through the other reviews and notice some people received defective screens, so I want to make a point of saying my screen is perfect. I do wish the volume control could be turned up a little higher. It is fine for playing music and my own video files, But when watching Netflix or streaming from some other sites the volume is a bit low for my tastes even when it is turned up as loud as it goes.Update 8/29/2012I was told about an app on Google play called volume+ which I installed last night. The volume is excellent now, even on YouTube where some of the videos do not have the greatest sound quality. I don't have to hold the tablet close to me to hear movies on Netflix anymore either. I can set the tablet in the dock on a table and still hear it from across the room. I can even watch a movie with another person now and we can both hear it.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, fantastic tablet", "Author": "DoubleG", "ReviewID": "RI80J5VM8CL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had the Infinity for 10 days.  I bought this for my wife but we both use it. This review will have a follow up down the road, new stuff does not weigh in heavily.  I won't bother with all the tech specs, benchmarks and stuff like that because there is enough of it already posted.  I hesitated for two weeks due to the reviews about the glass / frame fit.  Non existent here.This tablet arrived in perfect condition and appeared to be well constructed.  Right out of the box it was a joy to behold and the software/hardware experience was excellent.  My wife and I both have used this tablet a lot everyday and I have really tried to stress it.  I am very familiar with the ipad3/ios.  My kids have them and they are nice but I really like this baby.  Smooth, fast and responsive.HD vids look great and I don't experience lag.  I converted a HD video to MP4 and it was flawless.  The resolution is stunning and the ipad is the only thing that can beat this screen but my eyes can't tell the difference between the two.  The Infinity has so much more going for it in regard to upgradable memory on the tablet and the dock.GPS is excellent and I get a good signal indoors too.  Wifi = excellent.  I have used PDAnet / Foxfi to have wireless ( 3G ) connection via my cellphone when I am away from a Wifi connection.  Works good as long as you have a good 3G/4G phone connections.Apps.... well they are coming and there are some good ones out there.  I like the stock book reader and the Kindle app does just fine with mobie files.  I like reading books on the Infinity better than our Kindle Fire because you have more page / text.  But we still like the Fire too.  The tapered edges take getting used to for book reading.  The Fire handles like a small heavy book and this feels like a tapered glass slate.This is great for email, IM, talk apps and video calling much better than any phone.  The cameras are the best of any tablet I've seen.  I have been waiting on the Windows tablets and phones for over a year now and I think I might just get another Infinity since it will be the end of the year before they debut and I never buy anything that is new to the market.  I always give it some upgrade time as I did with this.  The first transformers were crap but this Infinity is just great right now.  I will give this tab some more abuse time and tell all. By then I will have two Infinity tablets to compare and give everyone our findings.Most everything ASUS says about this tablet is true.  I've got 3 ASUS laptops (new to 3 yrs old) and now this.  So far I've had very good luck with my ASUS technology. I had one bump with an early EeePC.  The screen pixilated and to my surprise ASUS fixed and returned it fast.  I had read where ASUS support was lacking at times.My gripes so far:  You have to use a usb dock adapter on the tablet specific to ASUS.Speakers are sort of lacking.  You can hear fine as long as you cup your right hand behind the right side where the speaker is.  You need externals or a good set of ear-buds if you are watching a movie.Alive time is great.  I've pulled 7 busy hours with a 1.5 hr HD movie mixed in and still had plenty of time left for emails and general browser stuff.  I would like to know about how long the LI battery will last and how much of a hassle it will be to have another one put in.I say if you want a good tablet and you want to chance it on a 10 day simple review then get this thing.  I am very happy with it and I am rather critical about equipment. This thing rocks, holds its own to the ipad3, AND you get much more versatility with this Infinity.Just edited this for easier reading (had someone complain) and I ordered another Infinity.

Well, they came through.Following the latest firmware update, I followed the guide on TransformerFormus (dot) com and did a factory reset and cold boot (power off and hold the power and volume down button down for 10 seconds after the factory reset) and ALL of my issues were solved.  The lag has all been fixed.  The stock browser runs perfectly.  Amazingly, now the screen seems sharper.  I now prefer this over my iPad 3.Well done Asus, better late than never, I guess!****************************(Original 3 star review)First of all, I'm a big android fan.  I got the Galaxy Nexus phone on release day.  On the Nexus, Jelly Bean works great.I got the tf700 when it had ICS.  It now has Jelly Bean and despite cold booting etc as described on TransformerForums and the xda forums, it is no faster than it was on ICS.  I also have an iPad 3 (I hate Apple and refuse to call it the \"new\" iPad) because it had/has the best screen.  IMO it is still the best tablet as far as performance, but I hate the iOS ecosystem as I'm a geek and frigging hate the Apple playpin.  I also have a Kindle Fire HD... though the processor is not faster, the overall experience is less laggy and web browsing is faster than the Infinity.Cons:\"Would you like to wait or close your browser.\"  I specifically waited until the Jelly Bean update to post the review because I heard this would be resolved.  It is not.  If I had a nickel for every time I got this message I would be rich.Speed.  Over all it is slow.  It is the slowest responding device I have, including the Fire HD, Galaxy Nexus phone, and iPad 3.erTop Heavy:  falls over.  They should have put a bigger battery in the keyboard or something so it would not topple off the couch/bed etc.  This is a minor complaint.Google Play Magazines: Text is fuzzy and not optimized for an HD display.  Zinio puts google play magazines to shame.  Performance of these magazines really, really, sucks on the Infinity.Speakers:  Arguably the world's worst speaker, edging out the iPads speaker on suckiness.  The Fire HD speakes put them both to shame.Wifi:  The iPad and Fire HD have a 5 ghz antenna so the microwave does not cause the browser to crash every time I turn it on, as it does on the Infinity.Pros:The screen is nice.The transformer concept is nice, though Windows Surface is going to strip that advantage out.  I do like the option of using the trackpad or tablet.Overall, I would not recommend this to others.  I will sell it as soon as I get a 8.9 Fire HD.  While the Amazon ecosystem is limited, I just sideload google play apps, overcoming any restrictions.  The new Windows Surface tablets have low ppi screens, so I'll wait on those.If Asus fixes the sluggishness and glitchiness that should not be associated with this processor or OS before I sell it, I may keep it and will update.  ********Edit 11-5-2012 I now recommend this unit without reservation.  Probably really a 4.5 / 5 stars just because they don't have dual band like the Fire HD,  iPad 4, and Nexus 10 but everything after the latest update, cold reboot, factory reset, is fixed.

I don't know a lot about computer stuff so I won't comment on that, but everything seems to work fine. The one complaint I have is about the speaker. Some apps only display a certain way (you can't rotate them), which means you are forced to hold the tablet with the speaker at the bottom. This muffles the sound. I wish the speaker were on the other side or that these apps were able to rotate.UPDATE: I ended up returning my tablet because of a defect. I bought the matching keyboard dock to go with it, but it didn't work. After spending hours in Best Buy while they tried to fix the problem, they concluded that the only possibility was that there was a defect in the pins/port where you plug the tablet up (not sure if that's the right word).Another thing I noticed is that sometimes the tablet would freeze up. On a couple of occasions, the screen turned completely white ad wouldn't shut down for  a while, even when the power button was held down. I don't know if that was the tablet's fault or if it was a virus or something (I don't know how all of that works).

Since this device MUST be protected, I did research until I found the best available cover (caseen).  It's great and cut properly, but the keyboard is hard to get in and tends to unclip if you don't fasten it VERY securely.2) The tablet is considerably heavier than the keyboard, so if it is not on a hard, flat surface like a table, the tablet tends to fall over.  So it doesn't work very well as a true \"lap\"top, because it keeps tipping.3) Trying to type a paper on this machine is a bit of an ordeal.

I am a college student that was looking to replace my laptop that had fried. Deciding between a netbook or a touch, I knew I made the right decisions after countless back and forth. It definitely took care of all the necessary stuff I needed for college. I am very dependent on frequent emails, writing assignments, and attaching/sending .pdf/word doc. files to my professors and classmates.I have put this thing through the test of almost anything I could think possible. I have to say, it endures and stays up to par very well.The biggest factor to which brought me here to write this review is to warn people what has happened to my tablet just recently. On the tablet itself, there is the docking station inlet. In that inlet, there is a plastic piece to which the keyboard dock latches itself onto. The design to make this piece plastic was poorly placed, because after much inserting in and out of the dock and stress from pulling upward on screen or what have you, it broke. It then won't latch and stay firmly. But I did have a temporary solution and found a plastic piece which I cut to size since I could not find the original broken piece and super glued it there. Now stays on like new, but for how long? Granted, I did hold the tablet with the dock attached countless times. But even so, it is inevitable that one day, this part is prone to breaking on any Infinity owners that uses their docking station and travels with it a lot.My mother has an iPad 4 and my brother has an iPad 4 to which I have used extensively. I will make a short comparison for those \"apple vs android\" tablet people out there. I am in no way bias towards any brand or manufacturer. I am simply a gadget loving person. Price and device functionality determines my choice.The iPad and Infinity are both great devices. If I had to put it simple, the iPad is a great entertainment device where it excels in browsing and overall smoothness. The Infinity on the other hand, excel in functionality. I could do so much more with it. With the added dock, it just can't be beat. The iPad's dock is nothing in comparison to what the Infinity delivers. Added battery life and more netbook-like feel. Android, like any other software and programs out there, it isn't perfect. But it is definitely heading in the right direction compared to when I have last touched an android device a couple of years ago.I really could go on and on about this, but I feel that many of the other reviews have already done that and I just wanted to add in my own input. There will be sluggish moments on the Infinity. Browsing can be slightly laggy/sketchy, on start up from standby, it can be a bit slow and jumpy especially if it has not been touched for a while. I have experienced random reboots at least once a week (more on this, I feel that it does this because the RAM or cache is full, because after it does this, my tablet runs much smoother). Understand that I also load my tablet with A LOT of apps that sits in the background running. With this in mind, I believe this machine is a beast.

What did you expect me to watch?) and it works!! Amazing! Plugged it to my speakers and viola... No issues with streaming.Another thing that I really really like about this tablet, and compared to my iPad, is the SD slot on the dock and the micro SD on the tablet itself. I like transferring files from my computer to the SD rather than through plugging in the tablet straight to the computer, just my preference. The ability to do that, is one of the things that got me to decide to pick this one.Lastly, I like the spell check. While typing this review, I was seeing a few words underscored in red.

Not only the display is amazingly clear, it was easy enough for me to get used to the UI of this mobile device.Since most of the reviewers here have pretty much went into detail about their experience, I'm not going to take that route :)What I like about this set up (with the dock), it looks like you are using a netbook instead of a tablet with keyboard. Like the iPad, when I used it with Zaggmate, it didn't really go together as a whole. With the Asus dock, it looks whole and complete. In addition to that, it also extends your battery life per charge.I read somewhere here where one reviewer wished it was white or came in white. Not me. I have the Asus Eee netbook in white and though they are really pretty to look at, practically, with fingers going everywhere to places not seen or heard, you'd get your device dirty real quick.I have not really played with this thoroughly as some of the apps that I have on my Galaxy S II are not yet supported on this device. Disappointed that Pageonce Pro hasn't updated their apps (but that is a different story hehehe).Would I recommend this device to anybody? Definitely!If you are looking to get a great device and do not want to pay for those that are quiet overpriced.... then this is the best option out there currently.If you can spare a hundred dollars and change, then get the dock (keyboard) -- makes it all worth it.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good But Not Great", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3PSB1XOOBV0ZL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really want to be able to give an Android tablet 5 stars, and I believe this is one of the best options in the market at the moment. Unfortunately there is still some growing to be done on the last few details in Android tablets. The ICS interface is really nice with improved alert, settings and application selection, but it has some shortcomings in general (not specific to any particular tablet). The single biggest problem is that scrolling and selection of links, menus and text boxes in the browser is jerky and unresponsive even with the quad core, and maybe this is to be fixed in 4.1 Jelly Bean. After using the tablet extensively, I have come to the conclusion that the problem is so bad that the tablet cannot replace my online driven usage of the laptop. Even reading the news is frustrating, and only the most casual browser usage is comfortable. It may be advisable for some buyers to wait until Jelly Bean comes on the tablet pre-installed.Asus has provided some good software, mostly preloaded Supernote, etc, that most people will use. There is no built in video player that will support play of videos copied to the memory, so you have to buy something like MX Player Pro. The upside is that the cloud syncing of Chrome is excellent, and it has led me to finally switch from Firefox on my laptop which has been crashing Flash. The biggest shortcomings in the tablet design specifically are no option with 4G (FoxFi linking to your Android phone works extremely well, but requires the extra steps of phone launch and having the phone handy), and the audio, while clear, really needs a higher maximum power output. It is a little under powered to be usable as a MP3 replacement with Pandora, for example, or for watching movies on an air plane (with good noise cancelling headphones) or for clear Skype communications. Even at home, I basically have it on max volume all of the time with headphone use. The built in speaker is really blah and middle of the road in performance. Battery life is good and easily extendable by turning off GPS and bluetooth and setting the tablet to power saving mode. The GPS is very good, and matched with the display is excellent for things such as weather radar maps and Google maps. I have not really tested the camera/camcorder app and capabilities, but it is appears just fine.Having an open standard MicroSD is great for movie watchers or doc carriers like me, but the absence of an open standard USB is something that I still despise on tablets in general and this one specifically.Pros:1. ICS interface improvements.2. Solid construction.3. Has MicroSD slot for documents or movies.4. Cloud sync'd Chrome browser.5. Very good GPS and excellent for mapping.Cons:1. Headphone audio output not up to MP3 player capability and borderline for movie watching on planes.2. Built in speaker is average at best.3. No 4G (but FoxFi linking is so easy almost not a problem).4. Choppy scrolling and selection of links, text boxes, manipulation in browser is almost unusable.5.

Well I was one of them and decided to return that item for that reason and others as well. I returned the Prime because the 1280by800 resolution looked bad compared to the Pad's 1920by1200 monster resolution, the WiFi and the GPS had so many problems. I'll admit I could live w/o the GPS not functioning correctly but the WiFi needed to be fixed as there was no excuse for that not working 100%.Here 7 months later we have the Pad Infinity. Full HD screen with super IPS+ mode, fastest quad core processor available right now, 1GB of DDR3 ram, and a slim design that rivals the iPad's. So is this the best Android Tablet on the market right now? In my opinion, yes it is. The Nexus 7 is the best 7inch tablet, and this is the best 10.1 inch one. Acer has their Full HD Android on the market right now, but that processor is clocked at 1.3GHZ and to be honest I have heard many people say that device is sluggish for a quad core device. Granted that does cost $50 less but for an extra $50 for the Infinity it is worth it. I am not going to get into the specifics of the Infinity as Amazon has them listed, but this device really sets the bar for Android Tablets. The screen is fantastic and when you see it in hand, you will be in awe. The slimness feels great in the hand and it is light like the Prime so that area is covered. The WiFi and GPS work 110%. Do not worry about that at all. MY unit does not have any light bleed like others have had, and yes the browser does crash from time to time, but that can be fixed with an update or Jellybean when that comes out. If you are looking for an Android Tablet to buy in 2012, than this is it. Do not hesitate. It is a fantastic device and is worth every penny.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gold Standard, but with some weak spots", "Author": "Joe Mills", "ReviewID": "R1AYCRR1KC2LX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "People who want a Transformer pretty well know they want a transformer.  And if the keyboard dock -- that not only doesn't drain your device's battery like a wireless board, but charges it and comes with a hinge that provides far more viewing angle flexibility -- is important to you, then there isn't much competition out there.The Infinity stands apart from even other transformers with its strikingly high pixel density and super ips+ brightness.  Pixel density is mostly going to benefit readers by providing clear and sharp text.  Blurry text can add to eye strain over long reading sessions.  It's going to be less noticeable for gaming and video watching.  Super IPS+ is somewhat useful for outdoor viewing -- this is hurt a little by how reflective the glass on the infinity is and that gets magnified in brighter environments, so daylight viewing isn't exactly ideal, but it's better than any LCD screen I've seen.  If you're not a reader, consider the tf300 for a discount and a longer battery life.The Infinity's specs are top of the line, but two are slightly problematic if you're concerned about future proofing.  The first is the 1GB of RAM.  Asus speed the ram up, but didn't increase the capacity.  Now I doubt you'll feel that pinch if want to buy a new tablet every year or two, but I suspect this will be the first bottleneck to emerge for longer term buyers.  If applications and games ever do fully support the Infinity's big resolution, they'll probably be pretty RAM hungry too.The second spec of some small concern is that this only has Bluetooth 3.  Again, not a big deal today, because virtually no Bluetooth 4 accessories exist yet.  But BT4 is not just an evolutionary boost to the protocol, it's a little revolutionary, allowing super low powered peripherals to get, not weeks or months off their own battery, but years, and allowing tiny accessories to be practical.  Most of what is in the pipeline are exercise or health related, but you never know what awesome stuff might be out there once the possibilities sink in.  If you plan to get a phone with BT4, you can shrug this weakness off and use your accessories with that.The only build issue for me is the speaker placement.  I'll never understand why tablet makers, and virtually none do this, don't put the speakers on the front.  These tabs are designed for consumption of movies and music, among other things, and why would you want to direct the sound away from them?  No matter how good the speaker, and the Infinity's is pretty good, it'll always be better if it's facing you.  Hard to dock Asus for this since everyone does it though.All in all, the Infinity is lighter than I imagined, as bright and sharp as I'd hoped, is fast and versatile, and is doubtless the best Android tablet on the market today.  Asus has loaded it with useful goodies like a word processor, cloud storage, desktop streamer, a good set of performance profiles and plenty of helpful widgets.  It's an eye-catching device, especially docked, looking like an ultrabook -- easily the most conspicuous tech I've ever owned.

This is  actually the first time I encounter Android device doing that, so I am quite surprised and rather disappointed, and I would certainly expect Asus to do better.Since this happens less-then-deterministically (I observed about 3 instances during the ~week since I got it) certainly I doubt this could be addressed efficiently by any service center; not sure if the issue is caused by problem in kernel, some driver, or the actual hardware.One would think that for a ~$500 device its manufacturer could have put some effort into testing and overall quality assurance...Update (17-Oct-12): OK, it indeed appears that full factory reset with data wipe solved the issue: I have been using the device for a week since that and observe no problems. Thanks for the suggestions.Update (21-Oct-12): Today I registered one (the first in these two weeks since full reset) spontaneous shutdown (the device just went black-screen, like it normally does upon inactivity timeout, and then went through full powerup/boot-up sequence once I press power).Will be keeping a log of reboots here, for the sake of transparency, as apparently Asus uses its customers as beta-testers: 22-Oct-12: Firmware OTA update (second one from original JB upgrade) (JRO03C.US_epad-10.4.4.18-20121012) 24-Oct-12: #1 freeze (upon \"recent tasks\" button press) 27-Oct-12: #2 freeze (upon flipping page in FB reader, after doing so for two hours). OK, resetting back to 1 star, where it should belong now (~alfa-testing).  1-Nov-12: #3 freeze (upon task switch to Google Translate: white screen and subsequent reboot).  5-Nov-12: #4 freeze (upon skype start: screen went blue and froze in that state: just blue, perhaps with one scanline black at top).  6-Nov-12: Brought the device to the local authorized service center [...] according to ASUS support recommendation (quoting email of ASUS TSD \"It''s not normal. And I can''t tell you it''s a hardware issue or a software issue. We need to have a check on that.\"). 10-Nov-12: Service returned the tablet, with verdict \"Firmware updated, tested, all OK\". I see firmware upgraded to JRO03C.US_epad-10.4.4.20-20121026 indeed.  OK, right after ~an hour of working with it, the screen went black (while in Google Play, after pressing on some application's screenshot there), and booted subsequently after a few seconds timeout... 21-Nov-12 -- admittedly the longest problem-free run ended with new strange situation. After being charged for whole night, the device would not turn on: it did not respond to power button, occasionally the screen turned on, showing low battery warning, but usually went black in a couple of seconds. Managed to reboot it, after that worked normally (recognizing fully charged battery and turning on normally). 23-Nov-12 #6 freeze, upon opening google maps (after selecting action, pressing \"just once\", screen went white and frozen) 28-Nov-12 #7 freeze, while switching from Google Play to home desktop.  2-Dec-12 #8 freeze, while opening QuickPic application (black screen, then I guess watchdog-triggered reboot) 19-Dec-12 Firmware OTA update to 10.4.4.23-20121127 19-Dec-12 #9 freeze, while scrolling PDF page in Polaris office: screen (white with black text) went uniform grey, with the familiar 1-scan line black near the top and froze. I think that's the first time when the event was not associated with the change of active application. Too bad, I hoped this update would fix the issue... 20-Dec-12 #10 freeze, while browsing in the default internet browser 22-Dec-12 #11 freeze -- device apparently switched off while switching to a different task in \"recent apps\" menu.Sorry for the frequent updates, but this whole thing with this tablet starts to feel like some practical joke. And I thought this was \"the best Android tablet on the market\"...One thing _is_ deterministic though -- every time the unit freezes, its screen is filled with constant color (can be different each time), save for one black scan line a couple of lines below its top. So it looks like the problem can be traceable to some particular screen update event.Oh, and did I say that Asus support is on par with their product? I have communicated with quite a number of people in US, Russia and probably Taiwan, mostly having problems getting single coherent response... The final verdict apparently is that I need to take the tablet to an authorized service center (which I did, and where they did not see any problem), get the device back, then bring it to the service again if the issue re-surfaces (which it obviously does at some point), go to step 1, loop. Excellent business model, I'd say, assuming one can sustain it...Oh, and the official policy is of course that \"if anything is installed except the software that came with the device -- then Asus is not responsible for anything\".

Unfortunately, my excitement was short lived once I actually started using it.The tablet is nearly incapable of any kind of multitasking. If you happen to be surfing the web when an update for one of your apps comes through your browsing will slow to a complete crawl and there is a good chance of having the tablet freeze and/or crash on you completely. Apps will also 'hang' when launched so when you press a app you can expect to wait for a while till it decides to open the app (your device will freeze during this time) and even when launched it will just go to a black or white screen for even longer while the application loads. Sometimes the app will load, some times it will freeze and force you to do a hard restart...it's a complete crap shoot every time you decide to use the device.While the screen resolution is nice, you really aren't going to make use of it unless you are watching videos that have been completely downloaded onto an SD card or the internal hard drive. Video quality while streaming Netflix or Hulu is horrible and on par with my first generation Nook and it still runs into serious frame rate issues at less than 480p resolution. This isn't an Internet issue on my side as I have multiple devices in my house and ALL of them outperform this device for streaming video; even ones old enough that you can't buy them off the shelf anymore.I know not everyone who owns the TF700 has these issues, but Asus's QA is spotty at best so you are taking a complete gamble as to how well it will perform once you open the box. On a separate but related issue, the dock/keyboard for the tf700 also suffers from some serious QA issues. Hitting backspace will, 50% of the time, force close all programs and take you to the home screen or shut the device down completely. Simply writing a simple email can become the ultimate test in patience as you are going to need to start over at least twice trying to write more than a few paragraphs.I have to admit that the device looks gorgeous but as I'm not in the market for overpriced paper weights I can't really weigh this as a positive.I seriously considered benchmarking this device to see what was really going on as I am fairly sure the factory they have putting these together in China is supplementing the parts it's suppose to have with cheaper, outdated parts that cause it to perform so poorly. Ultimately I decided it was better to just package it up and return it to Amazon and warn other potential buyers what they may be up against.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS doesn't stand behind their warranty", "Author": "ngp", "ReviewID": "R24NBFN45DALWT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After about 10 months of using this tablet the screen failed.

I am an avionics and software engineer but will try to write something helpful for the majority of folks who buy tablets and are not engineers or hard core gamers. I just returned the TF700 to Amazon and bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and I'll explain why. So here we go.After a lot of on line looking I decided to go with the ASUS TF700. Many times this model is rated at the top of the heap for all Android tablets. After getting one I'm not exactly sure how it gets rated that highly. Is it a bad tablet? No. That said, there's no real benefit here for the average to even slightly advanced tablet user so the value story isn't the best and it has a couple of issues which is why I gave 3 stars.One major thing to know before you buy this model is that it can not effectively be recharged using anything but it's own power adapter. That may not sound like a big deal, but it is if you're highly mobile, don't want to carry extra stuff everywhere, or are prone to misplacing things. The last thing I want to do is have to carry separate adapters for all my electronics so I rely on charging via USB. This goes for my Android phone, my Ipod Touch, and everything else. The ASUS TF700 owner's manual says it will charge from a PC USB port but this is very misleading, if not an outright fib of sorts. Most USB ports, PC or otherwise do not have the voltage level this tablet requires. Hence, some ports/charger adapters will do a \"trickle charge\" while others will not work at all. Also, it's very important to note that if you find a USB port that works, it really is a trickle charge and the tablet screen can not be on or the tablet in use or it will stop charging altogether. The tablet will re-charge at a rate about 3% or so of the rate using the adapter....so be prepared to wait a very long time.The TF700 is put together fairly well but it does have some parts that seem kind of cheap for a tablet in this price range.Here's a real kicker. It has the latest Tegra Quad Core processor, a fair amount of RAM (memory), and yet it's slow. Boot up time is twice as long as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and there are delays when working with your favorite software applications. Very little to none of this happens on the Samsung which is why this is a kicker because the Samsung only has the Dual Core \"slower\" processor. Without getting too technical, if the engineering isn't good a better processor can be offset by other lower quality parts or design and the result is the computer/tablet runs slower than an older or supposedly less capable one, and I think that's what happened with the TF700.The TF700 has a very high resolution screen (think similar to the iPad Retina display). The problem is it actually doesn't render (display the picture to keep it simple) many things as well as some less capable lower cost tablets out there. As time goes by I'm sure new software apps and some updates from ASUS would probably make better use of the display.Lastly, the TF700 uses battery power at a pretty good clip. Honestly, it was this issue combined with the inability to charge properly/efficiently from USB ports that caused me to return it. While I use a tablet for fun things, it is really a tool and like any other tool, it needs to be there when you need it.So what are the benefits? If you're reeaaallllyy into games then this tablet may be for you. If you just play some games sometimes and you're kind of an Angry BIrds level type, you can do better with your money. For you gamers, the TF700 does have a lot of chops, but for some reason there are issues with the RAM even though it's the latest DDR technology. Again it's either an engineering or part quality issue so you may not get the performance you might think you'd be getting. The other benefit is the optional ASUS keyboard. If you still like to use a real keyboard at times, no one does this better than ASUS with a tablet. Clicking it on the keyboard makes the tablet look like a netbook. It stays petty lightweight but the keyboard has a built in battery that also powers the tablet for extra up time. It also has additional ports and a full size SD card slot.The summary here is that unless you're a serious gamer and you like Android, save your money and go with one of the many other capable tablets out there. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is on Amazon for about $120 less than the TF700, and if you're a Costco member they have it right now for $279. Impossible to go wrong at that price and the quality/performance of the Samsung. That said, there's also a few others out there as well. The bottom line is that super horsepower is not needed on a tablet for most users, and if it is needed for heavy work then you'd want to go with a Windows Pro tablet or Ultrabook anyway.Hope this helps someone out there!

The ASUS tablet has one small speaker on the back (2\"x1/4\") facing out with about 100 micro holes for the sound to pass through.  The only way to hear anything, is to cup your hand around the speaker to bounce back the sound. However, the ASUS tablet has an adjustable equalizer for music (the new Kindles don't have a manual equalizer anymore since going Dolby)...but the ASUS only sounds good with earphones or bluetooth speakers.  Do not buy this tablet expecting to use it without an enhanced listening device. It might as well not have a speaker at all.  And ASUS describes the tablet as having superior sound.Everything else about the tablet is good (for me) and performs well.  No lockups on websites that use Flash Player - and that's why I'm going to keep the ASUS tablet - it supports Adobe Flash Player.

I have had the TF101, TF201, and the TF700.  Of the 3, I really liked the TF201.  Now, the only drawback of the TF201 (aka: Transformer Prime) is that the Wifi issues were definitely apparent.  Unless you were literally 10 to 15 feet from the router, your Wifi experience would be sluggish.  Hence, I got the TF700.  Definitely a huge improvement.  In fact, once you get another tablet/computer with a higher resolution, it's almost unthinkable to go back.  Switching back and forth to my TF201 and TF700 was like switching from a standard definition TV (TF201)to a high definition TV (TF700).  The problem with the TF700, is Asus didn't bother to implement enough RAM to make up for the screen's demands as well as the user's potential to multitask.  Despite the TF700's superior screen to its predecessors, it was the most sluggish in regards to performance.  I even rooted and flashed the TF700 with a ROM that would \"fix all that\".  And the result was the same. My beautiful screen wielding TF700 went from a sluggishly performing tablet with all looks and no strength to back it up (again, perhaps more RAM would've helped in this matter). After so many cold boots, factory resets, mixing and matching with this ROM or that ROM, I noticed that Amazon was featuring a 2012 Nexus 10 (new, not refurbished) for the SAME PRICE as a new TF700.  After getting a Nexus 10 with none of the bloatware and straight untouched Jellybean, woah, what a difference.  And the screen resolution is top notch (for now) out of any 10+ inch tablet.  I sold my TF700 but kept my TF201 (despite the Wifi issues, it was the most reliable overall).  If you shop around Amazon, you'll notice that a Nexus 10 (2012 and new, 32gb version) costs just as much as a new Asus TF700. Why not avoid the bloatware and waiting game (yes, you'll be waiting on the next Android OTA update while Nexus devices such as the Nexus 4, 7, and 10 get it first)? If you want a superior screen without the lag and performance issues, I would avoid the TF700.  It's just too bad that something this great (a nice sized tablet with a dockable keyboard) would have so many issues in regards to performance.  My best description of the TF700 is that it's a 2012 Chevy Corvette with a 4-cylinder engine under the hood.

Although I hadn't bought a tablet up to this point, the ASUS was my choice after much research for the following reasons: 1. This tablet has the best HD screen on the market second only to the current iPad 4.  2. The quad core cpu and 10.1 inch screen is comparable to if not better than the iPad 4.  3. For what I needed the tablet to do and the apps that are available for it (this is where some people may need to do their own research for apps vs needs as the iPad still has quite a few more apps available to the consumer), this product has (sold separately and I bought) the available keyboard which also has a battery that will charge the tablet (until the battery on the keyboard runs out) while they are connected together. Then when I disconnect them, the tablet is still charged once I am done using the keyboard.  4. Also unlike the iPad, this has a micro SD card slot for extra storage space up to 32GB as well as a micro HDMI slot for connecting to a TV.  5. The keyboard, when attached, also has an available full sized SD card slot as well as a USB port (which is what I use the most to transfer files from my computer).As you can see, there are quite a few more features externally on this ASUS tablet that I use that must be paid for separately if you buy an iPad.  Oh and let me mention that this has 32GB of internal memory when you buy it for the same or less price than the 16GB iPad. So far it has worked extremely well for my needs and runs very well. As almost every computer that has an operating system (Android on this), I have had a few \"lockups\" or \"freezes\" that require a reboot of the system. This doesn't appear to be out of the normal range.

And, to be fair, it might be less the device and more the ASUS updates that have been pushed down--but, given ASUS is behind them both, I believe this review is still valid.  I spent about $800 for both the tablet and the dockable keyboard about a year ago.1.)  The battery life is *terrible.* Especially after the past two updates, which is about the past 9-12 months.  I have both the battery in the tablet and the tablet dock, which has another battery, and from a full charge, it takes less than 18 hours to drain them both while in standby.  To state it another way:  From a full charge, and the WIFI setting set to turn off when unplugged (effectively disconnected from the internet), and the device in the \"off\" state (not shut down, but not active or in use) it drains both batteries in under 18 hours.  This is just not acceptable.2.)  Loading applications after a reboot, starting a browser session, accessing settings, sliding across screens is laggy, horrendously slow, jumpy, and buggy (applications crashing--or needing to be shut down).3.)  The system will randomly reboot.  (Akin to the blue screens of old WinOS days).  Once it crashes, it will try to reboot, but the OS will be quite buggy as though some remnant of the prior session is still active in memory.  SO, after a reboot, you need to go through the shutdown process all over again until you get a clean shut down.  This is problematic, because even though you choose \"shut down\" as the option to power off, the system will actually try to \"restart\" itself over and over again.  (This is why I think there is a remnant of something still active from the crashed session.)  Eventually, after at least three and as many as seven (based upon my experience) you'll get a clean shut down, and you can power up and be okay until the next crash.NOW, the logical expectation for me and my experience is to say, why haven't you done a factory reset--it sounds like something serious is wrong.  In fact, I have done four since getting the device in 2012.  Four times I have gone through the arduous task of backing up my files to the cloud, resetting the device, starting with a clean system, re-establishing all of my accounts and settings, and putting my data back on the device (if I want it back on).  Each time is a few hours to do the actual reset and a several days to get everything configured and set up again.  This isn't acceptable.To be fair, I like the concept.  I like Asus technology in general.  I very much enjoy having a physical keyboard, which makes using a tablet as a primary device a possibility.  I think the resolution is amazing.  I like the concept of having an extra battery and extended life.  When the device was new (pre ASUS updates) it worked beautifully.  But, the device as it sits now, with current ASUS updates is undependable and if I had an option for a tablet with a physical keyboard (non bluetooth because they are in fact laggy and ridiculous to use), I would switch in a minute.I consider this a big miss for Asus, and I will definitely look at a different manufacturer when I'm ready to replace this one.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Try a different product.", "Author": "Robert Hardies", "ReviewID": "RZ2N6R1GLAPE9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The speaker is not any good.

I had deliberated for a few weeks over whether to buy another ASUS product or an alternative brand Android tablet. Eventually I decided to buy the TF700 Infinity, primarily because there was very little else on the market that came close to the specification of the TF700 and I was impatient to get another tablet as I really loved using my TF300. Overall, I am delighted with the TF700, it is a truly wonderful tablet. I've been using it daily for over ten days now so thought that was long enough to give my thoughts.The new full HD Super IPS+ screen offers a fantastic resolution and brightness. While it is true that few Android apps support such a high resolution directly at the time of writing, uses such as the Kindle app and general web browsing look incredible and it is impossible to see any pixelation at all in text and hi-res photos. It really is a joy to behold. However, the primary reason I'm not giving this tablet five stars is also because of the screen - the bottom of my screen suffers from relatively minor light bleed in about four or five places an inch apart from each other and the left edge has two patches on the edge which are darker than the rest of the screen. I can live with this - it's certainly a common problem with tablet screens, (and desktop LCD/LED monitors/TV for that matter.)Having upgraded from a TF300 I was a little disappointed some of my previously bought apps didn't work on the TF700. Most notably, Tiger Woods 12 is listed in the Google Play store as incompatible with the TF700. That's a shame as it was one of the games I loved on my TF300 and I hope EA eventually get round to fixing their code to work on the Infinity and other newer tablets. It's worth saying that most of the apps I'd already previously bought for my TF300 worked fine on the TF700 though - at a rough guess out of over forty (non-Google) apps, only two or three refused to install, or installed then crashed upon running. Of course, all the Google apps work perfectly.Before I bought the TF700, I was a little concerned as to whether the 1.6ghz Tegra 3 would be quick enough to drive the 1920*1200 resolution in 3D games and the like. I needn't have worried - every compatible game I've played on the TF700 works wonderfully. System intensive games such as Riptide GP work great even when upscaled with no noticeable drop in frame-rate, (if there is a drop in frame-rate, I don't notice it.)If I was to pick fault with the tablet, I'd have to say the most disappointing thing is the speaker and its positioning. Being placed on the back, the sound is already directed away from the user and sounds feebler than tablets with front mounted speakers, but when used in a case, (folded open), or when the tablet is laid flat on a desk, the sound is obviously further muffled. It's still audible when used at home, but harder to hear properly when outside or somewhere with ambient background noise. This is nitpicking though - and something that using headphones obviously solves!Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich is a joy to use. That said I am looking forward to the 4.1 Jellybean upgrade when it becomes available after having used it on my wife's Nexus 7. I'm in no particular hurry though as ICS is very stable and well featured. (EDIT 13th October 2012 -- I received the 4.1 Jellybean update wirelessly from ASUS over a week ago and absolutely love it! The upgrade install and setup without any issues and was a very nice surprise.)One thing I was particularly interested in using this tablet for was video calls and plain voice calls using Skype as I have a lot of family in Europe. The Skype app works perfectly - the audio sounds perfectly clear and the video streams without any hiccups.Compared to the TF300, the TF700 appears to be better constructed and solid. The majority of the back of the unit is metal rather than plastic and the unit feels much more sturdier than the previous model. The inclusion of Corning Gorilla Glass is very welcome too compared to whatever the screen covering was on the TF300.If you are looking for a high specification tablet, I would definitely advise you to consider this product. It's great - not perfect, but certainly much closer than any other Android tablet currently available at this price point.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"TTanner\"", "ReviewID": "R1BAKIA2LGWWZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Tablet.

The performance of the Asus is abysmal. More often than not, I had to close down the browser because it wouldn't respond. I have to constantly make use of the Task Killer and the Fast Reboot Apps to keep the performance optimal. The tablet cannot handle more than 2 apps in the background without becoming choppy. With the keyboard connected, it's not possible to watch YouTube videos in fullscreen.

It constantly has issues booting up properly (I shut it off when I don't use it) And it also takes a minute or two for the home screen to load once I quit out of a game. I have taken great care of it so there is no excuse other than poor construction. One other issue not with the tablet but the operating system. I purchased an app on the Google Play store for USD$1.99, and when I tried to install it, an error popped up saying you must first purchase this item to download it. I checked my bills, and they charged me for something I was unable to download. Not Cool Google/ Android. I still like the keyboard when it works, but it sometimes disconnects. The top row of the keyboard is also very annoying because of pressing them and turning off wifi when i don't want to. I plan on selling it and buying an iPad. Buy at your own risk.Update***** 2-28-13I now cannot have the tablet on for more than 3 hours before it crashes and I have to hold the power button until it turns off and resets. It also has a flaw with the keyboard. If you have it not attached to the tablet, it looses its charge if it is completely full in an hour. I am also still having troubles with the Play Store and am refusing to buy another android tablet.

So far, I have owned this tablet for only a week but I have owned previous tablets longer than that. I have to say that my Toshiba tablet had NO light bleed to speak of. The sound on that one wasn't real great though. It also had no LED flash for the rear camera. The TF300T is a nice tablet by ASUS but, still no flash for the rear camera and the \"stereo\" speakers are placed far to the right of the back of the tablet as is the same with the TF700T which I am now using. It, however, does have an LED flash, a very bright one I might add. The folks that said the flash wasn't very bright, I don't know whom you were trying to kid. Now, the sound on this tablet isn't as good and rich sounding as the speakers for the TF300T, even though the placement is the same...to the far right in the back. That bothers me a little but not enough to send it back yet.As far as that darn light bleed. Well, this one has one spot towards the bottom that is very noticeable and then a few areas towards the right of the screen that show up also. But you know what people, it is my experience that once that tablet is fully booted up and you have all the images on the screen and the auto brightness has adjusted itself to a mid level, the \"bleed\" is no longer noticeable. I don't understand the people that have huge complaints about it enough to say they returned their tablets because of it. The screen is very nice and very responsive. Even in IPS mode for outside viewing, I can barely tell of any light bleed and it surely isn't enough to project across my screen. If you are out in the bright sun with the IPS mode on and the bightness at full, the sun's rays still block out what you think one could detect as \"light bleed\" so again, I don't understand what all the fuss is about! It's still not bothering me enought to return the tablet. The one I really wanted actually was the Toshiba Excite but the reviews were much lower than this one. I still feel in some way I should've got the Toshiba instead (thus the 4 stars of this tablet). At least it places its \"stereo\" speakers as right and left side speakers and not just all the way on the right side. It also has an LED flash.I'm not really going to comment on what bloat software it comes with becaue I didn't feel it actually has all that much extra apps installed to worry about. I'm also not going to comment on how well it runs all that software. I have found that from tablet to tablet, they all pretty much do the same thing with just a little bit difference in the design. That part is just to each one's own preferance. I've done the system update to the newest android version. The tablet as a whole seems to function well.

When you hold it in your hand it just screams quality.  The lines are clean and there is no flex in the tablet at all.  The screen is bright and colors are true to life with very little saturation or contrast issues.  While it doesn't have as high a DPI as the Nexus 10, I much prefer the display on the TF700.  I love how bright it gets and if you watch a lot of movies/tv shows on it - like I do - then you'll appreciate how beautiful this screen is.Other Pro's are the keyboard dock which adds battery life and a bunch of extra functionality.  It really feels like a potential laptop replacement (though you'll want to use a regular laptop for heavy lifting of course).  Throw in not one but TWO SD card slots (one micro-sd on the tablet and regular SD on the dock) and you have the potential for a ton of extra storage. If you have a lot of multimedia content there really is no better set up than this.  With the micro-hdmi port you can pipe beautiful HD video to your big screen TV without a problem. I've done this countless times and have been pretty pleased.With so much to love why would I give this tablet 2 stars?  Simple: usability.  While the tablet is a year old it should not have the lag problems that it does.  It has a Tegra 3 with 1 GB RAM.  More than enough to run multiple apps without a problem.  On Paper!

I had read a lot of reviews so knew what to expect going in. I did return the first one I received due to signifinant light bleed but the return was painless and the second one was almost perfect except for slight screen lift on the bottom left corner, which is considered normal according to Amazon 2nd tier customer support (but they said if it causes any problems they will honor a return since I have it noted on file).So far have no major complaints other than having to get used to the battery life (had been spoilt going 5 days before having to charge now its abut 3 days!).

But the GPS STILL DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY.C'mon, Asus makes the Google Nexus tablet.  How can they make both that and this and the 200 dollar one works whereas the 550 dollar one does not?  This isn't rocket science.Using GPSTest, the Nexus 7 locks 7+ satellites inside my house in about 10 seconds, outside on the front steps, it locks 11 in about 30 seconds, and never loses a fix.Using GPSTest on the TF700, it sees on average 3 less satellite signals than the Nexus 7, and never locks a signal with more than 4 or 5 at a time.Can't think that it's a hardware issue, since it doesn't lock on satellites that it sees a signal from, for unknown reason.  You would think after all of the trouble Asus went through with the original TF Prime they would make sure the one thing thing that caused them all that grief would work on the next tablet.  Apparently not..EDIT:  After Googling around it appears that there's a Jellybean update that was not pushed to this tablet when I started it for the first time.  To make sure I factory reset it and it still wasn't pushed.  Downloaded and updated the official ROM manually and tried the GPS again.  As of now, I get comparable performance outdoors as the Nexus 7 (10 to 11 satellite views and locks in GPSTest), but still none near windows indoors where the Nexus 7 has no issues.  Comparing GPS 'versions' between updates there are several version numbers of difference.  So that confirms my earlier suspicion, it's a software issue, that they are at least attempting to resolve.So the GPS failure was compounded by the update failure.  After I took the trouble to manually fix the problems myself (for which all information came from random forums, mind you, none published by Asus up to and including manual update procedures) I kinda got it working.  Of course there are no apparent release notes detailing what they have worked on between ICS and JB either.  It's a crap shoot, you get what you get!

Also, the keyboard is a bit smaller than what you'll be used to, but once you adjust you'll get the hang of it.But overall, this is the best tablet on the market when I bought it, and if I were buying a tablet today I would make the same decision (but the newer model, tf701)", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love ASUS tablets", "Author": "Marcelo Aliberti", "ReviewID": "R2BM9656XTTBQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely I'm an ASUS fan.

I am not a progammer, but just a user. My phone still has a slide out keyboard.I looked at different tablets with 2 goals in mind. First to replace a dead HP laptop.  Second to have a tablet for use as a mobile computer / e-reader / game playing / movie watching device.  Not having any Apple products, and not liking their \"new product every 30 days\" hype, I wanted an Android device to be able to pair it with a new phone when I got around to it.  Surface was just coming out and I never buy the first edition of anything but would rather give them time to get the bugs worked out.I like it.  It's heavier than an \"Air\" but that gives me a little more substance  which I find somewhat reassuring.  I like that I can slip it into a bag without the keyboard and use it as a tablet or add the keyboard and use it like a notebook.  I can use it  as an e-reader when stuck in some mentally terminal place like a Dr's office or on a trip.  Or use it for some mental and finger stimulation with offline games.  (I have never played Call of Duty or any of the other high action games so I don't know how it handles them.)The word processing stinks.  It's functional but not something that I would use for serious \"office work\" and I have to extend that to the entire office suite preloaded.  Because it has Jelly Bean I cannot use Adobe.  But have found a reader that works well for pdfs (UB reader)Having to manually reduce the running tasks to free up cpu is a pain.  If I'm not online why do I need YouTube and other internet tasks running in the background.  In time I will figure out how to keep them off until I WANT them.The tablet keyboard has a big wide space bar but does not always register unless it is touched in or very near the center requiring that I go back and add spaces to \"runonwords.\"  It also is missing the \"up down left right\" arrows that make simple word adjustments in the body of a document easier.I LOVE  the clarity of the screen.  In anything but full sun that is.  The glass is too shiny and reflective then.It does get warm as the battery both charges and while in use.  But not hot, just warm.Yes, I bought an expensive \"starter\" tablet.  It reviewed well and I'm quite happy with my purchase.  I would recommend it to someone as a great crossover.  Tablet when you want it.  Decent sized notebook when you want that.And yes, I've found that being able to carry just the tablet or the tablet / docking station around is so much nicer than lugging the 17 inch laptop around.Tablet, & Docking Station / Keyboard & Poetic case.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Tablet Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z56UV2VF7L8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tablet for a great price.

I wanted a 10\u201d tablet that I could use for school; I am a 3rd year, studying Civil Engineering.  A lot of our textbooks are available in PDF format or Digital format.  So obviously carrying around one 10\u201d tablet as opposed to 4-5, 5-10 lb textbooks is a great trade!  I did a lot of research, looked at different brands, read tons of reviews and even played on tablets at every Best Buy, Walmart, Radio Shack, etc, that I could get my hands on.  I finally decided this was the tablet for me.My deciding factors:HD DisplayExpandable battery (optional Dock)Expandable memory (MicroSD card slot)Android OS (Jelly Bean Update)SuperNote (preinstalled note taking app)Polaris Office (preinstalled)I ordered this tablet on Monday morning, and by Tuesday afternoon (using Prime Shipping) it was delivered.  After I charged up the tablet and turned it on I was definitely amazed at the display.  The HD on this tablet is very good.  The battery charged very quickly, I did notice the back of the tablet got very hot when charging.  But you can\u2019t feel it through the case I have it in.  The tablet automatically updated to Jelly Bean, which made the tablets web browser drag and crash like crazy.  I downloaded Boat Browser and have used that as the main browser ever since, it hasn\u2019t crashed on me yet (it also supports flash, BONUS!!).Overall I love this tablet, it is customizable (Hello its Android), lightweight, stylish and extremely easy to use.

I am wondering how one can resolve this problem if it is at all possible to do.That said I am glad I waited for this tablet to come out it really rocks.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost there...", "Author": "GadgetAddicted", "ReviewID": "R1TP0IT0E528MV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let's start this off by saying I am a huge Android fan and a big nerd.  I have been waiting for the Infinity since it was first announced.  I wanted the Prime, but that turned out to have lots of issues, so I waited patiently.  FINALLY, it has arrived.  I had high hopes for this device that it could be a suitable replacement for a low power laptop.  In that function, it does sort of deliver.  If your uses for a laptop are only browsing the web, watching videos, e-mail, word processing, and maybe some light Excel, you should be good to go here.This tablet comes equipped with the latest Tegra 3 processor, with higher clock speeds than what's in the Transformer Prime as well as the TF-300.  That extra clock speed pretty much only evens things out when it comes to performance since the higher resolution of this tablet is going to make it take a hit in frame-rate.  The Infinity has a 1900 x 1200 Super IPS screen, most current tablets have 1200 x 800 screens.  This panel is incredibly sharp, incredibly bright (600 nits), and has great viewing angles.  So if a beautiful screen is a pre-requisite for your purchase, you definitely want to look at the Infinity.  Other noteworthy features would be HDMI out and a micro SD card slot (and a full sized SD card slot if you buy the dock).  I can't stand tablets that don't have expandable storage.  I bought a 32GB micro SD card from Newegg for $15 the other day, so doubling my storage will be great for media.  Also of note, performance wise, is that this tablet can finally handle x264 encoded videos (high profile).  If you understood that, you probably know that previous generation tablets such as those with the Tegra 2, or other Qualcomm processors, could not decode those videos, and for me, made those tablets useless.Camera performance is solid.  Takes sharp pictures, not too much shutter lag.  But taking pictures with a tablet camera always seemed silly to me.  Front facing camera is what you tend to expect from any front facing camera I'd say, maybe slightly above average.Advertised usage is roughly 9 hours without the dock, and around 16 with the dock (which has it's own battery that the tablet can draw from).  From my usage so far, I would find these numbers to be reasonably accurate.Speaking of the dock - The dock is definitely the selling feature of the Transformer line.  It's definitely a huge step up from just typing on the virtual keyboard, but definitely not a replacement for a full sized keyboard.  It makes typing out a long e-mail tolerable on a tablet, but you won't be wanting to type any novels on it.  It definitely takes getting used to, since some of the important keys are very small, such as the right shift.Overall smoothness of operation still leaves a little to be desired.  You get the usual Android hiccups here and there.  I'm hoping that Jelly Bean (Project Butter) fixes this, finally.  ASUS is known to do a great job releasing timely updates to their devices, unlike many manufacturers.For the people who are into benchmarks, I ran a couple of tests, in Balanced mode (the Infinity has 3 power use modes...Performance, Balanced, and Power Saver):Quadrant - 4840Antutu - Total Score 12202 (CPU 7655, GPU 1331, RAM 2584, IO 632)Linpack - Single Thread 54.43 Mflops, Multi Thread 84.63Lastly, as others have mentioned, the speaker is horrible and the placement was poor.  It's on the right side, roughly where you'd hold the device in landscape mode.  You'd be best to hold the device upside down, so the speaker is on top, or use headphones.To sum it all up, I'd say that this tablet meets most of my expectations, I was only mildly disappointed in the performance of the device.  At this stage in the game, it should be running smoother in overall UI responsiveness.  Fingers crossed for Jelly Bean.  There are faster processors on the horizon, which I would probably wait for if you're a performance junkie, but it's going to be eons before ASUS puts one of those in a Transformer style tablet form factor...", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "So much potential, so much more pain when it failed.", "Author": "pek", "ReviewID": "RFDTPU271FEUR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I unboxed the Infinity on Monday, I was impressed by its build quality and design. At first glance, the screen looked a little smaller than I expected, but that was mainly because it has a decent border around it. When I booted up the device, everything ran smoothly. Apps where launching instantly, swapping between different screens was smooth, and overall everything was working fine.On Tuesday, I got a notification to update the OS to the newest version. I was going to get Jelly Bean! So I went ahead and started the update process. After everything finished and the device rebooted, I immediately noticed hiccups. However, I had installed a bunch of apps, so it did not concern me that much.On Wednesday I ran a small game I am developing and I saw the screen flicker. \"OK\", I said, \"This is probably my fault. There must be something in the code\". So I didn't give it much attention either.On Thursday, while holding the device I noticed that there was space between the glass and the back casing, on the bottom side. I had just ordered a case for it, so again, I was not that much concerned about it.On Friday the device froze completely while I was browsing the web. I held the power button down until it rebooted. When the OS came up again, a message informed me that it installed an update. Weird; I did not remember reading anything about an update.Now I'm concerned. I noticed the flickering in another game, the space between the glass was becoming annoying and the hiccups were becoming more and more obvious. But I was willing to put up with all of this until the device froze completely again. Unfortunately, this time when I rebooted I got an \"Encryption Unsuccessful\" error screen while the OS was booting. It clearly stated that I had to factory reset the device and loose everything. I was speechless.This is just the 5th day of using the device. It did not fell, I did not root it, I did not do anything out of the ordinary, and yet, it was completely useless in less than a full week of use. Wow. The device felt like it had so much potential. I search the Internet to find out what happened and it turned out that this is quite a common problem after the OS update. I did not find any website on how to fix this permanently, but did find a bunch of articles that tried to fix it and had them see similar problems later.I wasn't going to risk keeping this device and finding out it can't be fixed after my return window goes away. Especially when a very good competing Android tablet just became available. The only reason this is not a 1 star review is because the device looks and feels very good, the specs are amazing, and, if you happen to buy this device with none of the problems mentioned above, it is a very good choice.

After looking through all of the tablets we decided on the TF700T versus the Nexus 10 (lack of expandable storage) and the iPad (lack of expandable storage / requirement to have all of the media in a specific format / pricing).The screen on this device is still among best - even better based upon the price we paid for them ($428 per).  The tablet has more than enough power to run any app and ASUS has done an excellent job of keeping their devices updated with the latest version of Android.Although I think the Nexus 10 is an excellent device, I was able to purchase each of these tablets (plus a microSD card and a case) for the same pricing as the Nexus 10.  In addition, one of the kids has added the keyboard and turned it into an even better work solution.I highly recommend this table - especially if you can get it in the same price range as I did.

Yet, about the only difference in specs is that the Nexus has 2GB of RAM and the tablet only 1GB.So, the performance between the two is about the same. No significant improvement. However the TF700 has an improved GPS (it works as it should) and improved Wi-Fi.

Because I loved my rather inadequately and would never recommend Smartphone from T-mobile (a Samsung Gravity Smart filled with bloatware and incapable of expanding even with a larger storage card), I finally decided on the Asus tablet because it struck me as the perfect hybrid between a true laptop and a tablet.  I found a great deal on a 64 gig open-box unit and they price-matched me on the keyboard (J&R; in New York) and was sooooooooo excited I purchased over $150 in accessories before I even got the darn thing!  I will say this, I have NEVER experienced such awesome visuals in my life (and yesterday was my 50+++ birthday).  Truly amazing, crisp, beautiful -- I can't say enough.  That being said, for the price, it just wasn't worth it.  The sound quality is a joke as in, why the hell do you put 1 speaker in the rear only?  Yesterday (I did say it was my birthday, didn't I?) I caved and bought an iPad mini and the sound on it is 1,000x better than the Asus.  Also, my brand new (not opened box) keyboard had a \"T\" that kept sticking.  I type over 80 wpm, so when I key doesn't work, It screws up my rhythm big time.  It also made be wonder about Asus quality control.  I will acknowledge that I thought the tablet will be more like a laptop, i.e., able to have multiple \"windows\" open at once, etc., etc., so I have to bear some of the blame with respect to expectations.  Also, I had no idea 10\" could be so unwieldy.  I had seen and caressed the iPad when it first came out but it just didn't look that portable to me.  I think I had forgotten, and the Asus I believe is heavier than the iPad.  I carry a big pocketbook always but still, plopping it out at a restaurant was a bit unwieldy.  I'm currently \"in transition,\" (i.e., desperately seeking employment)so the cost was a huge issue.  So, as much as I didn't want to give Apple any money, for half the cost of the TF700T, I got an iPad mini which is more portable, gets more podcasts (which I will be able to hear without earphones) and has less accessories on which to waste money -- although I did order a keyboard for that, as well.

From their tablets and keyboards to their motherboards, I have never has any issues. I'm not saying that some have not had problems with products purchased from Asus, but they are few and far between. I purchased my first Asus product in 1995 and never looked back. This tablet is absolutely wonderful, looks great, runs exactly as they advertised, I love the option of having a keyboard that docks with the tablet to make the device a notebook, having gorilla glass 2 to protect the screen from scratches and the fact that it is a true hd screen. Videos are crisp and clear, the tablet is fast and responsive. I received a deal when I purchased the tablet and keyboard as a combo deal. I know that there are those that complain that the android update to 4.2.1 is slow in coming, they say thing that are totally ridiculous at times. Though I do understand that everyone is impatient when waiting for these updates, myself included. However, when you buy the tablet you do purchase it as it is, they are not required to give anything more, that goes for all hardware vendors. I feel that they do update fairly well,  these things take time . If they rush the ota out and there is issues, well there is another set of complaints. I added this comment only to make the point that you should not make decisions on a tablet on those types of complaints but the overall performance and reliability of the device, whichever one you choose.

They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Asus stands out as the jewel of tablets. From it's performance to looks the Asus is the true winner. Another big plus, is by adding the keyboard you have an additional battery that gives you about 14 hours of charge.

Sometimes the touch screen is not accurate; at times the touches seem \"off\" as to where I am trying to touch; not by much, but it's there.  No matter what program I use, I get frustrated just trying to type something because the tablet is unresponsive. I had better responsiveness on my old XOOM. Using the dock is better, but it makes the tablet a little awkward to use (I would get out my notebook, then.).How many times I reformatted, cold-booted, and did the other suggestions out there on the web...well, nothing worked. Am I the only one? Go over to XDA Forums and read. It was suggested that the more programs you put on the tablet, the slower it becomes. That's why I bought the tablet with all that memory; so I could put all my programs on it.  Why would I buy a tablet with all the memory and not use that memory because it degrades performance?When I first called them, Asus tech support was good; they responded promptly, and I received the unit back in no time. However, I still have lag and poor I/O performance. Because of the lag, I was willing to unlock the device, void the warranty, and install a custom rom that supposedly makes the tablet run better, but I keep getting the network error response.  I called tech support again, but after the initial response, I have heard nothing, although I did receive the email to rate the service.On the physical side, I usually hold the tablet in my palms. Depending how you hold it, the tablet may dig into them. I also cradle the tablet between my thumb and forefinger. The bottom of the tablet digs into my flesh.On the whole it is not a bad tablet. Tech Support was pretty good. It just isn't worth the high price. It's an average tablet with an over-average price. If you want to use it for the Internet (and it doesn't even have 5Ghz!) or play an occasional game, get something cheaper, or wait for the new technology to come out. I bought it for the dock, but I really don't use it that much; I'll end up going to my desktop with the better keyboard. People swear by the thing; others bitterly complain. There's no consistency. You may get a good unit, or you may get a bad one (not the occasional bad one either; there's too many people complaining). I got a bad one. Too much hastle for the money.Don't buy this product based just on the specs. Do your homework before you buy. This tablet has better graphics than my old XOOM, but I'd rather have a tablet that works when I want it to rather than having to wait.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defective unit", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R1D1M2FY8ADCY2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was really excited to get this as I had the transformer prime and liked it, except for the wifi issue.

Do not buy.", "Author": "Rhynocerous", "ReviewID": "RGKKNGKPY09Z3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Shame on you AS; I've been a big fan of your motherboards, laptops, and network equipment, but this tablet is horrible.  I was very excited last Christmas when I received this tablet as it had been reviewed so well and it seemed to have enough hardware to be able to compete with an iPad.  It seemed fairy snappy for a bit and then the problems started.Basic tasks like typing into the address bar of the web browser lags horribly.  Launching the Kindle app literally takes up to 15 seconds at times.  Multitasking is a joke as it can take up to 30 seconds to switch apps and it sometimes crashes and you have to wait another 15 seconds or so for it to update.I have done about five wipes of the device hoping that it speeds it up and there has been no difference.  Even when it comes factory reset it is only slightly faster than when you add your own apps.  The \"performance\" setting makes only a slight boost in speed.  The really frustrating thing is that this tablet flies when playing full screen games like Need For Speed but at the same time can't accept basic typing without choking.  My co-workers urged me to send it back to ASUS since it was still under warranty (which cost me $15 bucks with insurance) and they sent it back wiped and said the device didn't have any issues.I have never been a fan of how much Apple locks down their devices and you have to pay extra for everything that comes standard on the Infinity like and HDMI output and Mini SD card slot.  I hate to say it, but nothing I have used so far comes even close to an iPad 2 which is now three generations back.  I work with iPads everyday at work and it pains me that nobody can come up with an Android tablet that can come even close to an iPad.  I have heard good things about the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7, but we'll have to see.If I had known how slow this tablet was, I would have paid a little extra and purchased an iPad.

She used it primarily for web apps (email, social networks, surfing) and occasionally documents/spreadsheets. But the hard drive was near empty and it had a paltry 2GB of RAM so she couldn't have too many programs or browser tabs open. The machine was super heavy and bulky to boot. All in all, it was time to let it go.So after some thinking, we figured an Asus Transformer Prime with the mobile dock would be the best choice. We decided to abandon traditional laptops with bloated operating systems like Windows or OS X and try a more modern option. I've never been a fan of ultrabooks since I don't believe in paying more than $1000 for any device, especially since you'll have to replace it in a few years.*Display*The Transformer's display is actually not as impressive as I thought it'd be. Sure, it easily matches iPad 3's Retina Display in terms of sharpness. But our Galaxy Nexuses both have similar pixel density, so we don't really notice anything new. And unfortunately, I've gotten used to the inky blacks and gorgeous colors of the AMOLED display on my Nexus. The Transformer's Super LCD looks bland and washed out by comparison. I'm not sure which has more accurate colors (who cares?) but I know that _everything_ looks better on AMOLED. Using an LCD is simply a \"downgrade\".*Performance*The Tegra 3 really flies, especially in games from the TegraZone. I was stunned by the particle effects, shadows, lighting, textures and frame rates in Glow Ball and Dead Trigger. For a mobile device, this is astonishing. However, I was disappointed to see that the device wasn't as powerful as I hoped it'd be. I tried running the Shadow Galaxy live wallpaper and the device couldn't handle it -- scrolling through screens was choppy. By comparison, my Galaxy Nexus and its ancient GPU isn't anywhere as bad. So I'm attributing this lag to the display's 1920 x 1200 pixels -- I guess even the Tegra 3 can't handle that. Still, you don't expect that on a high-end device.*Build quality*The build quality is rock-solid -- it feels like a hunk of metal. But I've always detested the ice-cold feel unfinished look of brushed aluminum, but that's just me. I'd much rather have preferred a unibody polycarbonate design, like in the HTC One X. In addition, it might not seem like it but 1.4 lbs is incredibly heavy to hold. Laptops don't have this problem since they can be nearly 4-5 lbs and still be comfortable for hours. It's annoying always trying to find a more comfortable position to hold the tablet since your hands will tire quickly.*Keyboard dock*The keyboard dock is near perfect. It blows away any other tablet keyboard solution out of the water. Bluetooth keyboards only drain battery and require you to somehow prop up your tablet. Meanwhile, the Transformer's keyboard dock actually boosts your battery life by 50% to a mind-blowing total of 14 hours. It also has dedicated keys to control the OS, which was handy. Unfortunately, the trackpad was tiny and I found that I had to touch the screen more than I wanted to even when using the dock.*Usability*This is where the device crashes and burns. After using the Transformer Infinity, I realized that tablets (Android or iOS) aren't remotely close to being good for doing tasks as well as a traditional computer. Here are some examples.- Opening a link in a new tab in a browser. This requires you to long-press the link, which sometimes just doesn't register. With the trackpad, it's even more frustrating. On a computer, you simply right-click and choose to open a new tab.- Cut, copy, paste. You need to long-press to select the word either by touch or the trackpad, select the Cut/Copy icon, and if you want to paste it in a different app, you have to put up with the hassle mentioned above. Once you're there you have to long-press and select paste. The entire process is a huge step backwards in usability.- No browser extensions. Not sure if Chrome Mobile will ever get these, but not having any of my (especially AdBlock Plus) is infuriating.- Multi-tasking. Even though Android actually has true multi-tasking, it's not very functional. For example, to chat with a friend requires you to hit the Recent Apps button, find Google Talk and select a person. And then you have to repeat that to return to what you were doing. This is absolutely annoying (and about 1000x more so on iOS) when responding to messages. On a computer, you can multi-task a lot faster and more efficiently.- Apps are really diluted, clunky versions of their websites. Trying to edit a spreadsheet on the Google Drive app is a horrible experience compared to the web app. Comparing products in the Amazon app isn't possible since you can only view one at a time. Every app (even on iOS) feels like it was designed to be used in short bursts, instead of sessions. In fact, we stopped using apps on the tablet and just opened the respective site in Chrome.SummaryThe Transformer is without a doubt a powerful device but it has lots of kinks. What I learned by using this device is that tablets are trying their best to be a legitimate device category but got lost on the way. The Transformer Infinity and iPad are still nothing more than giant smartphones (minus the phone). All the usability problems I mentioned above are invisible and don't bother us when using a phone. Why? Because apps, even those specifically designed for tablets, are best used while on the go in short-bursts. Sure, there are apps for almost everything, but when you have some time and want the full experience, they just don't cut it. And this is because Android and iOS were born in the smartphone world.In order to be a justifiable purchase, tablets need to do certain tasks better than any other device. And that task is purely media consumption, at home or on the go. Current examples of tablets that have found their identity are the Nook, Kindle Fire or the Nexus 7, which are designed from the ground-up to be gateways to their respective app stores. They're better for reading books/magazines, watching movies/TV shows, and playing games than any other device. The 7\" form factor is ideal since it's not bulky or as heavy. No surprise that Apple is frantically entering this category soon.So yes, we returned the Transformer Infinity after using it for a week. During that time, my wife was sick of using it and couldn't get enough of my Chromebook. Since using web apps and browsing is what she does most, the Chromebook was a perfect fit. And there simply isn't a better device for that.

While for use almost exclusively networked to the home pc, I really liked the improvement in features the tablet represented: smaller, lighter, touch screen, cool apps, etc. I also liked the idea of taking it on the road when traveling, just a lot more portable. And while I really liked the tablet itself, when it came to Android and home networking, I decided this platform simply wasn't for me.Tablet Pros:\u2022 Touch screen - very bright and clear, smudges when screen off are completely invisible when on. Responsiveness is incredible.\u2022 Battery - unbelievable standby time, very good use time. We didn't use that much, but left on all the time only had to charge every few days or so, maybe every other day with moderate use.\u2022 Keyboard Dock - I also got the keyboard dock, worked really well, love the convertibility of it - the Android keyboard works amazingly well, but for more robust typing, the keyboard is obviously your best choice\u2022 I really didn't use any other features but liked the idea of having both the forward and rear facing cameras, as well as the mini-HDMI port among othersTablet Cons (only one):\u2022 WiFi Speed - while at times I experienced speeds comparable to my laptop, at other times, this thing was incredibly slow, especially when watching video such as Youtube or a product video on a company website.Android Home Networking Cons - The Deal Killer in my book\u2022 File Sharing - requires an app, such as the most popular, ES-File Explorer, all of which function essentially as FTP, meaning that you don't edit the file in place but instead open it, edit it, save it to the tablet, then transfer it back to the PC. Call me Goldilocks but I want to open it, edit it, save it, done. Okay, so \"duh,\" we're talking two completely different O/S's, so I should expect that, but I seriously thought the apps would handle it differently.\u2022 Printer Sharing - again, requires an app. No, you don't just print directly from an Office type of software, or directly from a web page, but instead you save your file to the tablet, then open your downloaded printer app, then open the file, then print it. What a pain.Conclusion:So again, if you're looking for a mobile tablet or are all about cloud file storage, not considering it for networking with a pc, and are also only an occasional printer, then I would highly recommend this tablet.

I purchased the unit because of its improved display and processing.  This tablet does provide enhanced graphics over the TF101; however, ASUS has yet to include good sound quality in their tablets.  Also, the switch from the TF101 to the TF700 required that I purchase another docking station because the TF101 dock will not fit the TF700.  I believe that ASUS should have developed an adaptor that would allow the 101 dock to work with the 700 rather than requiring their customers to pay another $150.00 for a second docking unit.  ASUS also changed from a mini to a micro HDMI port that requires the user to buy another HDMI cable.I've experienced some problems with the apps on the tf700 also.  The Xfinity Player app stops everytime I use the micro HDMI link to my TV.  The video stops playing and gives me a message to disconnect the cable before it will resume playing.  This app works fine on the tf101.  ASUS has been of no help in trying to resolve this problem.  Their only answer is that it must be an app problem even though I use the same app on their 101 without any problem. I contacted Comcast regarding the problem and I was told that the message that I am getting is not an error message related to the app, but a message related to the unit's operating environment controlled by the operating system.  ASUS tech support refuses to even try to duplicate the problem or perform any analysis of the issue!!Overall I like the unit but do not recommend that anyone rush out and buy it as a replacement to the 101 or 300 unless you realy want the highr resolution.I'll end by noting that I have been an ASUS fan for years.

Unless you put the tablet into portrait position or hold your hand on the right side in landscape to deflect the sound more to the middle, it sounds like the (non-existent) left speaker is broken.  I don't usually listen to my music with the left channel shut off or with only the right ear bud in my right ear, so this is especially frustrating on this tablet model given that the screen itself is quite nice visually.  If I do return it, it will probably be due to the inexplicably poor speaker placement, limited volume output, and less than stellar audio quality even with expensive headphones and equalizer apps.  At this price point (I bought the 64GB), as an audiophile and music lover, I am not satisfied with the disappointing sound features.  The overall build quality is also taken down a couple notches by the cheap feeling plastic volume and power buttons, and the proprietary and flimsy power adapter connector (no direct USB without the dock??).  Yes, the full HD screen is really nice, especially for viewing high resolution photos, but the other downsides may be a deal breaker.Even my old HTC Flyer has the stereo speakers in the center, but with enough of a raise in the rear profile of the case so that the sound is nearly evenly distributed in landscape mode even when lying flat.  While I do have the nice Bose portable bluetooth speaker, it's not practical to carry it around everywhere all the time to compensate for the TF700T's lousy sound.  What was ASUS thinking?I've read the XDA discussion about this tablet's DAC, so I'm not the only one who hoped for more from this tablet.  It would be nice to know if there is a better Android tablet choice available in terms of sound quality that still has a decent display, whether 7\" or 10\".File this one in the \"so very close but so very far\" category.  How this can arguably be the best Android tablet on the market for this kind of money is just sad.*** UPDATE - 08/04/12 - Item returned due mainly to poor quality sound design.  Will wait until something better is released for this kind of crazy money for a tablet.  Manufacturers are you listening?

I like android, and I'd never buy an apple product for all the BS lawsuits they've done to android phone tablet OEMs. As such, I can handle roadblocks and problems with ease. Unfortunately, most can't. So here is my gripes and observances so far with the device; some annoy me, and some will just cause it to be returned for most people:HARDWARE1. Some complain about the top right hand corner, being able to push the glass in. I can, but very little, so that's really nothing to me.2. The bottom left of the screen has a little light bleed. Visible when the screen is all black.3. It doesn't seem to register finger taps as well as my HTC Sensation does.4. The wifi keeps sleeping or something. So it keeps throwing a \"No connection error\" while the wifi comes back. Never had an issue like this with my phone.SOFTWARE.1. I go to use Netflix, and it just closes. I try to update the app, but it doesn't offer an update. Wait, the description at the play store says if I can't update it, click here to install it. It downloads an apk for me to install, thus requiring the install of 3rd party sources. Now it opens.2. The \"My Library\" has a serious flaw. I can't tap on any links in epubs (same issue with the Transformer 300). That's a big show stopper. And the page animations are very choppy. So I installed FBReader instead. Then I associate any epubs I download with that.Here's the weird part: I can't disable it to just get rid of it. And this obviously is ICS. Even on my phone previously preinstalled apps you couldn't remove can at least be stopped and removed from the app list (I know that from people who upgraded from 2.3 to 4. I don't run carrier crap and thus was in control via a 3rd party ROM since day one). Not here. Now I realize there might be a reason for it, but still.3. Using Hotmail. The email app has no built in settings for it, nor did it work for me doing it the exchange server route. Ended up using the app. Why it isn't a non-issue like my dad's 2+ year old ipod touch is beyond me.4. Has a newspaper app. Activated the free trial, then tries to load a newspaper. After waiting about a minute, it disappears.There are good things about this device. Problem is, I know the average person could care less. Some of it is Asus' fault, and some of it is Google.

I understand that with electronics there is always a possiblity with a \"lemon\" here and there. Thats just the nature of electronical devices. Fine... I returned it with Amazons great return policy and received the replacement.Several days of using the replacement I noticed that when left charged overnight the tablet woudn't fully charge. Odd..I'll keep using it and see what happens during the next charge. Well the tablet finally got down to the point were I needed to charge it again. I turned off the tablet and \"plugged\" the charger into the tablet. Nothing, know charger indicator light (orange/red light) came on. I then tired to power the tablet back on. Nothing, tablet doesn't want to power back on.I tried holding down the power button for 3 secs...nothing. I then tried the 30 second hard reset..this didn't do anything. I thought maybe it might be the charger itself. I took a USB flash drive device with light.. and \"plugged\" it into the the tablets wall charger. The light on the USB flash drive came on. Okay the wall charger works fine.Wow...Ive had the second tablet for less then a week and its already died on me.Lemon number two.The tablet came with ICS. On the second day of owning the tablet I upgraded it to Jelly Bean. Im not certain if this is the problem with the tablet or not. Just pointing this out.To make matters even worse. I purchased two Nexus 7 (for my boys) at around the same time I originally purchased the TF700T. As we all know, the Nexus 7 is also made by ASUS. Yes, one of the Nexus 7 sreens has a defect. It looks milky white/cloudy with some \"burn\" retention on the screen. I didnt purchase it from Amazon, but from Google itself. Called them and I will receive the replacement today.So when it comes down to ASUS and there tablets. I wont be buying another one. As for other products from this company. I wouldnt think twice about not buying from them.

Here I brought home the tablet I thought was best on the market and believe me it is NOT!Pros: Fast CPU, everything running fast and very smooth. Finishing touch on the tablet is high class, the feel is perfect. Asus 4.1 is not the latest version of Android but it is very very close! Flash is also a big pro, compared to the TF300 at least. Triumph over Nexus 10 and 7 thanks to its supporting MicroSD card so you can easily upgrade your storage with affordable price, the ease of transferring your files, and you don't have to put yourself on the cloud like you have to with the iPad. So MicroSD is probably the biggest pro. One more pro over the Samsung competitors is that you have the option to turn the tablet into a netbook with physical keyboard and extra battery life!Cons: I didn't think it would be a con, but the aluminum back cover is a con! Extremely easy to be scratched doesn't help. And the charging port is also aluminum. And the aluminum \"bar\" is extremely easy to be bent! I charged my tablet while it was on the shelf with the wire hanging and a day later I found that \"bar\" in a V shape! (Should have known better and buy extra warranty at this point!\" After a few time of bending and try to bend it back, the port is completely broken! Won't charge anymore and I saw my tablet die after its battery ran out. Then while I was trying to contact Asus for repairing. Two day later, I pull out the tablet after leaving it lying on the floor and I found a crack between the camera hole and the flash light. Either something happened that cracked it without me knowing, or I suspect the aluminum part shrink due to the cold weather, much faster than the carbon fiber part on top thus corrupting the top part. The reason I think this is after I pulled it out, I found the aluminum back extremely cold while the carbon part only slightly cold.Anyway, the tablet is a bust for me.

Unfortunately I was disappointed.  After extensive research into buying my first tablet, I boiled the competition down to the TF700T and the new iPad.  I chose the TF700T due to several key features: the expandable storage options, dock w/ extra battery and usb, built-in GPS and android OS (I loathe itunes) with Adobe Flash support.  After owning it for a week, I still like the expandability and access to the file system.  However, the other 'pros' have not met my expectations.  First, I found the dock to be not particularly useful.  The keyboard on the dock is too small for me to use practically, and I repeatedly dragged my hand over the touchpad, causing the cursor to jump while typing (ok I'm knit-picking).  With a little practice, perhaps I could learn to use this effectively.  Second, and I may have received a defective unit, but the GPS did not work at all.  I tried to find a signal in multiple locations (indoors and out), at multiple times of day, but never once locked onto a satellite.  When I contacted ASUS support about the GPS, their response was top simply state that the GPS may not work - thanks for nothing, ASUS support.  I knew that GPS was a problem with the transformer prime, but I thought the issue had been ironed out by now.  Regarding the OS, I think the tablet has a great interface and feel. On the app front, I found many of the android apps to be a bit glitchy.  For example, navigation in the netflix app is nearly impossible.  I made a side-by-side comparison of several apps with my brother's ipad2, and in nearly every instance, the ipad2 apps worked better.  For the record, internet browsing was similar between the two devices. Finally, Flash is no longer supported for android, so there goes that advantage over Apple products.Bottom line: I returned the TF700T and bought a new iPad and have not regretted the decision at all. Please don't disregard this review as just another apple fan bashing android tablets, because that could not be further from the truth.  I had that same mindset when reading reviews before buying this tablet and was dead set on finding an alternative to an ipad.

However it is far from being the best tablet on the market.I own the 1st and 2nd generation ipad but i will compare to ipad2 only.1- the screen is not visibly better. It is just brighter in the sun and still annoyingly reflective. I played temple run on both and found ipad2 less bright but otherwise snappier and clearer.2- the tablet kept dropping wifi out of the box. It took 2 hours and a call to asus to fix it. I came this close to sending it back.3- when wifi finally connected. It only connected at wireless g. It does not connect at n speeds. Additionally it only has a 2.4 ghz radio, no 5 ghz to be seen. For those less familiar, the wifi on this tablet is 2005 equipment. And this is unacceptable for a 600 bucks machine in 2012.4- the glass seems like it could separate anytime. The whole tablet feels flimsy and gives crackling sounds on gentle handling. It feels very cheap and fragile. Again unacceptable for a high end device.5- try pressing on a white screen and you end up with semi-permanent graying that lasts minutes. It seems air (and dust) can easily get between glass and screen which could spell disaster long term. Ipad2 graying disappears in a second.6- browsing experience is average. Chrome is better than on ipad but not nearly as fast as it ought to be. This is not saying much though because chrome on ipad is very slow on its own merits. The letters appear sharper though. Big wop.7- goes without saying, it is much harder to find quality tablet apps for android than it is on ipad. Even if you are willing to pay top dollar for them. Part of the problem is the play store which does not aid the discovery process.8- tablet is a smudge magnet, front and back. Again in high end tablet i expected surface treatment with lipophobic material to keep the screen visible.I only had the device for 24 hours at the time of writing and i will update as i gain more experience. But so far, if this is your first tablet purchase, buy a freakin ipad. You would be much better off. Zero frustration, and 100% enjoyment. Android tablets are easily 5 years behind current ipad.Update 08/10/2012: 9- Performance is quirky. The graphical user interface has quit on me 3 times so far in light use. Suddenly and for no apparent reason at all, I am left with an empty frozen screen that only shows the wallpaper. I am forced each time to use the physical power button to reboot tablet. I have a total of 25 installed apps only, most of which came pre installed. In 2 years of iPad use I never had to do that, never.Note: all the 5 star reviews you are seeing come from android fan boys who have been using really crappy tablets and see this one as a great upgrade.

If you live in a tiny dorm room with a roommate for 4 years, you will think that a one bedroom apartment is buckingham palace.Update 08/12/12: 10- the tablet heats up pretty quickly. after about 30 minutes of continuous use the left upper quadrant becomes noticably hot. i am operating at a controlled temperature that does not exceed 75 f.11- battery life is iffy. it simply does not last all day. you have to recharge it in the afternoon on moderate use. on heavy use, like playing advanced games with high graphics demands, battery life is about 4 hours. the 9 hour theoretical claim is based on playing video which is a relatively battery friendly activity.12- Sound is awful. the one speaker can easily be blocked by your hand, and even if you are careful, it is still very low, thin and bland. no distinction between bass and any other levels. you literally have to put your ear to the speaker to hear. in fairness, all tablets (and smartphones) I have used have bad sound. a supplemental bluetooth speaker is mandatory.Note: i checked out asus facebook page. every entry they have is followed by hundreds of irate comments from dissatisfied customers. oddly asus reps never comment back despite the fact that many comments are specific.Note: I am disappointed with the tech blogs who touted this tablet as the perfect device, conveniently ignoring any of the above quirks and defects. the disappointment includes anandtech, the verge, engadget and hothardware.Update 08/25/12:13- Scrolling is hard and choppy and unresponsive. I can't believe it is a processor issue with such a powerful 4+1 processor. it must be a OS issue because it is the same problem in most apps but not all apps I have used. Maybe android 4.1 will solve the problem.14- links: clicking on links is a surprise every time. sometimes it just works and sometimes it is completely unresponsive that you got to click several times. And it is always embarrassingly laggy.15- Widgets: android has a wealth of beautiful and functional widgets to choose from. Trouble is, many of these widgets freeze, go blank or just don't update as expected. This seems a system wide yet random problem. On any given day you just don't know which widget is going to work.Note: tablet wide freezing problem follow up. the problem is getting worse. I frequently end up with nothing but the background wallpaper (at least once a day). Ironically apps would still work but only from the recent apps button since the main screen is blank. So this is gui issue which speaks volumes about the lack of attention given by developers to the user facing components of the OS.Note: for those who have come to expect airplay from their tablets, there is a partial workaround. If you have any Google tv device and install the free \"able remote\" application on both tablet and Google tv, then you can stream music, YouTube and other videos to your tv. This is not mirroring but it solves most of the problem. Basically you start your video and choose able remote from the share menu.Note: someone might ask, but why have I not returned this machine yet and gotten my money back. well, I should have except I need a larger form factor android device to try apps I am working on. Besides android tablets aren't getting any better in the near future. So it is not like I have better alternatives at this screen size.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Would give it 0 stars if possible", "Author": "jarns", "ReviewID": "R1VZZXBMGH60CN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "**BUYERS BEWARE****BUYERS BEWARE****BUYERS BEWARE****BUYERS BEWARE**This tablet does not charge.

I already use an iPad and bought this for my parents.I hoped for the tablet to be stylish, provide a seamless user experience and easy to use. To give credit where it's due, Transformer Infinity is extremely light weight and attractive looking.However, I was thoroughly disappointed after struggling with it for nearly 4 hours before giving up. Here's what I was trying to do1. Transfer photo's, movies and music from my macbook pro to transformer Prime2. Set up contacts3. Set up social apps (facebook, gtalk, gvoice, skype etc.)First of all the app store (google play) seemed crowded (comparing with apple app store). Maybe that's just a preference. I downloaded Skype and could not find a way to add my skype contacts to the app.I couldn't do it so I moved on.Tried installing the Flash plugin. Too bad, Adobe has pulled out support and I was not able to install flash. It's not available on the app storeHowever, the browser would keep on asking to install flash, which was annoying.I couldn't do it so I moved on.Tried copying files from macbook pro. Too bad, the tablet was not even recognized.I searched quite a lot on the net to understand the nuances of Android and how to use it but the help was pretty much non-existent.While I was struggling through all this, I also noticed that when comparing with iPad, the performance was a touch sluggish. I had to tap on the app icons one or two times to have them open. They generally felt sluggish.I could not find the place to close the open apps. Some of the apps crashed and the tablet restarted in the middle of a browsing session.To be honest, I think most of the issues listed could just be because I was using Android for the first time. But then if I can't figure it out and there's no help for most common issues on the net, that's a genuine concern.After struggling with the software, I noticed a couple of dead pixels and that was the last straw.

If you unlock it, voiding the warrenty you can, and ASUS will help by giving you the software - SUSPICOUS!  We tried desperately to use the tablet for two weeks.  Not worth it.  It is very sensative to WiFi, and constantly lost connection in my house (even though my crappier Windows Phone keeps connection everywhere in my house.  I also tested the signal strength in the house, bought a bigger WiFi antenna, and switched channels, NO LUCK.  It is also very hard to set the settings.  It burns through the battery in about 6 hours without doing anything intense (IHeart radio).  I could never get videos to play. I also could never find the video player software on the tablet.  I bought this because i dont like how Apple locks you into their crap only, well it looks like i will have to finally break down and get an apple product.  I dont know if Jelly Bean will help but i am not waiting around to find out.  The tech people could not even tell me when or if jelly bean was even coming.  Also NO FLASH capability.  It is not compatible.  So half the websites dont work.  Who builds a tablet without FLASH support.Update 30 Sept:  My friend at work did not listen to me and bought an Infinity anyways.  Same exact problems to a T.  WiFi does not connect, scrolling is slow, system becomes overwehlmed when you try to do two tasks at once. Also his USB port does not read external storage devices.
