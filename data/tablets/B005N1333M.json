{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First impression, premium tablet at premium price.", "Author": "Traveler", "ReviewID": "R3BT0UYIOJ3IFV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading a few theoretical reviews, I thought I would post a very early review based on one whole day of using my Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus (which I've updated a couple of times).  I've rated it overall 4*, which is 5* for the Tab and 3* for a premium price.  There are certainly less expensive tablets, but I think this one really does have class-leading features.  It's up to you whether you think the features justify the price or whether you want to wait for the next better-faster-cheaper version.Not much to say about the design, it's a slab but the build quality is excellent and it feels very solid.  I bought this specifically because it's a 7\" form factor, and I wanted portable and pocketable which this delivers.  I've posted a picture of what's in the box, it's just the tablet, charger and cable [see photo on the product page].  Don't plan on learning much from the \"manual\", which is a tiny little booklet.  One thing I can't say is whether it has Gorilla Glass like the original Tab.  I hope so, but Samsung doesn't say much as Amazon shipped before the release date -- heck, Samsung won't even let me register it yet.  The screen quality, brightness and resolution is excellent although I did wind up disabling auto brightness as I thought it kept things a little dark.  Easily fixed by manually setting the brightness to about 60%.  The auto setting was probably to save battery life, which seems excellent.  Charged to 100% this morning, and after a day of light usage (web browsing, wifi on all day, an hour of music listening, dozen or so apps loaded, 15 minutes of navigation) I still have 51% remaining after a day of usage.  [11/6] I'm still happy with battery life, but I will say watching Netflix looks like it would only last about 4-5 hours.Honeycomb with this tablet is extremely responsive, and I didn't find Touch Wiz intrusive.  Actually everything pretty much just works the way you'd hope.  GPS and Google Maps worked great, got sat lock in only a few minutes sitting on the passenger seat of the car.  Local driving, but Google Maps cached enough that nav worked great.  [11/6] In answer to several comments, the GPS works without wifi.  Google Maps caches some local coverage, and there are standalone nav apps that have broader coverage.  If traffic updates are important, you won't get them with no wifi.Tried the camera, it's point-and-shoot cellphone quality but nothing approaching even my Lumix camera let alone a DSLR.  [11/12] But apps like Barcode Scanner and Skype make good use of the cameras.  The touchscreen is very responsive, and Netflix and Youtube looked great on my home wifi.  No problems at all with any of the apps I downloaded, they all ran and looked great.  [11/12] The 1.5.14 Pandora update fixes my previous UI complaint, so Pandora now looks as good as it sounds.  If you want to pretend to buy this for work with a clear conscience, I also setup the built-in VPN client and was able to load a free RDP application (Pocketcloud) from the Android market to access our Windows servers just fine.  [11/12]  The Peel Smart Remote folks never answered their email support form (why bother to have it if you don't respond?), but their 1.2.6 update did deliver basic support for my Time Warner/Motorola DVR so I've now had a chance to use the built-in remote.  The personalized program guide is nice and I might actually use it.  But the remote functions supported are pretty basic so I'll still be using my Logitech Harmony - maybe they'll create an app!If you're looking for a smaller tablet with all the bells and whistles, I think you'd be happy with this one.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung has it Right", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2IEFW8MEB68Y7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT:  Now the product has been tested more in more depth.  My initial review still stands.  I have edited the review to include more content concerning features.  ThanksFirst off I would like to state that this product has now been tested for two days.  If anything changes my opinion of it I will be glad to update this review.When getting this package I must admit I was filled with anticipation and some level of worry.  This tablet is going to be used for both recreational and business purposes so it had to be capable of doing a large number of things.  At first glance I have to say it is a real beauty.  It features a slick and stylish design capable of impressing nearly anyone.  Mine was charged to approximately 68% when I received it so I was able to turn it on and start right away. It took me approximately 10 minutes to get it started and linked to my google account.  Here came my first surprise.  Already having an android phone it then proceeded to download my saved contacts and apps that were own my phone.  This saved me lots of time and was a big plus.Briefly I would like to list features of the Tablet and give a quick run down:SCREEN -Very bright and clear.  This screen is impressive to say the least.  It comes auto set to change the lighting itself but you can turn that off and set the brightness to whatever level you choose.TOUCHSCREEN -Aside from being bright it is also very responsive to touch.  For this part of the test I went to my father.  My father has larger fingers and usually has problems with small buttons or touch screens.  He was impressed at how easy he could type and not make mistakes on the device.CAMERA -This is a noteworthy camera.  I was able to take a few decent shots with it and saw no real problems.Edit:  Tested out the video chat feature and had no problems it is a reasonably clear image.BLUETOOTH -No problems at all.  It linked to my phone and I was even able to tether internet to the tablet.GPS -Now first I was concerned GPS applications for download.  However after a few times using it I have decided I rather like it.  Here are three reasons why!1) I bought a tablet not a GPS!2) There are various different apps available on the market that seem to enable offline gps support.3) You can start the Navigation while connected to WiFi and it will load all the information for a route and then it works perfectly.  I even managed to get it to reprogram the route by turning the wrong way once.  All in all it is just an added feature that is fun to use and can be useful if you pre program it at home.SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ-Samsung has made a nice skin that overlays the natural Android design.  I found it both user friendly and rather fun to play with.  It took nothing away from the tablet, but added a few features that made it worthwhile!GAMES -Naturally I tried out a few games such as Angry Birds and others. This tablet played them with no problem and they looked even better than ever with a clear crisp image.MEDIA CENTER -I took the time to watch tv (Netflix) and listen to music (Pandora).  Both were clear and crisp in sound quality making the tablet good to use standalone. However Samsung also provides Ear buds if you do not want the entire room to hear what you are watching!PEEL -Edit:  Having first tested the remote on an old model tv I was unable to provide a clear picture of the features.  Now I have fully tested this features and I am impressed.  The Peel remote control offers an easy to use interface to change the channel, volume, or access menu.  Simply WONDERFUL.BATTERY LIFE -Honestly I cannot say much about the battery life of the product.  I charged it once and have used it off and on all day with little battery drainage.Edit:  Test and can now state that it held a charge for over a day with constant off and on usage.  It only showed a serious drop in life after watching roughly 45 minutes of netflix on full brightness.All in all the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.0 plus is an ideal tablet for anyone wanting to jump into the tablet market.  I would gladly make this purchase all over again.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet but not without problems", "Author": "M. Gymnopoulos", "ReviewID": "R14O08D5RLB1N3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I have to say that I am in general really satisfied with this product. Size and weight are perfect. The 1.2 Ghz dual core Exynos processor is great and in general the tab is fast. It is sometimes a bit choppy when exiting applications and if you return to the homescreens: Widgets are sometimes empty and refresh for a second but nothing to bother. I guess Honeycomb 3.2 is not optimized for the Tab 7 plus yet and Samsung has to polish the drivers a bit.The biggest problem I ran into so far are occasionally random reboots or random shut downs (Screen of death). I haven't manipulated the OS or installed problematic applications. At XDA forum I saw that several people had problems with random shutdowns so I guess it is a software problem and I hope that Samsung is aware of it and will fix it soon. I had two Tab 7 Plus and both had these problems. I had to return the first one because of some screen defects. The second is fine except for the mentioned problem. I can't wait to see ICS on this beast.Update regarding the random shut downs: I find my second tablet once per day shut off. I have to do a reboot (pressing on/off button and the volume rocker) to turn it on again and it doesn't shut off because of an empty battery; I checked that already. I will send this Tab back again. I just haven't decided yet if I will return it for a refund or if I try another exchange. 400 Dollars are too much for a buggy device.Update 11/27/11I decided to return my second Tab too. The random shut downs are bugging me and so far no fix. No statement from Samsung regarding this problem yet. If Samsung will fix this problem I will buy this tablet again, except there will be better ones out.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus vs Kindle Fire vs B&N; Nook", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RFGUD11RMP9Z0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using 10\" tablets and 3.5\"-4.5\" smartphones for the last 18 months. That included iOS and Android OS spread over 6 different devices. But what I was looking for was a compromise between the large, heavy tablets and tiny phones. So I spent the last couple months debating the offerings in the 7\" market.B&N; Nook is rootable and has a good rep in the geek community, but out of the box it lacks too many features (1GB usable storage for non-B&N; content and lacking B&N; content).Kindle Fire almost seduced me, but I canceled my pre-order when I considered the specs. No camera for video chatting, only 8GB storage memory, a funky flipboard-like interface and a limited app store. It's good for beginners and budget conscience, but woefully underpowered for a 10\" veteran tablet user.So I opted for the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. For an extra $200 (over the Kindle Fire), I get two cameras, double the internal memory, a microSD card to add more video content, a working GPS for the car, and a fancy smart remote.The build quality feels secure. Not \"plasticky\" but not unnecessarily heavy either (i.e. no hard chrome backing of the iPad or Asus Transformer). The toughest part of this tablet is the screen. I've used it a week without any case or screen protector and it has not so much as a scratch.So far I'm content with my purchase. Touchwiz seems to work better on my Galaxy SII phone, but it's not horrible. Honeycomb's most annoying feature to me is the always-on menu at the bottom. Adding the screen capture button just guarantees you take lots of unwanted pics. Ice Cream Sandwidth should do away with this problem, as least while watching video.One thing I really appreciate about the 7.0 Tab is how well it retains a charge while in sleep mode. It is comparable to my iPad, able to live off the charger all day and only burn the power I need for use. And that's with GPS on. I wish my Transformer and Galaxy SII did as well.This is a device perfect for someone wants the tablet experience without having to invest in a massive purse or backpack. it does all the Kidnle and Nook do, but with full fledged Android Honeycomb features.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not too big Not too small tablet with all the mostly right features.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TMWGDW4GZZ88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus for a couple of days now, adding apps and tweaking settings and such. I must say, that this is a really nifty tablet. The screen size is right where I want it; big enough to comfortably view websites and small enough to carry around the house and on the go.The tablet is very responsive and the interface navigation and customization via the settings is excellent. The pre-installed software (aka BloatWare) is actually more than half useful and easy to remove from sight, residing in the app section where you never have to see them, but available to use or put back if you change your mind.The screen display is very nice and I suppose if you were to do a side by side comparison with other tablets, you would find that a few of them have better screens that only then would be noticeable, but know this, the screen in the Tab+ easily meets my expectations for a quality display.The camera (front 2 megapixel and rear 3 megapixel) and the video option are simply adequate. Good for Social Media and such, but certainly not a replacement for a good digital camera or smart phone. Does have a flash which is nice.One feature that tilted me toward this tablet was the microSD slot. Being able add and swap out as needed 32gb is pretty sweet.I have two 32gb cards; one with all my music and documents and one that I dedicate for movies and photos. When shopping for any tablet, if you can, try to get one with this feature. You won't regret it.You hear a lot of gas about the Android Marketplace vs. the Apple App Store. I honestly don't care which store has the most apps. What I care about is do they have the apps that I actually use on a daily basis.I would suggest you go to the Android Marketplace via your browser and have a look. It had versions of all the apps that I wanted. Though since I don't game on my tablet, I can't vouch for that aspect.Right now, my apps are a mix of pre-installed and thru the Android Marketplace (both paid and free):Pre-Installed:Amazon Kindle - a few minutes on Amazon and I had it ready for downloading books.Video Player - I may change this out for something else. Still undecided.YouTube - it's there, just in case. You never know when Rebecca Black is going to release a new video.Camera - simple to use, adequate for my needs.  Though I do wish they would have increased the quality.Polaris Office - mobile version of MicrosoftOffice? You can create documents, spreadsheets and slides.Contacts - using the pre-installed; though I imagine that there are fancier ones on the Marketplace.Calendar - same thing, meets my needs, but power users will want to head on over to the Marketplace.Maps - ala google; very handy to have.Of special note:Social Hub - this Samsung App is pretty cool. It's a one stop app for my Facebook and Twitter feeds plus gmail. Two thumbs up.Peel Smart Remote - another feature I was very interested in. Pretty darn easy to set up. Got my HD TV, Audio System and TIVO box dialed in and ready to go in a matter of minutes. Beautiful interface too. But all said and done, a resounding \"Meh\". If you are familiar with the look of NetFlix this is kinda how they did the navigation interface. My deal is that I just want to cut to the chase. My TIVO records all the shows I'm interested in and I use my universal remote to channel surf when I feel the need.  Peel just doesn't quite fit the way I watch T.V. Others may disagree.  Again, really slick interface, just a wrong navigation convention for me.Android Marketplace Apps (paid and free)Dolphin Browser HD - EXTREMELY happy with this browser for the internet. Very speedy, great interface and easy to use. You really need to consider this one.Pulse - Wow. I was able to take all the info websites that I normally visit one at a time and put them all into this newsfeed aggregator. I can get my daily fix of news and information in half the time. You can also separate your feeds into different tabbed sections; News, lifestyle, fun stuff, etc.AutoDesk SketchBook - Great way to sketch out concepts and ideas. Kudos on the interface and ease of use.Skype - Video chat and all of that.RadioScanner - who doesn't want to know what local law enforcement is doing? This app is an absolute 10-34.UNO - a time-waster's dream of card gaming heaven.iHeartRadio - internet radio of ClearChannel stations.SpeedTest - gives you a fair idea of how fast your wifi connection is to your tablet.Of special note:mSecure - way to secure all your logins and passwords into one handy location. You only have to remember one password to get in and from there jump to the various websites that have login screens. The cool thing is that they have Android, Windows, Apple and iPhone versions that can synch with each other via WiFi.Conclusion:This was a big step for me since I have been in the Apple environment pretty much exclusively. I kinda feel like Logan's Run; escaping the Apple BubbleDome to see what the real World is actually like.  Thanks to WiFi, my iMac, iPhone and now my new tablet are best of friends and play well in my own little networked playground.g.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet of 2011, Hands Down!", "Author": "Ted R.

Specs, looks and performance justify the price.", "Author": "Mike E.", "ReviewID": "R1SFQL313FPP4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus two days after it launched from Amazon. Just to start, I own a Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S1)phone and I have tried my friend's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 a couple of times. Those are the only items I can compare on (I know they're not comparable to other tablets similar with the Tab Plus 7.0) but these are just a basis in case you own those devices.Screen:I am just basing this on what it looked like since I am a little bit lazy to research on the exact resolution of each screen. The screen on the Tab 7 Plus is somewhat similar in looks with the 10.1 but falls short when you're used to using a Super AMOLED screen (in my case, my Galaxy1 phone) I see the big difference every time I switch between the tab and my phone. SAMOLED screen is sharper and has very high contrast. But if you haven't owned a device with an amoled screen, you would give this tab's screen 5 stars because it's really good compared to other tablet screens i've seen in Bestbuy.GPS:Very spot on! (at least compared to my Captivate phone which had some issues before I installed a custom firmware on it) I have not tried navigation yet which I know should be the ultimate test on a gps but I walked about a mile with it and seems great to me. \"GPS status\" app from market locks up 12-14 satellites with SNR constant to about 40. But again, I haven't tried yet on how it deals with driving. I will have to give you an update on that..**UPDATE: 11/18. I tried driving for an hour upstate and back using Google Navigation (phone data is tethered to the tab plus, took about 5MB of map data in 2 hours). It's very accurate and responsive. It did not have any problems at all. :)Speed:Dual core SoC Exynos 1.2Ghz.. Very fast! Smooth scrolling and very fluid. One of the reasons why I didn't get the tab 10.1 is for some reason, its scrolling are not that smooth even if I try other launchers. But this tab plus 7.0 really makes the 10.1 look bad when it comes to simply scrolling. Launching apps is very fast as well. I haven't encountered any hiccup within an app. I have yet to try playing graphic intensive games. Will update again..Universal Remote? (Peel SmartRemote App):This is one of the reason why I got this tablet. There are limited tablets out there who has a built-in IR port for controlling Home theater systems. The app is pretty good but I don't think this can replace a Logitech Harmony remote right away since this software is pretty new. Their database for devices is somewhat limited for me. I own an old Samsung 46 inch LCD which the app can control. It can also control my Time Warner cable box and my Denon AVR 1911 receiver (ON/OFF/VOLUME/INPUT SOURCES only. doesn't support all buttons. I love the way Peel displays all the TV shows that are currently. You won't need to browse through the guide on your tv anymore. You can display based on genre (drama, comedy, action, sports etc) and you can even personalize your channels from there. Bottomline, the app is currently good on replacing you TV/Cable remote but is still limited in supporting other remotes. As for streaming players, it only has support for Apple TV and Roku for now. I submitted a request to Peel to support WDTV Live device, let's see how it turns out. By the way, search youtube for \"Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Universal Remote\". Someone did an early post on what the universal remote app looks like.**UPDATE 1/17/2012: I ended up buying a Logitech Harmony 650 for only $49 (sold by Amazon and it's an excellent remote for the price!) because I gave up on the Peel app because the app development is very slow. At the very least, they do reply when you ask for support but I don't think this Smart Remote app is priority to them.WIFI:I get around the max 15Mbps limit on my Speed test app on this comparing to 5Mbps on my Captivate phone connected to 2.4GHz band. I tried the 5Ghz band and had same result for the Tab plus. I guess I have to try another app that would display more accurate results. My point is that it is fast. Browsing is very fast and very smooth. I watch HD trailers on the Movie Fone app and youtube without any hiccup.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Speed definitely varies and has different factors like ISP, router, wifi chipset, CPU specs, OS etc. But I recently noticed that the wifi of this tab has the same performance as my desktop on quadcore proc, 12GB ram, dualband wifi, windows 7 64bit specs. Goes up to 30Mbps (Time Warner turbo boost)on my 15Mbps connection.Camera:Pretty good. 3MP back and 2MP front is enough to take decent pictures and videos. Did Skype a couple of times and they say my video quality on both cams is good. Oh and audio quality is superb and LOUD considering its size!Size and Weight:This is pretty much a perfect balance between a phone and a laptop for me. Fits in your pocket and it's big enough to browse and watch movies. It has a very premium feel. Build quality is awesome.Battery:So far so good. I've only had this for two days, charged a couple of times for a few minutes to an hour but I've only had it charged to 100% once. And battery performance is great!**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Battery has been superb for me lasts about 7-8 hours of almost nonstop use (surfing the web, youtube, music, skyping, streaming videos and downloading files. Battery drain is very little on standby so I won't worry if I don't use it for a couple of days.Overall:This is a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking great looks, performance and portability. For you guys who are used to having super AMOLED screens, you might want to wait for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 version but it will definitely come at a higher price. But I don't think it will be worth it if its price goes $100 higher than the Tab 7.0 Plus. I think I would prefer a 7 inch screen which is just right for one hand. We'll see when the 7.7 gets released.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012- Now that the price for this tab is only $350, I'd forget about the tab 7.7. I am 100% contented with this after almost 3 months of use. I've been using this without any problems at all and it always gives me the best performance regardless of how many apps i throw at it.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you immediately install the Kies program from the Samsung website on to your desktop/laptop and connect it to the Samsung.  The updates made things MUCH better for me and I had the thing 5 days before I did that- notably the annoying AP mobile app that came with it that wouldn't uninstall or move off the home screen until the update.  I have some 4 gigs of ebooks and 10 gigs of audio library, so I immediately got a 16gb MicroSD card for it, giving me a total of 32 gb on the tab.

My only other Android device is an Evo, so it took a bit of getting used to the differences. But I was fully up and running with a complete understanding of the tablet in less than an hour. The only problem I had with it is the Wifi. I don't know if it is is a problem with just the one that I have, or if it is a problem in general.

I also have an iPad2 and an iPod. I tested it against the wireless capabilities on the iPad, iPod, and my Evo, and none of those suffer from the Wifi attenuation like my tab. In areas where the Galaxy Tab could not connect, my other wireless devices showed full signal, and were able to connnect and browse at full speed. I noticed that if I moved my hands a bit around it, I got a better signal. But the signal was the absolute worst when I had both hands holding it at the bottom. That is naturally where I hold a device of this size.  I also tried all of this on two different wireless networks.  Same exact results.I am very sad. I was really looking forward to this purchase. But I have no real use for a tablet with flaky Wifi. I wonder if this is an issue with the positioning of the Wifi antenna, or if it is just a weak antenna. I wonder if it is a problem with all Galaxy Tab 7.0 units, or just the one that I had.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like it, but...", "Author": "D.

The Peel remote works, but doesn't change channels with Tivo (contacted Peel and they said they are working on it).Pros: lightweight, small form factor, nice screen, good viewing angles, netflix appCons: expensive compared to other 7\" models, you have to dig around or use a third party app to close programs, auto-brightness makes the screen too dark, questionable battery life, not all app store apps are available/function on the tab.I bought the Galaxy Tab 7 Plus because I wanted a smaller, lighter tablet (I have iPad 1). I also wanted an Android with a webcam. I love the size and weight. It is perfect for thumb typing- much easier than on my Galaxy phone. Glad to see Netflix is supported. The battery drains quite a bit faster compared to my 1.5 year old iPad. With moderate use (web-browsing, email, installing programs) I can see needing a charge after about 4-5 hours.This isn't a complaint against the Galaxy Tab, but be aware that it is not easy to find tablet sized apps in the Android app store like you can for the iPad. Thankfully, the 7\" screen makes this more like a giant phones so you don't notice it as much.

I spend untold hours searching and reading reviews on all the available 7-8 inch tabs, and viewed many video reviews as well.  Looked at the main contenders, including the HTC Flyer, Acer Iconia a100, Kindle Fire, BB Playbook, Sony, as well as the \"cheapie\" Chinese versions of tablets that are flooding the market.  This seemed to be the best rated overall, with the only real downside being the $400 price tag, in light of the supposed Galaxy 7.7 somewhere on the horizon.  Didn't want to wait for the 7.7, which would appear to be the best, but at present it is non-existent.  The Plus as mentioned is very fast, easy to use, and quite intuitive, especially for those of us with Android phone experience.  The WiFi is strong and connects easily, and from a great distance.  I have not had issues as some have had here, with dropped connections.  Bought a Roo leather cover which is nice, and an Ankor dock for bedside.  Still learning what apps are best for tablet use and experimenting.  All the basics--Pandora, Facebook and other social media on the Social Media Hub, TuneIn Radio, Droid AntiVirus, etc., all work great.  The few tablet games I've downloaded all work great, but I haven't dabbled too much in them yet.  One VERY cool app that I have on my Android phone is SplashTop, where I can access fully my computer at home through my phone, which works ok with 3G, but great if connected to WiFi.  Since I already had a SplashTop account on my home computer, I was able to add the SplashTop app at no extra charge to my Plus as well!  And it works even better on the Tab.  SplashTop allows you to fully access your home PC, for example, and use it remotely.  It plays back sound and video through the Plus (or through an Android phone).  As well as it worked with my phone, it's several times better, and faster, with the Galaxy Plus.  That this works so smoothly is important to me for several reasons, not the least of which is that I can now (well, when the season starts) view MLB games through my Galaxy Tab Plus without needing to pay for another app!  I get the full slate of MLB games viewable live on any computer through my MLB.TV account, so I can access the games on the home computer, and watch them on my Galaxy Plus....wherever I am and wherever I have a WiFi connection!  This is very cool.  I can even set my Tab on my bedside dock and keep an eye on the games there, without lugging around my laptop.  Obviously, you can use the SplashTop connectivity to your other computers any way you want--this is just an example on how one use benefits me personally.  And yes, it does play stereo sound from your PC to your Galaxy Tab!  Sorry, didn't want this to become a review of a cool app, but using this particular cheap app dramatically increases my utility and use of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.  And now I'm even less likely to drag my laptop around anymore, since I can just access it directly through SplashTop on my Tab, when necessary.There really isn't any obvious downside that I see to the Plus, which in my opinion is worth the extra $100 over other 7-inchers.  Most of the pluses and minuses have been discussed already below, and you should read through them all (as I did).  Maybe not enough ports--when you connect the Tab via HDMI adapter to an HD TV for example, you then have no way to keep it charging while used in that fashion.  I think there is a docking station that allows for this, but not sure.  I have not as yet used the Tab in this fashion.  The Peel remote seems like it could be useful and a nice extra function, but the selection of TV's and DVD and stereo connectivity devices is still very lacking--it couldn't find my Zenith media center with surround sound that I have connected to my 42-inch screen, so I couldn't use the Peel universal remote.  But this app seems to be still in development, so I'll reserve judgment on that for now.  Bluetooth is nice, and have had no difficulty in beaming pictures from my phone to the Tab, even where I have no WiFi, obviously.  I do wish there was a way to tether it to my work computer at the office, for instance (I don't have WiFi there), so I can access the internet that way.  Maybe there is a way to do that--I haven't seen it.Anyway, buy with confidence.  Or wait until the 7.7 comes out.  I'll probably eventually get that one, in a couple of years, and after they iron out any bugs with that new product, but I expect this one to keep me entertained for a couple of years.  And yes, Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus IS getting the Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade--there was some confusion on this when CNET posted that the Galaxy Tab and the Galaxy S line of phones would NOT be getting the ICS upgrade.

At that time, my overall opinion was \"No, I would not recommend this to a friend.\"  However, with the recent upgrade (FINALLY) to the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system (4.0.4), the problems have ALL been fixed.When I spoke with Samsung back in March they refused to even acknowledge the so-called \"Sleep of Death\" issue.  This is despite the fact that it has been well documented all over the internet; any search will turn it up in seconds.  I am now COMPLETELY HAPPY with this product.  I love it and I use it all the time.  I actually loved it, more or less, prior to this upgrade, although it annoyed me regularly.  I see now that I had forced myself to become complacent with the problem.I use my Galaxy Tab extensively for scheduling and personal management; I have used it for playing audiobooks while driving; for reading ebooks in both epub and pdf format; for surfing the web; for reading and composing email; for taking pictures and video; for streaming music; and for playing games.The available apps in the android market (now known as the Google Play Store) are plentiful and totally satisfactory.  There are apps and widgets for nearly anything.  When I search for a particular type of application I am always presented with many matches from which to choose.  More apps are being added all the time.I would now HIGHLY recommend this tablet to a friend.Frank===== MY ORIGINAL REVIEW - NOW OUTDATED =======================================February 8, 2012I just received this tablet for Christmas. The good: The physical design of the tablet is perfect for my needs. I wanted a tablet that I could read books on, plus surf the web, do email, etc. I found that a larger tablet would be uncomfortable to hold for a long period of time. I also wanted this tablet because it has a MicroSD card slot. The tablet is perfectly responsive, even with a screen protector. It's nice and bright, although I find I have to decrease the brightness when running on battery.And now the bad news. Almost immediately, I began experiencing a problem. When the device goes into sleep mode, it will randomly shut down. TOTALLY. After experimenting I eventually found that pressing the power button for about 15 seconds would restart it. So, sleep mode is somewhat useless. This happens a couple of times a day or more. After researching this issue online, I discovered MANY people having this issue. It has been dubbed \"Sleep of Death\". Unfortunately, Best Buy won't help me so now I will have to start dealing with Samsung. Stay tuned - if I get this fixed I'll update this review.A new problem today - it locked up upon recovering from the \"sleep of death\" issue. It was stuck on the \"Samsung Galaxy Tab\" splash screen. I could turn it off, but it would come back to the same screen. After working with it for about 20 minutes, it restarted - in recovery mode. Luckily most of the apps were backed up to my Google account, so they restored automatically. Not so my wallpapers, other settings, etc. Don't know if this is an isolated problem or not.Pros: Built-in speakers, Bright display, Realistic color, Lightweight, microsd card slotCons: buggy", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "amazing device... great for kids... great to put in my coat pocket", "Author": "Jeff Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R2GHE02I6IGWSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 1 - SEPT 2012:They released Android's Ice Cream Sandwich for this device and if the device wasn't nice before it is even nicer.

My first thought was to purchase an I-Pad as I have owned and still do own two I Pods. Yet, when I did some research, I discovered the I-Pad was lacking in some items which are important to me... 1) Size, (yes, I KNOW size isn't everything!) at  7.4 inches it fits perfectly in my hands, a 10 inch tablet would have been just too much like a net book, for my taste. 2) Portability, I can slip this in to my purse or a pocket, additionally the android system is very user friendly and has really, really nice functionality. 3) The View, (no, not the TV show, \"Hi Whoopi\") The screen is sharp, the colors vivid, I can adjust the brightness to my liking, day or night (it is sometimes a tad too bright at night, even on low, but a scarf, gives what I need) 4) Flash, Apple does not support the Adobe Flash player. The player is needed for a number of application and to not have that available on the go is for me a deal breaker in a portable unit. Of course I have \"worked around\" that problem with my pods, but if I'm going to pay almost $400.00 for a \"mini computer\" I WANT my Flash player!But I digress, I have found what I want in this tablet, I wish the 32GB had been available (and in my price range) but I can add 16GB to my current 16GB Galaxy and have 32GB so I'll deal.The ONLY down side, for me, is the location of the on/off button.

The operating system (Honeycomb 3.2) is a great upgrade from Froyo and Gingerbread that I experienced on the original Tab.  Apps are nice, and the Samsung proprietary layers work well on the device.One down side is the Peel component of the device.  Either the Infrared port is weak or the Peel app is not functioning properly.  More often than not, even after extensive time in customizing the setup, the wrong signals are sent to my entertainment system.  This is especially frustrating since I also have a Samsung plasma TV and Samsung blue ray player.  Both products are models less than a year old, so they should work seamlessly, one would think.Otherwise, I use the device for email (Gmail and Exchange), browsing, and many apps including fun games, widgets, and productivity-based apps.  Most work great, and those that do not appear not to be the fault of the Tab.  For work, leisure, and portability, this is a great tablet!I am looking forward to purchasing the custom Samsung keyboard dock for this unit when it becomes available (still listed as \"back ordered\" on the Samsung site and not available at Amazon yet).  I bought the original Tab OEM keyboard and it absolutely changed how I used the device.  The fully customized keyboard from Samsung turns the tablet into a productivity machine!  I will highly recommend that product, as well.  Even at $90 MSRP it is worth it.Speaking of cost, I value the use of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.  The price, though, is a little high compared to other tablets like the Kindle Fire.  I paid $400, and it was tough to do so especially after having just bought the original Tab last year.

Their phones and tablets (and TVs) have been nothing short of amazing. And the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is no exception.Despite the similar weight and measurements to the original Galaxy Tab 7.0, the Plus is a completely different tablet. The bulky and squarish designs are gone. The Plus now resembles the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which is still the best looking Android tablet in my opinion. It's very light and thin. The screen is fantastic with the right amount of saturation and contrast. Very responsive as a touchscreen as well.A big bonus is the Infrared Transmitter which transforms your tablet into a great all-in-one remote with the right software. I tried Samsung's pre-installed software and while it does work great, it's a bit slow. Perhaps there are better alternatives on the market.So we know the Plus is a great tablet, but is the operating system up to snuff? Well, yes and no. It's running Honeycomb, so at least we're not using an antiquated phone OS on a tablet. Everything's in high resolution as it should be. However, HC is not Ice Cream Sandwich. There's no support for hardware acceleration. At times, the OS can be quite sluggish and unresponsive. The good news? This can be easily fixed with an ICS update from Samsung. The bad news? Samsung are well-known for their poor and slow update roll-out. It's been over half a year since ICS was officially released and their flagship devices (AT&T; GSII, Galaxy Tab 10.1 etc) are still waiting for an update. Yes, it will come, but might still take a while.Another big question is whether or not anybody should still buy this tablet now that there are cheaper alternatives? Maybe... The Kindle Fire and Nook are in in a different class since unless you're willing to hack your devices, you won't get a true Android experience. They also lack GPS and expansion slots. Now the only available competitor is Samsung's very own Galaxy Tab 2.0, which is at least $50 cheaper (I actually got my Plus for $270 so it's not really a big deal). Even if the price difference was minimal, I think I would pick the Galaxy Tab 2.0 this time around. Why? It comes with ICS out of box. That is its selling point. ICS is just so much better than any previous Android release. That being said, if you can pick up the Plus for less than the 2.0, it's still a great deal. The Plus is slightly lighter, and slightly faster processor.

(get a class 6 micro SD card)Noticeably faster than the 10.1 with the Samsung 1.2G dual processor rather than the 1.0 Tegra.GPS (using NAVFREE USA from the Marketplace) works like a charm without a data connection.Set up like a phone with an earpiece and mic for occasional Skype calls.Battery life decent if you turn off wifi when not online and the auto synch apps and only enable those periodically. Put it to sleep with the power switch and it will sit all day with no noticeable battery drain. Charges in a few hours. (Still wish it had the larger battery used in the 7.7.)Vivid screen- no bad pixels.Sound is impressive for a tiny device- much better than my Asus eee Netbook.I repeat- FAST. Boots fast too without a hitch.Strong wifi, but see below.Samsung 1-800 support very good if you get a good line- you get techs in S. Carolina who are very courteous and run off to get you an answer if they do not know- no bluffing.NEUTRALKnow beforehand that this tablet is optimized for use in portrait mode like a cell phone, although it does auto rotate to landscape (essential for Angry Birds). That is the price I was willing to pay for a manageable jacket-pocket/ glove-compartment size. So using it in landscape presents a few problems- the stereo speakers are both on your right (where the logo is) and your fingers obstruct the ambient light sensor near the earpiece causing the screen brightness to jump up and down. So use external speakers or headphones and turn off auto-brightness. I loaded an app called Display Brightness 2.4 that puts a transparent slider bar on any screen edge so you can adjust the screen manually without opening the settings menu. Not listed as CONS because the device IS optimized for portrait mode- it is what it is. The \"Pulse\" web aggregator used in text mode (rather than web mode, selectable at the top) is splendid in portrait mode- it gives you book-like text on white with pictures and no side bars, no banners, and no ads. You can customize it with so many feeds that it alone is worth the price of the device. You might even stop using a browser.CONSThese took a long time to figure out, but once you know, they are not real Cons anymore:* If you put your music library on the removeable SD card and plug it in, don't expect the music player to find them without a little work. It seems that Samsung used the same coding in this device as it did in the 10.1 (according to Samsung support) and since the 10.1 does not have an external SD card, the software isn't looking for one. With a file browser you can insert a \"jump point\" on the internal SD card going to the external SD card, and it is not hard to do. I wrote a forum post on how to do it at:[...]* The wifi is strong, connects instantly, and is as fast as my hard wired system. But after a week or so, you will lose your connection and be unable to connect again to the same (your home) network. This is because that routers are DHCP- they only lease your device an IP address that they change later. But the Galaxy tabs take note of the initial IP address and the MAC address (the serial number) of the router that issued it and remember it. When your router gives you a new IP address later, the tablet ignores it and uses the one it logged in. The explanation is long and tedious,and it is unclear whether the problem is more from Android than Samsung since the web is full of people looking for solutions with other tablets as well. But the solution when you get locked out is to delete the old connection info in the tab and give it a new STATIC IP address. Samsung's website tells you how to do it and the phone support people do as well. It seems from my testing that the Static IP is only static on your own network. You can still go to a public place and log on to their network with DHCP, at least until it boots you off as well. If it does, there will probably be an update by then or another workaround. I don't think you can escape this by buying another brand, so if you want a tablet, you have to live with it and grow as Android grows.ONE REAL CONI think the internal compass on mine is 4 or 5 degrees off, even after factoring the declination offset.

Radio.com does not work well at all and tv.com is in the same boat.  Unless the app is specific to tablets you could have problems.  I had a little trouble with Weatherbug but it is usable.  All of the above apps run fine on my HTC Android smart phone.  Thirdly,if you are listening to music or listening to audio on a web page and navigate away from that screen to another screen the audio will stop.  Otherwise apps like iHeart radio and Tunein radio work well.  The tablet is very fast.  I think faster than the Tegra2 tablets.  The screen is more than bright enough so don't believe what you read in other reviews.  I wish it used a micro usb for charging.  The proprietary charger connector looks suspiciously like that used for ipads. I checked and they look identical but the pin outs are different.  The camera is a bit weak at 3 MP but I have an 8 MP cell phone camera so that is not a deal breaker.  Oh yes, Skype works well with the built in mic and speakers but not well with head phones either bluetooth or the ones supplied with the tablet.

My needs were a product that could handle all of my media play, portability, little to no restriction in terms of browsing, video chat through both gchat and Skype and document editing through office and adobe. I had the kindle app on my Xoom and downloaded it on the tab, it works fine at accessing my books, although there is a page turning glitch which I noticed someone else mention where if you tap the margin on the tab, it advances two pages in stead of one. That's annoying, but the slide page turn works as normal. Now the Tab is small, so of you have big old fingers you might want to think about a ten inch (my dad prefers the size of his Xoom to my Tab). In terms of document editing, polaris office is very good. Input methods indigenous to the Tab include Swype which is what won Samsung a guinness record for fastest text message sent I think. I can see why - Swype is very very fast, although, if you notice a really interesting spluttering or grammar mistake, or just a comical use of a particular word, it's probably because I'm using Swype right now. It puts the website \"damn you autocorrect!\" Into perspective. You should definitely check your completed compositions before you send. Another little glitchy thing is that I actually had to delete one of my email accounts from the Tab email client because it was just not a reliable feed of those emails. This is an email account from a university, managed by Google so I don't know of there's any significance to that, but accessing gmail works fine on my Tab, so I just use that. The picture quality on video is good, although it isn't very loud, I find myself having to wear head phones even when alone in my bedroom. Skype works as well as Gchat for video which I'm happy about, because Xoom didn't.

At all (in fact, it is rated as \"Garbage\" on the Wine site).Thank goodness there is a card slot, otherwise I'd just return the tablet.

I am absolutely thrilled with it - another one batted out of the ballpark by Samsung.  I owned the 2010 Galaxy Tab and sold it because it was disappointing - thick, heavy, crude looking interface, low-quality display (I had the wi-fi version), you-name-it.  The 7.0 plus is a drastic improvement - truly beautiful display and is is much thinner and lighter.  Besides the display - and faster processor - I think Honeycomb is at least an order of magnitude better than the old version.  It is fast, the apps - especially e-mail, are better organized and run very quickly.  I haven't tested all of my game apps yet - but Plants vs Zombies runs very well and it runs faster on the 7.0 Plus than it does on both of my 2010 Android phones.  Truth be told - there are a couple of things which I don't like though.  First - Samsung has stuck with their proprietary connector.  Some might say - so what - Apple uses a proprietary connector too.  But, you can find an Apple connector in many, many different stores - not the case with the Samsung cable/connector.  And, for a device costing as much as this, I am disappointed with the rear-facing camera. Come on, Samsung, the *Phone had a 3.0 megapixel camera in 2009 - here it is almost 2012!!  Last but not least, GLONASS GPS support is becoming more common - the 7.7 Plus (if it ever comes to fruition!) will have GLONASS support but the 7.0 Plus does not.

If you have larger hands, which I do, then you can easily thumb type the landscape mode on this keybord with both thumbs.

I owned an iphone 3G, then the original Droid slider, and now an iphone 4S.  What keeps me with Apple is the fact that the interface is very consistent, the programs interact with the interface in a very common manner, and everything works seamlessly.  Android, with its openess, invites variation and clunkiness.  Programs crash, some things are not intuitive, and sometimes things just look bad.  Forunately Samsung's interface makes up for some of this, but there is still some left to be desired.  The android market is also void of most of the great programs available on the itunes marketplace.

I found typing on the tablet to be a pleasure, too!We have/had the following tablets in our home and will rank them accordingly:1) iPad 2 <still own>2) iPad 1 <sold>3) Nook Color/Tablet and Kindle Fire <tie and we still have both>4) Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus <returned>5) Samsung Galaxy Tab (the original 7 inch launched a year ago) <sold to friend and still going strong>6) Asus Transformer (the original that was release in 2011) <returned because it was bulky and reading PDF's and ereaders in vertical mode was distorted>7) Samsung Galaxy 8.9 <returned - very buggy and horrible lag>Personally, I think the 7 inch form factor is the best for travel.  The iPad 2 is just a tad large when traveling on a plane; however, it is great for reading PDF documents more so than a 7 inch form factor.  I am looking forward to the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 when it comes to the US.  Also, if Apple comes out with a 7 inch tablet, I will be first in line.I am a Project Manager for a software company, so I love technology; however, it has to be functional and if it collects dust due to lack of use, it will be sold.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is functional, but the display is lacking and not the best for Kindle or Nook books using the apps in the Google Market.

Now i'm so mad at Samsung for their super mediocre costumer and website support, that i was planning on purchasing one of the new Tab 2 that just came out for my father, but i'm going to look at other brands.Problems: First, this tablet was sold and advertised from amazon as a tablet that would receive an update to the ne Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwish) the thing is that 3 months later no such update ever occured. The battery life on this device don't last even a half of what they claim. The screen is not bight enough to look at outside in a porch per say, not to mention on a sunny day under a shadow next to sunlight. The cable that came with it is way too short, and brakes pretty fast, mine broke the plastic sleeve right where the 30 pin connector is, exposing the metal wires, and now the tablet  wont charge with that cable. I went to the samsung website, created an account, registered my tablet with them, and right when i tried to use the warranty for the cable problem, now all of the sudden, the website says that i'm entering the wrong serial number when they found it very well at the time of registration, that is so frustrating, anyone would expect a lot better from a a company selling a device for more than $400 Anothe problem, the tablet gets really warm on the back after like 3 minutes of use, and the interface is not smooth at all, it freezes and stutters.Final thought, they may have got me once, but certainly it wont happen twice. It's really a shame for a company this size.Amazon on the other hand is a great company, but sometimes sells products with false advertisement and product description, like what i mentioned a the begening of this review.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "7\" GALAXY PLUS TABLET", "Author": "BADWOOF", "ReviewID": "R1Q9N67HOUTLLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned an HP tablet, Nook Color and an iPad 1.

This Tablet has expandable memory and you can buy the cable to hook up to HDMI. Also when you plug USB into your computer, it recognizes it immediately for transfering files onto the microSd in the tablet or into the tablets memory.Pros:-Customizable-Very Good Speed, ie Browser and Opening Apps-Amazing Picture Quality by Samsung as usual.-Comes with a program similar to office already preloaded for documents, spreadsheets, etc.-Unlike Apple, when you transfer files, you rarely have to convert them to other formats. I have AVI files that go right onto the tablet and I can play through a downloaded app from Android market. It has all necessary codecs.-Using DoubleTwist you can set your tablet up with an Itunes similar program.-Slightly smaller than Ipad so easier to carry around.Cons:-There are a lot less apps on here than on an Apple. ie. Scrabble with Friends.-Using Optimum app on Android, you cannot watch live TV, where as I can watch TV on my iphone with the same app.-Peel app is pretty bad. I got it to hook up to my TV, but the IR capabilities aren't easy to work with. It makes a poor universal remote. If they did not put so much other stuff into the app and made it solely a remote it probably would have worked better. You shouldn't buy a tablet if you want a universal remote though.

It is more powerful then the Galaxy tab 3, the only advantage of the Galaxy tab 3 seems to be it is a bit lighter, which is better for reading books, and for watching net flix movies. Also the newer Galaxy tab has usb instead of propriety.

It came with 5 free books! and I bought a Zondervan red letter edition King James Bible for $4.00! I down loaded an Adobe Acrobat reader that works flawlessly.

I have played around with other tablets but this is the first one I've owned and will review it based on that.While I have seen the convenience of owning tablets in person now, I've never wanted to spend too much money on something that is neither too portable to be a phone/portable media player nor large enough and lacking features to be a full-on computer. A week or so before the keynote for the iPad 3, this one got to a sweet spot of $300 that I found was fair enough. The price has gone back up ever since though.The Galaxy Tab 7+ has an amazing size that makes it portable enough to carry around pretty much everywhere you go. Not sure if you have giant pockets but at least your backpack, handbag or maybe even just holding it with a fancy, discreet case will do. And yet the screen is still big enough to enjoy all your media. The tab has a perfect weight too. It feels heavy enough to not feel cheap and fragile, though still you don't want to drop this one. Better get a case for it asap.The tab has great features that make it ubber versatile, such as Front and rear cameras so you can take pictures and do video-calling, led Flash, Flash support on web browsing, microSD card slot for memory expansion, and more. It's great for playing music, videos, web browsing, playing games, messaging and pretty much all the Android Market.. sorry, Google Play store allows you to do.Most of the flaws that I have found with this tablet are more software than hardware related, which is both fortunate and unfortunate. I don't know what it is, but Samsung keeps releasing Galaxy hardware everytime someone in Korea sneezes, but they have their Android OS updates all messed up and neglected. Honeycomb is great and all but I somehow feels that is buggier and is lacking features from Gingerbread. Not that these can't be fixed, but I don't see the intention to do so really. And sadly, one of the features I was looking forward to using the most, the IR sensor built in the tablet, is practically useless not because it actually isn't useful, but rather cause there are NO good apps to take advantage of it. I mean Peel gets promoted as it was great and all, but its not. It sucks.So yeah overall this tab is excellent. It will run many apps very smoothly and its a perfect size to take everywhere with you. If only the Android OS got the updates it needed on time, it would be even better. And also, I wouldn't pay too much money for it.

It's nice to be able to read a book, watch a video clip, or listen to music while waiting for an appointment or just filling in a few spare minutes.The only small quibbles I have are the placement of the on\\off button and the volume button (they're right where I tend to grip the tablet), and the lack of a standard mini\\micro USB port.Samsung has done a great job on this one.  It's the best 7 inch tablet on the market now, and if you are looking for a quality small tablet the Tab 7 Plus will not disappoint you.F De Vore", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware and features!!", "Author": "Moises G Carvalho", "ReviewID": "R2CV65R7TMN6X9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What is good:- 7' fits my jeans pocket and light weight;- Fast hardware;- Nice finishing;- Infrared feature is really fun to play with;- Android; (of course, I'll root it and put other roms .. ;))- External SD Card;- Battery capacity;What could be better:- Better cameras (at least 5 MP at rear)- 30-pin interface for the usb cable (why not stick to the mini and micro standards ports in the device?)- Higher screen resolution (it's not bad at all..  but could really be higher)In a nutshell: Comparing with other 7's, this is far the best.

Now I am a little sorry I didn't wait, but perhaps this is the fate of anyone who jumps into a market that is being flooded with new releases from many manufacturers.  I won't go into a long or technical discussion of all of its features; that is already well-covered in various reviews and forums.  I did do my research before buying, and at the time this was one of the best-reviewed tablets out there.  I had my heart set on a non-propietary Android tablet that had access to the Android market.  I wanted to be able to read, watch shows, and explore the world of apps on a high quality device that would provide a minimum of 2-3 years of service.  The Samsung Galaxy tablet seems to do well in all those categories.  So I will just share a few observations about this device, some of which will hopefully be helpful.- The touch screen is very responsive, and image quality is very satisfactory.- I came fairly close to getting a Nook and rooting/unlocking it, which a friend of mine had done, but decided to put down some more money and not risk damaging the machine and voiding the warranty.- I am not happy with Samsung's support.  Shortly after getting it, I was told to update the firmware, but in order to do this, Samsung sticks you with some spyware.  Is there somebody out there selling Android devices and apps that are free of spyware?  If so, they are laying low, and I can only guess that the public has agreed to play along in order to enjoy the many benefits that Android systems offer.  The last time I decided to cave in and let them spy on me, but the update did not take.- I don't use the thing as much as I thought I would.  It is most useful to bring along when I am going out of town.  I don't particularly like using it on trains and buses, or carrying it around in a shoulder bag or backpack, due to the fact that I spent around $400 for it, and would not like to see it get lost or stolen.  It has not put an end to my reading of magazines and books, or watching television, or using a desktop computer.  For me, the smartphone has been a more revolutionary device, since it does everything a tablet does, and also makes telephone calls and sends text messages, and it fits into a pants pocket.  Now if the price for reliable service would only drop a little... But the tablet is basically a big smartphone that you can't call anybody on.  I have not tried using it for video chat yet, but I would like to.- Wifi is often a hassle.  For some reason it seems to have problems finding good wifi and remembering passwords.  It can take several tries to get it working, but before you reach that point your attention may be wandering.  I look forward to the day when cheap, metered data plans are common, or free wifi is easier to use.- If anyone has comments / ideas / suggestions for me or wants to share their Galaxy Tab experiences with me, then let me know.

Found myself having to charge it quite often.  I put it in power saving mode and accepted the dimmer screen in order to save on battery-life.  Grew close to this tablet.  Using it became part of my daily routine.A couple of days ago, I turned on my tablet and there was red \"x\" and lightening bolt on the battery icon.  I clicked \"settings\" and then \"battery\" to see what it was.  It said it was charging when it wasn't even plugged to the adapter to be charged (I use the adapter that came with the product to a wall outlet).  I did numerous searches on this and grew aggravated because there was little on this.I kept running into so-called fixes for a Galaxy Tab phone and the battery needing to be replaced!  It is not a phone, it is a tablet.  There is no way for a customer to insert a new battery on this tablet.  I went to the Samsung site to see if there was anything on this in Troubleshooting.  There was nothing.  I spoke to a Tech via Chat on their page and that wasn't helpful at all.  The tech was friendly, though. She suggested I do a factory restore but that meant losing all of my pictures.  She said I wouldn't but when I was about to clear All data a warning window came up saying that I was indeed going to lose all files. So, I did NOT clear all data.  Aren't techs suppose to know this?!Then I thought about mailing the tablet to their service center (the nearest service center is in Texas. I am in NY)...but I saw complaints about that (hacking into personal accounts.  tablets being returned with even more problems).  This is a new tablet that cost over $400!!!  I am so upset.  I don't want to be charged extra if they assume it is a hardware malfunction. I don't want to lose my tablet.It still works even if there is a red \"x\" and lightening bolt on the battery icon.  Sometimes it says it is charging when it is NOT connected to adapter to be charged. Other times it says it is discharging.  When I do need to charge the tablet, it doesn't make that sound that it, normally, made when it is about to be charge. I miss that sound. I want my tablet to go back to normal!  It is no longer on power saving mode bc the tablet thinks it is being charged.  When I am about to power down the tablet the giant battery icon switches from 100% to 80%, back and forth. It used to just show the amount of batter life left on the tablet with out switching like that.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know if my tablet is slowly dying.  I don't want to send it off to Texas to be fixed.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect-Sized Tablet for Entertainment,  Needs Ice Cream Sandwich to make it even better", "Author": "Life Aquatic \"life aquatic\"", "ReviewID": "R2QF0IDN7P250T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pro: Hardware - great tablet for pure enjoyment of multimedia (youtube videos, games, and web). The screen quality is fantastic, videos look really sharp. The 7-inch form factor is perfect for holdling it with one hand (although it is a bit slippery at times).  After purchasing this,  I hardly ever use my Ipad2 anymore, which is more geared toward being used as a laptop (i.e. for word-processing, etc).Con: Software can be a lot better to match the hardware.  Honeycomb is great, but it needs to be even more customizable in my opinion.  Tinkering with the vertical wallpaper setting for the lock screen can be annoying as the manual border selection is horizontally-based (why can't you just display a portrait wallpaper as is?)  The apps are hit-or-miss on the android market.  A lot of them seem to be questionable-quality (read their comments,  many of them say they have flagrant advertisements or access to private stored info).  The galaxy tab plus is the PERFECT size to play games, but there are very few of legitimate ones compared to the Apple games.  Live wallpaper is pretty cool - my favorite being the matrix and the cosmos background.  Youtube also has some quirks - every time you change the screen orientation, the video restarts, which is annoying.  Also,  full-screen mode for a youtube video has a single horizontal orientation (with the samsung logo on your right side),  so if you happen to be holding the tab with the logo on your right,  the video does not flip itself,  mildly annoying.  Hopefully Ice Cream Sandwich will prove to be an improvement.Overall, I would highly recommend this tablet.  The 7-inch is the \"sweet-spot\" between the smartphones and the full-size tablets.  Samsung has created a solid product that rivals the Apple line.

I believe only inherent flaws should lower the rating of a device, or misleading advertising, not personal preferences that are known before purchasing the device.  With that in mind:These tablets are amazing, especially the 5-7 inch ones.  These are a game changer, more so than the 10-inch devices, because of their extreme portability, or, more specifically, their holdability or pocketability.  These are so much easier to use than a desktop computer with all the delays in starting up, etc., and being confined to a chair in a sitting position.  One big difference between the 5 and 7 inch tablets is, more is displayed \"at a glance\" on the 7-inch device, it's more visually rich and exciting, so the inclination is to buy the 7-inch device (like the Galaxy Player 7 Plus), it is holdable and a good impression is made in the store.  BUT - it's weight becomes a problem for extended periods of reading.  Holdability is an important property for these small tablets, and I discovered I could hold the 5-inch Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 (5-inch) device endlessly, whether standing, sitting, or lying down.  One needs to be able to hold the device in 1 hand while gesturing with the other, rather than cradle the device with both hands, which you almost have to do with the 7-inch device.What's surprising is how a 5-inch display can deliver so much!  I wouldn't have expected it, and the 5-inch model fits in a shirt pocket!  It's both holdable and pocketable.  It displays full web pages (in landscape), and text is very easily resized by pinching then tapping for almost all web sites (and most text based apps).  The 5-inch Galaxy Player also has a micro SD slot (max 32GB) but not the 4-inch. I could go on, but the point is, the Galaxy series delivers 100%.  The 5-inch model is simply more holdable, in my opinion, than the 7-inch Galaxy Player 7 Plus, but that's a preference that doesn't diminish the 5-stars of the 7-inch \"Plus\" model.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad product up grade.", "Author": "Bigdog", "ReviewID": "R15ZUNRE70ESNN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The previous owner changed the platform so nothing wants to run correctly.

Then put the WiFi settings for it to sleep/switch off when screen is off, in case it was the reason for battery drain. Charged and left it overnight again. Same thing. Needed a hard reset again in the morning and battery was down to about 40% although I had left it fully charged in night. This was at work. So I took the tablet home to see if it would behave differently. Same problem the third time. Also, WiFi was connected to my secure home network in night, but the tablet refused to connect to it in the morning (after freezing and losing more than half of battery power in the night), although my Motorola phone had no trouble doing so (meaning there was no problem with the network). So I am not sure if the problem is with the WiFi, or battery, or something else.

When I see the Galaxy Tab 7+, I compare it to the iPad, iPod Touch, and Galaxy Tab 8.9. The 7+ is less expensive than the iPad because it is smaller. It is more expensive than the iPod touch because it is larger and better. Its price relative to the 8.9 is perfect in my opinion. I think this is an excellent device with the perfect size and ample features. The expandable microsd slot sold it to me over the iPod touch which I have now, and the large screen that is still pocketable is a no-brainer. Stop comparing this to the wrong products.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lost function in less than 3 hours of use", "Author": "unhappy", "ReviewID": "R1A28M76YOYURE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do a lot of research before purchasing anything.  Thought the Galaxy Tab 7.0 was the best item available, it was in our price range and had the features we were looking for.  Received tablet on tuesday, downloaded a couple of apps, 1 book, some music and a movie.  Found several quirks such as motion sensor on screen didn't always work, seemed very slow in downloading and syncing to another device, several times the screen lock for security didn't work, and the web browser frustrated my wife to no end.  Sitting in an airport on thurs, the Tab crashed.  Called tech support and went thru their checklist finally trying a hard boot.  Nothing worked.  They said our only option was to send it back to them, shipping label provided, once received they will determine if they can fix it or just send us a new one.  On vacation with multiple layovers what good does this do us.  This is our first Android device, not excited.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a comparison of iPad 2", "Author": "Foziakauser", "ReviewID": "R620IPVT8MEYP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have iPad 2 and as everyone knows iPad dont play flash. I wanted to have something which I can play each and everything for which i need flash too. I liked the idea of having a small size 7.0 as I already have iPad and 7.0 can be a good option which I can carry in my purse with me. But totally disappointed!!! The screen is not so sensitive, had to touch more than 3 times, volume is so low. I can't even voice chat on Skype. Battery life is not good if I watch video its gone within 2-3 hours. Browser got hang and forced closed many times in a single day urghh.

Having the internal sd is the reason I chose this over the 8.9 (a size I would prefer).3.

That's why I went for the tablet, hoping that a bigger battery would mean longer battery life. It seems very well made, with a nice screen and is fast. However, the speakers are about the quality of a $5 radio and the headphones cut out with the slightest movement of the tablet. It wasn't the headphones themself because I tried a pair of my own and had the same problem.
