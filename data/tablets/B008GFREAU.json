{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Thoughts (Typed Using The Kindle Fire HD 8.9)", "Author": "Rick Mallory Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2VX6G023G4D9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying that I am new to the tablet world and have had no experience using any tablets prior to this purchase. That being said, I spent a great deal of time fishing around through reviews and specs of what seemed like countless tablets for months. The obvious cliche conclusion led to all fingers pointing at some variation of an iPad, yet for me, I do not see much sense in purchasing a tablet (regardless of brand) for around the same price as a cheap yet descent laptop that will have more potential.Enter the Kindle Fire HD.I will spare you the story on my process of how I ended up choosing a Fire HD and get right to what you all want to know: my thoughts and experience thus far with the product.Picture: (10/10)I will start with this since obviously that was the first thing i noticed. In a word, incredible. Now its not \"eye popping\" or anything out of this world, but i can honestly say it exceeded my expectations and i was (and continue to be) impressed by this piece of hardware's capabilities. I tested out just a few minutes of  TV shows, trailers, videos, and films from Prime Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Flixster, and Youtube (through the web browser since an app is currently unavailable) and everything looks as it should (and beautiful to boot)! Books come out crisp as well (both in text and picture) and the same goes for basic website visuals, apps, and games. Overall I am very impressed.Sound: (10/10)This is probably where i was most impressed. I have seen some of the reviews on here that are 3 stars or less putting down the audio or claiming they don't hear the big deal. Not to be a jerk or anything but i recommend those people check in at an ear clinic and have their hearing tested. I was literally amazed at how I was hearing sounds from various distances and angles. From up close it felt like i was hearing a high quality home theater system and not just for one flick but everything. From website audio to music, Netflix to Audiobooks, this tablet sounds great!Book/Reading Features: (10/10)At first this was not my primary reason for purchasing a Fire HD, but after toying around with a few things, I am truly impressed at how well Amazon has integrated the ability to find, purchase, read, and even listen to literature. The lending library for Prime users is a nice added touch allowing you to borrow from a rather extensive list of books. Not to mention many timeless classics are available for free (such as Dracula, Gulliver's Travels, Little Women, The Iliad, The Jungle Book and many more) and of those titles, many come with free audio! If you do not feel like spending the money on audio (or if your book has none available) the text-to-speech feature is surprisingly well done with minimal error. With all this being said, I can honestly say that I am excited to start reading again.Web Browsing: (8/10)The only reason I do not give this a 10 is because web browsing (with what is given out of the box) lacks Flash support which limits the capabilities. However, with a bit of research I was able to find forum discussions on how Fire HD users were able to work around this by downloading an app called ES File Explorer and then a separate browser called Dolphin that gives you Flash capabilities, so this is an easy fix that even a monkey could figure out how to do as long as they are patient. Though don't get me wrong, Silk is fast and beautiful and i use it for the majority of my web surfing, but occasionally Flash is needed. As I am sure you have read by now in other reviews, the fact that the Fire HD does not automatically come with Flash support is not Amazon's fault yet rather Adobe for pulling he plug on their involvement with tablets. Again, as long as your network is put together well, browsing the web is very fast and up to par with dare I say some computers.App Availability: (8/10)To me, this is the only area where the Fire HD lacks. I would rate lower here but I am trusting that over time and after updates, the lineup will have grown. Once more, with a bit of research you can find discussions on how to \"sideload\" apps from your computer and other devices, but that could be a bit too advanced for the average user. Though for what it is worth, the selection it does currently come with is top notch. Just to name a few, some important missing apps include: YouTube, Dropbox, and SiriusXM. Still, as far as I am concerned, this certainly is not a deal breaker and I am sure that as things progress access to these will become available.Look/Feel: (10/10)The 8.9\" model that I own and am currently reviewing was a lot lighter than I expected and it is true what they say ( it is just right to fit in one hand). Out of the box/pre-case the Fire HD looks great and is very thin, sleek, and dare I say...sexy? The only minor gripe I would have (that I noticed other reviewers mentioned) is the volume and power buttons are sometimes hard to find and do not always register, but after a while you get use to it. Aside from that, I love how it appears and functions.Overall: (56/60)There are a few things that by now you may know, such as how out of the box the Fire HD does not come with a wall charger. I know that is a bummer but if you don't already have one roaming around your house from a smartphone or if you cannot tolerate simply charging from your computer, Amazon sells them at a fairly reasonable price.Bottom line? I have purchased over 500 items on Amazon and I rarely feel the need to review a product, but I genuinely felt my voice needed to be heard ( or read rather) with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I strongly recommend purchasing this product and if you have any questions, feel free to comment and hopefully either me or someone else can assist you!P.S. This took me forever to type on the Fire HD but it was good practice and hopefully worth it!I would highly recommend a screen protector and a case", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value and Great Gadget", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R1664MHMUTYIOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally published in November 2012, Updated January 19, 2013 after using this Fire for several months...As there appears to be mixed reviews of the 8.9' Fires - ones with 4G access and those without - to clarify, this review is for the 8.9\" tablet with the 4G connectivity option.To get the iPad comparison out of the way, I put this tablet side-by-side to my iPad 2 I use for work.  Downloads were slightly faster and the video screen resolution and the colors were more vibrant on the Fire vs. the iPad 2.Screen Display / Video Playback:With the larger HD screen, if playing video is important to you this is the version of the Fire to get as the screen display is fairly impressive with sharp and crisp colors. The display on this HD Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model and even this year's smaller HD model.Amazon also added a cool feature on this one with the HDMI micro connection port. I have an HDMI micro plug and was able to hook this up to the big screen to watch an episode of the science fiction series Defying Gravity.  It played back great smoothly with no problems.Wi-Fi connectivity:My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this 8.9\" version of the Fire sitting next to the \"smaller\" HD version of the Fire, my Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the new 7\" Fire all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity..My website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices and were still slow but faster than the other devices (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was slightly faster but for a casual surfer it is not noticeable nor does it hang.Email Setup:Email setup was very easy with the included email app for my main Google account - it took about a minute to input my email address and password information and I was good to go: sending and receiving emails was a snap, and when I sent a test message with pictures they displayed crisply.  I will tell you I primarily us an existing app called Enhanced Email that I received here on the Amazon app store for free vs. what came as standard with the Fire for daily use, and it was easy to use - actually better due to the larger screen size - with this version of the Fire. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!Game Play:I do play a lot of games, but they aren't the heavy action / interactive games many of the kids play today.  For my test, I tried out several rounds of Words with Friends and a Majong derivative.  The display was crisp and the tablet was very responsive as it interacted over the WiFi network of my home to the game server.Sound / Music PlaybackDifferent than last year's model and the $159 this year's model, the two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I wanted to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. However, the sound is not very crisp (the $159 Fire sounds better to me) as the sound is going away from you with the speakers being in the back.  With a cover on the Fire to protect it, that can be a problem.  It's going to take a little bit of getting used to having the volume controls at the top of the device.Reading Books:Reading a book was enjoyable and easy on the eyes with the larger screen: I appreciate being able to changing the default font to something else in addition to increasing the font size so I don't have to wear my glasses.  Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.Bluetooth:Bluetooth setup was very easy. I tested this with audio in my car as well as an external keyboard.  From a music standpoint, there were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about 30 seconds; I hooked up a Motorola Bluetooth keyboard and started banging away with several emails.  Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Cellular Connectivity (This Section Updated 1/19/2013):The 4G connection is a lot like how I have heard one of my friends describe his relationship with a girlfriend: when things are good, they are real good and when they are bad, they absolutely suck.The same can be true for the 4G connection - it can be real fast when it wants to be fast, and you can be dead in the water in the strangest places.  For example, I can be out in the middle of the country and see a cell tower on the highway / frontage road, and the cell service is screaming fast and very convenient.  On the other hand, I can be in downtown Houston, the display says I have full cellular strength, and it just won't work - no Internet, no email, no anything.In other words, I have a love-hate relationship with it.Concerning the introductory data plan - the one where you pay a one-time fee of $50 for 250 megabytes of data per month for 12 months, I have mixed emotions about it, also.  I am not a heavy user of email or web surfing, I dislike video chat, and I don't download big files all of the time, so I initially thought the 250 meg per month limit would more than suit my needs.I was wrong.Why was I wrong?  It's all of the apps loaded on your Fire that auto-magically turn themselves on that constantly check the Internet for updates, apps like Accuweather and The Weather Channel, a few news apps, and Words With Friends.  The Weather Channel app had to be the worst: despite manually shutting it down, it would miraculously come back on and download maps, constantly check for updates and refresh said maps so frequently it chewed right through the month's allotment in a day and a half.No kidding.  And it's not a very good app, either, in comparison to Acccuweather so I deleted it.Bottom line is you need to watch the data throughput carefully, or you will go over.  I upgraded to the 3 gig per month plan, which is the same plan I have with my work iPad and seems to be enough.  That's $30 per month, so I wasted the $49.99 on the 250 meg per month plan (AT&T; wouldn't give me a refund even though I upgraded).Affordability vs. an iPadDollarwise, this version of the Fire whips the iPad when you stack up the annual cost of connectivity, 64Gb of memory, and the cellular (or not) models of the iPad.  The iPad's screen is slightly larger, but when I put it up against each other for the same things (web page, game app) I really couldn't tell that much of a difference.Overall, if you are looking for a larger tablet this one wins hands down.  With the full-features included with this model - especially the 4G connection - I believe this will be my go-to device, and I will no longer be carrying my e-Ink Kindle in addition to my iPad every day.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the Greatest Tablet, but a Good One", "Author": "D. Carlson", "ReviewID": "R3IX0K0RPO803C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wasn't really in the market for another tablet, but my girlfriend ended up getting one for me so she got me on this one. I would like to say that this tablet reminds me of the first Motorola Droid smartphone that came out several years back. The phone jam packed a ton of bells & whistles into its hardware and software to give a lot of bang for your buck. This is what it feels like amazon has done with the Kindle Fire 8.9. They have put a lot of advanced hardware and innovative software, so for the average user, specially someone who absorbs a lot of media, you get a lot for the price. But just because you get a lot for the price, doesn't mean it is without its flaws. This is an updated version of my likes and dislikes, (my original analysis was a bit rushed, this is more detailed):LIKESBuild QualityI like the build of this product, it has good material design and durability. It feels nice in your hands and comfortable to hold with easy access to buttons. Since this is only 8.9\" and not 10 or 11 inches, it is easier to grasp and hold in one hand with an overall good aesthetic look and feel to it.SpeakersI have to say, the more I listen to it, the more I like the sound. The speakers are definitely a step up from the norm and probably one of its best features. They produce a full, rich, and very vibrant sound you can experience music and movies the way they were meant to be experienced. It is not a home theatre experience, but as close as one can get with a small device like this.ScreenThe display is very nice. I'm not sure if it compares with the clarity of Super Amoled or Retina screens, but it comes close. High screen resolution is not special to the Kindle, lots of tablets now have high resolution screens, some higher. What this screen has that other tablets don't is the anti-glare, which works well under sunlight and highly lit places, it's not something that seems advantageous until you work with a screen that doesn't have this.InternetKindle's Wi-fi and Silk Browser make internet browsing fast. I did a comparison with a Samsung and Apple tablet, and noticed that the surfing was faster, it wasn't a huge difference but it was noticeable. Streaming audio and video had a bigger and more noticeable difference, with the Kindle being very smooth, with fewer lags and dropped connections. This is key for me, I hate streaming content with pauses and breaks in loading, there is less of that in the Fire.Reading ExperienceIn my opinion, this is Fire HD's best feature, delivering a better reading experience than any tablet right now. This is no surprise as books are Amazon's claim to fame and where they excel and have always excelled. I don't know if you remember, but before Amazon was Amazon, they were the first online retailer for books. Before there was an iPad, there was the kindle. They have always been at the forefront of the book buying and reading experience, now especially digital books. I think I remember reading that the Kindle was the main reason Borders Bookstore went out of business, Borders said they just couldn't keep up with or match Amazon's delivery system.Now with this Fire HD, they offer even more advancements. With its X-ray for books, its 'reading view' that takes away messy images on a site leaving only text, `immersive' reading that lets you play an audio book while reading, whispersync technology, and better optimization of text, other devices can't match. Granted it doesn't compare to digital ink like on the original Kindle for me did the best to mimic actual reading, but as far as tablets goes its better than what is out there. If you are getting a tablet primarily for reading, this is gonna be a good choice.Amazon UniverseI have a love hate relationship with Amazon's Universe of services. I don't like how even though the Kindle HD uses Android, it is somewhat restricted. Also, they don't have as many apps as google or apple. But taking everything else into account, movies, books, music, prime lending library, prime movies, amazon is better. The big drawback is you have to own a kindle to fully enjoy their universe, which means if you own a kindle, you are limited from using other company's universe.Apps and other featuresAll the apps work fine, they start and stop as they should, nothing to criticize or brag about. The touch screen is smooth and responds good, though nothing like iPad...hate to say it but iPad thumps everyone on that, their touch and scrolling is very fluid and just feels right. I don't have kids so I can't really comment on the parental controls but from other reviews seems like something to have if you have kids. Can access email and everything fine.DISLIKESWhen it comes to bringing together the right mix of original and developing technology in a tablet, like the first Droid phone, Amazon did an admirable job. It merged a mix that most of us will enjoy and find useful. Although Amazon has put original elements that make this tablet worthy to compete in the tablet world, at the same time, they've done some things that make you question what they're doing.AdsThis is the most disliked innovation to hit electronics since the Windows phone (and I don't mean the Windows 7 phone, I mean its predecessor, which was so disastrous nobody heard about its release and was pulled from shelves within two weeks). Microsoft was smart enough to pull its mistake, Amazon seems to continue to run with theirs.No ChargerAs you have read in other reviews, this product does not come with a standard charger. I don't like that other reviewers excuse this by claiming it makes the product cheaper. Chargers are not expensive to produce so I don't think it makes the product cheaper, it gives Amazon more opportunity to recover the Kindle cost by charging $20+ dollars for an accessory that probably only costs a few dollars to make. Not sure how accurate this is, it's my own decision I've reached as it doesn't make sense not to include a standard charger adapter because for most people including myself, this is not a pc companion, rather a pc replacement. Without a real charger, it becomes a companion. Yes, you can buy one, but why make us do that.CameraThe Kindle Fire 8.9 only has a front facing camera. It is useful for video chatting, but not for taking pictures. If I want to take a picture of something outside myself, I have to point the screen in that direction, which means I can't see what I am taking a picture of or have easy access to the camera buttons, doesn't make sense.This is some of the qualms I have, nothing revolting.All in all, do I like this Kindle HD? Yes. Will I keep it? Probably. Do I think it is the greatest tablet in the world? In some respects, yes, in others no. Should you buy it? The answer is this is not an all-in-one, do everything machine that the likes of iPad claim to be. With this it seems like amazon focused on some key things, like watching movies, listening to music, surfing the internet, and reading books. The things they concentrated on, they made sure to go full force to give users the best experience they could. They are things that most of us average users are going to use a tablet for...email, streaming, social media, video, music, for what amazon focused on with this product like I said they did admirably.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Value Given All the Features & Options", "Author": "Dean Pritchett", "ReviewID": "R3AX3V9UT4B1ZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife purchased the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for me and have to say it is definitely one of the more nifty devices, with lots of cool features and options. Before I talk about them, I'd like to say that I enjoy tech gadgets and I usually get my hands on the latest and greatest ones. Although, I don't buy everything that comes out, I do play around and keep myself up-to-date with what is out there. Also, I don't hook myself into a particular manufacturer. If a product is good, I will purchase, use, and tell people about it. If something better comes out, then I move on. This review will cover the Kindle HD as well as my experiences with other devices.DisplayThis tablet has a very nice and fresh looking display. The images are super sharp and everything looks crystal clear. It is easy to view on off angles, which is useful when me and my friends are viewing the screen at the same time or for using the device in presentations and meetings. The anti-glare feature is a nice touch, I can view it in direct sunlight without a huge loss in clarity. Granted, it's not as great as in dim light or shade, but it does the job.AudioThe audio was a huge selling point for me. Most speakers on laptop, netbook, and other portable devices like tablets and smartphones produce poor quality sound. You always have to plug in external headphones to really enjoy music and movies. That issue doesn't exist with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" These speakers get loud, and with Dolby technology, produce an enjoyable experience. Again, this can come handy when you are listening/viewing the device with multiple people.Wifi/4GI really like the Kindle Fire HD's dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. It not only does a better job of streaming HD content, but it allows you to connect to more types of signals. WiFi routers vary, some are old and outdated, while others are newer and function better working on different bandwidths and frequencies. Kindle can connect to all the different varieties. This is very handy if you travel a lot like me and need the ability to connect to whichever random connections you can find in the moment.BluetoothNice, handy feature, I don't know why more devices don't have them. I can connect to my Bluetooth wireless headphones and walk around the house without being tied to the device. Also, I can have the Kindle connected to my other Bluetooth devices without having to be next to them. Not a deal breaker, but a nice feature.Silk BrowserSilk is a neat innovation in internet surfing. It predicts what links on a site you will navigate to, and downloads those pages b/f you click on the link. This increases the load speed of webpages. The concept is interesting, and it proves useful when you've lost internet connection, because if the pages were downloaded prior to you losing the connection, you can still navigate to them.AdsThis is the part of the Kindle HD I dislike; the whole ad concept is unwise. Not only does it come off unprofessional, it adds an unnecessary decision/step in the purchase process.  The price difference is not much, so Amazon should either price the device higher or just chalk up the cost. As a buyer, if ads are an issue, since your spending $300 - $500 on a device anyway, spend a little more so you don't have to deal with it...unless of course you like to be kept up-to-date with ads.Outside of the ads, this is a fantastic media machine. With the display, speakers, dual core processor, and graphics card, it is the good for gaming, music, movies, and video. Add to it the Silk browser and the dual band, dual antenna Wi-Fi, it also becomes good for internet browsing, allowing for better streaming of those games, music, movies, and video.Vs iPad 3The main advantages iPad has over Kindle HD 8.9\" are that iPad's Retina display gives its screen a higher resolution, but not by much. iPad 3 has both a front and rear camera, while the Kindle HD has only the front facing camera. Amazon says the front facing camera is HD, but I'm not sure what that means. The iPad has GPS which the Kindle HD lacks. The clear advantage for Apple is the number of apps. Apple phones and tablets have the most apps of any competitor.On the other hand, the Kindle HD 8.9 is a bit thinner, lighter, and smaller than the Apple counter part. iPad has only a single mono speaker, while as mentioned, Kindle has the Dolby stereo speakers. Kindle's screen is a 16x9 aspect ratio (like Movie and HDTV screens), while the iPad is 4x3. What this means is that movies will display larger on the Kindle, using the entire screen whereas iPad will display smaller, leaving bars along the top and bottom.For most people, the key distinction between iPad 3 and Kindle HD 8.9\" is the price. The Kindle HD is considerably cheaper, with the WiFi model costing $200 less than iPad 3's comparable model, and the 4G LTE costing as much as $230 less than iPad 3's 4G LTE (even the iPad 2 and iPad mini are more expensive than the new Kindle). Take into consideration the data plan, and you are saving another $150 in the first year with Kindle HD.Another disadvantage of the iPad is that you get the deliciously awkward pleasure of joining a cult that brainwashes you into thinking buying Apple makes you different, better, while offering an advanced product; when in reality they are like the million other Apple users, spending twice as much for a device that is rarely up to speed with current technology.Falling behind in technology is one of the main reasons I've strayed from Apple over the few years. The original iPod and iPhone were true innovations. You might even say the iPad was an innovation, even though it was simply an oversized iPhone, even using the same operating system. To make their products work smooth, Apple's uses highly specialized components in their products. This makes it difficult for their products to evolve as quickly. The initial iPhone was one of the last phones to make the switch to 3G. And even though 4G has existed for nearly 2 years, iPhone made the jump only a few months ago. Apple's prized Siri is just an enhanced version of Google's voice activated search, which came out 2 years prior to Siri. Now Apple is playing catch up with the iPad mini and Amazons already on its second generation 7\" tablet.Vs Google Nexus 10Before starting this comparison, I would like to point out a couple things. One, evaluating the Kindle Fire against the Nexus is more an apple's to apples comparison as they are both use the Android operating system. The Nexus is a 10\" tablet (hence the name), while this review is for the 8.9\" Kindle HD. Both companies have a 7\" counterpart with the Kindle HD 7\" and Nexus 7, though the comparison here is strictly between Kindle HD 8.9\" and Nexus 10.It is also important to note that Google is the main reason anyone is able to compete with Apple phones and tablets right now. They are the creators of the Android operating system that are used in majority of non-apple devices. Tablets like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Samsung's Galaxy Tab really owe it to Google's open source Android operating system for their ability to participate in the tablet market.Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's begin the comparison. Both Kindle HD 8.9\" and Nexus 10 run version 4 of Android. However, Nexus runs the updated 4.2 Jellybean, while Kindle Fire HD runs the 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (the names are silly, but they are memorable). It is important to note, the version in Amazon's tablet is heavily customized. The customization has its advantage and disadvantages. The advantage is Amazon can offer things such as parental controls that can limit what your kids can do and for how long. The disadvantage is there are restrictions on certain features like Google's Play store.As mentioned, Kindle HD is 8.9\", the Nexus is bigger coming in at 10.\" Both have a front-facing camera but only the Nexus 10 has a rear one, which is 5 megapixels. Both have HD displays with Gorilla Glass and micro USB & HDMI connectors for HD video output. Google's display is higher resolution (even higher than iPad's retina), while Amazon's display has the polarizing filter and anti-glare technology. Both Fire and Nexus offer stereo speakers, but only Amazon offers Dolby sound.As far as hardware, both boast a dual core processor, though Nexus is a little faster at 1.7Ghz against Fire HD's 1.5 Ghz. On the other hand, Fire HD has more storage capacity starting at 32GB and going up to 64GB, whereas the Nexus starts at 16GB and goes up to only 32 GB. Kindle HD 8.9 comes in both a Wi-Fi and 4G LTE version, Nexus 10 comes in only a Wi-Fi version. Kindle has the dual antenna and dual frequency Wi-Fi, I believe the Nexus comes in only dual frequency, not dual antenna.The Nexus 10 excels in that it has the NFC chip for device-to-device communication, GPS, and it is fully integrated out of the box with Google services like Maps, Drive, and Gmail. As mentioned, Amazon's modified Android places restrictions on some of these services. Also, since Google makes Android, it is highly likely that updates to the Android operating system will likely be released to Nexus devices before Kindle Fire devices.As it relates to price, like with iPad 3, Kindle Fire HD has the clear advantage. The Nexus starts at $399 while the Amazon 8.9\" starts at $299. The next model up for Nexus is the 32 GB version which costs $499. At that price, you can get the Kindle not only at 32GB, but with 4G LTE. As far as price, Kindle has everyone beat.ConclusionThese are the major players in the world of tablets today. There are other manufactures like Samsung and Acer, however, they don't offer an extensive ecosystem of apps, media, and services like Google, Apple, and Amazon. Also, as stated earlier, most tablets use Android's operating system, so aside from hardware size and features, they are going to offer an experience similar to the Nexus.The question that beckons is which one to buy? If you really like one company's ecosystem of services, the answer becomes less difficult - get that company's device. That is, if you like Amazon's Whispersync technology, Silk browser, Xray for books and are a Prime junkie, then go with Kindle Fire HD. If you are a fan of Google Play and their services, consider the Nexus. If you are diehard Apple, well, I don't have to say what your going to go with...though if you go with Apple, do it and be quiet. Don't be like the masses of Apple customers who feel the need to run around advertising to the world about how they own Apple. Ranting and raving doesn't make you cool, it just shows how childish and insecure your need for validation is. Although, you might think you are cool, we all laugh and talk behind your back.On the flipside, if you are not overly committed to any company's services and are looking for a good overall tablet for a good price, then the clear winner is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Given the hardware specs, its focus on media, internet, and reading, and the price point, it is hands down the best value. In my opinion it is the most advanced, feature rich device for the price.I love technology and enjoy following its progression, I've really enjoyed sharing my thoughts about this so I hope you've found it helpful.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "We like it better than our iPad (please don't hate me)", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "RO3LEA2I4EWCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We originally bought this for our daughter to use so my wife can get her iPad back.Let's start with the comparison...Size (and weight) matter - This larger version of the Kindle Fire is smaller, thinner, and a quarter pound lighter than the iPad 3.  Of course that means the screen is a bit smaller too, less than 1\".  However, the Kindle screen is breathtakingly clear and the weight difference, while it sounds small when you type it into a review or read it as you are now, is really noticeable after just a few minutes of holding the device with one hand while using it.Price - Another tiny difference is that the Fire is a couple hundred dollars less than a similarly configured iPad.About the Ads supported version - We never notice them.  They are only on the lock screen.Display - We like the Kindle display better than the iPad.  There, I've said it and hope I won't have to go into hiding.  It is clear and bright without making everything look like a comic book and shows up well in sunlight without having to turn the display way up (which means the battery won't drain quickly).Usability - I'm liking the Kindle interface more and more, compared to the iPad or \"Native\" android tablets.  The Kindle prominently displays apps used most recently and the ones I just installed in a side scrolling \"Carousel\".  Other apps are just a few taps away.  That's great for me and greater still for my young daughter (see FreeTime, below) since there's no hunting for the things I'm likely to want the most. The iPhone and other Androids I've seen do it the other way around.First use - First use was very straightforward.  I liked that it knew my name without me having to tell it.  First thing it did, after greeting me (by name) was ask for my WiFi password.  After that it took a few minutes to download updates.  When I clicked on the \"Apps\" menu it already had listed every Android app I bought from Amazon.  Same goes for videos, music, and books.  I realize iPad does something similar.  However, having used both, I feel the Kindle is easier.On the business side I can access my email accounts, including those in an Exchange server, with no problems.  Attachments, including .PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets can all be read with no problems.Back to the fun stuff, YouTube, Netflix, and SmugMug videos stream flawlessly.  Pandora provides music without a hitch.  It connects to Bluetooth devices quickly and easily.The Camera - The front facing camera, designed for video conferencing, provides a clear image while the screen provides a vivid image of the person at the other end.  We ran some side-by-side tests with our iPad 3 and the Fire always performed better.  There is no rear-facing camera for taking snapshots and I figure that's what my iPhone is for.FreeTime - We love it!!! This allows us to limit the app's and sites accessible to our daughter.  For us it's as much to keep her from getting into confusing places that interrupt her activities and keeping her from things we don't want her to see.  This is so much nicer than handing her my iPad or Samsung tablet and dealing with the frequent frustrations from her stumbling into an application she doesn't understand.  OK, these are not so much child friendly as parent friendly but everybody wins in the end.The Missing Charger - One difference that could be important to some is that the Kindle doesn't come with a charger.  It does include a cable that you can use with any USB charger or computer you may have on hand.  However, if you don't have one of those then you will want to order a charger along with this.Remember at the start of this I said we originally bought the Fire so my wife can get her iPad back?  After using the Fire my wife prefers it and leaves the iPad to our daughter.  The only problem is I need to buy a second Kindle Fire because now I want one too.FIRST THING TO BUY after you get your Kindle: Best 100 Kindle Fire HD Apps (Updated With Top Apps for the Kindle Fire HD!).  It's a bargain at $0.99 (Free to borrow if you're a Prime member).  You can zip through, read descriptions for the mostly free app's, click on the ones that interest you, and have them installed right away.A NICE CASE:  A little while ago I got an Innovic Multi Functional Handmade Leather Zip Bag for iPad 2 and 3 16gb, 32gb, 64gb edition.  Turns out even though it's made for an iPad it fits the 8.9\" Fire HD pretty well.  (I've added a video showing how well it works with this Kindle along with my review for that case)  It may not be a perfect solution but given the limited options for cases right now, especially for the price (originally $11, it has as of this writing almost doubled since I originally added this to my review and is still a good value), it isn't a bad temporary choice.  (I had a chance to try the Marware Revolve Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Black and will be sticking with this one.)", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Fire HD 8.9 essentials - the Ys, the FAQ and some comments", "Author": "A.

I am not a pro videographer and couldn't find a way to better focus on the screen and cancel out the screen reflections.Second, this is NOT a video review. It only illustrates the answer to one and only one important question: how do you get around the seemingly impossible to turn off 1-Click? This is how you do it:1 - Whether you are a parent or not, you must have parental controls turned on.2 - From the top settings menu select 'More...'3 - Select 'Parental Controls'4 - Change 'Password Protect Purchases' from the default 'OFF' to 'ON'The video illustrates the above, then shows how attempting to buy a book prompts for a password rather than immediately beginning to download it, which is what happens if you didn't do 1-2-3-4.____________________________________________________________BACKGROUNDWe own the original 7\" Fire and the 7\" Fire HD which is our daughter's favorite tablet now. In addition - we are a relatively large, gadget-using family - we own a Nexus 7, a XOOM, a Galaxy Tab and a couple of lesser known Android tablets. We used to own a first generation iPad and I have access and have used the latest 10\" iPad but only spent a few minutes with the 'mini'.These being said, I will break my review into 2 main sections, followed by some conclusions. I'll have a section on the Y's (as in why the Fire HD 8.9 and not...) which may be slightly subjective and a FAQ which should focus on the Fire HD 8.9 and I will try to make it as unbiased as possible and then I will insert my own personal comments and views concerning the product. I will not going to list all the features: pixel density, expected battery life or CPU speed, etc. because the exact specs are all listed and can be found at the product's page.____________________________________________________________THE FAQ - I am trying to be objective here but the last 2 answers reflect my own viewsQ: In what ways is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 different from the Kindle Fire HD 7?A: Larger screen, slightly better speakers, heavier, costs more, can be purchased with a 4G option.Q: Does it come with a charger?A: No. A charger must be purchased separately. There is an Amazon branded charger but many generic chargers will do.Q: Besides the charger, what other essential accessories should I consider?A: You may want to shop for a case/sleeve/portfolio, a stylus, possibly a glare-reducing screen overlay and a screen cleaning kit.Q: What should be the first things I may want to do as far as setup is concerned.A: You may want to disable/password protect in-app purchases, set you favorite search engine if you'd like something other than Bing, set parental controls if you have children, password-protecting any content purchase and deciding which type of content they are allowed to access.Q: What can I set through FreeTime, as opposed to the 'regular' parental controls?A: You can set profiles for more than one child, set limits on the amount of time they can use the Kindle each day, specific time limits for specific activities (reading, gaming, watching videos) and you can add specific books, Videos, Apps that the child can access.Q: Is all the content I purchased through my Kindle Fire 7 or my Kindle reader, including Paperwhite accessible from the Fire HD 8.9?A: Yes and No. Any purchases from Amazon's Appstore, including books, movies, games can be accessed from any Kindle tablet and on any non-Amazon Android tablet that run the Amazon apps (Appstore, Kindle, etc.) if they are compatible with your device. Incompatible apps that were purchased, let's say, for the original KF 7 or the KF HD 7 will become available for the KFHD 8.9 if and when the publisher upgrades them to run on it.Q: How much storage is available on the 16GB model?A: 12.8GBQ: Can you make a compelling case for purchasing the 32GB model?A: Yes, IF you have a lot of non-Amazon-purchased content (music, photos, videos) that you do not wish to store on Amazon's cloud.Q: Is storage on Amazon's cloud unlimited and free?A: Yes for Amazon-purchased only. No for everything else.Q: Can I install 'third party' apps, not purchased from Amazon's Appstore?A: Yes. Under 'Device' set 'Allow Installation of Applications from unknown sources' to 'On'Q: Can I change my browser's search engine to anything other than Bing?A: Yes, you can do it from within browser's settings.Q: Is there a way to prevent 1-Click from ordering items as soon as I touch them?A: Yes. See the (poorly made) video and the note at the top.Q: Name the most compelling reasons for buying a Kindle HD.A: Easy access to all Amazon-purchased content, unique and very effective parental controls, great sound quality off built-in speakers, good value for the price.Q: Name the most annoying features that may drive you away from buying a Kindle HD.A: Sold without a charger, hard to get to buttons, fenced in inside Amazon's own 'ecosystem'.____________________________________________________________THE YsWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over a Fire HD 7 (+) or why should I prefer the Fire HD 7 over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Larger screen+ Slightly faster processor- Lower price- Lighter, more portableWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over an iPad (+) or why should I prefer the iPad over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Significantly lower price+ Excellent parental controls+ Easy access to all Amazon's content+ Amazon's cloud with free storage for all Amazon purchases+ Not fenced inside Apple's ecosystem- Larger screen- Access to Apple's store- Rear-facing camera- Siri- Not fenced inside Amazon's ecosystem- iPads come either black or whiteWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over a Nexus 10 (+) or why should I prefer the Nexus 10 over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Excellent parental controls+ Ability to play Amazon Prime movies (don't believe can get it on the Nexus)+ Amazon's cloud with free storage for all Amazon purchases- Comes with a charger- Runs Chrome, Gmail natively and all other Google Apps- Google Play, does not block access to Amazon's Appstore or Amazon apps such as Kindle- Google Now- Pure Android, sure to be upgraded as Android evolves- GPS, Near Field Communication (NFC)____________________________________________________________CONCLUSIONS, RATINGWe have our Fire HD 8.9 now and it's a good quality tablet, right at the top when it comes to quality, design, user interface (very top there) and to a good extent, features. If I was about to buy a new Kindle Fire right now I would probably go for a Fire HD 7. The HD 8.9's larger screen size is the only clearly distinguishing difference between the two so, if screen size matters, get the HD 8.9 but be aware that others make equally sharp-looking tablets with larger 10\" screens.The Y's section below seems to suggest my preference for the Google Nexus tablets or 'pure Android' in general and, yes, I do prefer them over Amazon's. But I am a minority of one in my family because everybody else prefers the Kindles. I actually prefer to see my younger kid use the Kindle Fire because of the exceptionally well done parental controls.In the end, iPads, Fires, Nexuses are all going to sell millions of units each. I can only hope that my review helped at least some of you who invested time reading it decide what's best for them.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE the Kindle Fire 8.9\": A Detailed Review", "Author": "J. Friedman \"JF\"", "ReviewID": "RM0EJRMDXSQ9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I did with my review of the 7\" version of this device, I had the chance to check out my friend's advanced copy of the 8.9\" version as well. My conclusion? Simple: I LOVE this device. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!I am a former Apple fanboy; I had the iPhone, I still have the second generation iPad; but now I am finding myself expanding to other, less expensive options. I now have the Galaxy S II, and am seriously considering switching to this product. You'll find most of my comments similar to the review of the 7\", with a few exceptions.DESIGN - I really like how the shortcut bar switches to the right side of the screen when you turn it to landscape mode, so you won't have to look for them. Landscape mode already uses up more vertical space so putting these buttons on the bottom in landscape mode would be silly. It's a bit weird that the home button is now on the right instead of left, but hey, that's fine with me as long as you're not using my landscape space.Attachments download pretty easily. Once you get the hang of things, you'll be using it in no time.FEEL - The fire HD 8.9 was designed very well this time around. So much easier to hold one-handed than a 10 incher or the even bigger 11.6\" guys that weighs down your hand. It has a fairly large bezel which does not look so great aesthetically (I would rather have an edge to edge screen with only a tiny bezel for holding, but I'll live!) It has a soft touch back which looks very pleasant. wider bezel as I noted before, and is extremely light. It is somewhat thick - definitely thicker than the ipad, but the 8.9 version feels just right. It weighs 20 oz. so it's the heaviest product in the Amazon kindle repertoire, but it offers the most so that is expected.It is bigger than the original fire and has nice curved edges which makes it much easier to hold than the original fire. It looks very sharp!!! It has volume buttons, a MAJOR improvement on the original fire as well. It is bigger than an iPad mini and feels bigger too - while still keeping a similar price point as the regular iPad but with far more options.SOUND - the sound is clear and fantastic and comes out very crisp. The fire uses dolby digital audio which comes out very clearly. Dolby knows what they are doing. The music plays very nicely and can be stored in the cloud which is great. Amazon allows you to import up to 250 songs which is not very much, but what can you do?SOFTWARE - the device has new programs such as x-ray which is great to learn more about books and movies, and FreeTime which is fantastic for kids.The platform is Android 4.0, but this is Amazon's customized version of the platform. It is based solely to sell products so don't think of this device primarily as a iPad replacement - folks, think of it more as a faster way to line amazon's pockets with other purchases that you will almost certainly make through the device. The home screen is not customizable with widgets, live wallpapers, weather apps, etc., the way an android screen is.Immersive reading is a new feature that allows you to play an audiobook while reading the screen - you can read and listen at the same time, or if you're bored with reading, just listen. I love having the option. They do well with the sound here using the new Dolby digital feature - that is just super neat and not expected in a tablet!While x-rays for movies is super cool, I got bored of it quickly. I enjoy learning about interesting features of the movie, but after the first time, I just want to enjoy the movie.The idea of FreeTime is great for my kids. My daughter can play with her games, and I know she is not doing other things because of the bright, vibrant blue background color of the screen which I can easily ascertain with a quick glance. I can lock them down on time so they can share with each other. Most importantly, the new fire HD is built tougher.The browser runs very nicely. It seems to run faster than the original fire did. I can turn full screen on or their new \"reading view\" which eliminates all the background junk that wastes space. I was able to download and load PDF files and some of my word documents without any issues, and I'm told by my friend that he had no issues loading his exchange server for work on the 8.9 fire HD.Movie and book titles show up the same way the original fire did, in a library look which seems to work well for Amazon's needs. It displays your titles easily and clearly and allows you to find what you are looking for quickly. The whispersync feature was a great idea - it lets you access your content on any device, so I was able to download a book on the fire HD and see it on my original kindle fire and my iPad's kindle app. Now they have whispersync for movies, games and audiobooks as well!!!!You can use skype which works fine on wifi - it's integrated but is not as full featured as their desktop app. You can also check email - they allow access to aol, gmail, etc. Facebook is set up with the device, and you can easily view photos as well. In short, it's a pretty full featured tablet just as all the others on the market, but at a fantastic price point.HARDWARE - The 8.9\" version costs $299 and $369 respectively (add $15 if you can live with special offers), as well as 32gb and 64gb ($500/$600) with LTE, plus you can get a fantastic 250mb data plan for only $50 a year on the LTE version. As my previous review noted, the 7\" kindle HD comes in 16gb (only $200!!!) and 32gb for $50 more. So you are getting a pretty fantastic deal. In comparision, the 64gb version of the iPad is $659 not including the data plan, so you're saving some money on this guy. Additionally you get 5 gb of amazon cloud storage free, plus you can pay more for more cloud storage (for files: 10/20gb, $25/50gb, $50/100gb, $100/200gb, $250/500gb, and $500/1k gb, plus for music: free/250 songs, and $25/250,000 songs).The data plan, if you get the LTE version of the 8.9\" fire HD, blows away the competition. Consider any smartphone you own - for instance a Galaxy S 2 - you have to pay at least $10 a month premium for the data plan alone, and this is only $50 a year! Not to mention the data plan includes 20gb cloud storage and a $10 Amazon app store credit!It has dual band wi-fi with 802.11 a/b/g/n that makes it much faster than the competition. It also has an amazing screen and dolby digital sound! It can handle WPA2, WEP and WPA security. The processor is a speedy 1.5 Ghz dual core processor with 16 gb integrated flash memory, which is almost as fast as my desktop PC... time to upgrade... :)It is a capacitive touch screen with fantastic resolution. The video playback is 720p. The device also has Bluetooth (A2DP) and HDMI port, as well as text to speech which is great for my blind friend. It comes pre-registered to my account which is a good and a bad thing. I have to be sure not to give it to anyone else without undoing that! It also has a USB 2.0 and 3.5mm stereo jack. It has an accelerometer and gyroscope and front facing HD camera with built in microphone for Skype! It also has an ambient light sensor as well which is a fantastic feature.As noted in my other review, I was able to check out the cover for the 7\" (haven't seen it for the 8.9\" yet) which has a nice leather grain. The interior is made of nylon which has a bit of a plasticky feel. I love the iPad 3 magnetic locking feature and they seem to have utilized that here which turns the device off (sleep) when you close it, and turns it on when you open it. Simple. Uncomplicated. I assume the cover is the same for the 8.9\" version.SCREEN - They have reduced the screen glare on the device using IPS technology, a polarizing filter and anti-glare, which is pretty nice. IPS is a big deal as you don't want to be looking at it from a sharp angle and not be able to see the screen. I don't have as much trouble seeing it in direct sunlight. Also, the screen is much sharper and crisper than the original fire. I can lay the screen down flat on the table and still see what's being played pretty well. The color is vibrant and the magazines show up fantastic similar to the iPad's retina screen. It has vibrant blacks and a display resolution of 1920 x 1200 which is about 255 ppi so that does lag a bit behind the iPad with retina display.PERFORMANCE -  The HD 8.9\" seems to run a bit more efficiently than the 7\" version that I tested earlier, and it certainly runs much faster than my current kindle fire. It has a hardware called MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) which is increased antennas that work together to transfer data and improve data performance without taking up more unnecessary power or even adding any bandwidth to the spectrum! It uses all antennas provided to improve the connection quality as well. Not only that, the processor needed can be the same one without requiring an updated one.Downloads are pretty fast. I have Prime so I am able to run movies and shows for free and they ran fantastic on the device. On Wifi they just scream OWWWWWWW FAST. Much better than the iPad 3 as I've cross tested them. Netflix and YouTube ran seamlessly with no stuttering as sometimes happens on wireless devices like the iPad. I was able to get about 8 to 9 hours of battery life with VERY heavy usage, a bit less than the 7\" version since I had the LTE running, I think they say over 11 hours but that did not happen for me. It charges pretty fast - it took only a few hours using their \"powerfast\" charger.ADVERTISING - The device DOES have advertising, which is displayed on the lock screen only. I found this did not bother me too much, but now Amazon allows you to pay $15 to turn this feature off. If you care so much, then you probably should not be wearing that shirt with the polo logo on it. I'm sure most of you don't and would rather spend that $15 on a new app for the device.OPENING THE BOX - It has a USB 2.0 cable and the quick start guide, as well as the tablet itself. I wish it came with the power adapter up front. I would have to go out and buy one - the iPad comes with one so why not this device? I would rather pay the extra price up front, although I guess it's better to have the option than the choice made for me. The micro-USB cable is nice for plugging it into the computer. No headphones, although I just plugged mine in from my iPad and was fine.WARRANTY - this comes with Amazon's 1 year limited warranty but you can buy a 2 year warranty as well.ACCESSORIES - You get a $3 mp3 credit with any kindle accessory you buy, so that's a bonus. You can and probably should buy two products with the device. Most importantly, pick up a powerfast charger which allows for superfast charging in only 4 hours and costs $20 which is not unreasonable. Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging (for all Kindle Fire models, not included with device). I did not get a chance to see the cover for the 8.9\" but I DID see it for the 7\", so I assume they are very similar. You can get it here for about $55 Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Fuchsia (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\") which is a bit pricey but attaches magnetically, will wake and put your iPad to sleep, and serves as a built in stand.CONS - Very minimal issues - no charger included. No microSD port. No rear camera (most have dual cams now). But let's consider these things - you save money with the absence of a charger - remember, Amazon is already selling these at cost. If you have any USB charger (most people have a smartphone so you can reuse that charger if it's USB), you'll be fine. No rear camera is fine - you aren't holding a larger device like this at all times and if you really need to take a photo, you'll have your smartphone or camera for that. The only real negative I found was the lack of a microSD port, but given that Amazon is generous with the significant memory capacity of the 8.9\", this isn't a desktop replacement so you probably wont need to use up all of that storage.Conclusion - Price is great in comparison to the competition (i.e., the iPad) but you may still want to get a charger and almost certainly a case to protect your baby. Definitely a worthwhile buy if you are looking for a functional tablet and you want to be at the forefront of the technology line. I LOVED IT and recommend it!!!I hope you enjoyed this review. Please feel free to post any comments and I'll be happy to answer!***UPDATE 11-19-12 - Still loving it. I play with it every day. Noticed that the browser does predictive linking. Cool! Screen is super clear and immersive - those pixels are put to great usage and the IPS with a variety of angles is simply fantastic (although it's included with many devices, it's still a great feature for those not used to the future of tech!).  Gotta love that x-ray tech - it's so nice to download something on my kindle then switch to my phone when I dont feel like holding it, without having to redo everything. Makes life SO much easier! Amazon, you're a blessing!******UPDATE 11/23/12-have been playing with it for a few more days and i am still very happy with it. When I'm on wifi, movies load super fast and snappy, even better than the 7\" version. It seems like the wifi is just much better on this model. Also, when watching movies, the sound is fantastic and crisp, due to the speakers on each side, almost like surround sound! One thing you should know is that the device does have a tendency to get a bit warm, nothing extremely unusual, pretty typical in fact but you should just be aware of that fact. Minor issue. Still love it and reccommend it!!!******UPDATE 12/17/12 - Sorry this is a bit behind the 8-ball but better late than never!!! Just so you are aware, Amazon has posted an update for the Kindle. Doesn't work on the lower end models. This is the text of the update taken from the forums: \"We have a new, free software update available for Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire Second Generation. The software update will be delivered automatically via wireless to your Kindle in the coming weeks. These software updates will include: *Kindle FreeTime, a tablet experience just for kids allowing parents to set daily screen time limits, and give access to appropriate content for each child. *A setting so customers can control whether or not personalized recommendations appear below the carousel on the device homepage. *Ability for customers to set the default device language to one of six languages, including English (US), English (UK), German, French, Italian, and Spanish.

If you have any questions related to this release, please visit the Kindle Help Forum - http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=kindle_help_forum_gd.\"", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad experience", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R1WN5L92AX76A6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since I am getting so many rude comments, I decided to delete the issues and problems I had with this unit.  A little background on myself; WAN Tech, Project Manager for 3 major Internet providers and a telecom specialist for 15 years.  I had purchased the Original Kindle fire and love it.  You may search my reviews to see that I am credible.I am currently on my 3rd replacement of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with 64GB.  The current unit is working, but the previous two had major issues regarding WiFi/4G connectivity and memory problems to the point where the units were useless and had to be replaced.I would not recommend this unit for the following reasons....1) Many android apps on the Amazon store do not work, or harm the unit. For example the app called \"Locate my Kindle\" (now removed by Amazon) has harmed over 130 kindle fire units.2) It appears that memory management software may be, or has been defective.  Hopefully the last update has cured this.For a synopsis of the memory problems I had with unit number 2, you may visit the kindle forum at the Amazon link below ....http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=kindle_help_forum__rvt_np?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1GLDPZMNR1X53&cdPage;=2&cdThread;=TxBRLZ21QQBP22#CustomerDiscussionsNew==================================Now that my third Kindle Fire HD 8.9 64GB is working, I feel I can write a full review of what I like and don't like.1) Email Support.  The embedded email app works well.  I use the MSN Outlook platform, and it even supports multiple sub email boxes.  This is better than the Kindle Fire Original app. 4 of 5 stars.2) Music.  The music app is fine.  However it does not let you add a new song to one that is playing like the Original Kindle Fire.  However, the work-around for that is simply to play a song, then while listening to it, build a new play list.  You can sort by Albums, Artists, and Songs. 3 of 5 stars3) Sound.  The sound of the internal speakers is ok.  The Amazon marketing department use words such as \"Booming\".  No, they don't boom.  They are loud enough for two people to watch a movie without headphones.  They do have good stereo separation thanks to Dolby.  However, if you really want a good experience with sound, get yourself a very good set of ear buds and enjoy, then, and only then, does the Kindle Fire HD actually BOOM.  2 of 5 stars4) Movies.  I have to say that this was the whole reason I got the 8.9 64gb unit.  And, I have had nothing but problems in this area.  But (cross my fingers) I hope third time is a charm.  So, lets say it like this .... When the unit is working well, the screen has excellent resolution when playing movies.  You can download them from the Amazon store with different resolutions depending on the quality of playback you want as well as how much memory storage you have left.  3 of 5 stars5) HDMI Output.  This is a new feature and I do like it.  However, be very careful when looking at cables for this.  The first one I purchased was HDMI rated, but the video quality sucks with it, even though I downloaded the movie in the highest definition.  I would buy one that said HDMI with HIGH SPEED.  That should be the best one.  4 of 5 stars.6) Video Quality.  The screen on the HD unit is good.  When displaying icons for music and menu functions, it is totally clear and easy to read.  When watching an action movie, the screen keeps up with the fast moving scenes quite well.  Further, there is an auto-dimming function that works really good with my 3rd unit, that didn't work well at all with my first two units. 5 of 5 stars.7) Amazon App Store.  Apps are limited and have a much lower selection than those available for other Android tablets.  Further, apps that work on other android devices simply do not work on certain models of the Kindle Fire (such as the HD).  However, if you read the reviews, most of the time you'll be fine.  But, don't expect that just because an app is in the Amazon store that it wont harm your Kindle Fire.  There is some history of damaging apps that are on or have been on the Amazon Store.  I suggest reading the reviews carefully before downloading ANY applications for the Kindle Fire HD.  0 of 5 stars8) Amazon Tech Support.  I work during the day, so I have found that when I call in for technical support I usually get someone that is from another country and has a difficult time understanding what I am saying, or I get someone else in the USA that doesn't have any technical knowledge at all.  So I would have to say they simply don't have any technical support that is any good at all.  Further, if you are a tech head like myself, and find a problem with the unit, the really only viable option is simply sending it back and purchasing another one.  To get an exchange is next to impossible without using colorful metaphors. 0 of 5 stars.9) WiFi Wireless.  Simply awesome!  They really did their homework on this function and they deserve to use all the really dramatic marketing buzz words they wish.  It simply is really good, it works from a long distance, and is quick to sync up with a network. 5 of 5 stars.10) AT&T; 4G.  Not as good as I had hoped.  First of all, if you leave your 4G on, you wont have much battery life left is just a few hours.  So, some of the really cool texting apps are out of the question when using the 4G.  Further, when you turn it on, it can take 2-3 minutes to sync up, sometimes even longer.  It seems to bounce around from the regular AT&T; network and the 4G as if it didn't know that it only should work on the 4G network.  Although I do like the promotional plan they give for $50 for one year because it seems to be great for me if I am just checking email, facebook or my stocks.  2 of 5 stars11) Silk Web Browser.  When this came out for the Original Kindle Fire, there was a lot of hype about the Silk browser. Personally, I think it was, and still is just that, hype.  The browser is slow to launch and will display that its ready, but then you start to type something and it isn't.  Only a few seconds later you realize that you typed your UserID and Password to your bank and the Silk browser wasn't actually in secure mode - which is a little alarming.  Sometimes the Keyboard doesn't show up when you want it to, and sometimes its just slow to show up.  Also, if you are new to Tablet browsing, realize that Flash is no longer supported.  Although there are work-arounds for that (side-loading a different browser), be prepared to start getting a little more tech savvy in regards to that.  3 of 5 stars.12) Battery Life.  Its not so good.  I have really learned to use the Airplane mode which shuts off the WiFi and the 4G antennas from searching for a network, when I know there isn't one.  Also, if I leave on the WiFi and 4G, the other choice is simply to power down the unit.  The only problem with that is that it takes a bit to power back on.  If you are looking for a battery application, I would advise against the Free Battery HD app.  I had a lot of problems with it and do not recommend it.  2 of 513) Amazon Shopping.  I have not had the best experience in the last several months with Amazon shopping.  This hasn't always been the case.  However, in the last 4-6 months, I have returned about 30% of the items due to issues with the items.  You are welcome to view my reviews for more details on those.  Suffice to say, I avoid Amazon shopping unless there are absolute glowing reviews AND the item is a good value.  Otherwise I shop elsewhere.  Further, the merchants have been quite rude.  Several have tried to bribe me to change my review with cash. I suppose if they didn't have ethics when they shipped me a defective item, there would be no reason for me to think they would have ethics later.  Suffice to say I did not accept their bribe - the negative reviews stand.  0 of 514) Camera.  It comes with only one camera that faces you when you look at the screen.  This is good for Skype.  You can still take photos with it (get an app), it just takes a little more mental coordination when shooting scenes. But I have shot photos that way and it works pretty well. It would have been nice to have two cameras though.  3 of 5 stars.15) Sync/power and HDMI receptacles.  The placement of the these probably has to do with a future accessory stand.  However, depending on the design of the optional case you purchase, you may not be able to keep the unit charging while viewing it, especially in landscape mode while watching a movie.  4 of 5.16) Power and Volume Buttons.  The power button on the Original Kindle Fire actually lit up and depending on the color, you could tell if the unit was fully charged, or was charging.  This does not have that function on the button itself.  Further, the button protrudes from the unit, which makes it easy to accidentally turn off.  However, some of the optional cases actually help with this problem.  The volume button is a new addition to the Kindle Fire.  With the Original Kindle Fire, you had to used the on-screen volume in order to change the volume.  This wasn't always compatible with some apps.  So, this is a good addition. 4 of 5 stars.17) Included Accessories.  You get a nice cardboard box and a sync cable.  You can buy the Amazon Charger with the unit for a discount.  The retail is around $20, but when you buy it with the unit its about half price.  The charger is mandatory.  My personal opinion is that it should be included especially for the price that we are paying for this 64GB unit.  The optional charger (which really isn't an option) does not come with a sync cord, you use the sync cord that came with the unit.  Since I mentioned the box, I would make sure and keep it if you have to return the Kindle Fire. 0 of 5 stars.18) Blue Tooth.  I have re-written this section of my review. The blue tooth function is poor.  It seems to drop blue tooth functionality quite often, no matter what the Blue Tooth device is.  This is especially a problem when running the skype application with a blue tooth headset.  I have tried this with the Kinovo and the Rocketfish headset, but both drop about 20 minutes into a call and can not be reestablished unless I completely do a hard reboot of the Kindle Fire.  Obviously there is some sort of a software problem with the Blue Tooth.  Hopefully this will be resolved in the future.  0 of 5 stars.19) Value.  When my #2 unit failed due to memory issues, I did take a hard look at the options out there for other brands.  This unit is unique because it has some nice options that others don't especially if you love movies like I do.  As an independent telecom project manager, I have a history of flying around the country working with my clients on their WAN projects.  This unit does especially well (when the Kindle Fire itself is working) with Email (great for work and home email accounts), playing HD movies (Entertainment; because of the larger screen and extra memory storage), music, and access to documents on the cloud.  That boils down to a large HD Screen, cloud storage, and the large internal storage (64GB).  Further, when I can't access the WiFi network, I can switch to the AT&T; 4G network to get email.  Those features on the IPAD Mini still cost more than the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G 64GB.  Further, the next popular choice would have been the Nexus 7, but the internal storage is half of the Kindle Fire.  And although its about half the price, that simple doesn't suit my needs.  So, I'd have to say, as long as all the features of the Kindle Fire actually work as advertised, its value is 4 of 5 stars.All the ratings I have given are my honest opinion with the 3rd unit that is working (but still having issues with Blue Tooth).  My overall rating is still 1 star since I purchased the unit over two months ago and I have finally got a unit that is working. And for those that don't like negative reviews, I am sorry.  I write my own personal review the way Amazon intended so that people can read my experience and determine if it will work for them.  Simply writing glowing reviews without any attention to detail never helped any future customer.  And although I have been accused of not actually purchasing a Kindle Fire HD, please note that this is indeed a verified purchase.  And for those still intent on shooting down the author of a negative review by insulting my credibility,  please realize that I am in my late 40's, I am a telecom and network specialist and have worked as a project manager for no less than 5 major telecom companies.  Suffice to say I've been around computers for a very long time.Absolute Essentials to buy with the Kindle Fire1) Home Charger.  Find it at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GWO5WK/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00You cant fully charge the HD without it. 5 of 5 stars2) USB Charging Cord.  The cord that comes with the unit from Amazon is ok, but if you want to keep charging the unit while in landscape mode with the rooCase (see below) you need a USB cable that has a right angle to the left.  I've tried a few cords like this, and this is the best one that is durable and is rated for the higher voltage charging. The right angle to the left is important so as to not get in the way of the HDMI port.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJCC2TQ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  .  5 of 5 stars3) rooCASE Origami Dual-View. Find it at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097FLMVK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00The case is needed to protect the unit, plus offer multiple viewing angles. 5 of 5 stars4) ReVIVE Series DualFLUX DC to USB Rapid Car Charger. Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OTESFK/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00The car charger provides the higher power needed to charge your Kindle HD while on the road. 5 of 5 stars5) Silver Executive Stylus Pen 2-in-1 Combo for Business Professionals.

Quite good! 5 of 5 stars", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon Kindle HD 8.9\" Makes Boredom Extinct", "Author": "Gregory S. MacBeth \"\"Be polite, be profes...", "ReviewID": "R7QCK5G4MM6BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned two Kindle devices one of which was the original Kindle.  Both of which I have been very happy with.  If you are planning on buying a tablet for e-reading and want some of the benefits of a tablet (Web, email, music, or videos), then the Kindle is the best way to go.  If you are buying a tablet for business purposes primarily, then you would be better served with a Nexus 10 from Google.For personal use, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", is the best device on the market this Christmas 2012.  It provides the perfect balance between hardware to power use, which allows the user to have a device that runs for a long time, 10 hours, for reading, music, videos, and games.  When you add in the power of Amazon Integration, users are blessed with vast sources of books, music, videos, and games/apps that will make becoming bored nearly impossible.Reading Books:The typeface is amazing on the new Kindle Fire HD.  There is no eye strain and the controls easily allow you to change the font type, size, margin, and background colors.  Outside, the screen displays the page easily in full light of day with no glare.  Amazon didn't include any frills such as page turning animations like you see with the Google Books or Nook, but never the less, turning pages is easily done with a swipe.  Highlighting is easily done and seen by the viewer.  Buying books is simple and can be completed by any educated person.  The size of 8.9\", in my humble opinion, is the perfect size.  It allows you to see a real page of text from a book, which is great because it gives you the actual feeling of reading from a book.  Whereas a 7' screen never really shows you an actual page of text .  A 10.1\" screen will show you a screen of text on a page but it is slightly harder to hold in your hands.The only real downside is that Amazon continues to use their places rather than actual page numbers in many books.Music:The devices comes with two great speakers which allow you to play your favorite tunes loud enough to hear in almost any venue.  The Amazon Music store offers great deals with $3, $5 and discounted music on any genre of you desire.  You can make playlists to organize your tunes easily.Video:With a 1080p HD screen supporting a resolution of 1920 x 1200 you will enjoy movies all your movies and if you are an Amazon Prime customer, many will be free.  The Amazon store offers a wide range of movies for all interests.  If you can't find it in the Amazon store you can always use Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO or Youtube.Web/Email:You easily browse the web using Amazon proprietary browser Silk or you can download Firefox or Dolphin.  With these choices you can access almost any site with the exception of parts of sites that use Adobe Flash which is no longer supported on Android after version 4.  There are also apps for accessing your email which provide access to almost any provider.  Please understand that if you are a power email user, you will have to use the browser to access full GMail functionality, which is easy to do.Apps:One of the first things you will want to do is disable the feature that allows only Amazon store apps.  This way you can put apps like Nook or Zinio on your Kindle Fire HD.  Now you have a fully functional tablet...  But seriously folks, the app store is not as full as Google's store but for most major apps if they exist in Google's store, they will be published in Amazon's store too.Hardware:In general, the device feels solid in your hands.  It weighs in at 20 oz which is a little heavy.  The speakers are nice quality and sound clearly when used with clean country music or distorted head banger styles.  The 1.5 GHz Dual core processor is more than enough to power this device for personal use as an e-reader or personal web browser and email.  It powers the music and video with great quality giving the user High Definition on a 8.9\" screen.Screen:The screen is amazing in that it is brilliantly colorful, has a great resolution, and is easy on your eyes during reading.  With a resolution of 1920 x 1200 you will easily be able to watch videos in full HD brilliance and to be honest anything beyond this resolution in this size of a screen is overkill that is just using more power.  The glass is strong, but I would recommend a case and a screen saver to prevent scratching.Battery:Battery life is great in the device and you could easily fly from New York to Los Angeles on one charge.  The device recharges quickly when you use the additional cost charger which is a must buy unless of course you have existing Samsung or Motorola mobility devices that use micro USB in which case you can share the cable and chargers with your new Kindle.Wi-Fi connectivity:The new Dual Band capability is a big benefit as most routers contain G and N functionality allowing for greater range of connectivity from the wireless base station.Memory:With options for 16GB or 32GB you will have plenty of room.  People fail to realize just how big a GB is.  For the average person 16GB will more than do.  If you are a music nut or video freak there is the 32GB option, but to make your life easy Amazon includes free Amazon Cloud storage for media purchased from their store.  This is great because you can access your movies from XBOX, Roku or Google TV devices.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value, beautiful device for media.", "Author": "Tracey Fox", "ReviewID": "R3TQ7KTJ2K5GLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, and love it.  When I decided to get something larger to use for out of town travel, I considered just about everything out there, but ended up purchasing the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.  I couldn't be happier! I put my hands on as many tablets as possible in the stores to make sure I was making an informed decision.  I even considered plunking down $600+ on the new ipad with retina display; also seriously considered the top of the line Toshiba tablet (has a great screen, among other things, but not as sharp as the Fire).  In the end, it was price and SOUND that made my decision.  I use my Kindle Fires mostly for music, web and video (aside from reading, of course).  The screen on the 8.9 is absolutely gorgeous!  Yes, the retina dispay on ipad is also fantastic, but the difference was not worth nearly twice the price, IMHO.  But where Kindle blew everyone away was the sound.  The stereo speakers on both sizes cannot be beat.  I literally had to put the speaker of the Toshiba up to my ear to hear it on the loudest setting in the quite noisy store I was in.  A few short steps away, in the same noisy crowd, the Kindle speakers were loud and crystal-clear, and not even all the way up.  I can really crank it up and rarely get any distortion.  Don't worry about the youtube app,etc.  There are plenty of instructions to be found on the net for loading apps like that onto your Kindle Fire.  Took me only a couple of minutes, and the app works just fine.  The silk web browser is fast, and I have no complaints about it.  A word about the ads vs ad-free argument: Unless you reeeeaaallly want to look at a picture of your kids or whatever for the few seconds your lock screen will be seen, I wouldn't bother cancelling the ads.  Even the \"suggestions\" at the bottom of the carousel are unobtrusive, and don't even show in landscape mode.  It's only $15 to opt out if it really bothers you, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I used that $15 to buy a magazine subscription to enjoy on my awesome new toy!  I picked up the case made by Amazon, which to me is a must, and will be adding an anti-glare screen protector.  The Fire already has less glare than anything else I looked at, but I still like the protectors. Some things to take into consideration about my review: I do have alot of Amazon content.  Now, I know full well I could still have taken full advantage of my Amazon content from another tablet, but it may make a difference to some of you reading this.  I am not a gamer, and I don't have 500 time-wasting apps on my phone or Kindle, nor do I want them.  And last, I am not and have never been a die-hard Apple fan.  They make great products, but so do other companies.  If you are someone who will not be happy with anything but an ipad, please do yourself a favor and buy one.  Please don't buy this great Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and then return it and post a negative review because it's not an ipad.  I hope my review helps someone!  Thanks for reading.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet with some Tweaks/get Dolphin Web Browser", "Author": "Trent", "ReviewID": "R3LDEQ74UDEZYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Kindle Fire 1st gen, and decided to go with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" since it solved some of the issues I had with the first one.  There are plenty of reviews about what the tablet functionality includes, so I'll only cover some basic things about how it compares to the first gen Kindle Fire and some notable items about how to improve the HD with better apps. Toward the bottom of this review I provide instructions to installing the Dolphin Web Browser, which is the single best thing you can do to improve the Kindle Fire HD.A few notable improvements from the Kindle Fire 1st Generation:* Volume buttons: this is huge! Big improvement. Although I think the buttons should be separated a little to tell them apart, or be physical different somehow to tell which one is increase or decrease.* Freetime: huge improvement. I don't worry about giving it to my kids any more, and my kids love it!* Generally it's more responsive, the screen is better quality, and I like the size much more. As far as the screen goes my 7\" Kindle Fire was good for reading books, but not so much for browsing the internet. If I needed/wanted to browse for something I'd usually fire up my laptop for a full browser.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" larger screen and resolution makes a huge difference. I'm no longer using my laptop as much and able to more quickly look up things I need on the Kindle. It's a full tablet! Of course, this is also a slight negative--I could fit my old Kindle in some pant and coat pockets so it was easier to take around with me. I can't do that, and I'm taking it with me more. I'm a little more afraid of losing it.Now a few things about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" specifically:* Overall I like much of it. The UI is great for novice and intermediate users. I'm an advanced user, and I still think it works pretty well for my purposes with a few simple enhancements I'll mention below.  If you like Amazon's platform and have Prime, it's a no-brainer. Free books via the Lending Library or just free titles is great!* Video is a real standout with this: I'm going to cancel my subscription to Netflix now! Netflix's catalog is going downhill quick, and is still terribly difficult to search for good content. On the flipside, Amazon's Instant Video on the Fire is now much better! I love how the free Instant Video is the 1st option when opening the video tab, and how they have shortcuts immediately to Editors Pick and Just for kids. Makes it simple to find good video, and it looks great output to my TV in HD.  I've also installed the HBO To Go app and found it's awesome as well. HBO directly on it! I've also found myself just watching video on the Fire instead of plugging it up to my TV or turning on my TiVo for the same content--just easier.* Integration with Audible is awesome! I used Audible several years ago and found when I logged in dozens of old Audio books I can download in a moment, with great quality.  It almost makes me want to go back to Audible. I use Overdrive now and borrow from my local public library to my iPod, so probably will still do that.* Books:  it's a great ebook reader. I hate to say it but I prefer most books to be on my Kindle now. Don't forget you can get them from your public library as well (search for Overdrive!). One negative is that I can't put books into folders and I have a lot of books. Oh well...* Integration with Amazon's cloud drive for music and files works great as well. Not much to say but it works flawlessly.The device is great but does have some flaws:* Most notably, Silk is a terrible web browser. Mine crashes continually and is very slow. Even after turning off \"acceleration\" it's slow.  See a fix below for this.* The battery life is so-so. I'm getting around 6-7 hours of use before the battery is dead.* It really should have a forward looking camera.* It would be very nice if Amazon allowed more advanced control over the settings of the device.  There are tons of things I'd like to customize, but since this is a more controlled environment than other Android tablets, I just can't. One example:  I get lots of email for work and personal use, and as a result I don't like audible email notifications. However, when I turn those off I lose all notifications. There isn't an ability to still show the new mail icon unless you have audio notifications!Overall, I love my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". I have had some frustrations so I'll share how I've fixed those below:* Web browser: GET THE DOLPHIN WEB BROWSER. Most people don't know this, but you can get a different web browser. You can also get plenty of other apps than what is available in the app store. Here's how: o Set your Kindle to allow installing unknown applications: Settings > Device > Allow Installation of Applications = On. o Install the One Mobile Market (independent market place). Amazon won't let me give a URL for this, so just Google \"1 Mobile Market\" or go to 1Market d o t com. This gives you the ability to install pretty much ANY Android application (with some functional limitations). o Once installing One Mobile Market launch it and search for the Dolphin Browser. This browser works great and is much faster than Silk. It has more options to control privacy and other features. The only negative is that you can't change the Kindle's default \"Web\" menu item to open Dolphin--you'll just need to add it to your Favorite's menu.* One you install the One Mobile Market and Dolphin also install: o Youtube. Must have. o OneNote (great notetaking product from Microsoft that allows you to sync notes to the cloud) o Anything else you want--just remember that anything that relies on Google's framework functionality won't work without rooting your device. Generally, if an app is already in Amazon's store, get it there so you ensure it works with the Kindle. o AirDroid: This is an amazing tool that allows you to access your Kindle from any web browser to copy files between your computer and Kindle--pictures, etc, and do other advanced tasks. o Flash: While in Dolphin, find a Flash APK file to download. I had a link here but Amazon removed it. Instead, just BING for \"flash_player_ics.apk\". Currently the top link at Bing is the file you need directly from Macromedia's servers.* In the Amazon App Store make sure you download these key must-haves: o Slacker Radio--Spotify and Pandora have better PR, but Slacker is better IMO. Radio + choose your own music, and if you pay $10 a month you can listen to anything you want, any time. o NetFlix o GSam Battery Monitor o MapQuest--It's surprisingly good. You can also download Google Maps from 1 Mobile Market, but it doesn't work great due to bugs running on the Kindle.UPDATE 12/3/12:Two additional items I realized I should mention:* I didn't mind the Fire didn't come with a charger. I bought this instead: PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger for Apple iPad 2, New iPad 3, Amazon Kindle, Kindle DX, Kindle Fire / Noble Nook Color / HTC Flyer / Samsung Galaxy Tab Series (USB Cable not included) - White. This has 2 USB ports and works at a high-enough amperage to charge the Fire quickly.* I bought the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Ink Blue (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"). I gave that 4 stars in my review there. It's really great as well but just a little overpriced.UPDATE 1/7/13:I still love my Fire, but wanted to write a quick update about Kindle FreeTime. The Kindle FreeTime function is great -- it helps kids have their own area on the device that is locked down to the items you let them have, so they don't accidentally start buying stuff on Amazon or send emails on your behalf.The key thing though is Kindle FreeTime \"Unlimited\". This is the monthly subscription service that gives your kids immediate access to hundreds of books, apps, and videos. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId;=1000863021). I used this for the 30 day trial for my two kids, and it is a huge benefit. My kids love my Kindle now because there is so much to do on it--and it's not just Angry Birds. They watch movies--even educational videos like Reading Rainbow, read books, and play apps that are educational. Last night I watched my 8 year old son help my 5 year old daughter play a learning game for 45 minutes--what is this animal, what sound does it make, etc. For $6.99 per month it's a huge value--worth every penny!", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "If You Really Want to Know the Truth", "Author": "Book Fanatic", "ReviewID": "R3PGT8A3O26AWC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, people who give a product a 1 or 2 star review because of one issue don't get the point of reviews.  They should reflect the overall experience so people can get a fair idea of what they might be buying. Secondly many people are dinging this product because of a lack of flash.  Get over it people!  It's not Amazon's fault.  Adobe doesn't support flash on ANY new Android device.The Good:The display is outstanding.  I cannot see any pixelation in text and even the tiniest fonts are clear and sharp.  The HD video is outstanding.The reading experience on books is far superior to the original Fire with a much more pleasing to the eye experience.The size is perfect.  10 inch tablets are too big and 7 inch (including the original Fire) are too small.  I love this 8.9 inch device.I am not experiencing the slowness in browsing some are reporting.  I have an excellent connection on wifi and maybe that is why.  I would note however that I bought the original Kindle Fire and after a few updates to the firmware Amazon fixed many of the problems with browsing.  The speed on this device is far superior to the original fire and it does have a better wifi signal sitting side by side in my home.The bluetooth is a huge plus over the original Kindle.  I'm typing this with a bluetooth keyboard and I love it!  I have a quality logitech keyboard.  Don't cheap out on your keyboard.  I haven't tried a mouse.  I also have connected to external bluetooth speakers and it works great.  Love that sound!Everyone and their Grandmother is complaining about the fact you can't install non-Amazon apps.  OK, that is NOT true.  You can and I side-loaded multiple apps that work beautifully on this device and some that looked awful.  There are massive amounts of Android apps not available on the Amazon app store that work perfect if side-loaded.  Side-loading does NOT invalidate your warranty.  Just don't root it unless you know what you are doing.  Side-loading means changing your default setting to allow unknown apps to install (See Amazon allows this!).  Then get the apk file on your device and tap it.  The Kindle will install it.  You can do this in many ways, to me the easiest is to simply download them from dropbox or something like that.The Not So Good:If it wasn't for the hype the speakers on this device would be in the good.  I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality after Amazon's \"Booming Dolby\" hype.  As I've listened to it subsequently I like it better.  For a tablet it is actually quite good, but frankly listening to music or a movie on this thing can't even begin to compare to what you get even with fairly cheap external speakers.  The good thing is I can pipe it to speakers via bluetooth.  Don't get me wrong, the speakers are tablet good but do not live up to the advertisement.I have never liked Amazon's user interface.  I much prefer a native Android interface.  On my original Kindle Fire I installed GO Launcher but I've read it doesn't work on this device.  Apparently there are some that do and I assume more will as time passes.  Come on Amazon you can do better than this and STILL push people towards your content.  There is very little difference in the interface over the original fire.  Yes there are some improvements but they are incremental and the UI remains much the same.The build quality seems to be good overall but the power and volume buttons are very hard to feel and figure out which is up or down.  That's a mistake.  You get used to it but that is going to bother a lot of people.There is no charging light and that irked me because I like to walk by and see the green light on my original Fire and know it is charged.  With this one you have to hit the power button and unlock the screen.  A light would have cost more but it probably would be worth it.The app market on Amazon is limited even compared to the original Fire.  I assume that is because the apps aren't ready and that is not Amazon's fault.  For example I side-loaded an app I have on my original Fire that I got from the store that is not available on this one.  It looked horrible.  We have to wait for the developers to update apps.  This is to be expected and I don't blame Amazon, but you need to be aware of this.Summary:This is a darn good device.  The reason it is inexpensive compared to similar devices is because Amazon sells at cost and they left a few features out.  You get what you pay for but with this device you are getting more than you pay for because Amazon hopes to make money off of your content purchases, but you don't have to buy a thing.  People need to quit complaining about stupid stuff like chargers.  OMG, I have numerous charges that work with this device.  Pay 10 bucks if you want a fast one.It would be an even better buy if it had a rear-facing camera.  Well gee it would cost more too so I'm glad it doesn't.  Yes I would use it some but I can click a photo with my cell phone too.For the money this is great hardware and a good experience.  If you want a pure Android experience DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE AND THEN COMPLAIN.  Do a little research first.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Why I bought a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" and how I made it useful", "Author": "Granddaddy", "ReviewID": "R3A1F4FY18DQ1S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Posted on 1/7/2013, this is an update to my comments about the Kindle's weight that I posted on 12/12/2012. I've now had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" WiFi 32GB with Special Offers tablet for one month. My experiences might help others assess their \"need\" for this tablet.Many of the 1-star reviews of the KFHD8.9 remind me of the time some decades ago when a famous consumer reporting magazine gave a poor rating to America's favorite sports car because \"it still only seats two.\"When buying a product, I want to know what that product claims to be, what it really is, and whether any of it is of any use to me at all.In December I thought I might \"need\" a tablet device. This despite the fact that I've never used a smart phone and I hate laptop computers. I figured that poking a screen with a finger is crude at best when compared to the precision, flexibility, and speed of a touch typist using a keyboard/mouse combination. Giving up a multi-tasking windowed environment seemed like stepping backwards a few decades.I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 32 GB WiFi with Special Offers based on Amazon's description and on user comments and reviews that persuaded me it could do the several media viewing tasks that I had in mind.My biggest surprise was that Amazon seems not to realize that a 32 GB tablet is far more than a media display device. It is in fact an information and entertainment system. As such it requires tools to manage large quantities of information stored in thousands of files. Not acting on this fact is the same mistake made by so many when hard disks first appeared and transformed desktop computers from simple data manipulation devices to systems that required management.Developing and refining management tools for the desktop has taken 30 years and is continuing. Hopefully Amazon will learn more quickly what it is selling. For now, the KFHD8.9 lacks the most basic organizational tools. Fortunately, independent software developers are working on apps that enable us to make the Kindle useful.Here are the 6 things I wanted to do with a tablet, along with a brief summary of how I made the KFHD8.9 useful for each task.SIX TASKS FOR MY KINDLE1.) Play home videos for my elderly mother so she can see her great granddaughters on her big screen TV.  This finally succeeded just yesterday when another Kindle owner recommended the free app BSPlayer Lite. I had produced some mp4 videos of dance and piano recitals from my AVCHD files. These mp4's played flawlessly on my desktop PC using several mp4 players. I then copied the files to my Kindle using the USB cable. I then connected the Kindle to my mother's TV using an HDMI cable.  The Kindle Personal Videos app and two other video player apps stumbled where the videos included crossfades between scenes or where there were scrolling credits over a still image. The sound continued but the progress of the video display halted for a few seconds and then jumped ahead. ES File Explorer crashed completely when I tried to use it's built-in player to open an mp4 file. I assume there is a bug in these apps or in the codecs included with the Kindle that will eventually be fixed. Meanwhile, BSPlayer Lite is the only app I've found that plays my mp4 files smoothly.2.) Streaming HiDef Netflix video to a big screen TV  This works well with no additional software. I previously used a Wii game machine (which is not HiDef) to stream Netflix. I connected my Kindle to the TV with a 15' HDMI cable that allows me to sit in my recliner with the Kindle and watch streaming video on my HiDef TV. This saved me the cost of buying some other network HiDef video streaming device.3.) Replace old iPod Nano 2nd generation for listening to podcasts.  I listen to podcasts several hours each week with my iPod always connected to one of my stereo systems. Using the Kindle for podcast listening almost didn't work in any useful way. The iPod is well integrated with iTunes self-organizing playlist system based on attributes of each mp3 file. In contrast, the Kindle has only rudimentary tools for organizing podcasts and music.  Fortunately, Amazon had a 99 cent offer that called my attention to iSyncr and the free Rocket Music Player. These can be synced to my iTunes playlists on my PC. I am now well on the way to making the Kindle into a useful podcast organizing and listening device. This saves me the cost of buying a new iPod or other mp3 player.  The rave reviews about the Kindle speakers imply to me that most small devices have really terrible speakers or that no one knows any more what high fidelity sound is meant to be. These tiny speakers have minimal usefulness, though they do beat listening through iPod earbuds.4.) Browsing the web when away from desktop  This works pretty well. The Silk browser has never crashed since I started using it. I have no more trouble with it than I do with Internet Explorer on my desktop PC. Silk is fine for casual surfing and quick lookups. It is utterly inadequate for serious research and writing. Especially it lacks a robust method of managing a lot of bookmarks or of keeping multiple tabs open for instantaneous switching among pages. (On my desktop PC I have some 2,500 bookmarks organized into 140 folders.) Clicking links with a finger can be trying on some web pages. A stylus was less helpful than I had expected. A severe fault is that you have no control over where Silk puts downloaded files. They all go to the Downloads folder and you need another app to find them and move them where you want them.5.) Reading books and technical papers in many formats, especially PDF  I have never liked reading books on my computer and I doubted I would like it on the Kindle. My opinion is slowly changing now that I have loaded dozens of PDF files and Mobi files (all free) from various web sites and from my public library. The free Adobe reader has basic markup capabilities, though it's far less capable than what I am accustomed to with FoxIt Reader on my PC. With the Kindle I can read longer documents in a comfortable chair instead of at my desktop.  A major deficiency is that bookseller Amazon provides almost no means for organizing books and documents. Fortunately, on my first day with the Kindle I found the free ES File Explorer that enables me to work with documents much as I do using Windows Explorer on my desktop PC.  Some publishers do not allow network transfer of library electronic books directly to the Kindle. The file must first be downloaded to your PC and then copied to the Kindle over a USB connection. Connecting a networked device through a USB cable seems slightly ridiculous. WiFi File Explorer Pro costs only 99 cents. It lets you copy files to and from the Kindle over WiFi.6.) Playing games  I am not a computer gamer, but I thought my granddaughters would enjoy playing games when they visit a few times each week. Having had to step up to their challenges, I am now addicted to several puzzle games, including Flow Free: Bridges, that can be played by 5-year-olds and by their granddaddy. I've also found that Bubbles is not so mindless as I first thought. It does require some strategy. With Go Free I'm recovering my old love of Go from several decades ago.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSGetting started  Had it running in a few minutes, partly because I had read a lot in advance. The Quick Start card packaged with the Kindle was not much use as it was glued into its slot in the top of the box.On/Off button  A truly terrible button. Some report the Kindle can be accidentally turned off when you brush the on/off button. In contrast, I find it very difficult to turn it on or off when I deliberately press the on/off button. Using a cover with the auto-on feature eliminates most of this annoyance.Weight  Some reviewers think the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is too heavy. With my kitchen/garden scale I determined that the KFHD8.9 with the Marware Revolve case weighs less than most hardbound books I own. Without the case it weighs less than many of my paperbound trade books, and it weighs less than my daughter's iPad. Weight is just not an issue.Weight details added 3/2/2013:Kindle Fire HD 8.9\": 19 oz. (Amazon says 20 on their specs, perhaps my scale is underweighing by 1 oz, doesn't matter)Marware Revolve Case: 13 oz.Combined weight of Kindle + Case: 32 oz.Hardbound books:Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: 40 oz.Bennet's The Book of Virtues: 42 oz.Michener's Hawaii: 39 oz.Paperbound trade books:Mutual Funds for Dummies: 29 oz.Gleick's Chaos: 20 oz.Crockett's Victory Garden: 34 oz.Apple iPad (my daughter weighed hers on her electronic kitchen scale): 23 oz.iPad with cover + integral keyboard: 43 oz.Conclusion: Kindle with Revolve case weighs less than many hardbound books. Kindle alone weighs less than many trade paperbacks. Kindle alone weighs less than iPad. Kindle with case weighs much less than iPad with keyboard case.I'm finding the trick is learning how to hold the Kindle since it is denser and has a different leverage than a printed book. It all depends on what you want to do.Router  My old Netgear WNR2000 N300 router is perfectly adequate for streaming video. I did not have to upgrade to a dual-band router as some have claimed is necessary. CNet describes my router as a no-frills, budget, wireless-N router. I used the free Wifi Analyzer to measure signal strength and channel interference from neighbors houses. I was surprised how strong the signals were from some of my neighbors 50' to 150' away. I have been streaming HiDef video to a room 50' from the router without problems.Battery life  The Kindle runs all day for my purposes of reading, light web browsing, and video watching, along with games with my grandchildren.Charger  I paid attention to the advertising and decided to order the $10 charger. I don't have many portable devices so I don't have spare chargers lying around.Recharging Time (added 3/2/2013)Recharging time for the KFHD8.9 using the Kindle Power Fast charger depends on how low the charge is when you begin charging. Here's some recharging times I observed for overnight charging with WiFi turned off. I read the numbers from the excellent chart made by Battery HD:Starting from 9% charged:to 80% took 2-1/2 hoursto 90% took 3 hoursto 100% took 4 hoursStarting from 28% charged:to 80% took 2 hoursto 90% took 3 hoursto 100% took 3-1/2 hoursFrom 33% charged:to 80% took 1-3/4 hoursto 90% to 2 hours 10 minutesto 100 took 3 hoursFrom a low starting point to about 90% charge is almost a straight line charge. After that the charging rate slows as it approaches 100% charge.Protective cover  A case is an absolutely necessity for me. My one day out with the Kindle in the car (I only used it when I was parked) and at friends' homes was a bit terrifying.Carousel  This is almost useless with its huge icons and incredibly clunky appearance. It's not even a carousel as it does not wrap around. It is simply a linear icon array with no management capabilities except using a long tap to delete a particular item.File Transfer  Transferring files to a networked device over a USB connection is tedious. Amazon provides the Send to Kindle for PC software, but it has bizarre behavior, and I used it only once. The two PDF files I sent using Send to Kindle were first sent to Amazon after which they were sent by Amazon to my Kindle. Perversely, Amazon added nearly 3 dozen random alphabetic characters to the beginning of the filenames. Fortunately, WiFi File Explorer Pro is available for only 99 cents and it does a good job of moving files between your desktop PC and the Kindle without using a USB cable.Lack of significant free apps  The Kindle world has some good free games, but other free apps can be more annoying than useful to the point that they discourage me from upgrading to the supposedly more powerful paid versions. Compared to the Windows world, the Kindle world has a shortage of powerful and useful free apps. Perhaps this will change as the tablet market expands. I have mentioned in this review a few good free to low-priced apps that were vital in making the Kindle a useful device for me.Kindle is boring say some  Not for me. I've been thoroughly engrossed in the details of my Kindle for almost a month. I've had similar learning experiences with unfamiliar technologies over the 30 years I worked with mainframe, DOS, Windows, and Mac computers. It's never boring. (Then I just might be a geek, though a late adopter.)Locked into Amazon say some  Hardly. I've loaded my Kindle with home videos, home photos, and podcasts, and I've been browsing all over the web. I've downloaded books in various formats from a variety of web sites including my public library and Project Gutenberg. I do appreciate that it is very easy to access Amazon when I want to buy something (though I prefer using my desktop PC). You can easily ignore the Amazon tools, though I recommend checking the free app of the day every day. The free trial of Amazon Prime was a revelation to me. I've never paid Amazon shipping charges, having always used the free shipping option that causes slower delivery. With Prime I no longer have to accumulate $25 worth of orders to get free shipping. Even the least expensive items are now just two days away with free shipping. (Yeah, there's an annual membership charge. I'm betting I'll come out ahead.)Special Offers and Other Ads  These ads that appear on the opening splash screen are hardly noticeable, though some have displayed images that are mildly offensive. If some company wants to share sponsorship of my Kindle with other advertisers, good for them. People who walk around with advertising on their sweat shirts, shoes, and pants should hardly be complaining. I have not seen ads popping up randomly, though there are tiny ads in some of the ad-supported free games. Some free games do display full-screen ads. Turning off the WiFi has served to remove them during game play. With Special Offers on the opening splash page I've been surprised at the lack of variety. After the 20th display of the same car at startup I knew that advertisers don't realize that I only buy a car every 15 years or so. Perhaps the lack of variety means few advertisers are buying space on the Kindle.Flash doesn't work  An endless stream of Kindle detractors keep reporting this obvious fact. Adobe discontinued mobile Flash some months before the KFHD8.9 was released. Many imply that the iPad comes with Flash support, which it never did. Steve Jobs published his reasons for not allowing Flash on the iPad nearly 3 years ago. Some credit him for killing Flash, though Flash's many problems, not the least being security and the cookies you may not realize it puts on your device, would have killed it eventually. Not having Flash is less of a problem every day as HTML5 is replacing it (now with support from Adobe). Others have documented the workarounds for those who must have it.GOOD CHOICE AFTER USING ONE MONTH  So far I think the Kindle is proving to be the right choice for a portable device for my specific purposes. If I am still using it after 6 months I'll know I made the right choice.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 64GB 4G - Very Mixed Experience", "Author": "B. Kerr", "ReviewID": "R160RO2SI5VF4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wow, I don't quite know where to start! This is probably the most \"mixed\" review I'm going to write.First off, I had no preconceptions if I was going to like this or not. This is my first tablet, so I have no pre-conceived notions on that front. In fact, I was quite determined to like the Kindle Fire HD, but after 2 weeks of one problem after another, my resolve is wearing down.Please note that this review will also largely revolve around several Kindle Fire HD specific customer service/tech support experiences. I realize that they are not the actual device, but they have a HUGE influence on your experience with the device when something comes up, so I feel that needs to be taken into account too.So, let's start at the beginning. My kindle arrived, and earlier than expected. It was great out of the box, until I tried to register it and it just wouldn't.It seemed straightforward enough, and I'm reasonably tech-savy, but it wouldn't work. Off to tech support. Longish story short, they couldn't register it either, and an hour and two supervisor tech guys later, they managed to register my kindle to my account. In order to do it, they had to create another kindle listing, but oh well. They got it done - great!Next, once I got into the kindle, now that I could use it, I noticed that it was showing the \"offers\" even though I had ordered and paid for without offers. Back to CS to have them turn it off. Should have been quick enough, but oh no.Because there were now 2 Kindle Fire HDs showing, there was confusion. Then because for some reason my order status hadn't updated and my Kindle was still showing as not even having shipped, she kept on telling me that this kindle can't be it, because it hadn't shipped. Again, long story short, I eventually convinced her that I did indeed have the Amazon Kindle in my hand and that it was indeed that order - she set it to no offers and we were good.I then spent a fair bit of time moving my files and stuff to the kindle, uploading and downloading from the cloud, inputting passwords, setting up apps, etc.All that went well and I have to say, I'm loving the screen and the sound on this Kindle. The speed is great too and once I figured out some of the inner workings, I got it nicely customized!That evening, in the middle of a movie, the kindle did a spontanous factory reset and erased everything back to square one! I have NO idea why - it just did.So, I put everything back on. I lost a couple of hours, but at least it was at the very beginning of things - nothing I couldn't put right back in. Ok.A couple more minor malfunctions came up in the following days, one of which led to yet another factory reset as \"the only solution.\"Since this is also a 4G device, I signed up for the AT&T; offer. All went well, I got the confirmations etc.By all rights, the thing should have just been working now, but I kept on getting an error message, saying the SIM card could not be located and to remove it and reinsert it.Since there was no easy way to do this, I called AT&T; customer service in the hopes that they would know what to do. They didn't. In fact, had very little documentation about the Kindle Fire HD 4G yet, and she couldn't even tell me how to remove the SIM card (it's not immediately obvious like it is on a phone btw)Anyway, at their recommendation back to Kindle tech support to find out where the SIM card was for sure and how to open the slot.I spent 20 minutes with somebody that kept on telling me that my device didn't have a SIM card! I kept on telling her that yes indeed it did, I even gave her the SIM card number that the kindle was displaying, and told her that all I needed to know where the card was located, so I could remove it and replace it as instructed, but all I got was repetitive copy and pastes from some manual she must have been consulting.After she finally got that I did have a SIM card, she kept on copying and pasting instructions on how I can purchase the data plan, which I had previously already given all the information of, as well as the information that I bought it, etc.It went on for a while, which led me to believe that she had NO idea what she was talking about, as everything was copy and paste and quite basic manual stuff and only vaguely related to my actual problem. And totally ignoring what I told her I had already tried.Then we did the reset dance again.Reset. Didn't help. Hard reset. Didn't help. And then she got to factory reset. Again.This time I had enough. She kept on saying it was the only way and I'm sorry but my trust in that wasn't that great. This is the person who insisted my Kindle didn't even have a SIM card and now she was insisting that I trust her in believing yet another reset was the only way.Again, long story short, I declined further help on yet another factory reset, as I just wanted to have some time for another solution.Anyway, hopefully this may help somebody else!Turns out that when the Kindle is connected to WIFI, it will say that the SIM card can't be found or may not be present. It gives the standard blurb about removing it, etc. That is a tad misleading. Basically, when it's connected to WIFI it feels no need to be \"seeing\" the SIM card. Once you get out of the WIFI range it sees the card and connects.That I didn't know that is maybe not surprising due to my inexperience, that the error message wording is misleading is unfortunate, but that Kindle Fire Tech Support didn't know that is just tragic. This could have been a one sentence tech support consult! There wasn't even a problem!I am so glad I didn't actually factory reset the kindle - again!So I'm sailing along quite nicely for a few days and I'm loving it! This tablet is really awesome by itself and when it works correctly, all I had hoped for and then some!I have now downloaded what I need for the most part, I have my work documents on it and ordered as I need them. I totally love Kindle Free Time!! There's no fighting about time limits, it says it's all done for today, the kids accept it and happily skip off to do other things! I don't have to worry about my son buying stuff because he can't get out of his area, nobody fights over who's turn it is - it's great!Until last night, when all of a sudden a grey square appeared in the carousel.It's a random grey square that is there instead of the icon for any given app or book. But it's not always the same app. It's truly random. So it's anybody's guess what it might be hiding.I went through the usual reset, hard reset and all that. I deleted the kindle library book that I had gotten last, thinking that maybe it messed things up. Did the resetting game again. The grey square remains. Since I haven't installed anything that wasn't from the kindle store and approved for my device, I'm not sure why it would do it.So back to Tech support I went.And yes,  you guessed it. After repeating all I had done already, the only answer they said they had was: Factory reset! It seems indeed a favorite of the support people. But it's all in the cloud he says, you can download everything again.Yeah, in a few hours! And that's not even counting having to input everything again (passwords etc)I can't keep on doing this!So, for now I'm living with an annoying grey square and having to find my books/apps by guessing, but I've had it with the factory reset and wasting hours putting everything back! It seems something always goes wrong with this device.Never enough to really render the device useless but enough for stuff not to run smoothly. And yes, it is entirely possible/likely that this came from some book or app and has nothing to do with the device, but since the Kindle is so tied in with Amazon and their apps and books, as well as their customer support, this is relevant to the whole package!What's worse, I have no real trust in Amazon tech support right now and don't know if they just say factory reset because it's a catch all and they don't have to deal with anything else, or if it really does require a factory reset! I have no way of telling if it's a big or a small issue!I would hope that on these more sophisticated devices with a large storage capacity, a factory reset is more of a last resort than the first solution to jump to!So in summary:- This tablet, when it works, is awesome!- Seems to have a fair amount of little issues that keep on popping up.- Amazon Customer/Tech support really needs to have a LOT more training on this to be effective with these new devices!- My experience surrounding my ownership of the new Kindle Fire HD 4G has been very mixed due to all the above!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's what I expected", "Author": "missa lou", "ReviewID": "RFKB62ZQSG739", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" WiFi only yesterday and I am loving it.Pro's:-battery life is about 10 hours as is stated.-charging with the power adapter is fast and easy, the USB is great to power it off a computer if I need to.-The speaker system is so much better than it was on the first Kindle Fire, I don't need to use headphones or strain to hear at times.-HD quality is nice and the images are clear and sharp.-X Ray feature is great watching a movie and wanting to learn more.-It has a camera that works with some free apps-Free time will be great when my nieces and nephews come for a visit.-Ad's are built in to the opening screen, so they disappear when I swipe the Kindle Fire open.

I have an iPad and love it. However when I travel the iPad is a little larger then I want to carry on the plane. The kd fire hd 7 was just prefect. Then I thought about the hdmi out. I totally hate that apple makes you buy numerous hdmi adapters for iPod classic, and iPad and I just refuse to buy another one. The kd fire hd 7 again was beautiful. The hdmi out was outstanding, or at least I thought. It puts out a 720p. The kindle fire hd 8.9 puts out 1080p. I have a 60inch tv and it makes for a big difference. That fact sold me into buying the 8.9. I'm so glad I went to the 8.9, yes sold my 7 on amazon and took a $49 loss.  Just love the picture resolution. Books, magazines, tv/movies just look better. Don't think you can go wrong with this unless you're looking for a notebook. Great job amazon. Too, like most people I was surprised and extremely happy to get the kindle 8.9 prior to the Thanksgiving vacation trip.  One last note, the kindle deluxe is also a wonderful ereader for those looking for a larger screen, however, pretty costly but worth it. Update- about to get the otterbox. Not happy with the price but otterbox usually have the best covers period!  update- 1-17-13 I have had the opportunity to download videos and the standard video's look horrible on here while they look like High Def on the iPad.  this made me take away two stars. when I say iPad,I mean the 1st edition not the retina version.

Had thought about writing the entire review with this device, but the more I get into it, don't think that I can do it justice this way, so I'll just make my notes here as I go, then save them to the Amazon Cloud.Of the four different Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" models available at the time of this review, I picked the one that would best fit my personal needs. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB was chosen based on prior experience with the first generation Kindle Fire, as I had found no problems whatsoever with Wi-Fi in my area, either in the home or within the establishments that I visit. Picked the model that includes special offers, as personally they don't bother me a bit.Breaking this down into sections, I'll offer a subjective overview of what's good and not so good, followed by more details.Likes:+ Excellent display; very easy on the eyes, good access to Amazon and to the `Net+ High resolution; 1920x1200 HD display, rich color from all viewing angles+ Strong Wi-Fi connectivity; dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi, fast downloads & video streaming+ Exceptional sound quality; offers true Dolby Surround Sound+ Long battery life; over 10 hours average, measured and confirmed+ No setup needed; ready to go and runs right out of the box+ Built-in micro HDMI port; allows for 1080P to be streamed to the TV+ Prime Instant Videos; unlimited, and so many from which to pick+ Excellent product feel; very solid and comfortable to the hand+ 16GB storage; about 12.7GB available to the user, more on the Cloud+ Good clean styling; minimalist, yet highly functionalDislikes:- No charging indicator light/LED as on 1st generation Kindle Fire- No charger; it could have been factored into the base priceFirst Impressions:Amazon isn't kidding when they offer fast delivery on the new Kindle Fire models. Mine was received within 36 hours from time of ordering, and the minimalist packaging is quite good, with the USB cable stowed in the box lid. Ordered it with the charger, though I already had one from earlier, and immediately charged it even though it comes partially charged. Setup is minimal, making it all so easy. Once it was fully charged, took it online and immediately installed the Battery HD Pro app and ran the full calibration routine as suggested, just as I had done last summer with the original Kindle Fire; this one is highly recommended.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" came preloaded with content already purchased before. The Home screen offers a search bar at the top, with additional groupings below: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, etc. Additional groupings will show up when it's held in landscape mode. Below these there's a carousel of recently viewed material, be it a book, app, web page, movie, etc.Exploring the new Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, it was apparent that this unit is no simple upgrade over the original. The larger 1920x1200 HD display is clearly sharper, compared to 1024 x 600 on my original 7-inch Kindle Fire, and the reduced screen glare is immediately apparent, probably due to its built-in polarizing filter. The colors were deeper and more intense, with darker blacks and even at varied viewing angles. The 1920\u00d71200 HD also helps make text crisp and sharp, and reading books and magazines is a pleasure.The real test came when I tried uploading some ultra-sharp high resolution JPG photos, and was quite pleased at how well they were rendered on the screen. The display on this Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is rated at a very dense 254 pixels per inch (ppi), making it excellent with the 300 & 600 ppi photos that I had uploaded. Tried a few HD videos as well, and the more vivid colors and deeper blacks were apparent, again even at different viewing angles, a step up from my original Kindle Fire.Hardware:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" has a good look and feel. It's actually quite a minimalist device, and is easy to hold even without a case. Measuring slightly less than 9\u00bd x 6\u00bd inches and only 0.35 inch thick, it has beveled edges, which make it feel even thinner. Weighing in at 20 ounces, it has a solid feel, and the screen surface feels quite robust. Some sources have noted that the screen is made from Gorilla Glass, which may account for the solid feel, but that remains to be verified. The power button is a simple pushbutton, which is nearly flush with the device; no snags here.Wi-Fi Connectivity:As noted earlier, I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that is equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity because of earlier experiences with the original Kindle Fire. What I found with this new one was surprising. The product description claims that it offers \"over 40% faster speeds\" due to the dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. Where I live there's plenty of connectivity, but it can dip or stutter now and then. This newer Kindle Fire HD is said to be able to switch automatically between the more congested 2.4 GHz and less congested 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequencies, and I've experienced a longer range and faster overall speed, so it works.Processor & Storage:I never had issues with the performance of the original, but this Kindle Fire HD really does perform faster.  It's probably the combination between its newer dual-core 1.5 GHz TI OMAP4 4470 processor and the improved Imagination SGX544 3D graphics core, but there's a noticeable difference, both in speed and graphics rendering. Videos are smoother and far snappier. As far as storage goes, I picked the 16 GB version as I do not accumulate as much as others. Most of the items stored here are books, magazines, photos, some videos and MP3 music files. The Amazon Cloud is where much of my content is kept, and after a book is read, it goes back there for storage so that it can be pulled when need. Keeps things simple and accessible over multiple devices.Web Browsing:The newest version of Amazon Silk works well on this device and offers faster page loads than previous versions. But one of the first things that I did was to switch the default search to Google. It's a personal thing, easy to do, and it allows me to search just as I would on my Windows PCs and on my MacBook Pro. It's fast, easy, familiar and far less hassle that way. Luckily this Kindle Fire HD makes it easy to do in the settings, and it just takes a few seconds of exploring to do it.There is Facebook integration as well, and you can import your photos from Facebook to your Amazon Cloud Drive and view them there, along with any other photos you may already have placed in your Cloud Drive. But a word of caution here: if importing your images directly from Facebook, you're cannot specify which photos you want to import; you'll end up importing them all. Just be aware of this before you start.Email & Address Book:Email setup was a breeze. I use Gmail as my primary, and it was set up and configured within seconds. Once that was setup, the Gmail address book was simple and smooth, and no problems encountered. The larger screen on this device makes it a breeze to access Gmail, read messages and to reply to them.Accessing Apps:There are a number of apps that I use from Amazon's Appstore for Android, and was most curious to see how these would function on the new device. There's a \"Compatibility with your devices\" checkbox in the upper right of each app, and if it's designed to function on the Kindle Fire HD, there's a green checkbox. Most of the apps that I use have to do with news, travel, photo imaging, word processing, music and utilities. There are a few that won't work on the new device, yet with all of the choices in the Appstore, have yet to find a number of apps to fit my needs. Many of them offer a test drive so that you can decide if it works for you.I'm the wrong one to comment on game performance, as there are very few that I've even tried. The few that I've installed to see what the experience was like seemed to perform well, but not being a gamer, my opinions would be almost worthless.In the Clouds:I've found the Amazon Cloud Drive to be invaluable for storage, and quite easy to use as my freebie backup for books, magazines and apps. But it can also be used to back up documents, photos, videos and other digital files. This review was initially stored on the Amazon Cloud when it was being written, and from there downloaded to my PC for final edits. There's a free desktop app that one can download for access and connection to the Amazon Cloud that makes life easy, and it works well.But my main cloud storage for general use on my PCs and MacBook Pro is the Google Drive, and I looked for an app to install it, but it didn't exist in the Amazon Appstore. There are workarounds, but I hate wasting time hacking apps and interfaces, so I dug deeper... and it was there, in my Gmail settings, along with my address book and the Google+ access. Simple, no hassles, and it works.Sound Quality:Didn't know how well the tiny stereo speakers would work on this version of the Kindle Fire HD would work, but it's said to offer Dolby Digital Plus, and that they were tuned to better reproduce low, bass notes, and without distortion. So I tested it using a particular track that I've used before: Strauss: Introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, also known as the Theme from 2001, A Space Odyssey. This particular pure digital (DDD) track has the full dynamics that can bring your speakers to their knees. Without getting too deep here, the opening ultra low notes could be heard, and the kittle drums were surprisingly clear.This also held up quite well with a couple more music tracks, some films and videos that I watched. Distortion is truly minimal, and there is a slightly different though quite good sound when headphones or external speakers are plugged in. Over it's quite better with stereo sound than anticipated.Bluetooth:Setting up Bluetooth was very easy. I paired it with the Plantronics Voyager Legend headset as an audio alternative and tested it with Skype for future use. No problems encountered, and the audio quality was quite good.Reading Books & Magazines:There's no doubt that the 1920x1200 HD display adds to the enjoyment of reading books and magazines, and the sharper text is very easy on the eyes, especially late at night when one is tired. With the X-Ray for Books feature, you can easily get more info about characters, locations, terms, and historical figures mentioned in a Kindle book, and it also highlights exactly where in the book those details are mentioned, allowing you the ability to jump right to the appropriate page. It also allows you to get biographies and more from Wikipedia and Shelfari.Gripes/Complaints:There's no such thing as a perfect product, and in that this Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" isn't alone. My older 1st generation Kindle Fire has a charging indicator LED built into the power button, and I was surprised to see the lack of the same on this newer product. Let's just call it an irritant. The other gripe is that there was no charger included as there was with the original Kindle Fire, and a decent charger is essential for this device. As of this writing you can get the Amazon Kindle PowerFast charger for about half price, but only if it's ordered at the same time as the Kindle Fire HD, so if you're considering one of these, be sure to order it at the same time.Accessories & Cases:Though the device offers a 10-point multi-touch interface, which is quite good and far superior to the earlier interface from the original Kindle Fire, I've reverted to old habits and use a amPen New Hybrid Stylus for most applications. This one is quite responsive on the screen, and for some of us it's a faster way of working.Also picked up the Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" based on past experience with a smaller one for the original Kindle Fire. This is a solid 4-star product, but the more costly Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", which is made from genuine leather lined with soft microfiber interior, may be a better and more functional choice for many. These are just two among the many to be found here; the choices are yours.Summary:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a solid product, easily worthy of a +4.5 star rating, considering the minor complaints that I've noted above. It has proven to be subjectively the perfect choice for my needs, though yours may vary, and the 4G versions may better suit your needs. The Wi-Fi performance has showed itself to be better than expected, the navigation is quicker than earlier versions, and the higher-resolution screen does a better job displaying menu options. To date I've had no crashed or lockups. It's currently largest tablet Amazon makes at the moment, and it gives you access to all of your Amazon content in high definition. As a multimedia device it has proven to be quite good, and considering how vast Amazon's content offerings are, especially if you're a Prime member, this is probably one of the best media consumption tablets on the market today, and certainly one of the most affordable in its class.12/23/2012", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Big Improvement Over the First Generation Fire", "Author": "R. Angeloni \"slicktiger28\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZ1BGWMISB7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the owner of a first generation Kindle Fire, I was looking forward to a new version of the Fire and preordered the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  I have been using the device for close to a week and so far have been very pleased. This version of the Fire is a big step up over the first generation 7\" Fire, and with key improvements in screen resolution, Bluetooth, sound and even user interface.Screen ResolutionThe HD display is super sharp and vibrant, and this version of the Fire has a polarizing filter and anti-glare technology, to help improve readability at any angle and in direct light situations. E-ink technology (the technology used in the Kindle and other e-readers) will remain the ultimate when it comes to reading outdoors, but the screen resolution of the HD 8.9\" for reading is leaps and bounds better than the first generation Fire, and HD movies and television shows are super clear and vibrant.BluetoothBluetooth is important to me, as I have a number of Bluetooth speakers and like good sound for my movies and music. Setup takes a few seconds. The HD 8.9\" also has Dolby audio and dual stereo speakers if you do not have Bluetooth speakers. While not exactly booming, the sound these speakers produce is much deeper, clearer, and louder than the two speakers included in the first gen Fire.User InterfaceLike the first generation Fire, the HD 8.9\" has a customized Android operating system. For the new Fire, Amazon used Ice Cream Sandwich, Android 4.0. Set-up is extremely easy. The Fire arrives personalized and pre-registered, so as soon as you turn on the device, it immediately walks you through set-up, finds your router/WiFi, and downloads your books and apps.  The most time-consuming part of set-up was downloading the latest software. The user interface also includes a recommendation engine on the home screen, to find similar material. You can also turn this feature off. My device has offers on it, and I don't really find it obtrusive, as they only appear on the lock screen.  The user interface is very intuitive.  Web browsing is fast, and I like the \"Reading View\" feature, which removes unnecessary images or information on a Web site and lets you read or see what you want to see. I also like the \"Trending Now\" feature, which alerts you to Web sites that have a high amount of traffic. X-Ray technology also allows you to do a \"deeper dive\" and to find out more about actors, a scene in a movie or book, etc.SizeContrary to what they say, size is important, especially for tablets. The HD 8.9\" is light and thin, so I am able to hold it and use it with one hand. Swiping makes it easy to move from one page or Web site to another.Other Things to ConsiderIf you like or are connected to the Amazon ecosystem, and have Amazon Prime membership, then the HD 8.9\" is a perfectly designed media consumption device. With access to literally thousands of free movies, television shows, and even books, the Kindle works hard at keeping you easily connected to all of Amazon's content. Of course, if you want to buy something, the Kindle also works hard at making it easy for you to make purchases. The Amazon app store offers thousands of apps, but not as many as the Google Play store or iTunes.Also, text inputting is fine for e-mail or other simple Web applications, but until Amazon or some third party developers come out with a free-standing keyboard, I wouldn't attempt to write a doctoral dissertation or the Great American Novel on this device. E-mail set up for numerous accounts is easy, and this version of the Fire also integrates with Microsoft Outlook Exchange.Overall, I am very pleased with the Kindle HD 8.9\". If you don't mind the fact that the Kindle is totally tied to the Amazon ecosystem, it is a fun and easy-to-use personal entertainment device that is priced considerably less than the competition.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet option...", "Author": "Xurumela", "ReviewID": "R3QU51NE3O98P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire HD with the expectation it would be just a barebones tablet that I could carry anywhere and also eventually replace my notebook at home for day to day web surfing.  Heck, for 299 and a 8.9\" screen it was a no brainer to me.  I initially looked at the very same 7\" model and Nexus tablet, but the screen was just too small and it did not feel \"right\" on the hands.  Being the past owner of an iPad 2 that got destroyed by my kids I went back shopping for a replacement.  The iPad 3 was just too heavy and wayyy too expensive for the kind of use it will have.  Plus, add the kids to the picture, I was not planning on spending over 500 bucks on something that would end up rolling around the house and taking the risk of being destroyed...again...So I took the gamble and went with the 8.9\" HD.  And after only a few days, how surprised I am...Now, I was always a big fan of Amazon, customer service is something I'd pay for and when you get the best price and great customer service all I can tell you is you got my business forever.  With PRIME, this device is a full entertainment powerhouse, I have movies and games for the kids, music on the cloud, books for the wife, a great browser and an unexpected amazing screen.  Watching movies on it is just great, listening to music another big surprise: the speakers are just fantastic...I did not get into the 'dolby' thing, as I thought it would just not make a difference on a small device, but the sound in LOUD and clear.  As for the camera, I understand other reviews mentioning the lack of rear facing camera as a problem...but honestly, I had an iPad for 2 years and NEVER used the rear facing camera.  You simply will not...I do Skype and that is the only need for a camera in a tablet in my opinion (again, different users might disagree).  As for the charger (or lack of), I have at least 5 in my house (cell phones, iPad, iPod, etc, etc).  I just plug my cell phone one on it and done, not a big deal.  And if you are a PRIME subscriber, this device is a NO BRAINER.  Get one !  If not, it is still a great take-along carry-around-the-house gadget, very well built, slim and light.  Screen is very responsive, haven't seen any lag in the Amazon ecosystem Android wrap and the browser is faster than I remember my iPad being.  Maybe I am just overjoyed with the fact I spent so little with no great expectations and got this pleasant surprise.  I do have one complaint (so far): the power and volume buttons are hard to find and to a certain point frustrating...I saw that in the 7\" and was hoping it would be better in the larger form factor but it is still something that needs improvement (Amazon, are you listening ?).  About the ads...really ? I just skip them, so no problem for me.  They are not intrusive as you my think, not at all.

First is the web browser.  It crashed so much, I downloaded an other one (opera - and you'll have to allow non-amazon store apps in the Kindle settings to get any other browser - had to do that for dropbox and some other apps amazon doesn't like...).Email is a disaster.  After setting up about 10 accounts, they worked only for one day (sends but does not receive...).  This has been a known issue for several months but amazon has done nothing to address it.  Your only option is to get another app (K9 - free - is what I got).  There's no problem with \"canned\" email settings - but all mine were \"other providers\" (godaddy and other POP accounts including my business email!).Another issue is the battery life. You  must have to turn it off to conserve power as standby  still eats up the battery life (and this is with no automatic email downloads...).On the plus side, the integration with amazon cloud services (storage and music) is very good and was one of the reasons I gave up my iPad for a Kindle.  Just a note on opening docs - best to have a document app installed as the native doc viewer is really slow for some types.All in all, after spending way too long setting things up, I'm okay with it.

I just received the new Fire 8.9 which I ordered without advertisements. At first glance it is just bigger and heavier. But it has more storage, has a better screen, Bluetooth and a cool mosaic photo display when in landscape position. Yes, I have read the specs and know there is more under the hood but I don't care as long as it works well. I do like the layout of the new carousel and favorites better. I also like that it is harder to move the icons around in favorites. I like to put them in my own order but on the first Fire they would randomly skip across the screen by accident. One big OOOPPPS Amazon made is with the new case. If you are watching a video and you have the cover opened to support the Fire in the landscape position you cannot leave it plugged in. I am sure other companies will get on that soon. I do love the magnetic cover that turns the Fire on and off. I was horrified that there was no 'FLASH' because I watch several video podcasts that are still in flash. However, there is a flash work around. Go to your account, help, forums on the right and type in flash for Fire 8.9. There is a nice lady that has that all organized for you. You basically download a free app (ES File Explorer)  then download an old version of Dolphin Browser to the app and then the flash for Dolphin. It works perfect. Today as I watched my flash video podcast I was amazed at how good the video is on the new HD screen. Also, I actually think my music sounds better on the Fires so I take one to the gym instead of my iPod. I use AblePlanet noise cancelling headphones and ear buds and both are really really good.

I`ve also had a kindle keyboard and original kindle fire.  Was not sure about purchasing the fire hd 8.9 at first but decided i wanted to try the larger screen so i pre-ordered it.  I never did use the kindle fire one handed so the larger size of the fire hd doesn`t bother me.  I love the hd screen and larger size.  Fire hd feels very well constructed.  I found it very easy to use but that may be because i had the kindle fire and so was not a first time user.  It should still prove easy to use for someone who is new to kindle fire.  Fire hd is very fast for surfing the web and watching prime instant videos.  Display is incredible with hd content and sound is good for a tablet.  I really like having the hdmi out port so i can connect it to my home theater.  Some have complained about no charging light like the original fire so you can`t tell when it`s fully charged but while that is an annoyance it`s not enough for me to ding the fire hd in my review.  Be careful how much trust you place in the overly negative reviews.  A lot of them seem to have been written by, a - apple fan boys who feel threatened and so surf the internet writing negative reviews of competing products, b - people with unreasonable expectations i.e. did not fully read product description before purchasing, and lastly, c - people who are not reviewing the fire hd at all but are leaving negative reviews because they have a bone to pick with amazon.

Perhaps our experience can help you decide.", "Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "RUGXCVSU1KKXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review discusses whether or not to buy a Kindle in place of a different platform, such as an iPad.  It also discusses the pros and cons related to purchasing a new 8.9\" HD Kindle Fire as an upgrade to the old Kindle Fire.Maybe you're one of those who would like a tablet, but aren't entirely sure which one to buy.  Should you get an iPad, a NOOK, a Kindle, or some other tablet?  It's a big decision.  In the end, there is not one right decision, just the decision that is right for you.  Only you can make that decision, so I'll tell you our experience and you can compare that to how you think it might fit into your decision.Right now you're considering a Kindle from Amazon, and I won't say you're making a wrong choice.  The advantage of the Kindle is its price and how well it integrates Amazon content.  Being an Android-based device, there is an enormous amount of app support.  Not as much as Apple supports, but for most people, there's enough support to satisfy what you want to do.My wife has an iPad and I have a Kindle.  She loves her iPad, but she admits that there's nothing that she does on her Apple that she can't do on the Kindle.  Most everything she does on her iPad, she can also do on my Kindle.  She chose the iPad because her niece and sister have one and she wanted a similar device so she can map her apps in line with theirs.  I support her reasoning and it makes total sense.  She's Chinese and has language-specific apps she uses.  So, when making your decision, write down everything you feel you would like to do with the tablet, then research what native programs and downloadable apps there are that will enable you to do what you want on the tablet's platform (Android, Apple, etc.).  The Kindle is a lot cheaper than the iPad.  This is a major selling point some use to justify their choice of one platform over the other.For me, the Kindle is a more logical platform.  I love Amazon content and am an Amazon Prime member.  I have over 40 CDs I've purchased on Amazon and they all reside on the cloud (server-side storage my Kindle accesses wirelessly).  I've purchased a small library of books and love to browse their massive arsenal of products.  I feel like the Kindle was made for me.If you're like me and have already purchased a Kindle Fire and are considering upgrading to the new 8.9\" HD Kindle Fire, I can tell you it's a nice upgrade, but it's not perfect.So here's my list of cons for the new HD Kindle Fire.The Web browser on the 8.9\" HD Kindle, called Silk, doesn't support Flash.  The iPad also doesn't support Flash.  Some will tell you that you can't use Flash on the new HD Kindle Fire.  This is not true.  You have to install a different Web browser and do a few configuration steps to get Flash installed and working.  If you research this on the Web, you can locate instructions on how to do this.The old Kindle Fire came with a wall charger; the new HD Kindle Fire doesn't.  Charging is done very slowly using a USB cable connected to another device.  You can purchase a fast charger, but this is an extra purchase.  If you have the charger from your old Kindle Fire, you can use that also, and it'll charge much faster than the USB charger.  In fact, that old charger will charge as fast as the new \"fast\" charger for the HD Kindle Fire (sold separately).  If you're upgrading, you might want to save your money and just use your old charger.The old Kindle Fire had an LED on the power button that turned green when the Kindle was fully charged and Amber when it was still charging.  The new HD Kindle Fire doesn't have any LED, so you don't know the true state of the battery while it's charging.  There are apps you can purchase to help with this, but out of the box, the new HD Kindle Fire is not as convenient in this regard.I've had a few problems with the HD Kindle Fire not powering up after a charge.  This has happened three times in six weeks.  The first time, I called Amazon and was put through quickly (on a Sunday, I might add) to a technical support representative who instructed me to press and hold the start button for one minute, then let go, then press it again.  This forced a reboot of the device, and when it powered back up, everything worked great.  I was impressed with the rapid and helpful customer support.  I'm not sure what's causing the HD Kindle Fire to occasionally not power up, but the fix is a quick one and it happens rarely.Here is my list of Pros for the new HD Kindle Fire.The audio quality is excellent, for a tablet.  Don't look for any booming bass or ear splitting volume, but compared to the old Kindle Fire, it's a substantial upgrade.  The new HD Kindle Fire has surround sound audio processing that mimics wrapping the sound around you.  It actually works.  Watching movies or listening to music, there's an enhanced stereo effect that is a noticeable upgrade to the old Kindle Fire.The full-HD video quality is nicely enhanced on the new HD Kindle Fire.  If you look very close, you can see the individual pixels, but at a respectable distance, the video quality is much more uniform and smooth, colors are vibrant, and the video quality is richer.Wireless access I've noticed is much better.  I'm able to measure a 10dB to 20dB increase in wireless strength during side-by-side comparisons with my old Kindle Fire.  I've read others state they don't notice a difference, and perhaps that relates to the wireless router they have or where the router is situated, but I notice (and can measure) a difference.  Using the wireless bars on the GUI, my old Kindle Fire always displays three bars in most locations in our home while the new HD Kindle Fire displays four bars.The screen is noticeably larger, which is definitely a nice upgrade when watching movies, browsing the Web, or typing on the screen.  I still prefer the smaller Kindle Fire for book reading.  It's sized more like a paperback, but I do plenty of reading on the 8.9\" HD Fire also, so it doesn't detract from my enjoyment.I see a tablet like a tool in someone's tool chest.  Each tool has a specific function and each person needs to find the tool that's right for them.  For my wife, her tool is the iPad.  For me, it's the Kindle.  Which is it for you?", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "A reader's perspective (how the Fire HD works for reading books)", "Author": "G. Denick", "ReviewID": "R15HQZ08L79SUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own and have previously used a regular Kindle for reading, which I preferred using over traditional paperbacks. The Fire HD, remarkably, is even BETTER to read from - which came as a surprise to me, since I assumed it would not match the reading experience of the regular Kindle. I find the bright screen of the Fire HD to be marvelous to read from. I experience no glare, and can read for prolonged periods of time with no issues whatsoever. The screen can be read in any lighting condition, since it's so bright. For some people, it will be a tad TOO bright, but I believe you can adjust this in the settings. I'm not quite sure if I like this unit better than my 7\" Fire HD, but it's a toss up- they're both stellar. If you're going to use it primarily for reading books, the 7\" may be the best fit, but the 9\" would probably be better for heavy use of Netflix and/or reading of comics and magazines.What I really love about the Fire HD's reading interface is how it makes me a BETTER reader. How? A number of ways. First of all, I love the feature that lets me highlight passages that I like by simply running my finger over them, making them easy to revisit at a later time. I used to enjoy highlighting passages in traditional books, but I was generally too involved in my book to get up and go look for a pen - so I skipped it. Additionally, one of the Fire's functions conveniently stores all highlighted areas, so you can easily go back to your favorite parts (as well as having a simpler \"bookmark\" feature). You can even \"share\" the passages you like on social networks, if you're into that sort of thing. All of these things were possible with the regular Kindle e-reader, but with this tablet, they're 100x easier (thanks to an intuitive, responsive touch interface), and I actually find myself USING the features (all the time).The Fire HD also retains the ability to change the size of the font you're reading, quickly and easily. Again, this is something that the previous Kindle could do, but I find it much more intuitive with the touch controls. Once you get used to the way the device works (which doesn't take long), everything becomes second nature.What else? Page turns are smooth and seamless (something the original Fire stuttered on). Turning pages is incredibly slick - you don't even get that brief \"black flash\" that the regular Kindle performs to refresh its pixels. In fact, you can even PARTIALLY turn the pages, just like in a real book! You turn pages with a quick swipe of the thumb. But if you keep your thumb on the screen/page, you can gently begin to turn the page forward/backward, and hold it where you want. Very useful, if you quickly want to go back to the last sentence or two you read on the previous page, or peek ahead to see if you're near the end of the chapter.I also find that I love having color in my Kindle. Although reading is primarily a black and white affair, it's great to have color when you're perusing the covers of the books in your library, as well as when you're seeing the occasional picture. I generally read novels, but I've perused comics and picture books, and the Fire HD delivers in stunning fashion.Speaking of that color screen (and it should be mentioned that cramming 720p resolution into a 9\" screen is a technological marvel), video is also outstanding (something that I also couldn't do on my previous Kindle). It's really fun to read for a bit in bed, and then catch a quick episode of \"Parks and Rec\" on the Netflix app. It doesn't look quite as sharp as it does on my 40\" 1080p Samsung (understandable), but it looks darned good, and I feel like it might get even better with downloaded movies (as opposed to streaming). I watched a trailer for a Batman movie on the demo unit at Staples, and it was incredible- it's what sealed the deal for me. The sound on the Fire HD is everything it's been hyped to be, coming through crisp and loud. I also like the placement of the speakers, because if you hold the tablet with both hands, it bounces off of your palms and comes right back at you (although you can still hear it just fine, no matter how you hold it).The Fire HD has some faults - the charging time is painfully slow with the included USB charger, the power button is ridiculously hard to find, and the surface of the back is a bit too slippery. But these flaws are easy to overlook, considering all that I get in return from my Fire HD. It truly makes me look forward to reading every night, and it's a lot of fun to build and browse my digital library (I'm currently collecting Newberry Medal winners - and the ease with which I can quickly download these should also be commended).

Howard \"Kindle Ho\"", "ReviewID": "R1PFUG5AI2U3S1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading so many asinine 1- and 2-star reviews, I thought I should go ahead and get my review out there.  And before anyone has a chance to question it, though this is not a verified purchase, I DO own this device.  My folks were kind enough to let me purchase this through my Dad's account, and pay him back over time.  But anyhooooo, about the device...The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was how thin the Fire was!  The original Fire, though I absolutely love mine, was rather blocky.  My new baby was charged up, so I turned it on and checked out the picture.  Absolutely freaking beautiful!  Before I really played with it, I plugged it in and charged it up.  No, a charger was not included with it.  But I READ the product description and knew that, so I had already ordered the quick charger, even though I already had other chargers.When it was pretty quickly charged, I got down to some serious playing.  I have to admit that I am totally blown away by the beauty of the picture.  I don't own any other HD devices, so I was not prepared for just how gorgeous the images would be.  I was easily able to explore the Fire, as the quick tutorial explained what was needed to get started.  I loaded a number of books, lots of music and apps, and some pictures.  I am thrilled that this device can be loaded with my personal pictures.  It was extremely easy to do through the cloud.  And they look fantastic!I checked out the sound.  Dang, Green Day and Pink sounded absolutely awesome coming through the Dolby speakers!  No, it doesn't sound like a Bose sound system, but come on....this is a tablet.  I think it sounds fabulous.  Haven't tried it with headphones yet, but I will.I then played on the reading app.  Love it!  Though I do most of my reading on my Kindle Keyboard and Paperwhite, it will be very easy to read on this device.  Everything was crisp and clear...I especially like the sepia background; it's very easy on the eyes.Now we come to the apps.  No, not all of the apps I had on the original Fire would load onto the Fire HD.  Nor did I expect them too.  And I frankly don't care.  If I want to play them, I'll play on the original Fire.  Rooting?  Side loading?  Huh?  Nope, don't even want to attempt that.  I'm very pleased with the content I can get for my device from Amazon.  I bought this tablet for entertainment purposes.  And I know as time goes by, more apps will be adapted to work for the Fire HD.  The 8.9\" screen makes such a huge difference when playing apps.  I no longer worry about going blind playing Mahjong on my smaller screen!I then decided to check out some TV episodes I bought.  Copper looks fantastic on the HD screen!  I also checked a Prime movie - X-ray is such an awesome idea.  No more going crazy trying to figure out who is playing a particular role; I just look it up without having to go to the web.  Watching movies is truly a beautiful experience on the Fire HD.  I haven't used HDMI (did I type that correctly?).  I don't have an HD TV.  Besides, I like to watch on my 8.9\" screen.My Yahoo and Hotmail e-mail accounts were easily set up.  I like the e-mail app on the Fire HD better than the one on the original Fire.  I went to the browser and put my favorite websites on and bookmarked them.  This device is much faster than the Fire.  I will admit that the browser locked up and reset a few times.  I'm using a stylus, and sometimes I tap more than I should (which I did on the original Fire because I had to).  I'm getting used to the screen, though, and it's happening less as time goes by.  And I have had tabs not respond; but they recover so quickly, it's a total non-issue for me.I believe Amazon Prime is a MUST if you own this device.  Besides the free shipping on millions of items, you WILL want the free Prime TV shows and movies to get the most out of your Fire HD.I highly recommend the Fire HD 8.9\" 32GB with no hesitation whatsoever.  I mentioned some of the asinine reviews I read and would like to touch on a few points.  If you read the product description, you will know what this device can and cannot do.  Unless you live under a rock, I don't know how anyone doesn't know that Adobe no longer supports flash and is no longer used on new android devices.  And I can't say I know absolutely for sure what flash is, but I know I don't miss it!  Same goes for the device not coming with a charger; it's not listed in what comes in the box, and it has been discussed here more than once..  Someone said his Fire HD had sharp edges.  Eh?  Still trying to figure that one out!  The edges of mine are very nicely rounded, thank you very much.  There's no forward facing camera!  Call me crazy, but if I want to take pictures, I use a camera (or my cell phone if it's a \"photo emergency\").  Reviews have downgraded the device because of packaging or delivery times.  Sorry, but what does that have to do with the performance of the device?  There were also the reviews that were not reviews of the Fire HD, but were plugs for their favored Nook or Apple devices.  Then there are the defectivebydesign mindless Zombie reviews.  No comment.  But my favorite bad review was the guy who couldn't stand touchscreen devices.

Screen Resolution: Absolutely beautiful2. Sound System: Possibly the best sound system of all tablets. Plus there's an app to boost the volume.3. Amazon Prime Experience: Easy to use to watch Amazon Prime movies/videos and Amazon MP3 Cloud music4. Screen Size: Perfect for me5. Amazon Support: Great customer support to answer  any Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" questions or issuesDespite all that, I believe my specific Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was defective. First of all, when my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was delivered, it was delivered without a box and protective airbags, it just came by itself in the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" black box. I found my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" black box in the dirt in front of my house and it was pretty badly beaten up on the edges and sides. When I opened it everything was there, but my info card/manual was already taken out, but my Kindle was still in the plastic wrap and the USB was still under it.After one day of use, I noticed some bad things about my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". This included:CONS:1. Battery: Device would get REALLY hot after a few minutes of use (After 20 minutes of use playing the Oregon Trail game app, my Kindle's battery was over 118 degrees Fahrenheit according to the Battery app). My device even automatically shut down one time. Also I only get about 6 hours of battery life (instead of the promised over 10 hours) with moderate web surfing ONLY with default 70% brightness.2. SILK Web Browser: Absolutely crap. The SILK browser for my Kindle was really slow, and it lagged my whole device. Swype typing was about 1.33 seconds slower than my finger speed, and pulling the top notification/setting bar down was really blocky. SILK was incompatible with several webpages, and could not finish running any browser tests. On several occasions, SILK automatically closed on me while I was browsing, and I lost the page I was on because it restarted back to SILK's homepage when I reopened it. Also does not have Adobe Flash Player.3. Processor Speed: My processor speed was pretty rubbish. My phone (Atrix HD) runs faster than my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and my phone isn't even that fast (has same dual core 1.5ghz though). Very blocky and laggy on several apps other than the home screen carousel.4. Carousel: This isn't a defectiveness, but it is a CON. When I download apps that are not from the app store, the app's picture on my carousel is very pixelatedRecommendations and Tips:- Download Dolphin Browser, it works a lot faster and you can get Adobe Flash Player on it. Also better quality everything.- Recommended Apps (not from App Store, google around for it): Dolphin Browser, ES File Explorer, Adobe Flash Player 11, 1Mobile Market gets you YoutubeI have contacted Amazon about my specific Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" device and they are sending me a replacement. I will update this review a few days after receiving the replacement.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Huge improvement from first generation...with a couple of minor issues.", "Author": "gtucker7848", "ReviewID": "R1P2E854T5MTJX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Disclosures: I have owned every Kindle product from the first generation E-reader. Additionally, I have owned and temporarily used an IPad, an Asus Transformer tablet, and a Samsung Galaxy Note tablet. I currently use, and very much enjoy, a Motorola Xoom tablet (second generation). With all that said, here are my thoughts on the Kindle Fire 8.9\" tablet (16g, without special offers, no LTE).Pros: My first impression upon holding the tablet is that it is extremely thin and light. The footprint size is almost identical to an android based 10.1\" tablet, however the screen size of the Kindle Fire is only 8.9\". This creates a very large bezel around the Kindle Fire, but the trade off is that the Fire is much thinner (only half the thickness of my Xoom tablet) and therefor much lighter. The rest of the hardware is limited and strait forward. A USB charging port, a volume rocker (nice upgrade from the first generation) and a small and somewhat hard to locate power button. Many reviews complain about the power button, but I rather like it. the fact that it is small and somewhat stiff means that it is not easily triggered by accident. Additionally, there is a utility grade front facing camera (meant to be used as a web cam for skype, which is pre-loaded on this tablet), as well as dual dolby speakers on the back of the device. The speakers are absolutely the best I have ever heard on any tablet, bar none.The software remains geared towards Amazon content consumption, with several very nice upgrades from the first generation model. First, the menu options have been expanded, and now include audiobooks, games, photos, and shop. As always, all content is stored for free in the cloud if you pay for prime membership (only $80/year). The on board productivity apps, including email, calendar, and contacts, sync seamlessly with all your active accounts, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Outlook,Twitter, Facebook, etc. The overall user interface is basically the same, with a couple of nice additions. First, the favorites section is no longer a book shelve format, instead being accessed by a star icon available at all times. The navigation tools are always available with a swipe from the right bezel, and the settings and notifications bar are always available with a swipe from the top bezel. One very nice addition is in the music application. You can now leave your music or playlist on all the time, and control it through the notification bar. This is a very quick and easy way to control your background music. The newsstand application is simply amazing, as usual, and makes similar offerings from Apple and Google seem pedestrian and silly. Additionally, Amazon has included more settings within the books application (such as different font styles and background options) which make this tablet very functional as a e-book reader as well. The whisper sync and Xray options are as advertised and basically still in development mode, with only a limited amount of content currently being able to take advantage of them.Cons: The main user interface, basically a giant carousel, is really out dated. With the menu options available across the top of the device, and the favorites icon easily accessible, Amazon really should come up with some home screen widget options for this caliber of tablet. Additionally, the battery life on this tablet is average at best, and it takes a ridiculously long time to charge. From 10% battery life remaining, it takes a full 4-5 hours to receive a full charge, and this is using the fast charging adapter (sold separately?!?!). My Xoom tablet has better battery life, and fully charges in less than an hour.Overall: First, let me take a moment to comment on some of the product reviews I have read for the Kindle Fire 8.9\" tablet. You not knowing how to use the device, or not fully researching the specifications of the device, does not make this an inferior device. Additionally, you having an outdated wireless internet connection does not make this a slow device. And finally, not having access to 800,000 apps (think about that for a second), does not make this a useless device. YOU GUYS KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!This product is completely as advertised. If you use Amazon prime, or have a content collection through Amazon already, this is an absolutely great tablet. Within five minutes of unboxing the device, you will be set up and ready to go. The apps that are available will likely include everything you already use from an independent developer. Netflix, Hulu, Snag, Pandora, Pulse, Flipboard, HBO go, News Republic, Tune in radio, Evernote, its all here. If you have purchase your content through Apple or Google, why are you even reading this, this tablet is not for you. Additionally, if you need a tablet for heavy work related productivity requirements, this is not your device. You need to be reading the product reviews for a Windows 8 device instead. If you want to watch movies and TV shows, listen to music, read books and magazines, check your emails, browse the web (including Google's mobile website and Youtube videos, which are supported), skype with friends and family, browse and share your photos, and play some fruit ninja, then this is as good a tablet as you will find in today's market. Throw in the $300 price tag, and the unmatched free content offerings available through Amazon Prime, and its a no brainer!Finally, I am very familiar with Amazon tablets.

Snyder", "ReviewID": "R3JLRRNWI56BBI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have my new kindle and I played with it all weekend to rather mixed opinions on it.  I've had 6 kindle devices since the initial K1 and this is by far the most versatile.  As far as Amazon content goes, it works very well with them and has pretty good user interfaces to search that content.Here are some of my initial thoughts on the device:PROS* The fonts and covers on books are incredibly sharp.  The book library and store interfaces aren't much different from the one on the original Fire - it just has a much better resolution.* In streaming video, it's much easier to flip back and forth between Prime and regular movies without having to backtrack first.* It weighs about the same as the original Fire but it's much larger so it's thinner with the weight distributed across a larger area.* It has a camera - even though I would have preferred a back facing one - that works well for video conferencing.CONS* Silk still opens duplicate tabs when restarting the browser and it continues to crash at times so to that degree it's the same as that on the original Fire.  It seems to work better on pages with numerous updates like Google+ but it still needs a bit more work so it feels similar to a desktop experience.* Silk takes an extra tap now to get to bookmarks.* The original Fire had a wood grain background - this one is just black - there is just the carousel against a blank background.  The wood grain would be appreciated (if one can't choose from a set of backgrounds) to make the device seem more visually interesting when on the home screen.* They've increased the number of places where they advertise to you.  I'm dissatisfied that I have to pay extra to turn off 'special offers' while also having to turn off the 'also bought' feature on the carousel.  These are both correctable but I dislike that the application defaults to advertising to me.* I've had some trouble with my Fire waking itself up after I put it to sleep - and with it turning itself back on after I power it down.  Customer service says these are known bugs so hopefully that will go away with the next software release.Overall, it serves my primary purpose for it - book reading - well.  That's my first use for the device and the most important one.  My second use is as a web browser which it does less well.  So, I like it but with some misgivings .... I would prefer more customization but that has never been high on Amazon's priority list for any of it's kindle devices.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "From an Amazon fan", "Author": "D.

Easy to say - you don't get to five without liking the product.Worth the $15 to lose the Special Offers start-up screen, but in their own way the specials appearing below the carousel are impressive - they're dependent on which carousel item is in the main spot. I'm sure I'll tire of them, and my prediction is that there will be a way to get rid of them in the near future - anybody else remember how awful the first-generation carousel was at initial launch?Obviously, Amazon is using this device to encourage shopping, but after opening my first book on this device and seeing it rendered so well, I was sold. I have a background in typography, and this device set the type perfectly. When type is set perfectly, it's easy to read and all you have to concentrate on is the book.The double Wi-Fi antennas make this faster than any other Wi-Fi device in my household. Kudos for that idea. Sound is good, this version has Bluetooth and so I can use my already-owned Bluetooth speakers. All my Amazon content showed up as available for download, and in my case that's nearly a hundred books.Screen graphics are great - colors are rich and details well rendered. A step up from the first generation Kindle Fire.HUGE improvement in battery life. First generation was a battery hog; this one is WAY better. I've ordered one of the faster rechargers for it, so there will be a lot less recharging needs. The Amazon case is a great addition. It protects and shuts the screen off as you close it. Then it opens the screen back up when you open it.I'm very happy a week in, and my first generation Fire improved over the year as more apps were released for it and older apps updated.

Even for simple reading the 7\" didn't get them engaged and changing the font size didn't help.The 8.9 inch screen made a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE as I was able to engage them with reading, games, web searches and the like.So, it may be intuitive to everyone that the larger screen is better, especially for those not of current technology - but for me it was the difference between getting them to engage and not.  They already had a desktop up the stairs and I had installed a router to give them wireless.  I wanted something for them to use downstairs such that the stairs would be less of a barrier.This looks to fit the bill.Also, the camera will be something I engage too although I haven't yet.  Having the camera and Skype on the new version should be a plus and I intend to use that as they are 1000 miles away.So - if you are trying to do long distance relationships with older folks - the 8.9\" screen makes a huge difference.Good luck.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does everything I expected on a tablet, very pleased", "Author": "Travel mavn \"luvsbooks\"", "ReviewID": "RVCLLHF6QGXFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a couple of days to work with the kindle fire and I have to say I'm delighted. Maybe reading all the reviews lowered all my expectations but I absolutely love it. I realize some may have real mechanical issues but mine has worked flawlessly.I have a smart phone so was already familiar with using the touch screen, which at least on my Fire is very responsive (as much as my 4g phone is or better; especially with internet pages).I tend to obsessively read reviews on Amazon and googled using the Kindle fire review search term so no surprises about no charger (which I had already bought discounted when I bought the fire, and I thought they made fairly clear that it was not included) and I did cave and buy the seriously overpriced cover. I don't hate the cover but definitely not a $55 dollar item; works as described and looks ok and it saved me any issues with the on and off button people seem to be having since the open/on shut/off works great. I had also purchased a stylus that is great; only thing I need to figure out is how to find a way to keep the stylus attached to the case so I don't keep misplacing it.I also did search around and borrowed the Kindle fire users guide by Shelby Johnson which saved me alot of the frustration I have been hearing in the reviews. I would never have figured out how to get Google Chrome working and picked up a few of the recommended app's which I love (HD battery one especially nice as far as splitting out how much time available depending on what you are using the tablet for ie internet search, movie etc)and knew basically how to navigate; although I thought it was fairly simple as far as the carousel/top terms that take me to the different areas (video/apps/music) I rather like the whole setup actually and like the look so setting my own backdrop isn't important to me and I actually don't find the ad's intrusive.So, my basic needs for the tablet were for magazines as I was getting tired of bulky paper, movies downloaded so when I travel I can watch without lugging out the laptop or needing wireless, netflix and Hulu plus along with Amazon prime are my standard television watching even at home (no cable) so wanted to be sure these worked well and internet - usually I just use for searches, facebook.I bought the 32gb since I knew I was going to have movies downloaded.  So far internet working great, there are alot of tabs but nothing too annoying and still getting a feel for searches but no problems.Movies- bought and downloaded off amazon prime effortlessly using the black friday deals to pick up some I don't own yet; I'll try the downloading of some I own when I have more time.My music (limited amount on Amazon cloud since most on itunes; we'll have to see about transferring some of those) downloaded easily so I have music at any time and the sound is great.Netflix and Hulu plus (apps) worked great and seem pretty seamless; I do have high speed at home since I work online and my primary television is all streaming so that may effect them but they work as well on tablet as TV.Downloaded a couple of simple games since it isn't something I do alot of and they run fast and look beautiful (star wars angry birds, temple, Mah Jongg they look fantastic.Magazines I am very pleased with. I decided to try Oprah, More, Smithsonian and Natl Geographic and they all are working perfectly.  Still need to play with them to decide which I need to keep but they turn like a magazine using swipe then with a double tap expand to read in text, another tap and back to small so pictures and ad's can be viewed like thumbing through a magazine.  Nat'l geographic links directly to video's which is fun.  So far still only a basic use of them but no glitches so far.I didn't try the facebook app after reading reviews but it pulls up perfectly on the internet. The only thing to play with is to try again to download dolphin and flash (the kindle book does give links to do this but it was the only one I couldn't pull up immediately; or at least I don't think they downloaded)So still a learning curve but in the two days I've had the fire I've loved it. I was afraid since I had a 4g phone it would be a waste but the size is perfect for magazines and movies (a bit too heavy to use as a daily reading device, so keeping the paperwhite also for nighttime reading) but it is something I will definitely use every day.It would be perfect if I could download the pictures off my camera on vacation and manipulate directly. I wouldn't even bring the laptop in that case, I think that is the only thing for my basic needs that requires anything above the Kindle Fire.May have received a lucky Kindle with no mechanical issues but loving it. Looks like it will be worth every penny.  I do use Ipod and alot of my music is on that but I am heavily into kindle books and amazon content so this tablet works great for me; glad I got it and not a ipad. I also realize I have already been trained by my previous devices so the learning curve wasn't too great as far as navigating touch screen.

Very straightforward process of just turning it on and letting the tablet register and update itself. It took about 10 minutes (with the majority of the time waiting for an update to download) and it was ready to go. It picked up all my original Fire music and books from the cloud and most of my Fire apps. I was disappointed to see that a couple of my favorite apps (TED Talks and Play Music Videos Free) were judged not compatible with my new Fire. Hopefully updates will be coming soon.The screen is delightful! Crisp and clear, and a marked increase in resolution versus the original Fire. Videos on the HD Fire are simply amazing.The sound quality is also a marked improvement. While it was pretty much mandatory to hook up an external speaker for the original Fire, the new Fire puts out pretty decent sound quality all on its own. I still hook it up to external speakers (I'm partial to the Bose Companion 20) for movies and music when I'm at my desk, but it puts out more than adequate sound all on its own.Response time is more snappy than the original Fire, and the carousel is easier to navigate (smoother scrolling). Picking up a WiFi signal seems to be better with the new fire - I'm getting all signal strength bars displayed in areas of the house where I could only get 2 or 3 bars with the original Fire.The form factor is great for video watching. The extra screen size makes a big difference. The other huge advantage to the size is typing. It's MUCH easier to see and use the onscreen keyboard than on the original Fire. I had no problems typing without a stylus; on the original Fire a stylus is a must.So far I don't see many misses other than a hard-to-find power button. The casing and build quality is not at the same level as an iPad, but neither is the price. I'm very pleased with the price-performance level of the HD Fire.This is not replacing my original Fire - I'll continue to use that for most of my book reading and when I need portability. For everything else, the larger screen is well worth the additional cost.I have a Nexus 7, the iPad 2 and an HP Touchpad and the Fire is my favorite by far. Not because either the original or this new Fire are the best in terms of build quality or speed or tech specs, but for one simple reason: the Fire makes it so incredibly easy to avail myself of entertainment and content. The tight link to the Amazon ecosystem is, for me, a huge plus - it keeps my entertainment pipeline full of things I want to read, listen to or watch with little or no effort on my part. And, best of all, a lot of that content is free through Prime.Love it, and highly recommend.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT ... KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 DOES EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED", "Author": "Frances M. Tuttle", "ReviewID": "RGMITUGKKF7SY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I don't understand reviews/reviewers who waste time criticizing what isn't there - what is the point of that?  Read the product specifications and you won't be disappointed.  It is no secret that the Fires were created for the Amazon eco-system.Second, Amazon has always said that the Kindle Fires were all about consumption of Amazon products - in fact, that's why I bought the original Kindle e-reader, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 7\" (which I only used for a month and half before I knew I would want an 8.9) and now Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" - I am a mass consumer of Kindle books and now videos with my Amazon Prime membership.Third, my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is not an iPad replacement - nor was it created to be one.  I watch videos, play games (and yes, there are a few games that do not play on the HD 8.9 - but that happens with computers - get over it)and read books and magazines - that's what it was created for.  My magazines are incredible on the 8.9 - a great leap over the 7.  Stop comparing it to an iPad, please! And I hate to break it to you iPad fans out there - but you do realize that an iPad is in no way a laptop replacement, don't you?  Don't try to compare apples to oranges.  And no, the camera was not meant to take pictures - isn't it meant to be a Skype thing?Fourth, shut the wifi off when you are not using it - it helps with the battery life.  I have to charge my iPhone (yes, I have an iPhone) at least once a day because I use it so much, so having to recharge my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is no big deal for me - it comes with the territory.  My original Kindle e-reader did, indeed, last for weeks on one charge, but it wasn't a computer being used for many things - so if anyone buys a tablet with the expectation of long battery life, you are, indeed, going to be disappointed.Fifth, for the money I think the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is an excellent product.  The display is gorgeous, the sound is excellent with the new external speakers (on my original Fire I had to download an app to pump up the volume because I could hardly hear it without headphones) and the wifi connection is much quicker than on previous versions.  The Silk browser - well I find most tablet browsers to be kind of sucky compared to my laptop - so that is a non-issue for me.In summary, if you are looking for a device to watch videos (both Amazon Prime and Netflix in my case), read your Kindle books (and no, you won't be able to read your books on a bright, sunny day on this device - but I would hope you would realize that before you buy), read mazagines and play games, this is a device for you.  Would it be nice if it came with a charger?  Sure, and maybe Amazon will begin to include them in future versions, but for now, this is exactly the device I wanted and it is exactly what I expected.P.S.  I have originall purchased one of the really expensive cases to use with my 8.9, but I returned it and ordered a Fintie slim-fit case and find it to be absolutely perfect.Enjoy your 8.9 - I know I am!", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazingly adaptable and easy to use", "Author": "Bill Hansen \"Bill Hansen\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1B174FE06SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was originally written for another forum, in response to a person who worried that the Kindle would be too difficult to use, and too strictly limited to the Kindle environment. As a much older person and a technophobe, I worried about those things too - but the Kindle Fire and its siblings are far easier to use, for more powerful and flexible, than I had imagined. Users are not limited to Amazon content at all.In the 36 hours I've had my 8.9 I've subscribed to the National Geographic magazine (gorgeous!!), read the New York Times in a format which looks indentical to the one I'd buy at a newstand, watched a few short instructional videos, read a short e-book, checked our local weather using the very detailed Weather Channel app which comes with the Kindle, perused the CNN news site, checked my Gmail account several times and have written a few emails on the Kindle, discovered that my Google Calendar and all my Gmail contacts were automatically downloaded to the Kindle, purchased several small items - you get the idea. I could have bought movies, shopped for trousers, cameras, sticky buns, software (almost any sort of software)...... You get the idea. I'm a very non-technical person, 78 years old*, using my very first tablet for just 36 hours. I didn't sweat one drop doing all that. The Kindle is set up so beautifully that it almost does it all for you.Sideloading (this was a question someone had asked) - That's a process whereby a Kindle user can download apps which the Kindle app store doesn't offer. It involves getting the \"apk file\" for the app (similar to the \".exe\" file for any other computer application) from a site which lists them, saving the apk file to the computer, moving it to the Kindle, and installing it. You do have to have another Android device available, one time only, to begin the process - so if you don't have an Android cell phone, for example, borrow one for an hour or so, from a friend or acquaintance (or ask locally on Craigslist, your health club or church, etc).Yes, there are several steps involved in sideloading. But you can't possibly damage your Kindle, and you don't void your warranty. I've had a an android cell phone for over two years, and there are a few things - a little thing called Weather Bug, a hiking app called My Tracks, a wonderful MP3 player called Power Amp, and Google Maps - all of which are available in the main Google Play Store, but none of which are available in the Android version of the Play Store. One by one, I'll go through that \"sideloading\" procedure to get them on the Kindle 8.9. I have the 4G version of the 8.9, so the hiking and mapping apps might be available. If not, I'll just have to continue using them on my cell phone.Applications like Google Maps, GPS, and the hiking app won't work unless you have the $G version of the Kindle, but many other applications will work just fine. Some games are not yet optimized for the HD screen.Portability - if you're using the tablet almost exclusively in your home, get one with a 10 inch screen. Google makes one, but there are better 10 inchers out there - iPad (boooo!!!) and Asus Transformer 700 have the best screens, and the Asus has a micro SD card slot which is a very nice thing to have. The Samsung Galaxy 10.1 comes very close behind. Any one of those - and also the 8.9 - can be paired with a very light \"blue tooth\" keyboard, or docked to the keyboard, for those times when you're going to do extensive writing. For short notes and emails, the \"virtual keyboard\" of the 8.9 is perfectly fine, but the virtual keyboard on a 10 inch tablet would be better. The 10 inch screen would be better for watching videos or movies, or for reading photo-heavy magazines like the National Geographic - but lots of people are delighted with video, photos, and graphics on the 7 and 9 inch screens.However, if you think you'd like to take the tablet along on trips or carry it around town, the more compact 8.9 inch size is much better. It's also better for reading books, because it's easy to hold in your hand. Don't let anyone tell you the 8.9 is too big or too heavy to hold. It's not.Portability - I already covered that. I got my 8.9 because it will be primarily a reading tool for books, newspapers, and magazines - but the darn thing is so adaptable that it can do just about anything I'd want.\"Toooo much information\" as folks say.

This is my 3rd Kindle, I have the Kindle keyboard which I really love for reading and using my Audible books on and very lightweight to carry around.

I haven't had a chance to use the mobile plan yet because of the wireless so far. The people who have complained about the adds, well what can I say, it is really not a big deal, you see them on any smartphone now adays, I personally would not pay the extra to have them removed as they don't bother the way the tablet works. The only thing that I have noticed so far is the on/off button, it is hard to find but I have an Otterbox for a case and this does help to find it better, by the way Otterbox is the only protection to use for your smartphones or Kindles but that is another review.

I love the quality of sound that comes from the 2 Dolby speakers.  I think this is one aspect that the iPad does not have for me.2.) The quality of the display is very good.  I compared it to the iPad and I did not see any difference in my opinion.3.) Another selling point is the speed of the WIFI which makes streaming videos fast and enjoyable.4.) Lighter than the iPad and I liked the ability to easily hold on to the Kindle Fire (both 7\" and 8.9\") when compared to the iPads.  I like the ability to hold on to the Kindle Fires and not having them slip out of my hands (like the iPad did).5.) Lower price than the iPad. I could afford both of my Kindles for slightly more than the cost of one iPad.Negatives:1.) Lack of camera on the back. But this is not a huge issue for me.2.) The ads that come on the screens and that you have to pay to have them removed.3.) PowerFast charger was not included in the purchase.  I purchased my Kindle Fires at a local store and because I did so...I did not receive any discount for purchasing the PowerFast Charger.  I think Amazon should provide you with a discount even if you purchase from a local store.  This discount could even be provided to you online that can be used for credit for apps, music or books.  Just an idea.Conclusion:I have been enjoying my Kindle Fires!  The Kindle Fire receives 5 stars from me because I was totally impressed by the quality of Dolby Speakers and the quality of display. The negatives would not prevent me from purchasing another Kindle but I would like Amazon to know how cheesy those ads are.  I am impressed with the speed of how the PowerFast charger works!  My Kindle Fires are thin, easy to hold and provide a positive experience reading books as well as watching videos.  The cost made a big difference to me as well.  Quality for a lower price is important in today's economy!  I hope that Amazon reads these reviews and takes note of the negative aspects (followed by improvements).

I'm not worried about the flash no longer being used for newer android devices. If it's that big of a deal, then just side load Flash,anyone can do it.Some complained about dropbox not being in the apps. Again just side load it and it works fine. Basically you can just about get any android app you want through side loading them or rooting your device. Plenty of videos out there to show you how.

On the top of my Kindle is my name and next to it the words are \"4th Kindle\".  I liked the Kindle from the onset and they just keep getting better and better.There is no reason to go over the features because several others here have done an excellent job of that.  I will simply tell you that there is not much to criticize with this product.  Amazon has really done a great job and at a great price.  I am in a position to help others who are confused with computers or tablets.  I've spent time with many of  the other brands but, I will state loud and clear that I love this Kindle compared to many others.I did read the negative reviews here and some if not all made me chuckle.  No, there is no instruction booklet to read, it is all on the Kindle itself and it is not difficult to find.  The negative reviews made me wonder if any research or product reading was done before they ordered their Kindles.  The objections and dislikes I saw are all a matter of using the Kindle or going online and looking for the answers.  The Kindle forum here on Amazon is a wonderful place to visit and get help or good advice.Five stars plus is my vote.  If I had a wish for just one thing it would be to have a little mark on the screen where the on/off button is.  I agree it's not easy to find even though it is dead middle of the case but very imbedded.  I never turn my other Kindles off by mistake but I did manage to do it twice with this one.  Perhaps when my case/cover arrives that will be put to rest.  Heck, maybe that's what Amazon had in mind?  Most of the new covers turn the Kindle on and off automatically.

Excellent screen, Dolby stereo sound that is second to none. Perfect size for reading. And the price!  You get so much more for your money than an Ipad!  Once you install google market on this, the apps are endless.  A lot of people complain of the limitations of this tablet, like the limited app store.  But there are workarounds that will open up the potential for this tablet.  For example, after installing google play market on this, I've got all my google apps (gmail, maps, google+, youtube), and numerous other apps running on this bad boy.  In researching for a tablet, I was looking at many different tablets including all the android tablets (7inch and 10 inch).  I ultimately decided on the 8.9 because of its perfect size for reading, in particular books, textbooks, and medical journal articles.  Highly recommend this tablet if you like to read and use Amazon services.Update: I just wanted to address some of the common complaints I see in other reviews.1. Lack of Flash Player: News flash! ALL ICS android devices do not support Flash.  It has essentially been discontinued by Adobe. Ipad never had flash. If you want Flash, install Dolphin Browser and the Flash apk.2. Lack of Android Apps:  You have two options here.  1. Sideload the Apps: Just install whatever app you want from apk file (don't have to root)  or  2. Google Play market: If you want access to all the Android apps, then you need to install the Google Play Market. It may be possible without rooting it but I haven't tried it myself (I rooted mines).3. Ads - they just appear on your lockscreen and no where else. It's not a big deal.4. No AC charger - You can use any of your micro-USB AC chargers from your other devices (ie tablets, phones).  It's a standard universal micro-usb charging port. If you don't have any, they are cheap and only a few bucks to buy.Final words:  If you want an ipad, just buy an Ipad! This is first and foremost an E-reader tablet, that is meant to be used in Amazon's ecosystem.  This is a great deal at $299 ($200 less than the cheapest Ipad 4) and with some workarounds, you can turn this into a full-blown tablet that can rival any Ipad experience.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very slow, and bad Amazon service", "Author": "Shawn W", "ReviewID": "R2B3XS5XQ72SYZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased one at $249 during Amazon's promotion. I got it two days ago and I'm not extremely disappointed with the product and Amazon's customer service.Pros:+ Really nice screen, and it feels nice to touch. Nook HD+ has better viewing experience but Fire HD+ has much better touch experience.+ Can watch Amazon prime.+ Loud speakers+ Content viewing is supposed to be good, but my unit is super slow.Cons:+ Very slow, laggy - I will talk about this in detail later+ Speakers are rear facing so you can't watch a video in bed properly.+ Hard edges hurt my palms+ Locked Android so you need to root it and run Google apps and have full Android experience.+ Can only support one account.+ Silk browser is slow and all you are viewing will be recorded by Amazon for Ads targeting.+ Input is poor. I wish I could install other input methods in android.So let's talk about its slowness. It's slow in almost all aspects. Book reading, web browsing, Video watching, app running (e.g. flipboard). When I read a book, page flipping has 1-2 s delay. It even feels slower than my paperwhite! Web browsing is slow but I guess it's because Silk redirected your URL to Amazon server first. The most important thing is bad video experience because Amazon prime is the only reason I bought this tablet on top of my other Android tablets. I tried 3 TVs/movies, all of them froze at about 5 min into the play. It's only the graphic that is frozen. Sound is still going on.I'd imagine this is a defective device as how can a new Android device with 1.5G duo core CPU be this poor? Even Nexus 7 can do better. So I contacted Amazon for a replacement. The first one ask me to restart the device, and I told her that I had already done that. Then she asked me to factory reset, and wait for 48 hours to see!!! I'm an IT expert and I know this is bulls***. It was late at night so I didn't spend much time carrying on the chat. The second day, I called again. Amazon customer service is just pushing me around, from this department to another. They put me on hold for more than 20 minutes to transfer to amazon instant video team, can you believe that?! I got a defective device, you should just fix it for me. I have no time to help your team debugging devices.Anyway, I thought the above is my unit's problem so I'd have given it a higher rating, but according to Amazon's response, they don't think it's a defective device. Wow, if Fire HD+ is like this, it doesn't even worth $100 to me. What's use of it if you can't watch HD TV and read a book smoothly? My old Galaxy Tab 10.1 is even better than it. I'm so angry with the whole experience. Even if I bought it from Best Buy, I could get a replacement easily by telling them that I'm not satisfied. I thought Amazon is good at customer service but they just tried to push me to another team and wasted my time.

Some of the negative reviews are beyond comprehension and just plain silly, but with some merit. I now own the 8.9\" Fire HD and my wife has the 7\" Fire HD. She finds the smaller unit a better fit for her purse, since I don't carry a purse, the larger unit is perfect for me. It also is a bit smaller than the 10\" tablets and perhaps the ideal size for those wanting both an e reader and a good internet tablet. We are both extremely happy with our purchases. With my HD I have easily been able to connect with the apps I use either through the Kindle store or directly through the web. Email connection with my Comcast account took 30 seconds to activate on the Kindle. It was easy to sync with my Google calendar and IGoogle and I had no problem sending documents from my PC to the Amazon cloud. For example, I uploaded the digital manual for my new mini cooper to the Amazon Cloud and opened it up on my KIndle - easier to read and find things than on the print version. I have had absolutely no problem with wifi connection, speed has been way beyond adequate, and of course the screen is beautiful. As an e reader, pages are clear, crisp, and page changing is fast. I'm very pleased with our purchases,snd also, I appreciate the reasonable pricing on these machines.As for the criticisms posted on this review site, yes I would have liked an included charger; the lack of flash has not interfered with any of my tasks; having an external charging light would have been nice, but I will survive; my fingers very easily find the power and volume buttons; why would I want to use a 9\" tablet to take photos; maybe Amazon could have included a bit more written documentation, but all you could ever want is in the Kindle itself or on the web support pages. I got rid of the \"other buyers have recommended scroll\" through the updated software; the other ad thing on the lock screen is on my soon to be deleted list for 15 bucks, but isn't as annoying as some people claim (except for Mickey Mouse appearing several times); delivery of both Kindles was before the expected delivery date.If you want more bells and whistles, need to have access to every app in the universe, need every device you own to be capable of taking pictures, can't live without a blinking charge light, and prefer written documentation, the Kindle Fire HD may not be for you.

I have used this tablet everyday since I bought it 2.6 years ago. It continues to serve me very well. It is a simple, elegant, and well created device. From the very beginning, the first app I acquired was the Kindle app. I have read many books on this Kindle app. About a year and half ago, Apple and Amazon changed the terms of use and acquisition within the Kindle app. You could no longer purchase a book from the app. You had to go to Amazon.com to buy a book and it would then synch to the app. I did not have a problem with this change but it did throw an extra step into my book purchasing process. It was not enough of a bother to abandon my iPad and get the Kindle hardware.When Amazon announced this product back in September 2012. I was curious about it. It looked pretty sleek and it had the media buzz about as equal to the release of a new Apple product. I started reading about it all over the internet and @ Amazon.com. So I formulated my rationalization plan on acquiring this new device:1.  The screen had to be as good as my iPad screen.2.  It had to enable me to acquire Amazon product easily-->very interested in Amazon Prime.3.  It would be a back up device for my other tablet with cellular access when wifi not available.I ordered the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) 8.9 4G/32gig tablet on October 26, 2012 and it was delivered on 11/29/2012, one day earlier than Amazon advised. The KFHD arrived by US POST! But it started somewhere in the USA handled by FedEx. The packaging was superb. Too bad you had to rip the package to get into the device, as it makes a beautiful box otherwise.The KFHD had enough power to launch BUT during the set up process, it does advise you to plug it in. **When I ordered this device, I was warned that it did not come with a charger. I don't know how people miss that advise. In Amazon's way, it tells you that people who purchase this item also bought a charger, screen protector, and a cover/case. I'm glad that a charger was not included. I have three chargers for my iPad and I can use these chargers to plug in the KFHD's cable. Good idea Amazon-->one less device to throw away or store somewhere.The set up process was really easy. The KFHD already recognized me!! And it stepped me through the process of connecting to my home WiFi. Right after that process completed, the KFHD stepped me through the process of signing up for the 250MG/12 month introductory 4GLTE AT&T; cellular data.  ***A lot of negative comments about this cellular data is unwarranted, IMHO. AT&T; is a reputable company, the set up process to access their network was very simple. Why people had problems filling out what is in essence an application form that consisted of Name, Address/City/State/Zipcode, email address and credit card is beyond me.I am speculating that since AT&T; has been the cellular provider in past iterations of the Kindle, adding other cellular data providers would probably require hardware changes as well. For example, AT&T; and Verizon do not use the same cellular technology. Giving a poor review to the KFHD because you cannot choose your cellular data provider is like going to a bread store and demanding to buy meat. For you iPad owners, we now have a choice of buying a branded AT&T; or Verizon or Sprint iPads. Amazon would need to do the same if they were inclined to spend time to negotiate similar deals with other providers.Now, onto the device itself. The screen resolution is really good. It almost compares to the Retina screen on the iPad (3/4th generation). I can see a difference between the KFHD screen and the iPad but if I didn't have the ability to compare it would be very difficult. The KFHD's home page is easy to navigate and to scroll through every thing I have accessed on it. I have to double tap on my iPad to do the same thing. I like having my iPad apps in folders, but I can grow to like the simplicity of the KFHD's presentation.I am a little bit puzzled about aquiring apps outside of Amazon. Apparently you have to go into settings to enable this function. And then you have to go to Google+ Play to get other apps not in the Amazon app store.Amazon's browser is different. You can access other websites but the speed of acquiring those websites seems a lot slower. But faster on the KFHD than an iPad. If you want to go backwards on the screen you are reading, the back button is on the side and not embedded in the window.There is a star icon that if you press it, gives you a list of favorite apps that you can launch without going to the home screen.The sound is certainly a lot richer than the monotone iPad. I watched a 15 minute segment of a movie on the KFHD, picture and sound was very realistic. I can get the same sense on my iPad but I have to plug in earphones to the iPad.The KFHD form factor, its size and weight, is easier to hold over a longer period of time than doing the same function on my iPad.In summary, the KFHD is a very good device to acquire and use Amazon Kindle products. It is certainly a lot more reasonably priced than comparable iPad products. The 4G cellular data is a bargain compared to the the US$14.95 250 mg per month AT&T; subscription on the iPad. I hope this 'introductory offer' will continue for as long as I own this device. The screen and stereo sound are attractive. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a tablet to read books, watch TV/Movies, and browse websites. This has met all my requirements. I cannot rate it a five star device because there is no technology available that would merit such praise.

Wouldn't it be great if they did it in color and you could watch videos, too?\" Well, that's what Amazon has done in a superb manner.OK. Here's an update that I have to post:IF YOU USE FACEBOOK A LOT, DON'T GET A KINDLE FIRE HD. There is a major issue which at this time seems unresolved.  The Kindle Fire HD will only allow a few recent news feeds to be displayed (like maybe 15 to 20).  The last few will be displayed shaded in blue and you can't load any more of them.  So if you want to scroll down to something that you saw an hour or so ago, forget it.  The only work around that I found was to change the user agent to \"desktop\" instead of \"android\" in settings, but that makes some posts with pictures too big to view. One suggestion from an Amazon moderator on the Kindle Fire User's Forum was for us users to contact Facebook and make them aware of the problem.  It seems to me that Amazon ought to be the one to take such an initiative, since it is Amazon's modification of the Android platform that has probably caused the problem.UPDATE OF UPDATE (2/2012): The Facebook issue is resolved in the both the Facebook App and the Facebook site within Dolphin Browser on my Kindle HD.

There are things it does extremely well, but there were enough negatives about it that I ended up deciding to return it.The Good:- The screen is beautiful. It looks awesome on games, videos, books...everything, really. The size and orientation of the screen is also ideal for watching movies in a widescreen type format.- The speakers sound excellent. I had not imagined that I would ever enjoy watching a movie on a tablet versus on my TV, but the speakers on the Kindle Fire are very immersive and clear.- The size is comfortable. I had not wanted a full iPad because I've always thought my wife's is a bit bulky. Amazon has really nailed it in terms of a comfortable size and weight.- Integration with the Amazon store is excellent. For Prime videos, Kindle books, etc, the operating system is really well oriented to Amazon's content. The best software on the tablet is what is used for accessing Amazon content.The Bad:- All of my problems with the Kindle Fire are software oriented. The built in e-mail client synced for me the first time, then when I tried checking my e-mail again later, it just gave me the spinning icon and never refreshed. Not even after a reboot. The video camera worked, but when I tried getting Skype to work (which had been a selling point for me), the audio would work, but video would never turn on with Skype. It would try, then just give up. I tried to like the Silk browser, but I got tired of how every time you open it, it has to reload all tabs from scratch. It's time consuming, and also a bit buggy. The Facebook app on Kindle is just awful. If you were to look at a picture, you would have to hit the tab on the right, then find the back button just to get out of viewing the picture. I kept noticing that whenever I needed to check e-mail or Facebook, it was more convenient to put away the Kindle and to get out my iPhone than it was to deal with the Kindle apps.I think I was most disappointed to learn that the Kindle Fire cannot play digital copies of movies that I've purchased on Blu-Ray. I had bought extra storage in the Amazon Cloud, expecting to upload several of my movies to access whenever I desired to. But despite trying a variety of video player apps, I had to give up. Frankly, as you cannot play the common types of movie files that would necessitate larger cloud storage, despite a great job of integrating Kindle Fire with the Amazon Cloud, this renders the service much less useful than it would be otherwise.To summarize:Amazon has done an outstanding job on the Kindle Fire HD in terms of its hardware, its physical design, and its integration with Amazon. If what you are wanting is a device specifically for viewing Amazon video content, Kindle books, and playing games, this is an awesome purchase.I wanted a device for those reasons, but I also really wanted it for a bit of other productivity purposes, such as e-mail, internet, Facebook, etc. Unfortunately, as of the time of my review, the software for other basic uses is just too buggy. I was disappointed to see just how low of a priority it is for many developers to make apps for Android type devices. It wasn't that I couldn't get most of the types of apps I wanted; it was that the quality of apps developed is just so far lagging behind what I can get on my Apple devices.So in the end, I sincerely hope that in the upcoming months, Amazon will be successful in getting the bugs out of a lot of the software for the Kindle Fire HD. But for now, I just couldn't justify spending close to $500 for a device (after purchasing the 32GB 8.9\" with extended warranty) that was so unreliable for e-mail, Facebook, Skype, and other apps. If you already have a tablet for productivity, and just need another tablet to keep you and your family from fighting over who gets to play a game or watch a movie, this makes a great second tablet.Incidentally, I did NOT go out and buy an iPad, and am planning to hold out for a few more months to see how things progress. Amazon has an amazing piece of hardware, but the software leaves a lot to be desired. I'll continue to root for them. If the software were as good as the hardware, this would be the best item on the market.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hate then Loved", "Author": "Keith Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R5RRD5QQ17KFS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was concerned with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because the WiFi was loading all internet content slow.

Rightly, Kindle worked like a charm, so I knew it had something to do with my home network.

It was just last fall, after all, that I bought my first Kindle Fire (that's when it was launched after all). I've been addicted to it ever since, and it goes wherever I do. Or at least it did. That's because Amazon announced a refreshed line of Kindle Fires for 2012, and I knew that I had to have one.Not so much because of the fact that there was anything wrong with my trusty Kindle Fire, mind you. It was just that the new ones packed some amazing features that I knew would enhance my Kindle experience with books, videos, music, audiobooks, games, and apps.New Kindle ModelsThe classic Kindle Fire would be dropped to $159, and is a great value at that price if you are looking for a solid, entry level device. It has even been slightly improved since 2011. The new Kindle Fire HD would boast even better screen resolution and a faster processor, more memory, and better Wi-Fi for $199. It was released shortly after being introduced in late September.I, however, was holding out for the larger, 8.9\" Kindle Fire that was set to be released on November 20th. This was a trade-off to be sure, as my old Kindle, at 7 inches, was not much larger than a paperback book and immensely portable for that very reason. Still, I decided that I wanted the larger model at 8.9 inch screen size.The 8.9 inch kindle Fire HD comes in several flavors. I opted for the basic model that runs $299 and has 16 GB of internal storage. The next model up will run you $70 more at $369, with the only difference being 32 GB of onboard memory. Both of these kindles are Wi-Fi only.If you want a 4G LTE model, those are available starting at $499 for a 32 GB model and $599 for a 64 GB version. Monthly data plans are available, as well. For occasional use beyond the reach of a Wi-Fi network, you can pay $49 and get 250 MB of data a month for a year. This also includes an extra 20GB of free cloud storage and a $10 credit towards the Amazon app store.It should be noted that all of the Kindle Fire models will display ads when you start up the device. This is no big deal for me, but if you want to remove that feature it will cost you another $15.Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch vs. ipad MiniAs I said, I had opted for the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model. But a funny thing happened on the way to the tablet. Apple, sensing that other makers were eating its lunch with smaller, cheaper tablets than the ipad, launched the ipad Mini before I received my new Kindle.That, I think, makes an excellent segue into an ipad Mini to Kindle Fire comparison. Obviously, at $299, the Kindle HD 8.9 inch will save you a few hundred over the ipad 3. But what about a comparison to the new ipad mini? I had a decision to make when the ipad mini was announced, especially since most of my family is already hooked on Apple and has been bugging me to convert. I had a considerable amount invested in Amazon content, though, which was a consideration. Most of it would be portable to an ipad, but the easy interface to your content that the Fire features would not be the same.For starters, the ipad Mini would cost me $30 more for a similar 16GB, Wi-Fi only model. Not so much as to make a difference, but then I started to look at the specs. First off was the display, and the Kindle clearly had the advantage over the ipad Mini. The 1920 by 1200 anti-glare display was clearly superior to the ipad's 1024 by 768 display, and of course the Kindle's screen is an inch larger. The Kindle HD also boasts a faster processor and Wi-Fi, and better speakers. The ipad mini seems to have the edge with it's camera.I decided to stick with my order for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model.The Kindle HD ArrivesEarlier I mentioned that my new kindle HD was to ship on November 20th. But as I was checking my Amazon account on the preceding Friday, I noticed that the $299 for the device had already been charged to my account. Sure enough, a quick hop over to Amazon.com indicated that the Kinddle HD had shipped the day before, and was on the UPS truck for delivery.Initial ImpressionsI was happy to get my kindle HD early, and popped it out of the box posthaste. I was immediately impressed by the larger display and new design. The device did not have the same heft as my own kindle in proportion to its size, and as a result felt less sturdy. Still, it's clear Amazon has learned from some of the mistakes they made with the original Kindle Fire.First off is the power button, which has been moved from the bottom to the top of the device. This was a major annoyance on my old Kindle Fire, as it had an alarming habit of being depressed when the tablet was held upright and trying to shut the power off.A volume control button is another welcome change; the first Kindle Fire did not have one at all. There's a new front facing camera and improved speakers on the sides of the device as well. The micro USB connection is joined by a micro HDMI output, too.One pet peeve that I have is that there is no power adapter included. While you do get a micro USB cable, this is really for connection purposes to a PC; same will not effectively charge your tablet. Actually, it's not really the omission of the power adapter that bugs me. Let's be fair, the kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch is a steal at $299, and you can get an Amazon \"Powerfast\" adapter for $19.99. It's just the plug really, and connects to the device via the included cable.My peeve, then, is that I would have liked to have known ahead of time that I needed to buy the power feed. Luckily, my old Kindle charger is compatible, but won't charge the device as quickly as the new one will. Annoyingly, Amazon changed the price to $9.99 on the adapter, but then when I went to buy one the price had changed again to $19.99 again with a $3 MP3 credit. I will hold off, I think, to see if it goes back down.My Kindle HD arrived fully charged and already configured to my Amazon account. I did need to download a software update which took about 30 minutes to fully configure and delayed my ability to start playing.Incompatible AppsWhile the power adapter omission was mildly irritating, the inability to use a number of the apps I had purchased for my Fire was downright infuriating, such to the point that I called Amazon and obtained an RMA. To be fair, most of my apps work on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. One in particular, though, that I use almost daily was incompatible when I received my tablet.The app in question is Comics by Comixology. I use this app almost daily, and have spent a considerable amount on digital comics that I and my sons read. To be unable to access these was intolerable, and I called Amazon Tech Support and e-mailed Comixology about the problem.I wasn't alone in my dismay; a number of new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet owners also posted their displeasure on Amazon and the Comixology Facebook page. It seemed amazing to me that Amazon would not correct this, since they get a cut of every comic sold through the tablet app.Fortunately, Amazon and Comixology worked to resolve the incompatibility issues and I was able to download the app the following day. Of course, you may not find my tale of woe all that disheartening, especially if you don't read comics. You should, though, be concerned about the incompatibility of apps, and I should further advise that I do have a number still that won't work. This is  not a problem that Apple has had from ipad model to ipad model.NavigationAs with the original Fire, you will find navigation is fairly intuitive, and not much has changed in the department. The home screen is where the action is at, and you can always navigate to it from any book, video, or app by tapping the screen at the bottom to retrieve the menu; then hit the home icon. It's that easy. Once there, you will notice key information displayed at the top of the screen: \"alerts\" about software updates, new e-mail, and even a friend's latest move in \"Words With friends\"; the time; Wi Fi status; and battery strength.Gone, though, is the \"Gear\" icon that brught you to your settings menu in the past. Instead, you need to swipe down from the top center of the screen to get to some options: you can lock and unlock your device, adjust volume, screen brightness, see and choose wireless networks, sync with Amazon, see device information, and much more.You have several ways to access your content. The home screen is presented as a row of your most recently used books, apps, videos, and websites. This is called the \"carousel\", and you can scroll through it with the touch of a finger. Any time you access anything in the carousel, it gets bumped to the front of the line. Again, this is much the same as the first Kindle Fire.Holding your finger on a content pane in the carousel allows you to delete it from rotation, delete it from the device, or add it to your favorites. Favorites, however, are no longer displayed on a lower \"shelf\" on the home screen. Instead, there's now a favorites icon in the shape of a star beneath the carousel (it's also accessible from most other areas in the device). Tapping it at any time will bring up all the content in your favorites menu.You can also access content directly by category from a menu above the carousel.  In addition to the original Kindle Fire Options of Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web, you can also choose from Shop, Games, Audiobooks, Photos, and Offers. From each of these categories, you can see content on the device and in the \"cloud\", and also access the Amazon store to purchase more. As with the first Fire, there is a search box on the home page and for each content category.How Much Storage Do I Need?The amount of storage that's right for you is entirely dependent upon the way you use your Kindle. At 16 GB of memory internally (only 12.8 GB of which is user accessible), I have roughly twice the storage that I had with my old Kindle Fire. Truth be told, I never used all of that, though I came close. Mostly that is because I generally access my content from the cloud. If you are not often in range of Wi-Fi and store more content locally, you may choose to opt for more storage.Managing your content and the amount of memory it consumes is simpler with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. From the settings menu, simply choose \"Device\" and \"Storage\" and you'll get a detailed analysis of your usage by content type. Tapping any of these categories will bring you to a list of that content; you can delete what you no longer want locally to increase available memory.The CloudThe Cloud allows you to store content on Amazon's servers for access through a Wi-Fi or cellular connection with compatible models of the Fire HD. The Fire HD has excellent Wi Fi detection and transfer speed capabilities, indeed even better than the ipad 3 offers thanks to the dual Wi-Fi antennas. This allows you to transfer files to your device in no time.Amazon gives anyone with an Amazon account 5 GB of storage space for free. You can use it to store documents, videos, and music for your Fire. Any music, magazines, books, and videos you purchase through Amazon do not count towards your limit. Need more space for your stuff? Amazon offers the option to buy more, the cheapest plan being $20 for an upgrade to 20 GB. Best of all, this option includes unlimited music storage. Amazon recently copied Apple's \"matching\" option; if they have the same music in their library that you are uploading they will automatically upgrade your tracks to 256K or better quality. There is no charge for this with one of the paid cloud plans.Available ContentAmazon has the drop on anybody else in the content category. Not even Apple comes close, except perhaps in music, but Amazon offers reduced price songs and albums that I have rarely seen on itunes. In addition, many purchases on Amazon come with promotional MP3 credits, so you can download songs as a bonus. While it's true that you can access this content through other devices, for me the integrated interface with the Kindle Fire makes them much easier to get to.While it is true that the content is not unique to this device and may seem a curious component of a review of the Kindle Fire HD, I truly believe that it is a very important factor in your decision on whether or not to buy this device or an ipad, Surface, or Nexus tablet.NewsstandAmazon offers a number of magazines and newspapers by single issue or by subscription. You can find such favorites as Time, The Economist, Forbes, Us, Popular Science, and much more.BooksAmazon has a massive library of books to choose from, most of the latest titles and lots of classics, too. Many books are free. I had a large library already from Amazon, so I was good to go with my new Fire HD. I generally keep a few on my device and store the rest in the cloud for later retrieval. As with all e-readers, I love the convenience of being able to download a book the day it is released. No trip to the store required.Also par for the course is the ability to adjust display (meaning font and print size) to your liking, though sadly the text-to-speech option that was present on the very first Kindle is still not available. Here's hoping Amazon brings it back someday.MusicThe Fire is a surprisingly good music player. Although it will never replace my Zune as my preferred music device, I do enjoy streaming music from the cloud while web surfing or playing games. As with the Kindle Fire, the Fire HD boasts an impressive little music player that streams high-quality audio to your headphones from the cloud or local storage.There are a number of apps available for music lovers as well, most of them free. Pandora, Spotify, and Iheart Radio are all available for the Fire HD.VideoStill annoying is the inability to play digital copy from my blu ray purchases. That said, there are plenty of options for video with the Fire. The Amazon video store offers a large library to select from, with much content available for rental or purchase. Any purchased content can be accessed from the cloud or the device.When renting a title, Amazon offers the convenient option of downloading to the device so that it can be accessed when Wi Fi is not available. You have 30 days to start watching; once you do the content will be deleted after a 48-hour window.DocumentsDocuments can be accessed from the cloud or the device for access as well. Quickoffice is included at no charge with your Fire HD. This comes in handy, though the files are locked for read access (though different apps allow you to alter them).You can upgrade to the full version of Quickoffice for just $15. I in fact did this shortly after purchasing my first Kindle Fire. This allows easy editing and creation of documents.AppsAmazon is not even close to offering the app content that Apple does, and likely never will. While the library of Android apps available for the Kindle has grown, it is still only a subset of those available on most dedicated Android devices (such as my cell phone). Bottom line for me, though, is that the apps catalog on Amazon suits my needs, and while I may not always be able to get an app I want, I can usually find the app I need.AudiobooksA large library of audiobooks is available through Audible.com, an Amazon company. These are my constant companions on the way to and from work, and help me to endure the traffic.WebThe Fire HD uses the Amazon Silk browser. It's intuitive, learns from the sites you visit most frequently, and starts loading them in advance on its servers when you start surfing (you can shut this off if you prefer). You can bookmark favorites, and websites look good when displayed in either mobile or normal formats. Overall, though, it's not all that different than most of the popular browsers out there.PerformanceAs with the Kindle Fire, Performance of the Kindle Fire HD has pleased me overall. Using the performance of my old Kindle Fire as a baseline, it's easy to see the improved performance on this model.Wi-FiWeb pages load more quickly than in the past with the improved Wi-Fi connectivity. Video and music stream flawlessly with a strong source as well. All the better to access your content from the cloud.Video DisplayThe display is perhaps the most impressive new aspect of the Kindle Fire HD. Video is crisp and clear, and HD movies look better than ever. Apps and games are most impressive, with some HD Apps like \"Angry Birds Star Wars\" appearing in glorious, sharp detail and amazingly rich, vibrant colors. Digital comics from the Comixology app truly dazzle.Books, also, are easier to read, at least for me. One of the disadvantages of the Fire line is that it lacks the e-ink of the original Kindle. That device was much like reading a conventional book with e-ink. The Fire's display was prone to impart eye fatigue for this reviewer much more quickly. Happily, with the higher resolution and improved display, this does not seem so much a problem with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet.On Screen KeyboardCertainly, the larger display of the Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet allows facilitates the use of the keyboard for e-mail and word processing much more easily. Quite simply, it's much easier to type on the screen keys with the larger display. Often, I found myself making numerous typos on my old Kindle Fire because the keys were just too small; tilting is sideways to increase size reduced my content space. Not as much of an issue with the larger Fire HD.ProcessorSo far, I haven't noticed any benefit from the faster processor. All my games and apps run pretty much as smoothly as they did on the original Kindle Fire. Perhaps that's a compliment to that device.SpeakersAnother of the features that Amazon touts as much improved are the speakers. \"Exclusive Dolby audio and dual stereo speakers for crisp, booming sound without distortion\"  are promised. From my standpoint? Not so much. While it's true they are slightly louder, a welcome improvement, and have a marked increase in stereo separation, they have little bass at all. I'm not really disappointed about this in such a small chassis to be fair, just don't expect to replace your boom box with the Kindle Fire HD for audio playback.Battery Life and ChargingBattery life has averaged about ten hours of assorted use (apps, books, music, videos) from a full charge. Your mileage may vary with your usage mix; apps and games devour power the most quickly. The device does take a long time to charge with my old Kindle Fire adapter (similar AC adapters can also be used).An hour's charge brought me from 5% to 40% charged; it took another two hours to fully charge my tablet.A Few New FeaturesBluetoothWorth mentioning is Bluetooth capability, not present on the original Kindle Fire. So far, I have been unable use it to play audiobooks and music through my car's speakers, though I was able to successfully pair my new Kindle to the car.CameraA front-facing HD camera is another new feature on the Kindle HD. While there is no native app for it, it does work with Skype for video calls. You can also use it with facebook to record photos and videos; there are several apps for the camera available for purchase. Picture quality and sound recording are very good, indeed, though I find that the front-facing aspect makes it difficult to take photos of things other than yourself.Amazon PrimeIn addition to the second-day shipping upgrades Amazon prime offers, you can also access a large library of movies and TV shows with your Kindle Fire HD as a member. In addition, there is a large library of books that are not otherwise free available for borrowing, one per month. Prime is, it should be noted, an additional $79 a year, and you are under no obligation to purchase it.Overall ImpressionsAlthough I still have major concerns about the incompatibility of apps, I am nonetheless very happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. Concerns remain that content I purchase now may not be available for future models. Amazon uses the perpetual access of your purchased content from the cloud as a selling point, so I would expect to be able to use it in the future.Still, the Kindle Fire HD shines in so many other areas that I can overlook this. The brilliant display, increased size, faster Wi-Fi, camera, Bluetooth, slightly better sound, all make this a truly useful one-stop entertainment device.

It really sticks in my craw as it were, but that's the way the technology ball crumbles. Its irritating but no reflection on the device. As for the device, I Love It! I use it every day, often and with much glee and happiness.  I own an original Kindle e-reader, a first generation Kindle Fire, and now the HD. My wife has an IPAD and when I got the first gen  Kindle Fire, I liked it. I really did. However I still looked longingly and with much envy at her Ipad.  For good reason.  No longer my friends, no longer.  My new  8.9\" Fire HD is wonderful. It has plenty of storage for video, books and apps when I am out of Wi Fi range and when using wi-fi it is very quick on loading web pages, downloads of various media, and I can watch Hulu, Netflix, etc with impunity. Also, I have downloaded some very graphic/ram intensive games and the action is smooth and the video amazing. It really is a fantastic experience. I also like the feature wherein I can plug the unit into my television (HDMI) and watch movies or play games on a big screen. Is it an Ipad? No. In some ways it is better, in some ways not so much.  Is it a laptop?  No.  But that is not what it is meant to be. It is a great media device at a fantastic price.  It is not a portable work computer. You will not crunch numbers or create elaborate spreadsheets though they do have some office type apps available. Its a media device and I believe it does that job very well at a great price point.

I have a Kindle touch that has been my constant companion for since they were released. I had and earlier kindle reader, and my wife has the original Kindle Fire.I can say that overall, I have been very impressed! Since I travel extensively for work, most out of the country, i was concerned that the HD would be basically a brick outside the USA. Not so. I was able to use FEAT VPN app, then a VPN service. I was able to stream video with no issues.Picture quality was outstanding! IF streaming speed slowed down, I would see some pixelation, but this is streaming speed not the device. Hd movie I downloaded to the device had extremely good detail. WAY better than my laptop!Sound quality was surprisingly good. No, you are not going to get big booming bass on movies and music. But the sound quality was better than any tablet I have had a chance to play with, including the almighty iPad. In fact, the sound had nearly a surround sound quality. I found that in my hotel I preferred to listen through the device speakers and not my headphones. The surround effect was that good!Apps. People make a big deal about this. I borrowed a friends ipad, and yes there are more apps. More worthless apps! Seriously, just because there are a gazzilion apps doesn't make anything better. Are there apps that do what you need? That is what you need to find out. For me, I have found everything I need without an issue, and quite a few more i don't need! I'm not a big game player, so maybe that's why I haven't had an issue.Navigation. I actually find the navigation pretty intuitive, but then again, I have an Android phone. I find it easier to use than the phone, and easier than my wife's original fire. Maybe it's just the bigger screen size. Also, I did not not notice the \"lag\" that many people mention, except once. Something must have been going wrong because the response was getting slower, then, the Kindle re-booted itself. after that, it was back to normal. I'll keep an I on this to see if it happens again.Browsing. Pretty good. From a user standpoint, I don't see where Silk is either faster or slower for most browsing activities. The recent tabs gets a bit full, but that's easy to clear. Overall, I pretty pleased, but I do miss flash on occasion. I found that the Kindle stayed connected much better than my laptop, and picked up a lot more wifi networks as well. On my n-network at home, it is killer fast! The only issue i had was at the Inchon airport Asiana lounge. I could not get the kindle to connect to their wifi service. My phone had trouble as well, but not my laptop. I noticed other people with different devices not having issues, so there was some sort of compatibility issue.Reading. Ok. I much prefer reading on my kindle touch. It's just much easier on the eyes, and superior in daylight. This is true on with comparing to anything that's not e-ink. Not to mention that the battery on my touch will last for a month with wireless off. The touch will NOT be leaving by bag of toys no matter what other device i have.Music--pretty much a player.

But, the bigger screen was the main selling point, given these aging eyes, as well as the specs.I ordered it on Sunday night, Dec 9th, around 10pm EST, and it was on my doorstep less than 48 hours later.  I opened the box, and it exceeded my expectations in size.  It's heavier than the original Fire, but thinner.  I booted it up, and to my surprise, all the books I had purchased over the past year were already downloaded on it (a fact that I had overlooked when ordering).  You do have to tap on them to download, but it takes maybe 2 seconds.  There are more options for the font size, and moving from page to page is just as smooth as the original.The screen is beautiful, and crystal clear.  Scrolling through the books and apps is very easy.  I'm not big on the games, except for Angry Birds, and it plays just fine.  I'm more into the news apps, as well as Facebook and Twitter, and the HD screen makes the pictures and text crisp and clear.  The speakers sound better than on the original, however as other people have said, their position on the back sometimes makes it hard to hear, especially if you're holding it to where they're covered.  But, connect it to a set of speakers or earphones, and there's no problem. I haven't tried the Bluetooth option yet, but do have Bluetooth enabled speakers.I would highly recommend this.  I had thought about joining the iPad craze, but for the price, this device was the best option for me, given what I use it for.

I have an ipod and was used to how the apps and the layout were.  So when I began using the Kindle all I did was kept comparing it to Apple.  Well this is NOT an Apple product.  This is such an amazing device by an amazing company.  One of our main reasons for buying the Kindle was b/c we love to watch movies.  We are able to watch all of our movies that we have bought from Amazon right on the Kindle.  The picture is so clear and the sound quality is wonderful even with headphones on.  We were able to download all of our movies and still have plenty of room.  The other thing that has really impressed me is the Kindle FreeTime app for kids.  I have a 4 year old son who knows how to navigate the Kindle already.  We set up his profile on the FreeTime app and now I do not have to worry about him clicking on something he should not.  Now we have the Kindle locked down pretty good so that so get to anything you have to put in your pin, but with this App I do not have to worry at all.  We have put his games, movies and books in this spot and let him at it.  He will ask us in the morning can he play his Kindle.  I will say I wish you were able to download apps from the Google sight instead of thru Amazon but one thing I have noticed is they are always adding apps so I know the ones I would like will be there sometime in the future.  The screen is big enough so that if I need to enter in information on a website my fingers are not fumbling around.  We have even gotten rid of Netflix and began using the Amazon Prime feature.

I turned it on, followed the steps on the screen and was ready to go.  The Kindle is pre-registered so there is nothing really to do except set up the wi-fi and the Kindle walks you through the steps. I purchased the AT&T; package and it too was extremely simple.  I honestly don't understand people complaining about how they can't figure this out. If you do have trouble, there is a help section that is clearly marked.LOVE how the \"back\" button is on the of the screen, IMHO, much smarter. The swiping on this kindle is far superior than on my Samsung Galaxy S II phone, few, if any wrong words. Keyboard is easy to use, numbers/letters/characters where you expect them.  Internet speed is great, able to play videos on youtube for my son.  Volume sounds great. I very easily found the settings features and played around with all the options. Obviously there will be a little exploring time to find where stuff is located, this is expected and part of the fun.This is really a very easy to use tablet. I don't want to say it is only for \"beginners\" because it has a lot of great features if you want to delve into it, but it is easy to use and doesn't take a lot of figuring out. If you have a smart phone, this is easier to use.  If you are familiar with a touch screen, it is a snap.  If you know how to surf the internet, you are golden.  If you are not familiar with the above, it is not the tablet it is the learning curve - don't rate the tablet low because you don't know how to use it. If you WANT to learn how to use it, it is very simple. Some of the negatives are coming from people who expect to know how to use something they have never used before and aren't interested in learning.It come with a USB charging cord, not an issue to me as this standard. It doesn't have a huge users manual but again, standard and there is a help section on the kindle that walks you through things in exact detail.I love this, it does what I expect it to do.

The larger size and the the sleeker case design help it fit into one's hands a lot better than the first edition. The 8.9 inch screen with a resolution of 1920x1200 makes for beautiful viewing experience. It's my home PC resolution squeezed into a display 1/3 the size. The Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi (MIMO) is also a welcome addition. Finally I can use the 5 GHz frequency on my router. (As a side note; if you're looking to upgrade make sure you get one that can transmit in both frequencies at the same time)The new UI runs a lot smoother than the last edition and looks nicer. The black background just works much better. Please note the UI runs though runs on top of a newer version of Android than the last revision so some thing have changed slightly. But it's nothing that one won't pick up in 15 minutes or less. Haven't had a chance to test out many games that would actually stress the tablet out yet. My favorite pinball game does run smoother and just look beautiful under the new higher resolution.She isn't just a pretty face; my baby also knows how to sing! While I haven't tested it out with any movies yet; the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is also much improved in the sound department over the first version.It's not all perfect though. My only real issue is with the removable of the power/charge light. Not really sure why this was removed as it was helpful. having said that though there is (as other have probably mentioned) a program called Battery HD that you can download/buy. I purchased the Pro version and one of the things it allows is to set alerts for battery level. It's the perfect way for your Fire to tell you when it's all charged up or when it gets to a level you wished to be warned about. Still wish that the light hadn't been removed though. Hopefully Amazon will add a software method that will make it easier to see/hear charge status.And yes, unfortunately it doesn't come with a charger. I would think in this day and age people already have chargers but that seems to be a major complaint. My suggestion is get Amazon's high powered charger if you don't have one. You're going to need one for other devices in your life anyway and a high powered one is the way to go. This one will charge your Kindle and probably every other device without a charger you'll get in the future.So finally, should you upgrade from the first edition Kindle Fire? YES without a doubt. You already know what you're getting into with Amazon's device and the market place, so that won't be an issue. And you'll be getting something that is much improved.

I got my kindlefire hd 8.9 about a week ago and I havent been able to put it down. A few months ago I ordered the Ipad but I returned it right away after having buyers remorse about the price tag of almost $1000.  Im so happy that I decided to go with the kindle. I think it is definitely worth the price. A lot of people have complained about the ads but I only see an ad when I turn on the kindle or when I wake it up, other than that, I havent seen any ads. If you're a bargain shopper like me, you wont mind the ads one bit for the lower price.I love that it seems that attention was given to the details like a rubber back, light weight, the size is perfect to fit in my purse, and the ability to hold it in any position and type. Ive read a lot of reviews about how great the speakers are but since this is my first tablet I really dont have anything to compare them to but I can say that they are clear at the maximum volume.Im thinking about getting one for my 22 year old daughter. Her first question was does it have instagram. Unless I need to do more searching, no there is no instagram app which is disappointing.  I even went directly to the instagram site and my pics wouldnt load.  Im also disappointed with the facebook app that does not allow me to scroll down my wall as far as I want. I can only go partly down the page then it stops scrolling. Another problem that Ive had is that the internet browser keeps crashing, very irritating. Ive gone to websites that require flash to open content but the kindle says that its not supported, again irritating.  I dont know if this is the norm for certain content not to be able to open on tablets but if it is then this is a major drawback of tablets for me.  The point of having a tablet is so that I dont have to pull my laptop out just to browse the web. I also have to add that the volume and power buttons are hard to find since they are sort of hidden around the edge. It would be helpful if these buttons stood out more maybe by being a different color or even making the power button a switch that slides up and down vs a push button which is what it is now. Finally amazon NEEDS to include the charger. It was very inconvenient to get the kindle then realize that I could only charge it on a pc so I had to go back, buy the charger, and wait for UPS to deliver it.So far the kindle fire hd 8.9 has been fun to play around with and learn but if the concerns that I expressed were fixed, it would be perfect.UPDATE for new users like me:Check out The Android Guy on youtube.

The main reason for that is that Google play app store is not accessible on it and the Amazon app store is just not that good at this point in time as it does not have all the apps. Thus you need to know how to access other app stores like getjar etc. It will also help if you know how to sideload apps.There are a lot of articles on the net which provides you tips and tricks to get most out of this great device. I would recommend the following apps.1. An app like es file share that lets you explore the contents of your kindle. This will help you to find the apps which you can download from other app does our forums. Once you download the apps using ess file share you can find the downloaded apk file and install the app.2. Dolphin or chrome browser. I am not impressed with silk and find dolphin to be a better choice. Chrome is my second choice as it syncs all my activities from other devices but to install chrome and other google apps you will have to a little bit of research.there is a post on xda developers forum which provides step by step instructions to install google apps without rooting your kindle.3. Google apps. As i said in the point above kindle does not come pre installed with Google apps, so you will have to download them using the instructions on the net. The email client that comes puree installed sucks big time with gmail. For me it will stop syncing and i will have to remove and re add my account. Also it does not had a lot of other features provided by google gmail app.I will also advise a user guide like the one by Shelby Johnson. It has step by step instructions to get the most out of your kindle.It might sound like you have to go through a lot of hoops to get all your favorite stuff on it, but that actually is a plus point for me as it shows me the power of open source world (again different people will have different opinion about that but that's my personal opinion) and i can choose what apps i want and which ones i don't and i can get the apps from multiple sources rather being tied to just one.I will also recommend Adobe reader app over the default pdf reader. It's a free app and provides great features for your personal pdf files.Of course the default book, video and music apps for the content downloaded from Amazon app store are great.So in a nut shell the hardware on this tablet is great while the pre-installed software is so so.

The images on the screen are crisp and detailed, and the sound is gorgeous, even without earphones.  You can play an MP3-recorded  Bruckner symphony on it, without earphones, and get a very decent rendition (with earphones you'd think you're smack in the concert hall).  The Silk engine is quick and reliable, so going online is a cinch.  As a reader, it has resolved the problem of reading Tables on the Kindle, not only because text is easily readable, even if small, as a result of the bright background and the high resolution, but also because the Fire HD has a feature that allows you to focus on a Table section and enlarge it by tapping.When I first got my device, in late November of 2012, I had problems receiving email from a non-preinstalled provider (Earthlink in my case) but the problem was resoved around Christmastime with the latest software update (version 8.1.4) and, since then, I've had no problem receiving email from Earthlink (Hotmail and Yahoo have never been a problem).  Incidentally, the very annoying deficiency that plagues the first-generation Kindle Fire, and even the Kindle Fire II (non-HD), i.e., the inability to target a text search, has been resolved in both the 7\" and the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.So, the device truly delivers.  Amazon, on the other hand, is still behind with some issues.  For instance, the Kindle Fire HD can't yet install or read reference works, such as dictionaries, which are readily available on other Kindle readers, such as the Kindle Touch or the Kindle Paperwhite.  This limitation unfortunately robs the Kindle Fire HD of the bragging right to being  a \"work and play\" gadget.  But not everything is lost.  The Kindle Fire HD has a nice feature that allows you to both listen to and at the same time read an audio book.Though I still depend on my Kindle Paperwhite (or my beloved Kindle Touch) for some specific consultation functions, I have found the Kindle Fire HD to be a superior mobile device for enjoying almost everything that Amazon provides in the way of consumer content.  Even por those consultative functions that are still only available on other Kindle readers, I can still rely on the Silk engine and, a bit less efficiently, connect to Wikipedia or to other online sites and get my questions resolved. Since mine is a 4G-capable device, the online option is always available (though expensive) anywhere, WiFi or no WiFi.Finally, I'd like to emphasize that, as a machine, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G is beautifully compact and streamlined.  Though larger than any other Kindle, it is still easily portable, and its more ample screen offers many advantages.  I have the magnetized cover, which allows you to sart the device or to put it to sleep by just opening or closing the lid, and this feature (also available for the Kindle Paperwhite) makes everything quick and easy.For the above reasons, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G deserves an unqualified thumbs up.  Get it and enjoy it!

Since I have amazon prime I am able to view a lot of movies and shows for free. The quality of the video is excellent! The location of the power button is the only thing that I am not really fond of although it really isn't a major drawback. It is very easy to accidentally push it and have the kindle go into the \"sleep\" mode. I just have to be careful where I am holding the kindle and hopefully this will no longer an issue at all after I receive my cover. I still need to put a screen protector on it and will do that soon.

I went ahead and ordered the 32 GB Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". I was in sticker shock, of course, as it came out to a good $500 when I added Poetic KeyBook Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Black (Support Auto Sleep/Wake Function)(3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)and the warranty and a decal (for when it's not in the case).  But what the heck, you only live once, right?  I was extremely excited to receive it, and with the Amazon Prime Student 2 day shipping, it came in the mail exactly two days later.  The sleek black box contains the Kindle, a USB cord, and nothing else- but I'm a repeat Kindle customer, so I have plenty of micro USBs lying around the house.  The quality of the micro USB charger you use does seem to make a difference however, as some of my chargers didn't work at all (though they were working on other devices just fine), while others charged pretty decently.  I would say, after having my Kindle for a couple of days now, that it is worth it to purchase the rapid charger that Amazon offers you for $9.99 when you add the Kindle to your cart.Just a word of warning...a full charge lasts me quite awhile, but I like to charge it to 100% when I do charge it, and that takes FOREVER on a regular micro USB.  When I turned it on, I was pleasantly surprised to see how the carousel was already customized with some of my favorite books. The carousel can be easily changed to what you use, read, listen to, or watch the most often.  My carousel is a mix of the email shortcut, the Amazon Silk(that's Amazon's web browsing brand, for want of a better description) shortcut, which shows a pic of my last page visited, some game apps, and my favorite books.  The carousel is very responsive, and it changes functionality depending on whether you are in landscape or portrait mode. In landscape mode( my favorite mode) you see your carousel on a black background, and a row of options across the top that are shortcuts to music, video, books, apps, etc.  In the bottom right hand corner is the star button, which allows you to look up your favorites, though those might already be on your carousel.  In portrait mode, the carousel is obviously narrower, and across the bottom, for every item on your carousel, you see \"Customers Also Bought\" and a row of pictorial suggestions based on those selections.  I didn't notice this when I went to look at a display of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" at my local Best Buy.  One of the reasons I was so eager to purchase the new Kindle Fires is that I'm rough on electronics; I have accidentally damaged three kindle keyboard editions by leaving them in bad spots, where the screens were pushed on (mostly by dogs on the couch) a tad too hard, rendering them useless. The gorilla glass of the Kindle Fire is nice and sturdy- though I am glad that I purchased the 2 year warranty, just in case.  Fingerprints/smudges can be rather annoying to look at when the kindle is off and all you see are your prints marring the pristine black of the screen.  But I don't often stare at my kindle when it's in standby mode, so I don't consider it a big deal whatsoever.  But I thought I would bring it up in case that does bother other people thinking about buying this.  I was SO surprised at how fast the downloads and web browsing and toggling are on this Kindle.  It's freaking WONDERFUL. You just don't get a grasp of how fast this device is when you are looking at it in a retail store.  I did have a one or two times when Silk wouldn't load at work, but it quickly resolved itself. No different from network issues on a computer, so it didn't phase me whatsoever.  I would definitely suggest that if you are someone buying this for school, to go to the pull down menu at the top of the kindle screen, click on the more button and then onto the device link. Add this devices personal email address to your email accounts, so that you can directly email the device documents from Microsoft Word. It might work with the whole Microsoft Suite, but so far I've only tried Word.  This way it shows up quick and easy in your documents, and its' SO easy to use.  Before I figured out how to use the documents, I kept having to go to the drafts folder in my yahoo email to look up the text I wanted to read.  I'm a full time college student, as well as working full time, and I needed a device that was powerful, easy to use, and that had some great browsing, organization, and research capabilities. With my Kindle Fire HD, I can read critical analyses, Wikipedia the author of the book I'm reading, add homework to my calender, and watch lectures online, all without taxing the device.  I would definitely suggest getting a Bluetooth keyboard, as the typing, while intuitive, doesn't really lend itself to getting notes down quickly.  I'm enrolled in a winter semester (mini-mester)class and I'm really looking forward to keeping updated on class assignments, reading textbooks, and using Evernote to load notes for use later, all from my Kindle Fire.  And with the 32 gb model, I'm confident that I won't run out of room anytime soon.  I am glad, after seeing how many books I have in my Cloud drive, that I got the 32gb model rather than the cheaper 16gb model.  I've had this for almost a week now, and I'm feeling really confident that I made the right choice.  If you've already invested in the Amazon universe, and you need a tablet for school, or work, or play, I would very highly recommend this device.  I'm not too impressed with Amazon Prime's selection of free movies, and I probably won't purchase the full edition of it unless the library grows rapidly in the next 6 months. But Netflix works pretty well on the Fire, as well as Hulu Plus, so I wouldn't say that Prime's light offering of movies/tv to stream is that much of a hardship.Sorry if this review is too long, but I tried to review this for the things I would want to know, personally.

I pre-ordered this Kindle the day it was announced in September. I was pleased to receive my new Kindle at least two weeks earlier than advertised.The Kindle arrived in the same black packaging as the Kindle Fire. Easy to open with the side zip. Once out of it's box, the Kindle is sleek, thinner than the i-Pad. It is the same height. Simple directions are found in a side pocket of the inner packaging.The buttons are placed along the upper right side, horizontally. They are flush to the tablet, and for some these buttons seem to be more difficult to find.  Turn the Fire on, swipe the lock key, the tablet asks for your Wi-Fi password, you select your time zone and confirm your account. Very easy compared to many other tablets. Now, the real experience begins. Your apps have been automatically configured from other kindles. There is an amazing array of other apps to choose from. The Kindle brings you through the entire process. You click on next to go from one page to the next in the setup process.One of the best improvements, among many is email. Very easy to set up, the email is crisp and clear.  The Fire HD 8.9 is the version to get. Its larger, higher-resolution screen better facilitates Amazon's still-new Kindle Fire interface, and its faster processor makes for a much smoother and zippier experience.. The tablet's availability in a Wi-Fi-only version ($299 for 16GB, $369 for 32GB) and a 4G LTE Wireless version $499 for 32GB, $599 for 64GB, is superb. Speakers are mounted on either side and the sound is so much better.Streaming films from Netflix or Amazon Prime is the way to go. Crisp, clear vision and the HD sound!  Moving from one app to another is very fast. I purchased 'Best 100 Kindle Fire HD Apps' as suggested by another reviewer, and it is an excellent source. For $.99, a great deal of information is available.So far, I have been disappointed with the selection of Kindle Fire HD covers, expensive. I will do more research to find one that is perfect for me.I am extremely pleased with this Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet. It has everything I have wanted in a tablet with faster service and Amazon's experience. The lack of a specific charger is not a problem, I have several I can use.

I have the original Kindle Fire and have been happy with it, but the new version addresses most of my gripes with the previous version.  First and foremost, storage; I purchased the 32 Gb version and it was well worth the extra money.  I have download a couple audio books, a music playlist with about 50 songs, all of my magazines, a few books and most of my apps and have about 23 Gb left.  Doesn't sound like a lot, but I was constantly managing the space on my original Kindle Fire and would have never downloaded music or audiobooks, it just took too much space.  The gmail integration is much improved.  I can move e-mails to my gmail folders with the native app and it also syncs to my contacts and gmail calendar.  Ahh, so much nicer.  There is more customization available such as the ability to set the brightness to auto, turn off the last web page showing on the carousel, turn on notifications for applications, and turn off Amazon Home recommendations.  Amazon has learned there lesson well.  Give us an interface that is easy to use, but give us some customization to make it pretty.  The HD screen is very nice.  I plugged the device into my flat screen and the picture and sound were good.  Bluetooth was easy to use and worked with my bluetooth headphones, including forwarding through songs.In fact, I would have rated this five stars if not for the Silk browser.  Don't get me wrong, it gets the job done, but it crashes on the more intesive websites (esp. Adobe).  Also, if Amazon is driving us to the cloud, why can I not store my bookmarks there?

I've had it for about 2 months now and the only way to describe my feeling toward it at this point is buyer's remorse.  I had bought this as a replacement for my original iPad which is no longer supported and it has gotten quite sluggish at pretty much everything.  Initial impressions were good--but it is no iPad--it was also half the cost.  There were annoyances like it just freezing up completely for 30 seconds at a time before resuming what it was doing like nothing happened, but I figured I could live with it for at least a year despite those and it wouldn't have cost me any more than my iPad cost me since I got less than three years worth of useful life out of it.  BUT, two months in I am now getting about 10 minutes worth of use out of a complete charge!  Let me say that again in case you weren't paying attention...10 MINUTES USE FROM A COMPLETE CHARGE!!!  With a full charge I play about 10-20 minutes of Simpsons Tapped out on it (which doesn't take the battery meter down very much) and then leave it until the next day when I get home from work and it ALWAYS says that the battery is dead.  I don't have any notifications turned on so I don't know what it is doing all day that drains the battery--but at this point it is nothing more than a $400 paperweight--yes, I bought the ridiculously expensive cover too.I will unequivocally state that I'd pay twice as much for an iPad.EDIT:So after letting this sit for a day I realized that it wasn't much more than venting and didn't really provide much useful information.  So, here is something a little more useful to add.The display is excellent, though the touch sensor is not the greatest--does not seem to be very accurate or sensitive and suffers from the general lag of the system.  The system is a bit slow to respond to input, but seems to run most things pretty quickly.  I'm not sure what might cause this other than the overhead of Android.Many complain about the lack of the Google Play store, but I don't really see this as that big an issue.  You can side load anything that you download from Google Play on another Android device--it is just not nearly as convenient.The placement of the power button is annoying--I'm constantly accidentally turning it on or turning it off.  (Or at least I did when I was using it more.)Web browsing is one of the major things I had planned on using it for.  Web browsing is not a joy.  I don't remember specifics but after about a week I gave up on it for that purpose and went back to my iPad.One thing that I found extremely annoying is when I had the notifications turned on it would take me to the Amazon App Store when I told it to clear the notifications.  I'd think that would only happen if I tapped on a specific notification that was an advertisement.I also purchased the HDMI cable for it and was disappointed in the output of it.  It wasn't horrible, but not something I would use without a specific need to.The micro-USB charging port is HORRIBLE!  If you don't get the cable plugged in just right it will not charge at all--and it makes the device extremely hot to boot.  Always check to make sure you have a charging indicator when you plug in the cable.The extremely expensive case also disappointed me.  It does not fit tight enough and I've accidentally pulled it off several times when I've picked it up by the corner.  It also exacerbates the issue with the placement of the power button.I don't use my tablets to watch movies but when I tried that it seemed to work without problems.  I also don't use them to listen to music and I'm pretty sure I didn't even try that so while the sound is pretty good on the things I've used it for I can't really say how it might be for things that are more sound demanding.  Another thing I don't use it for is reading books--I have an e-Ink Kindle for that.  And I've never used the camera on it.One thing that I find annoying about Android in general is the lack of quality apps available.  Sure, the big name apps from the big companies all work well and I don't have complaints about them, but for some things it is really hard finding a decent app.  Luckily the Kindle Fire versions of apps are usually well done so given the choice I select those.Still, the negatives outweigh the positives and I would still be willing to pay twice as much for an iPad.

Love the larger screen, but the device is very slender and easy to hold & store.  The display is simply spectacular and the streaming videos are spoiling me!  The speakers are really incredible for such a small gadget.  Easy to set up and I find the keyboard just fine and no inconvenience to check for battery.  To keep the cost lower I am happy to trade off a few things and for me, Amazon put the money where the bang is - speakers, display.  One thing is that I am not able to read my books as comfortably as one of the older Kindles with the non-glare surface.

Yes I know we jump around a lot LOL. That is because we are trying to find that good balance between features, affordability, longevity, customer service, and ease that meets our needs with the stress on affordability because we are a family of 4 and this technology moves so fast that by the time you buy xyz 3, the new 6 is coming out LOL and keeping up can get VERY pricey on a family budget. My review is about contrasting the differences from my perspective:Customer Service (10/10):In this category for me, Amazon and the Kindle win, hands down. EXCELLENT customer service and I don't mean or take that word lightly at all. I've had to call all 4 companies for things and by FAR Amazon has been the best to deal with. I truly commend them for that in a time where it seems that area lacks more and more.Stability and Speed (7/10):Here I think the iPad/iPods/iPhones win it. Having used all the varying systems by far I think the iPads are the most stable and quick. That said, since the other companies are playing catchup, I would expect that to be so. The Kindle to me falls not terribly behind though. It does freeze here and there and I have had to do a shutdown/restart on occasion, more then with the iPods/iPad, but it isn't to the frequency that I have had to with other products so for me it isn't far off pace.Ease of Use/Base System Features (6.5/10):If you are coming from an iWhatever, you are probably going to come up a bit irritated and possibly baffled and very well may not initially like the Kindle. I know initially when we got ours I was \"underwhelmed\" especially with how things are setup. In this aspect I think iPads and Android systems have a leg up especially if you are like me and are a bit of an organizational freak. There are NO folders here, no way to move around or order things \"your way\". To me this was probably the BIGGEST issue I had with the Kindle. If you are someone new to tablets and this is your first, I think the Kindle is pretty straight forward and easy enough to figure out quickly. I know my 11 year old was off and running with it almost instantly.\"Fun\" Applications (9/10):In this area the Kindle is right in line with the rest. For a kid actually BETTER then the other three in terms of Parental Controls and services geared to keep your kids happy without the worry of your child using your credit card accidentally purchase to purchase something (though I will say I have less experience with this feature in the iPads so am speaking more about the Google and Microsoft systems for handling this which are both not so hot especially if you are a family with kids and adults using the same account or wishing to. On the application front, the worst of the bunch is the Surface which has a lot of NOTHING at the moment :( It is new so somewhat expected but I wasn't prepared for quite how anemic their selection really is. Probably one of the largest areas where the Surface falls very flat.Productivity (7/10):If you are looking for a tablet to Browse the net, I think iPad wins it. The Kindles and Android based tablets do well though for the casual user but for a power user you may find the Kindle a bit laggy. If you are looking for something to check e-mail the iPad, Androids, and Kindle all do well. The Surface though has a HUGE issue there. You have to use internet apps to check your e-mail if you have pop3 accounts...REALLY? O.o LOL If you are wanting to use MS Office products the the Surface wins. The rest do have apps that \"work\" but they do fall short in some areas so you wanna research if you choose this or one of the others to be sure there is something that does what you need. I will say if looking for something more for \"school\" for a child, the Surface, iPad, or Android tablets that run higher may be better. This system is good for general things listed above but not necessarily strong if you are looking for it to be a laptop replacement for heavy typing and taking notes etc. Great though for browsing forums, getting e-mail, internet, and light work.Reading (10/10):This is handled pretty well across the board with the availability of the Kindle app on most everything these days, though being able to borrow books if you are a Prime Member once a month or being able to restrict what your kids are reading is handled best by using the Physical Kindle.Movies, Music, and Sound (10/10):Strangely enough, the Kindle won on this level for me for a couple reasons (the Surface takes a good second because of the ability to add SD and flash cards to expand its size as do some of the Android systems) Amazon, unknown to me, has \"tablet\" editions of their movies...I LOVE THIS. If I buy a movie, Amazon gives you a full res version and a mobile version. If you DL the mobile version and put it on the tablet it takes up about 1/2 the space as the same movie on the other systems which means you can put double the movies on it. You do lose some resolution but if it's to keep kids busy on a long car ride its WONDERFUL. If you are more into the quality and want the HD etc though that is there still as an option as well. I also liked the Amazon Prime aspect in this area as well, giving access to lots of movies with your membership. Granted on this Kindle remember you have to have wifi to use Prime. On the music and sound side, I found the speakers on my Kindle to be by FAR the best of the group. The sound is actually REALLY nice. I have to admit I was impressed.Affordability (10/10):Definitely between the Kindles and the Google/Android units I think. For what you are getting for the price I think both these systems are doing a nice job. The iPad is great but not necessarily affordable for the average person especially when you consider what you have now will be outdated in a year or so (if you are lucky) if money is an issue, I would definitely consider these two systems though I won't say the Surface or iPads are unreasonable for what they do, just with their added features etc also have added cost. What that is worth to you really is a personal thing though :)To close (thank heavens right) after getting past the initial shock of how different this system was to the other 3 (especially the Apple system which OS wise I personally like most), I have really enjoyed it and would most definitely recommend it though whether it is best for you really does depend (as you can see above) what it is you are looking for. Fun, Affordability, For a Child, Productivity, Work etc. But for a general use Tablet for a child, reading, browsing the net without a laptop in your lap, I think this tablet definitely does it's job and very very nicely :) My whole family was happy with this purchase and I have recommended it to quite a few friends etc now especially those with kids or looking for an inexpensive solution to the Tablet quest.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle", "Author": "Krystal", "ReviewID": "R2K1C0Z1NXW7HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll be truthful, I love my Kindle.

There are plenty of reviews about the overall conformation and performance of the Kindle tablets, but very little about the audio book and Whispersync experience.  Amazon has a selection of free classic books for Kindle, each of which has a companion narration, also free, available from Audible. These are an excellent selection of performances by well know narrators, three of which I had previously purchased myself. I highly recommend new Kindle owners \"buy\" these free titles and their companion audios.  Whispersync works in multiple ways across multiple devises. I can read or listen to a book on my Kindle, then pick up where I left off, reading or listening using the Kindle app on my Android phone. I especially like the immersive reading function, where the text on the screen is subtly highlighted and \"turns the page\" following the simultaneous narration.  The immersive reading does not work with books borrowed from The Amazon Prime lending library or with Audible narrations and Kindle books borrowed from the public library, but is very effective when using purchased Kindle books. Audible titles are often deeply discounted when the Kindle book is purchased FIRST. Unfortunately if I want Kindle books to mate to my hundreds of previously purchased audio books, they must be bought at full price. Not a big deal for me as I mostly listen on the go, but no early-adopter wants to feel that they have missed out due to their patronage.  My sole disappointment in the devise has been with the speaker volume, particularly with regard to audio books. I find the maximum volume to be adequate for steaming video from Netflix or Amazon Prime video, but for some reason the audio books are much lower in volume, too quiet for my middle aged ears, even when the Kindle is set on full volume. The speaker capacity is clearly there, and the audiobook volume is fine when I use earphones with my MP3 player, phone or the Kindle, but I can barely hear audio books on the external speakers when holding my Kindle while alone in a quiet room.  My mother has macular degeneration, and audio books are important to her. I had hoped that she could use my Kindle, and the clear controls on its bright screen to access the library of Audible titles I have acquired. She simply could not hear the narrations. Of course she could use headphones, and I am considering Bluetooth speakers, but these extraneous devises are needlessly complex for an elderly person.  I wonder if a software update might allow higher volume audio book playback?  I would also like to see an Overdrive app for the Kindle so that I can use audio books from my state library system. I listen to about 100 audio books a year, most of them free from the library. That does not keep me from being a good Amazon/Audible customer. I have subscribed to Audible's one or two book credits per month program for nearly four years, and have bought more books at the reduced member rate. As long as I'm unable to use my Kindle to download library audio books, I need to use a parallel set of devises for most of my listening. I look forward to software which would allow me to integrate all of my reading and listening.  Since Amazon has purchased Audible and has made great strides to integrate the Kindle reading and listening experience, it is clear that they have identified this as part of the future of reading. Please Amazon programmers do something so that I can set my Kindle down in a room and listen to an audio book as I go about my business.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Major bugs never get resolved, quickly loses product software support (no updates).", "Author": "Digitalmaster", "ReviewID": "RA5LVB4CAKG3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can't recommend this product because of the issues that I have had with it the past 4 months that I have owned it.First, when it comes to hardware, I would rate it 3/5. It loses two stars because the power button is on the side, right where the average user holds it to browse the web and play games. Because of the location of the button, it is constantly being depressed, putting it in sleep mode, and having to repeatedly unlock it during a game, or while browsing.The Silk browser is buggy, and I regularly have problems with it crashing. In all fairness, it could be the onscreen keyboard, as most all of my problems happen when the keyboard dialog comes up. Regardless, it makes this unusable for most things that I actually use this for.It is good for videos, and as an Amazon Prime subscriber, it is a great unit, but it spends more time on my shelf due to the issues mentioned above.It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this unit, and less than a month after purchasing, it was replaced with a new unit addressing some of the physical button problems that I mentioned above; problems Amazon told me that they had not heard from other customers...

Rosario", "ReviewID": "RMRYVTG5TLXR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between a Nexus 10 and the Kindle Fire HD.  Both devices have their advantages and disadvantages.The Nexus has the Google Play Store along with all of its apps, but you cannot access things such as Amazon Prime without using the browser.  Also, getting a Nexus 10 requires you to work with Google Play Store support which is not always the greatest as I have had to deal with and still am on an issue regarding a music purchase.The Kindle does not have access to the Google Play Store, but it does have the Amazon Appstore as well as Amazon Prime access.  The Amazon Appstore has most of the apps the Google Play Store has including Netflix and many of the games.  The biggest gripe I have with the Kindle is that for some reason Amazon does not offer any of the official Google apps such as Gmail, GTalk, Google Maps and Google Music.  There is a work around to get these apps on the device as I have installed them myself.  You have to authorize installation of 3rd party apps on the device and download the .apk file from a trusted website.  There are numerous websites out there that have official Google apps all you have to do is search for the .apk for the specific app.  Unfortunately, there is no support for the apps this way so you do not get updates and many times the icon looks blurry and not HD on the Kindle carousel.  Other than that, the Kindle is a great device especially when combined with Amazon Prime.  I am using a stylus with it now and find it works better with it.  The WIFI antennas are very good for the device and can connect to very weak signals with ease, would not recommend connecting to just any network as there are hackers out there looking to phish for anything.Amazon Prime is great as it not only grants you access to the numerous TV shows and movies Amazon has under contract, but it allows to borrow books for free from Amazon.As far as the price with the offers goes, I opted to include the offers as it knocked $15 off the price and the offers are only on the device when it is locked.  Upon waking the device (pressing the power button) an offer is displayed.  You swipe to unlock the device and the offer is gone, not to be seen again until you press the power button again once the device is off.  It is not bothersome at all.  I have not had any problems with the offers thing and at times I have been interested by the offers.I opted for the Kindle, purchased December of 2012, as it was cheaper and it allowed me to access Amazon Prime shows with no problem.  I also liked the Kindle reading aspect of it.  The device does have a setting under reading font, Sepia, which makes it so much easier to read than a regular white screen.  This is actually on any device that you download the Kindle app for including cell phones.I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a tablet that allows for a lot of media consumption as it has access to Amazon Prime with ease as well as Netflix.  In addition, it would be a better device for families as it allows parents to lock parts of the device to prevent children from purchasing or accessing things they are not supposed to.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is by far the best tablet out there for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Kevin Hearn\"", "ReviewID": "RVHQD8DS6KB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just start off by saying that I am not an apple fanboy, so I have never truly been impressed with iPads or any other Apple product after 2000. I don't feel like the value is there, and as someone who doesn't have a ton of cash to drop on something like a tablet, I just can't justify spending minimum $500-800 on one.I have had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet (32 GB) since they first came out in November and all I can say is: WOW! These tablets are amazing! I can tell you that it has literally changed my life (in a good way). :) I am going to list my comments individually in sections so y'all can see the parts that are most applicable to you.Build quality:I like the very solid, ergonomic feel of this Kindle. It is light enough to hold in one hand comfortably, yet I never feel like I'm going to drop it due to its weight (unlike my Galaxy S2 Smartphone). I do not, however, like the buttons on the top that control volume and the on/off. These buttons are almost completely flush to the device and it can be very difficult to press them. I also continually press the wrong button on the volume rocker to change the volume on the device because it feels backwards to me. I also wish the device could know when I changed it from landscape to portrait and adjust the volume knob to be a little more intuitive that way. That may sound like nitpicking, but it can be an annoyance.Screen:On that note, the screen on this thing is just gorgeous. I have used it outside, inside, full light, no light, everywhere you can imagine and I have never had a problem seeing anything on the device anywhere. I live in South Texas and it can be quite bright here in the daytime (especially around noon-2pm) and I have spent many Saturdays outside reading my Kindle without any problems. It does require more brightness out of the screen which reduces battery life, but I never read outside for more than two or three hours so I have never had an issue with running out of power. I cannot say enough positive things about this screen!User Interface:I love the Amazon Silk browser, it is great and works seamless with almost everything. I did the infamous flash workaround with the dolphin browser (google it) and that works great as well. The only complaint I have about the apps is...sometimes I don't want apps to come onto the carousel after I use them. I am major OCD and I like to have my carousel totally empty besides the book that I am reading. I like the apps and I use them often, but I have to remove them from the carousel periodically. I wish there was an option that said \"do not put apps on carousel\", or even a list of apps you could put on the device that would do the same. Again, nitpicky....but a tad bit annoying.Reading:What can I say about the reading on this device? It is superb. From magazines, to books, to newspapers...everything is great. I have never had a problem with any of this and it works great. I love getting my Men's Fitness and my fiance loves getting Cosmo as well. They are always crisp and clear (gotta love that HD screen) and are never glitchy or freezing. This is really where this Kindle has changed my life. I am a teacher and it is very difficult for me to fit certain books into my backpack for school...but it is easy to fit my Kindle in there. I have read more books in the past five months of owning this thing than I had in a year.Ordering:Part of the reason I have had so much success with my reading is that it is very easy to order books from the device. I have bought books and had family members buy me books for my birthday and never had a problem. It is almost TOO easy to buy things for this device...because I spend a lot of money on books to read every month. Again, no complaints. It is far easier to make a buy on my device (which I keep with me perpetually) instead of having to remember to hit up a bookstore on the way home. And, let me add, cheaper to buy on the Kindle.Videos:I bought extra storage space to put my DVR shows on my Kindle for watching at various points when I am not home. Besides the fact that the only content it plays is .MP4 (a tad annoying) but the videos are always crisp and clear and never have to buffer or queue. I have absolutely zero complaints about video or playback on the device.Overall I would say that I have absolutely zero regrets with my Kindle. I have nitpicky concerns, but they are far outweighed by the benefits of this device. If you are like me and looking for something to make reading books and magazines easier-or even watching videos or movies, this is definitely the Kindle for you. I hope this review helps any of you that are on the fence about buying a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". I love it so much, in fact, my fiance is getting one for her birthday, so she stops stealing mine. :)", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "My third version of the kindle", "Author": "W.

There may be a way to fix this but I am not sure how.  They say the new Kindle Fire HD has a sharper picture than the original Kindle Fire but for my eyesight I can not tell the difference.  What I do like is the size is awsome and makes playing games like angry birds or fruit ninja even better.  The backlight for reading makes reading with the lights off a breeze (does not hurt my eyes at all).  I love that amzon imported my music onto my kindle / cloud and the sound is very crisp when I use my earphones its like listiening to my MP3.  I also thought it was easy to bring over my photos from facebook to my kindle so I can share them with friends. However there are times when I am using my kindle that my hand will accedintaly hit the off button and I need to restart the kindle which is easy but still a drag this happens to me at least twice a day (i use the kindle for several hours daily).  Also, for what you pay it would nice to be receive a wall charger instead of the usb plug.  I paid extra for the rapid charger and did not notice much of a difference in charging time from my normal phone charger that has the same size charger.  All in all I love the kindel the ease it provides in shopping amazon, the ability to play my music, the importing of photos and most of all the ability to read with the lights off.

I'm already an Amazon Prime member and ultimately I decided I wasn\u2019t looking for a work horse tablet to run productivity software; I wanted a right sized media device that also lets me surf the web, check e-mail, run apps and watch YouTube videos.  And I didn\u2019t want to pay a fortune for it.  The HD 8.9 fits that bill nicely.  I travel a lot so I sprung for the 32 Gb version which I highly recommend.A lot has been commented on about the location of the power plug port and design of the power and volume buttons but I found once I got used to the buttons it was pretty easy to find them.  Even though the volume buttons don\u2019t show which increases or lowers the sound it\u2019s actually easy to figure out; up is for louder and down is for lower. But I think the power port would have been better placed at the opposite end of the on/off switch because as it is now you can\u2019t use the case as a stand unless you do what I did and turn the kindle upside down in the case.  That way the power can be plugged into the top allowing use of the case as a stand.As for web browsing I am very satisfied in how the browser works for me.  It\u2019s not the smoothest and fastest browser but it works well enough.  Overall I really like the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because it fits what I want to use it for.

Not a problem I happen to like them there. I use on Amazon when looking for new items anyway so them being on home screen to me seems a plus.Silk. It has no adobe flash plug-in. Not a problem with as yet was able to watch youtube mobile and visit all my normal web sites.Reading. I have to say I find reading on it as easy as first Fire even better, It has text-to-speech, and some books can be read by a real person if you also have the audible book. Which is actual kinda of cool. Gave it a try with Acheron by Kenyon which I happen to own in both formats (kindle and audible). It adds a new depth to the story. The x-ray for books is nice as well, was able to get info on the characters on the page and thier role in book.Video. Nice picture and sound has happy with it.Apps. Now apps are a problem seems alot of apps that work on Fire 1st gen do not work on HD. Don't know if its Amazon or developer issue (hope fix is just an update away). That being said there are apps I wanted on Fire 1st gen that do work for the HD which is a plus.Over all Im happy to have updated to the new HD model of the fire (which I owned for a year and was very happy with).Difference I like the bigger screen, more memory, and speakers and the bluetooth is nice. Paired with my Jabbra Steet 2 I was able to leave fire in room and go next door. FYI the control buttons on the Jabbra do work to control music on fire was able to skip song and replay remotly. For me this will allow me to use the music player on Fire more easly while walking vs the 1st gen where I had to do all from screen in bright sun light (not fun).

Then Kindle Fire HD 8.9 came out offering, in addition to the features of KF 7\", text-to-speech for e-books and improved sound for Audible books. So glad I switched. The text-to-speech engine is very good with few annoying mispronunciations and a convenient speed control. And Audibile books do sound SO much better. Music and video soundtracks are also much improved with the new audio system. KF HD has a helpful, relevant accessibility setting that adds voice to the control buttons so the tablet is much easier to use for the vision impaired, especially since there is no text-size choice for control buttons. I suspect that if the 7\" KF HD has the same accessibility features, it would be just as easy to use and a bit less cumbersome. Time now to explore KF HD's non-bookish features, so I just bought an e-manual to point me to the other cool features.

THANKS!!!!!", "Author": "okiedan \"Pro Bono Publico\"", "ReviewID": "RG2ZHBMEXCJXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reviews are in...and they all look good.  Thanks to all the other reviewers for taking the time to help us all out.  I want to post a short review that may outline a few things others have missed or glossed over.A VERY sincere thank you to Amazon!  After years of back and forth between Amazon and various advocacy groups Amazon has surprised THIS user with a wonderful gift.  I did not expect it and frankly had heard that Amazon once again was going to forget about their visually challenged users.  Not  so!After years of waiting for Amazon..... they finally have accessibility options on the Fire.You can have voice over turned on with explore by touch.  FINALLY.  It also offers a voice guide and an orientation lock.For those of us with vision issues this is a BIG deal.  If I did not have the free accessibility programs that come free on every Apple device I would be lost.  I am heavily invested in the Amazon eco system and read often using the kindle for mac application and activate my voice over and listen to my books.  Conversely I am also heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.  I chose Apple because of the totally free accessibility features.  If I used a PC I would have to buy a program that cost almost $700.00 just to do the same things I now do for free on my iMac.  No I am not saying apple is better....this is about accessibility for all people.  It is about preserving and protecting the rights of the millions of people who are different in some way than the so called normal person.I have both the 4G LTE 64gb and the WiFi only 32gb.As expected their is no real difference between the two.If you need more storage ,I do, and if you want to be able to do basic Internet activity while mobile ,I do, then the larger capacity 4G is a good choice.Setup on the ATT network was fast and easy.Out of the box the initial startup on both was very easy.  Once joined to my network it downloaded the latest OS and rebooted.The WiFi signal is in fact very good...or I should say the WiFi reception is very good.  I can travel from the front of my house to the far reaches of my backyard and still get a fair signal.  In the house the 5.0ghz signal is strong and consistent.The screen is magnificent.  The clarity and smooth operation are a real joy.  Sometimes if I have too many things happening with it..... i.e...... downloading an Audible book.... downloading some music.... and still attempting to use an app or read a book the device will have a little hiccup.  That however is very rare and easily managed by not trying to do everything at one time.My wife uses Medscape at the hospital and it looks great on the 8.9 screen.  It only took 15 minutes to download all of the required content for this app to work.I am amazed at how fast my content downloads over the WiFi.  I was able to add 30 audible books and 300+ books in a matter of a few hours.  The audible books took the longest.  I found that if I left my devices plugged in to ac and turned off the auto sleep function....my content downloaded a lot faster.If you are using the text to speech application you will be pleased to know it sounds great..... over the Dolby speakers.I also have found that if I turn the brightness down to a minimal level.... using Sepia mode with font at largest I can top light my Fire with mighty bright light to simulate a more Pearl Ink display.  I so this due to the extreme eye strain I suffer when looking at a bright light.......  I was amazed to find this works.  It might look a little strange but who cares!I mount my Fire on a Bookholder stand and use high powered glasses to be able to read the larger print on the Fire.  I do wish they made a couple of larger fonts... maybe later???So to sum it up.  Thanks to Amazon.  I truly thought you did not care about us.  I have been reading on blogs for months about how you would not do anything for special needs folks.  Now you have proved them to be wrong.UPDATE:  Using full accessibility options I have found the tablet easy to use.  The voice clearly tells me where I am on the screen. To open a book I move my finger over the menu to find the word book.  I hear it say book..... then I double click and the book opens.  To open the menu I use three finger swipe up to open and down to close.  Two fingers to change page.  Text to speech is at the bottom..and will open if I tap at the bottom of the screen.  I think I will try some bumps to see if they first will stick and second will not effect the display.  I have one good eye at 20/400 so I can use that to find a lot of things...but I want to know more..... could a totally blind person use bumps on a touch screen.  Will give it a try.  Wish I could get my hands on a few of the textbooks amazon is wanting to sell to schools....would like to see if they are accessible.When using Explore by Touch, use the following gestures to navigate:Unlock your KindleWith two fingers, swipe from right to left near the bottom of the screen.Open the Quick Settings menuWith two fingers, swipe down from the top of the screen.Scroll through items in the carousel and content libraries on the Home screenWith two fingers, swipe to the left or rightTurn pages in a bookWith two fingers, swipe to the left or rightDownload or open an itemDouble-tapMake menu selections onscreenDouble-tapThe Explore by touch also works with your music.  It will state where you are and also give you the artist...then the track name etc...IF you are blind or visually challenged like myself...and would like to discuss this NEW change please feel free to email me.

This seemed like the best bang for the buck, so I went ahead and purchased this item from Best Buy. I let it charge for a few hours before using it. Here is my unbiased, concise review so that it may help you in choosing a tablet.Display: Looks great. Text is crisp and clear, and video playback from the internet was very fast (almost instant) and looked very crisp. Amazon advertises the nice HD screen, and it definitely does deliver. Impressive.Sound: As advertised, this is the best sound available on a tablet. Music sounded awesome. I also watched a few HD movie previews from flixter that looked and sounded spectacular.Ease of Use: I am very used to android-based items, so it was very easy to jump into. Even for an apple user, I think the transition would be pretty much instant. The people giving this product negative reviews because it doesn't include an instruction booklet really need to get with the times. If you can't figure this thing out in 15-20 minutes, you have no business with a tablet.Build Quality: Device feels very solid and high quality. My issue is the buttons and the placement of the buttons. They are very flat and somewhat difficult to find. There is a volume button, and a button to shut off the screen (which also shuts off the device when held down). There were many times where I wanted to turn something up, but accidentally turned it down or shut the screen off. Kind of annoying.Web Browsing/Typing: Web browsing is fun and very smooth with this device over Wi-Fi. Pages load quickly and video playback is instant without any buffering or image quality issues. I walked around the house playing YouTube videos and got pretty far away from my Wi-Fi router without any changes in video playback. If you are just looking for a device that is small and able to surf the net with ease, you will definitely enjoy this despite a few issues noted below:- No flash. I knew this ahead of time, but you do not get flash on this device in case you didnt know. I found this to be slightly annoying, but not too bad. A lot of flash-based websites will simply direct the tablet to the mobile version which makes a big difference for some websites while remaining mostly the same for others.- Typing is SLOW. It is a major pain to type something long like an amazon review. SWYPE is AWFUL on this device. This is the major, major flaw. There is no auto-capitalizing, and no auto-spacing. I figured I would be able to swype a paragraph rather quickly, but since you have to hit the space button every time you swype a word, it gets to be very annoying and time consuming. What is the point of swype when you have to stop and hit space every time? For a end of 2012 android device, I thought this was a major mistake by Amazon.Apps: By far the biggest issue with this tablet. App selection is awful, as are the quality of some of the most popular apps. Most people know that Amazon runs a modified version of Android and does not have access to the Google Play Store. I knew this when I purchased the item, but figured it wouldn't be THAT different. I was wrong. App selection is extremely small, and most of the apps are dumb things like chess or puzzle games (not very useful). Popular apps are less functional and seem hastily made for the Kindle Fire. Facebook is among the worst apps for this device. The layout isn't user-friendly, and it has less functionality than a typical Android Facebook App. If you are used to Facebook functionality on a computer or Android phone, you will be disappointed with Facebook on the Kindle Fire HD.Most of the functional and popular apps you probably have on you Android phone are not available for the Kindle either.Ultimately, this lack of apps made me decide not to keep the Kindle.Overall:If you just want to use the internet, watch videos with fantastic image quality/sound, and buy things from Amazon then this tablet will be an excellent choice for you at an excellent price. If you enjoy flash-based websites, full Android functionality, access to Google Playstore, or want a computer-like tablet experience then you will surely be disappointed. You can purchase movies, albums, and typical Amazon items very easily with this device. Amazon lets you have unlimited cloud-based storage for all of the media you purchase from them which is a nice feature. The Kindle Fire HD came off to me as a very smart way for Amazon to sell more merchandise rather than being a fully functional tablet.Pros: Display, Sound, Web-Surfing, Media-Consumption capabilitiesCons: No flash, no expandable storage (even though you do have unlimited cloud storage for Amazon purchases), typing is awful, small selection of available apps, some of the most popular apps are non-existent or poorly madeAfter returning this item, I am continuing my research into a new tablet and am beginning to lean toward the Nexus 10 for an extra $100.00", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Glitchy, unresponsive, battery killer.", "Author": "Dean H Ravin", "ReviewID": "R2U5JDL1TNTWZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My  Kindle HD8.9  has  very short battery life, even in sleep mode it rapidly discharges it's battery.

Amazon says it isn't possible, but some how my 3 year old was able to purchase a couple hundred dollars in movies and merchandise while I was in the hospital giving birth to his brother. Amazon refused to credit back the money for the movies my son purchased, and if I returned the merchandise I had to pay the shipping for the return. I also ordered a season pass for Teen Wolf II for my daughter, and it kept deleting off my account for almost 4 months, and I had to purchase the season through ITunes so my daughter could watch them as they released. Amazon would not credit the season pass when it wouldn't work either. So I no longer purchase season passes or movies through Amazon, and I don't leave an active credit card on my account either. I now purchase movies, TV series, Books, and Games through ITunes to play on my IPad and ITouch.

I LOVED my Playbook, and was skeptical about the KF meeting my high expectations.  OK, I give....it's everything it's proposed to be, and WELL worth the cost.

All of my Kindles have given me great gadget joy, but the HD models came with one great flaw in hardware design: the placement of the charging port.These latter devices -- heck, the whole Fire line -- have been designed for media far beyond books. Specifically, video, which they all handle beautifully. The HD models, spectacularly. And take note of all, ALL of the covers that they sell for these models: they are all designed to allow the device to stand in landscape mode to avail themselves to the strength.My original Kindle Fire (first generation) looks a little it silly with the power plug coming out of its \"side\", but it functions perfectly that way. It stands in its pretty little (extra purchase) case and shows me video. Or plays music or games or even lets me read, but it stands naturally on its broad edge doing so.The HD models in their specifically designed cases though are awkward at best because the charging cable impedes resting the devices on their long edge: they \"lean\" on the cables instead. This causes imbalance and clumsiness and can cause undo wear on the charging connectors themselves.Fortunately, a ready solution presents itself in a different design for the charging cables. Make them with bent or hinged connectors so they don't simply jut out stupidly from the device and the device can then stand much more normally and the world will be perfect again.That one flaw is the only one that the Fire HD has to contend with, as far as I'm concerned.I ordered mine even before the whole ad-supported thing was an issue, the day it was announced in fact. I left that order intact as to not lose my place in line. I figured I'd deal with the $15 later. Having seen what all the fuss is about, it's mostly trivia. I'll be paying the $15 within a few days I'm sure, but it has largely been a on-issue.As for the device itself, with the aforementioned flaw aside, it is nothing short of spectacular.The display is stunning, the sound is surprisingly great, the networking is solid and the bluetooth range is exceptional. The touch screen is notably more responsive than the original Kindle Fire. Despite what I noticed in another review, setting up the AT&T; mobile service was a no-brainer.I had the presence of mind when I ordered this machine to go ahead and buy a wall socket charger, so charging it is nowhere near the headache that others have expressed. In fairness, this is one area where Amazon might have been a little more proactive and these models might have been better served by including this accessory, but I won't belabor this point.Overall, I am as delighted with both of my Fire HD purchases as I was with my first Kindle (keyboard model) and my first Kindle Fire. They all serve me books and music, but the Fires serve me video, which is what I am usually most hungry for.

This Kindle is just what I expected to be and I am extremely happy with it so far. I cannot understand some of the 1 and 2 star reviews that people are giving it. It seems like most of the low reviews are based on the fact that the purchaser did not review the specs on the Kindle to know what they were getting. I know that every now and again someone is going to get a dud but with amazons awesome customer service they will have a new one at the door the next day. I have a hard time believing the reviews that say customer support did not help them in any way.I have the 7 inch Kindle fire and I thought that one was great but needed a few tweaks. I did not like the speakers, but I would wear headphones most of the time anyway. The speakers on the new Kindle Fire 8.9 are great, no trouble at all while watching a show.

I have not done any browsing online yet but I did download a few TV episodes in HD today and I was pleased at how fast they were done. The screen is just awesome, great picture and very quick response on the touchscreen. I will be testing it in bright sunlight soon but if the specs are correct that should be ok, one thing I could not do on my first Fire.I am not going to get all technical and go through all the specs, but the bottom line is as long as you research this and are aware that this is mainly used for entertainment and your not planning on running your home based business from your Fire HD you should be ok.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Movies/TV, Books, Games & Magazines (not good for web browsing)", "Author": "Cliff Hays \"Cliff Hays\"", "ReviewID": "R2TSVS82KQ3LPV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Good:In terms of hardware this is an excellent upgrade to the original Fire. The sound is better, the display is stunning by comparison, and it has eight times the storage capacity! As a result movies/TV and games look and sound awesome. Magazines - which I could not even stomach on the original Fire - are spectacular on this device. The pictures are clear and crisp, and the user interface can behave like a real magazine or a Kindle eBook. PDFs are also far more readable. The favorites have been moved to a star icon at the screen's bottom right (very convenient) to make room for a new feature of the carousel: as each new item moves to the fore, beneath it appears a scrollable shelfful of recommended items based on that item. So say you finish reading a really good book and want to find others like it, all you have to do is go to the home screen, bring that book to the fore on the carousel, and like magic you have a whole slew of recommendations to browse. This feature works on all types of items: mp3s, videos, games, etc. Another improvement is that there are external volume controls (unlike the original Fire where you would have to exit most apps to change the volume). In addition to magazines and PDFs looking great, ordinary kindle books look great as well (and the onboard ebook reader app is excellent as always).The Bad:The major flaw of this device is Silk (Amazon's own in-house made-for-kindle web browser). For users of the original Fire, Silk's bad name is nothing new. Only this time around I had an even worse experience with it! Basically, in two stints of web browsing (probably about 5 minutes each) the Silk browser froze multiple times for no apparent reason (usually about 20 to 30 seconds a freeze) and at the end of three of those freezes the browser not only crashed but caused the entire device to restart. Funnily enough, when Silk seemed to actually be working correctly it was extraordinarily slow. Unfortunately for the HD 8.9\" there are no other browsers in the app store at this time to use in place of Silk. Another drawback of HD 8.9\" is that several other apps that worked on the original Fire are not available: i.e. Art Authority, Treasures of Montezuma 2. For Kindle Fire users, I would check to see that your favorite apps will work on the 8.9\" before ordering it, that way you are not disappointed after the fact.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Going to love toting this around with me!", "Author": "J.

Music is fabulous on the 8.9 although I do not detect difference between the 7 inch HD and the 8'.9 as others have noted.There is a new difference in the keyboard which will take a bit of getting used to - the period has been replaced by an apostrophe. Long hold to get popup selection which then allows you to assign period or alternate punctuation to key.The processor seems  noticeably faster as my book archives appear instantly on the 8.9 and can take a full minute on the 7 inch HD.

I love reading books on  my 2 Kindles, I love listening to audiobooks and I was in the market for a tablet that I could do the above.I also wanted a tablet I could also take on trips, use to search the web, follow my Miami Hurricanes on message boards and do some rudimentary legal research  on Westlaw Next away from home in a pinch.Got the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 on Nov. 21from Amazon.(The battle I had with FED EX isn't worth going into.)I came down with pneumonia for Thanksgiving and thereafter. This was the first weekend I had to really spend some time with the Kindle Fire. The images look great,audio sounds great but after the 10th time the silk brouser crashed using the web and Westlaw App. I realized this tablet just wasn't what I needed. For entertainment and as long as you stay within Amazon media it is great, but for a tablet for all around use as well, it just wasn't reliable enough for me. Well I retuned the Kndle fire H.D. 8.9  and bought an I pad 4. And Iam glad I did. The I pad was  better on the web. It was not as good for images or sound and quite frankly not as good for the internal keyboard. Most importantly  you can not get a program on the Ipad that will automatically turn the pages on a book like a kindle. (You can do this on a Kindle  by activating the text to speech and turning the sound all the way down).  This was important to me as this is the way I exercise at the gym.  I make the print large and the Kindle tuns the pages while I am  on the treadmill, elliptical, or recumbent bike.  After a few days I missed the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I retuned the Ipad 4 and bought another Kindle FIre HD 8.9 at Best Buy.  --  Wouldn't you know this one surfs the web fine.

While the browser renders pages on Amazon.com quickly and with similar speed as a traditional browser on a PC or Mac, be prepared for very long load times, page load access errors and a lot of time spent watching the little circle spin on other sites.While my days are spent providing software support for a Cloud based application where typically my PC will have two versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox, Chrome and Safari browsers all open at the same time, I was not looking to write a review on the Silk browser. I just wanted to be able to surf the internet with a tablet.But instead of surfing the internet, I'm here writing a review because visiting amazon.com is the only site that will load. I wanted to relax and read the news or the sports, but instead I end up sitting with my Mac, PC and kindle next to my router trying to figure out whats up with the Silk browser and why sometimes it will render a page and others times be totally hopeless on the same page.I've tried a number of tests where a computer and the kindle were active and where only the kindle or laptop were on the network. The results are consistent where the kindle can take minutes and the same page (ex: sportsillustrated) will take minutes to render or just fail to load at all and the laptop will render in a couple of seconds.Yes a laptop has more processing power, but taking minutes to load a text based site such as drudge or not being able to load it at all is just not acceptable. Sometimes the page loads and sometimes not.I'm hoping there is a fixable solution and Amazon is not doing what MS did in the early days of breaking other peoples products to keep you using their products. Just as I hope that Amazon is dedicating enough resources to provide a quality browser product. Amazon is big and very profitable and should be able to develop a quality browser.

(More on Binocular Vision at the bottom) I read about a book a month, I write essays for a blog twice a month, and as a student, I found the amazing advantage of having a kindle as an even more portable option to my old, heavy laptop. I could get to my google docs, surf the web, listen to my music, watch media and pretty much satiate all my needs for my laptop save actually typing things out. With the addition of blutooth, I can now do that very easily with a bluetooth keyboard. I like to do alot of casual dining, and I usually read while I'm out and about, so it's great that I can work away at my essays as well. The screen size is apt for long documents, and media consumption without being excessive. With the Marware Vibe case it still just fits in my jacket or cargo pocket and follows me everywhere I go. It's got the right power behind it this time to cut down on the sytem lag present in the old fire.TEXT TO SPEECH: One AWESOME feature I didn't know the Fire had was Text to Speech. It's hidden under the settings while in the reader, under more options. I highly suggest it for the non-fiction reader. This way I can listen to my books at work when I can't be reading them, as well as in my car on the go. Saves a ton on audio books. It does a surprisingly good job with pronunciation and sentence structure, though it's still far from perfect. The lady's voice ends up sounding like British NPR, in that, she sometimes says things a little funny and she reads like it's the news, so it's probably not the best for fiction, but on the whole I know alot of real people that are more difficult to understand.MY ONE CON: The lack of google apps. Particularly Google+ and Hangouts. I was hoping to use the webcam for that...ON THE TOPIC OF BINOCULAR VISION: I can't focus on physical books, I apparently have a problem with my binocular near vision I've only recently found out about where my eyes struggle to focus properly on things up close. Having a kindle on a stand, has allowed me to move books further away, reducing the strain, and unlocked this voracious appetite for books I never knew I had. I always liked the idea of books, people always mistook me for a bookish person, but they couldn't keep my attention, often making me quite tired. Depending on the study you read, up to 7% of the population is affected by this. If you have trouble reading, focusing, or staying awake while reading books, you should ask you optometrist about it, and if so, the Kindle might be just the answer you've been looking for.

Without that discount, the cost before tax would have been $384 (for the \"Without Special Offers\" version).  Today I noticed that Amazon slashed the prices for Kindle Fire HD 8.9, so that the version I purchased would be $314! (as of March 13, 2013)  For that price, I would HIGHLY recommend this product.A little background on how I initially made the decision to purchase a Kindle Fire HD.  I have friends and family that own tablets, although the majority of them own the iPad.  Anyone who's played around with an iPad the last few years was probably at least somewhat impressed.  I've had several versions of iPods over the years, as well as a Blackberry for work.  So if I were to get a tablet, my initial preference would be for an iPad.  However, given that the cheapest iPads were still quite expensive (and I didn't want one without the retina display), I'd been on the fence about getting a tablet.  When the Kindle Fire HD went on sale, I figured, \"what the hell!\" and went ahead and purchased it (helped that I also had some giftcards, credit to use).At first, I was a little underwhelmed, as I was hoping for a similar experience to using at iPad, but I eventually learned to accept the limitations of the Kindle Fire HD and recognize what it excelled at.LIMITATIONS of KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9:My biggest complaint - lack of apps.  Anyone who's used an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad knows how many apps there are in the Apple catalogue.  Similarly for most Android phones, tablets, etc.  However, although the Kindle OS is build from Andoid, it's not really an Android environment.  They emphasize all of the popular apps that are available for the Kindle Fire, but there are many more which are not.  The frustrating thing is that Amazon sells apps for other Android devices in their appstore, but many of these are not compatible with Kindles.  An example of an app that I would like to install is Yelp or even something as simple as a Monopoly game (there is a version of it for Kindle, but not the one I wanted).  Not a big deal overall, but something to consider.  There's also something called \"side loading\", which I will get to in a bit.Silk browser - alot of the apps that aren't available have websites.  So one of the ways I worked around it is by just bookmarking their websites in the Kindle's browser, Silk.  However, that leads to my next issue.  The browser kind of sucks.  When it works, it's fine, but I has a tendency to crash quite a bit, which can be frustrating.  There are other browsers that you can install, but it's not so simple.Interface/ Smoothness of OS - most of the time this isn't an issue, but I have had occasions where navigating the Kindle Fire HD has gotten a little laggy or \"hiccup-y\".  It got so bad in the first few weeks of having it, that I had to reinstall the software, which has fixed this issue for the most part over the past two plus months of ownership.Video Formats - if you're like me and you want to use the Kindle Fire HD as a media tablet (video, music, magazines, books, etc.), you probably have quite a few videos on your home computer that you'd like to view on the tablet.  Well, if they're AVI's or anything other than these (MP4, 3GP, VP8), you're out of luck.  Anything copy-protected other than videos from Amazon is not going to work.  Now there are ways to convert files from another format to an .mp4 video that the Kindle Fire can handle (Handbrake), but it's kind of a pain.  They obviously want to direct you to their extensive video library, but if it's something that you already own on another format, it's somewhat frustrating.  Also, once you have the video file of your choice on the Kindle Fire, using the \"Personal Videos\" app on the device, you can't necessarily tell which video is which at first glance as it represents each video as a static screenshot (which could be a black screen!).THINGS I LIKE about KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9:Obviously the price is a big seller.  But you sometimes get what you pay for - what you don't get is an iPad experience, but it's still pretty damn good.Screen/ Hardware - I don't think it's quite the same as the retina display, but to my untrained eyes, the screen is pretty nice.  I have an iPod touch, and I've used it to watch videos, but one of the main reasons I wanted a tablet was for a bigger screen, and I am very happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Some have complained it's too big or heavy to hold with one hand, and yeah, I get that, but it works for me.  I also liked the rubbery backing, and when it's working smoothly, the touchscreen is great.Sound - yes, it does have great speakers for a tablet.  Makes it very nice to watch videos, listen to music, play games, etc.  They face backwards, behind the tablet, which is sort of weird, but it's not a major issue for me.  It does come with a headphone jack as well, of course, and the headphone sound depends on your headphones, but it's fine.Reading/ e-reader - Given that this is a tablet from Amazon, it's natural that it should be an excellent e-reader.  My fiance has a dedicated (e-ink) e-reader, the Nook, and you can't beat the battery life and the screen quality (for reading) of e-ink, but given everything else you can do with a Kindle Fire HD, that's a minor quibble.  As Amazon no doubt counts on, I have purchased several Kindle books once I purchased my Kindle Fire HD, and I've really enjoyed reading them on the device.  I even purchased the Audiobook versions a few times, and I really liked reading along to the professional narration provided by WhisperSynch for Voice.  Oh, I should also mention that you can purchase graphic novels that are optimized for the Kindle Fire, which is pretty cool.  Locke and Key: Vol. 1 Welcome to Lovecraft Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2--ShardsWhisperSynch/ Cloud - the fact that I can be anywhere, and purchase an app from Amazon or a Kindle book and then have it show up on my Kindle Fire HD automatically is a plus.  Also, the cloud storage for any mp3s/ videos that you purchase from Amazon and the ability to then download them to your Kindle Fire or play them from the cloud (with wifi connection) is great.  I am seriously considering paying the $25 or so to be able to upload all of my mp3's/ music from my computer to their cloud player.  The new Autorip feature also is pretty cool in that it automatically adds .mp3 versions of any CD you purchased from Amazon to your Cloud Player library.Amazon Prime - yes, you get one month of Amazon Prime free.  I also opted to pay the $79 for a full year.  Not only do you get free 2-day shipping of physical products, but for the Kindle Fire owner, you get access to their Netflix-like archive of movies and tv shows.  While it's not as good as Netflix, it's still pretty great.  There's enough shows and movies that I'm interested in to make it a good investment.  I don't know if I would purchase Prime only for the shipping, but add in the Prime Videos, and it's worth it.  You also get access to the Kindle Lending Library, but aside from a few well-known series (Hunger Games, Harry Potter), the majority of books available are either public domain or self-published.  I have no doubt that some of these books are great, but most of them are uninteresting to me, a rather avid reader.ISSUE on WHICH I AM \"AGNOSTIC\" - I think 16 GB is a little too small for most people, so I opted for the 32GB version.  I think this gives me enough flexibility to upload my personal media to the device, but it's still somewhat limiting.  If you use your Kindle Fire HD for mostly streaming media or Kindle books, then it probably won't be an issue.  But if you plan on adding tons of video and/or audio files, it's somewhat limiting for times when you don't have wifi.A few notes on apps and \"Side Loading\"So there are some decent apps that you can purchase from Amazon.  Many of these are free, and I'll highlight a few that I like.Twitter - much easier to use than the Facebook app.  Not much else to add.  I use it and it's free.  TwitterES File Explorer - this is a great app that you can use to look at all of the files on the device.  It also has a built in video player, and I've found it easier to use than the Kindle's native \"Personal Videos\" player.  Yes, as I've noted previously, you can upload your own videos to the Kindle Fire HD, but they must be in a .m4v or .mp4 format.  You can find many video converters that you can use to convert non-protected video formats from one to another (Handbrake is what I use). Free.ES File ExplorerComicCat - This is a paid app, but only $2.99.  If you like to read comics, especially e-versions, then it's a good investment.  You can find all sorts of comics online for purchase or otherwise.  I believe it only reads .cbr or .cbz files, but again, it's easy to covert zip files to these formats.  ComiCatAngry Birds Star Wars - similar game to the original.  Looks great on the Kindle Fire HD.  Angry Birds Star Wars Premium HD (Kindle Tablet Edition)Plants vs. Zombies - one of the other really well-known games available for the Kindle Fire.  Graphics appeared to scaled up versus actual HD, but this game is one of my favorites.  Plants vs. Zombies (Kindle Tablet Edition)Side-loading apps - As I mentioned before, Amazon sells more apps on their Android appstore than it allows to be installed on the Kindle Fire tablet series.  So you can buy some of these apps, but you can't actually run them from your tablet.  You can also download and then upload apps from other stores and sources and install them on your Kindle Fire, but you first have to change the device settings to allow you to install apps from \"unknown sources.\"  So side-loading is basically putting these apps for Android (from Amazon or elsewhere) on your device manually.  Sometimes they will open and work, other times they will never open or crash your device.  It's a mixed bag.  Do your research on where to find safe software to purchase, and be aware that it may or may not work before you spend money on non-Amazon approved apps.  I initally side-loaded a few apps, including the Maxthon browser Maxthon Mobile on my Kindle.  Sometimes they worked, but I think that's what also led me to reinstall the OS after a few weeks.  I hope Amazon speeds up the process for approving Kindle Fire apps in the future to avoid this issue!A few notes on accessories:Power cord - the Kindle Fire HD only comes with a USB cable with which you can charge it.  It is VERY SLOW to recharge connected to a computer.  I got around it by using the cord with wall adapter for another device, but even then it takes 10-12 hours to fully recharge from empty.  They sell their own charger for an additional $20, which kinda sucks, but I finally did it and bought one the other day (with a $20 credit). Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries)Case - you don't NEED a case, but I think it's worth investing in one.  I found one for a decent price with decent reviews.  There are several options out there.  Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", BlueMicro-HDMI out cord - you can also use any larger display with HDMI to view what's on your Kindle.  I purchased one for a few bucks.  I've found that I never use it.  Up to you.So overall, these are my detailed thoughts about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 GB.  While it's not the BEST tablet out there, I think its benefits far outweigh its deficits, so I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a tablet for a really reasonable price (especially for Amazon fans, who probably already have one already!).", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent choice for me", "Author": "Cheryl Hannah \"AspenGal\"", "ReviewID": "R2W9E6QKINW2BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have an iBrain - won an iP*d at a conference, tried using it for 3 months and sold it to a co-worker due to my frustration-factor.  I definitely prefer Android to Apple ios, I've discovered.  After much internet-searching, I decided to buy myself a 9\" Kindle FIRE HD for Christmas with some Amazon gift cards.  A very good choice on my part!  I'm already a member of the Amazon-universe (have owned 2 Kindles [2nd-gen and Touch], have the Kindle reader on my desktop PC and netbook, am a Prime member, shop Amazon quite a bit) so the FIRE has fit right in to 'my' electronic universe.I did not need or want a replacement for my desktop PC - the FIRE provides a nice alternative for access to most of the functions I want to use while traveling or at work (where many websites like YouTube and personal email sites are blocked on those computers).  I did not purchase the 3G version, since Wi-fi works for my purposes. Wi-fi is pretty widespread around the U.S.  I've had no problem accessing wi-fi while traveling internationally either, in Turkey, Ireland, Australia, since most hotels now offer free wi-fi. While traveling I like to keep track of local weather where I'm staying, home emails, US news, pay ebills while away, check out local entertainment venues, etc.  I have a small netbook which I've taken with me in the past for this purpose...now my FIRE will handle everything I did with my netbook, while being smaller and more lightweight to carry.  My 9\" FIRE fits in most of my handbags except the smaller cross-body bags.I'm not a big gamer, nor do I want to store a lot of videos or movies on my FIRE, so the 16G version works for me.  I still have 87% of my available memory left, so I CAN download a few movies for the long flight to Venice this fall.  I have watched some TV shows via the Xfinity app (our local cable company) - all but one worked very well with my home wireless router, with no stopping-and-starting or freezing of the video.  I'm a photographer, and will NOT be using the FIRE for photos since I have a nice digital camera.  It seems very awkward to me to attempt to use any tablet as a 'camera'.  That function was not important to me in my decision.The HD screen is very sharp and colorful (even my die-hard Apple friends admit '...it looks GOOD!').  The touch-screen is sensitive (although it helps to frequently clean the oily fingerprints from it - I clean it daily just before I start the overnight re-charge).  Adding my gmail email account to it was very easy, I've added the VMWare app for access to my work computer, and several other apps which I've used on my desktop PC and find work well on the FIRE also (I've reviewed many of them on the Amazon website).  I still prefer reading books on my Kindle Touch (easier to hold in my hands for a long time), but I do read on my FIRE when I'm also using it for other things (emails, YouTube, checking emails, etc).  Amazon's 'syncing' of last-page-read works very well for both devices (as long as I remember to turn on the wireless on my Kindle Touch while I'm reading).I bought the Amazon cover for my FIRE (though I choked at the $40 pricetag); it works pretty well for propping it in a horizontal alignment (although it does 'slide' flat occasionally on slick surfaces), not very good for vertical since there's no viewing angle adjustment (I seldom use it in that way, though a couple of apps display ONLY in the vertical mode).  I like how slim this cover is - doesn't add much bulk to my FIRE, and seems to protect it well.  For use at home and my job it works fine.  I'll probably buy another cover, though, once more are available for this new 9\" HD-version of the FIRE; a cover which will allow multiple angles in both the horizontal and vertical positions (I have one of those for my older 7\" Galaxy tablet, and it works very well).I ALWAYS buy at least 2 extra power cables for every electronic device I own; per other reviewer's advice, I bought the non-Amazon AC 'rapid-charger' which was half the price and works much better than trying to charge via USB.  I took the USB-only 'charging cable' which came with the FIRE to work, so I can plug my FIRE into my desktop computer while using it there.  Other reviewers are correct in stating re-charging via the USB function is VERY slow.  In fact, my FIRE tells me when I turn it on that it won't \"re-charge\" the battery while I'm using it; however, it does MAINTAIN my battery charge while in use, so at least I'm not draining it.LOVE my 9\" Kindle FIRE HD...I'm much happier with it than I was with the iP**.

Internet works well and fast. Entering text is fast and precise. Screen quality is dazzling.  I bought this especially for an ebook reader - kindle and PDF - but will use it also for typical tablet activities.Having not had a touch kindle before, I took this for a test run with my previously bought kindle version of Canterbury Tales (Penguin edition), which is heavily footnoted.  What a delight to swap easily between the text and the footnotes, with just a touch!The PDF reader which comes with this works well, but has the typical issue of most PDF viewers that if you want your page size larger, you have to re-zoom each page.  I installed RepliGo PDF reader (from the Amazon store) which retains your page size as you scroll.  It also has a feature to use the volume keys (at the top, next to on/off switch) to page forward or back, which is a nice alternative to the finger-touch method.The size of this device is wonderful.  I have an ipad-sized tablet already, and it is just a bit too big for comfort, or to carry around in a handbag. Also have a 10\" netbook for reading at home, which I still cherish, but of course the size and weight cannot compare.Prediction: The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 will be a big winner longterm, and its size may well become standard for tablets.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Like a high quality paper book. As always, i find the Kindle touch screen technology to be less than perfect (that's where the 5th star went, and it made me feel guilty). But the overall performance is spectacular. And I have owned at least one of every Kindle branded eReader, and have read hundreds of books. This is a great reader.Now to other things: As a movie player, and music player, and photo display, it again is terrific. Whether it beats the latest iPad, I don't know. But it has to be close, and it is better than earlier models. (Disclaimer-I own one of the latest generation iPads with the Retina display)SO HERE IS MY ADVICE: BUY THE 32 GB VERSION, SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO EXCHANGE FOR IT LATER, LIKE I DID. The thing is good enough you will use it for all sorts of things. Let me be clear: Other than screen performance, this is NOT to say it is an iPad. That's not its purpose in life, though it obviously will do lots of things as its support system grows.It is the best eReader around, with movies, music, and photos thrown in. Just save the effort and get the 32 first time around.PS:And icing on the cake is the Kindle leather \"Standing Leather Case\". Wonderful quality, and the feel and smell of the leather is like an expensive car. I wish something that trim, and high quality was available for my iPad. So I would buy this case (Mine is in the \"tan\" color!), if for no other reason than the fact that the eReader is so thin, and slick finished that it is hard to hold.

I didn't feel it was up to I [Pod standards, but that's just me.  I was contacted by Amazon via email in April about my review and they seemed to want to help but I didn't bother to get back to them.  Then this week  my music stopped playing; my videos wouldn't play and so I decided to call them even though by this time almost five months had gone by and I felt I was too late to get any help.  Not so, Amazon's customer service walked me through some easy trouble shooting and when that still didn't work they sent me a brand new one the next day with overnight shipping. So the reason I was not crazy about my Kindle was due to the fact that I had a defective model and now my new one works superbly and I am extremely happy and I can't say enough how much customer service from Amazon made the experience much more worth it.  You got a problem? Contact Amazon.  They want to know why you're not happy.

I even made a few trips to Best Buy so I could handle and use each size to compare the two, as well as other brands.  I figured that the larger 8.9\" size was best for me because I need reading glasses now and I was a little hesitant about the smaller screen model.  I also joined Amazon Prime when I bought my Kindle and the instant videos are fantastic.  I've had my Kindle about 3 months now and I've ordered more books than I ever would have thought because there are some great low prices (for me - $3.99 and under) on many wonderful books on Amazon.  I am wary of which games I download because of permissions but am totally hooked on the few I have which were either free or cost $1.99 or less.I bought my Kindle because I was going to be starting dialysis and I didn't want to use my laptop on a shared network and of course because the Kindle Fire is so much smaller and lighter weight.  It has proved to be no problem to hold for long periods of time and is very comfortable to use.  Movies are clear and beautiful and many of the ones I watch are subtitled and those are very easy to read.  Typing on the keyboard is easy and never annoys me unlike trying to use the tiny one on my Dell Mini 9\".  I have not needed to purchase a stylus and doubt that I will.  Wiping the screen with a microfiber cloth keeps it clean and print-free, though I am very careful and protective of my Kindle.  I bought a strapless neoprene carrying case that fits perfectly into another neoprene carrying case with handles as my intention was for the Kindle to bounce when tucked inside it's protection if it ever falls and I think it just may do that.I ordered the charger with my Kindle because I didn't have any other that I could use and it is great, too and was only $10.00.  The only function that really seems to eat up battery power is playing games but in one 6 hour dialysis session, I can easily watch a movie, read a book, and play games all on one charge.The only drawback is mine, nothing to do with the Kindle.  I live very rurally and my internet connection is beyond slow, so I have to load movies when I visit friends who have high speed connections, but I just load 10 or 12 (at perhaps 2 minutes per movie) and they remain on the Kindle more than long enough for me to watch one per dialysis session (every other day).  Books load with no problem, despite my ISP.  An operator at Amazon said that he'd worked there for 9 years and never seen anyone with as slow a download speed as mine!I am enormously pleased with my Kindle Fire HD and still cannot believe I own it.

Personally, I don't want to be driving over a bridge calculated by an Engineer reading an incorrectly displayed formula, you know?We're developers and work on this problem for all e-readers, and I was more than pleased to see that both the HD and larger screen REALLY helps eliminate this problem, both for texts and journals. We've even had to convert some complex math to graphics/ pictures to get formulas to display on older Kindles, and this new device will please both readers and publishers alike, who will be much less reticent to try more complex texts on Kindle.For any of you dear readers that are thinking not just of gaming and music-- the advanced display features here are also outstanding for those professional journals in both STEM and more pictorial subscriptions like chess magazines. All the hype about this new tablet is around entertainment, but don't forget that it started life as a READER-- and devices that can't handle certain types of texts are pretty useless!

This means that you probably already have a format that will translate your LaTEX, diagrams, chemical formulas, etc. nicely for this device. The HD renders them beautifully, and the size eliminates a lot of wrap issues. We do recommend you NOT use reverses in print for formulas, because many e readers will black them out.

My kindle 8.9 experience however has since changed my opinion of the kindle format and of Amazon as a retailer.First of all, I am writing this following packing up 2, yes 2 replacement kindles (simultaneously) that are sitting on my table.I initially purchased the 8.9 HD on Jan 15 for the sole purpose of using it for textbooks. The 1st one came quickly however, the rocker volume was broken so a replacement was sent out. The replacement  had a defective touchscreen that was replaced by another. This one had what the tech described as a defective software/hardware interface. All I know is that the volume did not work when running an app.Sadly, I begin this evening by installing the 4th purchased screen protector on the 4th replacement kindle only to find after flipping it over that this kindle was a refurb! It honestly looked like someone ate a sheet pizza and then drew with their oily fingers on the back. Again, I called and talked to a gentleman who was overseas and spoke in broken English. He is now sending me yet another (5th kindle) and I anticipate that I might perhaps be able to view the digital textbook that was purchased in January for the class that ends in 2 weeks within a couple days.I understand that some people who have working kindle hd's love them. My daughter who owns an original Kindle Fire loves hers very much. I however can't in good conscious recommend this device to anyone. Or the Amazon customer service/replacement team for that matter. All I can do is hope that maybe the 5th time is the charm. Oh, that would be after I get the screen protector pack that I yet again just ordered on Amazon.Update 10/8/2013 -After 6 months of use, the 5th kindle has proven to be functional and usable (touch screen works and volume adjusts properly). The continued issues I experience are as follows:- The included Web browser is garbage and will lockup routinely. Do yourself a favor and download a replacement browser and set it to be the system default ASAP. I have experienced no issues with competing internet browsers and have concluded that amazon SILK is simply unusable.- Text books are hit or miss. Some of the texts that I have bought have formatting issues that cause in some cases text to be missing and/or picture artifacts to be displayed over certain text boxes, making reading complete chapters impossible. This may or may not be an amazon issue however, amazon should not market this tablet for college text books as they are not fully functional. My rating of this product stands as 5 kindles later the kindle is still not what I payed for.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I shoulda done my research", "Author": "RAlthouse \"justareview\"", "ReviewID": "R1I3DWXJSLQJ9U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of Kindle since forever, so when I was in the market for a tablet, I ordered Fire 8.9. I wish I had researched it better. Fire is a fine device, but has some shortcomings in areas that are important to me.As an e-book device, my first disappointment was was lack of \"collections\", something I enjoyed on Touch. On Fire, books you download from the cloud appear on your home page page on Kindle's carousel arranged by date, author or title. But say you want to put all your 'mysteries' together? Won't be happening. My Catholic Studies books are mixed in with random fiction. A small thing, maybe, but a step backward from Touch.The next HUGE disappointment is that Kindle Fire seems less able to download and use most apps than my (very simple) smart phone. This isn't just lack of flash, this I believe, is Amazon hoping to market other apps. Take the simple yet very popular Candy Crush game. Nope, can't have that...but Amz has a ripoff of it. Or you can buy a book that will tell you HOW to use the app on Fire.  Facebook and Tumblr, yep, no problem. EPIX movie channel?  Well, you can dl the app, but since you have no Flash, you won't be watching movies with it.  And there are many, many games I had on my Touch which just aren't available on Fire. Look, if someone like ME is angered about apps that won't work, young people will surely be disappointed.I bought the cover Amazon recommends, and it's a dandy cover. Except that when Fire is plugged in and charging, you can't set your Kindle up to read or watch in landscape mode...the plug comes out the bottom. *So, you wanna watch a video, and keep your Fire plugged in?...see the problem there?Fire is fine for web browsing, and I like the fact that all my email accounts can be synch'd and in one location.  It is wonderful for reading, backlit and in color for magazines.But, even with my limited prowess of tablets and iPads, I just couldn't recommend it as a viable alternative to other tablets.

It continues to provide a reasonable platform to access media for entertainment purposes.My primary issue is that the Kindle is not a stand-a-lone device primarily in two areas:1.  It is impossible according to Amazon support to load pictures directly from my camera onto the Kindle Fire HD.  I do not understand the need to load the pictures on to a PC or or on the web via a PC before I can access them on my Kindle.2.  The Kindle also lacks the ability to connect to my WIFI connected printer. While this is likely due to lack of an app for my particular printer (an HP) it does reflect on the lack of some basic apps for this tablet or differences between the Windows and Amazon/Android approach to basic utilities.For now it looks like I will need to use my Windows laptop to accomplish these two basic tasks.  I find myself using the laptop at home and the Kindle less frequently.I expect that when it comes time to replace either the laptop or the tablet, that I will look at a Windows 8 tablet or for a different Android device that overcomes these limitations so that I don't need two computers.I recently purchased a Google Chromecast fob from Amazon and have been able to configure and use it with the Kindle.

That is, until I got my first Kindle fire. I was hooked. (Check out my review). I had no real complaints, but I wanted a bigger screen. Then came Kindle HD, and HD8.9... I had to check it out. I checked the specs and decided that the first one was so well thought out, I'd try it out. Long story short, I was absolutely blown away when I got it. The HD8.9 is much better than I had hoped. The case is slim, really slim. It is balanced in weight, so it cradles in your hand perfectly. Then there is the screen. It's Bright, and very sharp. The color on it is especially warm... and not to be outdone by the sound - If you are into video viewing on your tablet - This is THE best experience out there - PERIOD. The picture is head to head with any Retina display from Apple, but the sound is FAR better. The Dolby speaker setup is absolutely astounding. Particularly when you realize the case of the 8.9 is SO thin. The simple to use \"Masked\" android OS is as simple as ever to use, and because Amazon screens every app to assure it will work on the fire HD, you can be sure it does.The battery life is crazy good, and there are surprise features that are outstanding. For example, The Fire HD has a \"play button\" when you open a book. Pressing the play button starts your Kindle reading the book to you in very clear English. Not and audio book, but every book I have put on it. I really like this... what a cool surprise.Another feature worthy of additional mention is the Wifi reception. The dual band/Antenna setup is very noticeable. A few wireless devices have trouble in certain rooms of my house...but certainly not my Kindle. Reception is strong in every room. This is noteworthy if this is an issue for you. Even my original Kindle fire had reception issues in certain rooms, but not my HD. If you tablet use consists of web browsing, Facebook/Twitter, Email, Movies and books, and general entertainment, you can NOT go wrong with the Kindle Fire HD's. This combined with Amazons rock solid reputation for customer service is reason enough to try it. Its performance and price are reason to keep and appreciate it. If you're on the fence on which tablet to get, I seriously recommend you check it out.You may be as surprised as I was, and if so, you will be quite glad you did.Amazon did it again.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stunning Device - but not as a primary tablet", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R2DYXFKU7PDXUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The bad:  Typing is not highly responsive.  The processor is a dual-core where as other devices built to be primary devices can be had with quad-cores.  If this comes out with a quad-core, I think it could have quite a slice of the market.That's my only complaint.  The device is born of its roots as a e-reader, and that functionality is simply mind-boggling in its simplicity and beauty.So... the good:Unimagineably beautiful display.  So glad I went with the 8.9 vice 7 inch model. I bought the Kindle Fire HD specifically for the hdmi output port. I tried in on a 24\" Viewsonic 1080p HD computer monitor, and content rendered quite nicely.  Especially nice when reading magazines or books.  HD Movies played great on the larger screen (also tried on an Insignia 32\" 720p HDTV) and this makes it quite fun and convenient.  However, the display on the Kindle Fire HD really blew away the images on my larger monitor and TV.Great Navigation.  It was pretty easy to get up and running with the device. But where my ownership gratitude meter really got pegged was when I downloaded the CNET user guide book in the lending library.Special Offers:  I find this tolerable enough to where I don't see the need to spend $15.00 for the no-ad device.  There's an ad on the unlock screen, and then that is it.  I say live with 'em and spend the 15 bucks on books, magazines and other content.Reading:  Unqualified.  Magazines display so nicely, they're almost preferable to me than hard copy (certainly the aspect of all those trees that gave their lives so I can have something interesting to read is a guilt-trip I no longer have suffer with :) )  I also like how you can zoom on the magazine pages and enlarge them to your own reading comfort level.Power:  The device is VERY SLOW to charge if you use any other device than the PowerFast charger.  I didn't order one when I got my Kindle, as I assumed any of my existing mini-usb chargers would work.  They do.  But it takes many hourse (overnite, actually) to charge.  I've since ordered the PowerFast adapter and eagerly await its arrival.Particular Scenario of note:  I was unable to get an appointment for an eye exam I needed to do this past weekend. The rep told me told me the walk-in wait would be 2-3 hours.  So, I rented an HD movie I wanted to see (you can only download videos if you rent them, a reasonable requirement to me) for $3.99.  Most enjoyable wait time I've ever had.I did go for the 32G of storage.  I did so for several reasons not the least of which is storage of my digital photos, etc.  I think it is the smart move.  I don't regret it at all.(Update) - Forgot to mention about the device's weight.  The 8.9-inch device is a bit on the heavy side.  With the Otterbox I purchased to protect it, the combo weighs in at 2 lbs 5 ozs.  It doesn't sound like much but it is a bit too heavy to comfortably hold and read with 1 hand.  However, the otterbox serves a dual purpose:  as a solid protective case as well as the fact it converts into a tray to stand or lean the device in.  This works well, as doing so makes a VERY comfortable to hold in your lap and read/watch your content.  Matter of fact so comfortable, I would hesitate to own it without the Otterbox (some reviews of the otterbox complain it changes the screen dynamics because of their protective screen - I have not found any problem along that lines.  However you can if you wish remove the screen and put a screen protector straight on the device.  I didn't see the need as I didn't experience any viewing degradation).Overall, I am completely enthralled with the unit.  Just to revisit what I was saying about the CNET lender book \"Mastering the Kindle Fire\":  The Device is set up to primarily direct you to Amazon's content store.  You can override that, but it's not easy to find the how-to's.  This book takes you through that so you can load and run non-Amazon approved apps and content safely and without risking damage to your Kindle's OS.  I highly recommend grabbing that book.Also, I have Google Play and found a website with instructions on how to set that up on the Kindle, as you will have to side-load the Google Play App.  I've not done that yet, but once I do I will update my review.I will also update on how it goes installing and using Calibre as I do have a library of e-books I want to side load on the device.Happy reading y'all!", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Greatest Christmas Present", "Author": "Tori K.", "ReviewID": "RDURXRJAVCMYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Amazon Kindle Fire HD is a great Christmas present for ALL ages!

My Kindle Fire HD 8.9 arrived earlier today. I was very anxious to open the package and get my hands on this baby to see how it felt. First thing I noticed is the quality of the build. Excellent all around. I fired it up, using the optional quick charger I bought with it. Had it registered and software updated within 10 minutes or so. The images on the screen are crystal clear with vivid and true color. I played an Eric Clapton YouTube video right out of the box to see how the picture and sound quality were. Very impressive, to say the least. The speed between my WiFi and the Kindle is great. No flutter, no hiccups, just a fast and consistent connection. I surfed the web a little bit and this new Kindle HD moved effortlessly through the pages I browsed.I have many more things I want to try on this new tablet, and I'll get around to it when time allows. That said, my early impressions are WINNER WINNER Chicken Dinner. This thing is top notch. We have a first generation Kindle Fire and use the heck out of it. The new generation is everything I expected and so much more. I also bought several of the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets for family members. I fully expect they will enjoy them a bunch. I have an Apple I-Phone 4S and think it's a very good phone. I tried the I-Pad out, and while it impressed, for me, it was severely over priced given what you get. I'm not bashing the I-Pad at all, so please don't you Apple FanBoys come out and attack me en masse. LOL I know how sensitive Apple users can be. Look, they make very cool stuff, no question. My problem is this. Simply put, it's way over priced. All you have to do is look at their profit margins. For me, the new generation Kindle HD is right in my wheelhouse. It's priced very well for what it delivers. I am a BIG time Amazon junkie too. I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and have never once had a bad customer service experience. Buying the Kindle HD was a natural fit for me. I am looking forward to using it a ton.I'd like to take a second to thank Jeff Bezos and his great team for bringing us an affordable tablet with top notch quality and features too numerous to mention. I love Amazon. I'm a customer for life.More to come, stay tuned.Added this >>>>>>>>Battery life on this 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD is simply outstanding. I seriously can't believe how long the juice lasts.

I also have a Kindle with keypad that I love. This new device is well made and has a beautiful display. The web browser is awesome. I was surprised at how many apps were available for the Kindle Fire. I set it up with my multiple email accounts, calendars, and contacts. This lead to my first real disappointment. It's not possible to sync my Outlook contacts or calendar from work. While I don't need this device for work, it starts getting annoying when I have to put it down and reach for my phone to see all of my calendars and contacts in one place. The next issue I had was the power button. It's hidden so well in the frame of the device that I really have to search and almost need to actually look at it to find it. What's the big deal? Well, I like the iPhone and iPad's obvious wake button because I can get to it right away without searching for it. And, since I thought this new Kindle with its backlit display would be nice for after dark reading in bed without waking my husband, I would appreciate less awkward fumbling in the dark to turn the thing on.That leads to my next complaint- this thing is too big for reading in bed. I can't lie on my side and hold it propped up with one hand comfortably. And, it's a spotlight shining at my husband's side of the bed when I do.Finally, though it has a lot of apps, most aren't free. So, to have apps I use on my iPhone or iPad on the Kindle, I have to pay. That's jarring since I've used many if them for free on the other platforms. And, the app I use most often is Facebook. The Facebook app on iPhone is annoying. But, on the Kindle Fire, it's nearly useless. And, if you think that autocorrect is frustrating on iPhone/iPad - you will be as frustrated by Kindle's auto correct spell checking feature. And, possibly frustrated with what seemed to me a slower keyboard.If I didn't have a familiarity and daily reliance on my synced email, calendars and contacts, or constant need to check FB, I'd be completely satisfied with this Kindle.

This review is meant for late comers like me, people who are tech savvy but choose to wait out for the new tech to mature and then spend 25% of the initial cost.Was hearing a lot about everybody replacing their notebooks/home PC's with tablets and upon seeing Asian tourists takingpictures at Hoover dam with these instead of their cameras, I decided to enter the 2010's.After doing the exhaustive research as you have to do for any buying decision nowadays, I narrowed down my choices to Kindle 8.9HD, Nexus 10.1\" and the iPad 10\", felt like a cheat at BestBuy where I went to check out all my choices without any intention of buying them there.  I decided to go with FireHD as the intended use for me is to watch videos, read emails, view PDF's and light spreadsheet work, the deciding factor was the price, stereo speakers and most importantly the screen resolution.Must point out that the Amazon AppStore does have very limited offerings, I hate that the kindle OS does not let me read my gmail emails on the app I downloaded from the 1market store, the other apps I downloaded from there do work, including the google maps which saved me from returning this tablet.So, in conclusion, here's the gist:1) Great product for Amazon-Heads, people who are married into their system with prime membership and so on2) Great product for limited use like basic email/spreadsheet/doc work, watch video on netflix/prime, view PDFs etc., NOT a great  product if you're designing the next city center or the next new gen car...sorry had to take a dig at the reviewers who make it  sound like these are the reasons they are buying the higher end tablets3) Great product when looked at as an alternative to the more expensive and a bit bigger screen sized tablets, which by the way  are only about an inch bigger, I'd rather save the $2004) Now if you are an advanced user and still reading this review, you know there are ways to root the latest Google OS on this  devise and have it run just as efficiently and smoothly, this bit of info is only meant for tech savvy novices who like me are a bit  lazy but do want the newest OS to run on their investment :)", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "True HD viewing!", "Author": "Kat M.", "ReviewID": "R24XI4BT47ZVMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like the HD clarity.

This one replaces my original Kindle Fire (which my wife now uses, replacing her Nook tablet).  This is a great device -- fast, awesome screen and sound, and full of features.  But it is not perfect -- the negatives would include: (1) no rear-facing camera to take pictures or video of what you are facing, (2) no plug-in charging cord -- costs $20 extra (or $10 if you catch it on sale), (3)charging time is not fast, even with the fast power cord.  I have not had it out in sunlight to see how well the screen works outside.That being said, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  First, this device is inexpensive -- especially now that they have lowered the price.  I will pay this price and take a little smaller screen any day rather than pay for an IPad.  The processor is lightning fast, and streams very well -- I love Amazon prime and have only had one glitch so far -- better than my computer (which has an extremely fast processor).  The screen resolution is awesome and the sound is also great.  I can't wait to use on a long plane flight (to Hawaii in May).  The Internet and download speeds are great, and it is much nicer reading magazines on this bigger screen -- as far as books go, I don't really see it being much better than the 7\" Kindle -- but for people with vision issues the bigger screen would make it easier to read in a larger font.Once again love this item -- some minor issues, but for the price it blows away anything else out there.  I am not necessarily anti-IPad, but not going to pay that price when Amazon gives me this.

B&N; only gave me those features to rave about since the Kindle Fire HD didn't have them.Though the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" doesn't have an expansion SD slot or UV connection (via the device) it does have a built in camera, micro HDMI port, Stereo speakers, ties into Prime and I can watch the movies I've purchased on Google or a couple UV services like VUDU, Flixster and CinemaNow. All those things weren't available on the Nook HD at the time I originally wrote this review.I've read a number of reviews that criticize Amazon for having the Fire HD too proprietary. Obviously they have not even looked at the Nooks which decided to move away from the universal micro USB charger to a proprietary one that doesn't even allow charging when connected to a USB port (only data transfer, with the last OS update it appears to trickle charge now).  For those that think the SD slot or data transfer will allow \"Side Loading\" apps onto the Nook, NOPE, B&N; has blocked that and the only way to even come close to that ability is to become a Software Developer and load the apps as a Developer would... Though even this doesn't allow the apps to be visible until you use button press options to gain access to the apps (with the last OS update developer loaded apps are now visible if they are loaded after the upgrade, those loaded before will remain hidden until they are updated). What a pain, and the UV connection the Nook brags about fails to update as it should causing further headaches.Yes, I'm loving my Fire HD even with a shorter battery life and a missing SD slot. The Amazon AppStore alone makes it a worthy investment, but I added a bluetooth keyboard and now I use it more frequently than I do my Laptop.Since I purchased this through Amazon it came to me ready to go and even gave a discount for the Keyboard and AC adapter I got with it.If you are torn between the Nook or the Kindle, I can tell you that the Kindle sports more features that will be used than those that won't.-- I have to admit that B&N; did a smart move by allowing the Google Play Store to be included in their last OS update.

We haven't owned any of the previous Kindles so I have nothing to compare my experience with, but I love reading a book with the Kindle HD.  It took me forever to struggle with my feelings about e-readers because of my fear of publishing companies losing jobs, etc., compared to my wish to save some trees.  Quite a problem for my deeply held convictions, but I talked myself into it.  I LOVE IT for reading books.  Yes, I will still order books (it's the only way I can justify it in my mind) but when I've finished a book in a series and I don't have the next, or the e-book only novellas or supplements, it's great.  I can read after my husband has gone to sleep without having a light on.  Lamps never seem to put out the correct light for reading or you have to sit where you're not comfortable.  No problem with the Kindle.  You can read anywhere.  My son loves the fact he can read out of print or free books.  I got one for him especially because when he goes to college next year he will have no place to store all the books he reads.  Trust me, you can hardly find his bedroom furniture under all his stacks of books (he has filled up his bookshelves to maximum limit).  So, for college students who read a lot, it's perfect.  My husband does a lot with facebook, surfing the web, and playing solitaire.  He is thrilled he can use his Kindle as opposed to sitting with his laptop on his lap.  They're perfect.  We are all thrilled.  Just make sure you get a book so you know what all the Kindle contains.  There's a lot of stuff you won't even know you have.  It's pretty loaded.

To my surprise, no matter which website I visited, the Kindle seemed to be the perfect tablet considering its price, size, pixel density, picture quality, sound quality and overall design. Not only was this computer the perfect compromise, it seemed to be the perfect tablet computer for her.

I spent a lot of hours researching and playing around in best buy searching for the best tablet for me.My main features that i was seeking in a tablet were a near perfect display,fast enough processor to handle games and multitasking,decent speakers,easy to hold in one hand, and less than $450.My wife and I took advantage of the special that Amazon had on the kinkle one day, $50 off an already cheaply priced tablet was the no brainer decision maker for me,after paying the add removal fee and getting a really amazing case i was still under $300.The highlight so far for my kindle fire tablet experience was the prime instant video streaming via micro hdmi-hdmi. The picture was near blue ray quality after video upscaling through my pioneer reciever.I feel as if though anybody could figure out this device, even my parents.The wifi antenna is better than anything ive ever experienced, it was picking up my neighbors wifi 1/8 mile down the road. And the download speed is among the fastest ive seen.My favorite game plants vs zombies looks great and doesnt drop frames when the battle gets intense.The picture quality is absolutely amazing, the blacks are rich and dark, the white is white not blue like in most samsung screens, and the colors are vibrant and crisp.My only gripe that i have with amazon and the kindle fire as of this time is that i cannot take advantage of the free video streaming because my wife is the primary on the account and i am the guest. I would need to upgrade as a prime member also. So customer service said if i wanted to i could become the primary but there is a possability that one would not get there money back. So i think i am just gonna bite the bullet and upgrade, in augaust when my wifes contract is up i will cancel hers.Update: I am still loving the kindle fire, the battery last me all day long with heavy use and charges 100% in a little over 3 hours with the fast charger.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!", "Author": "A.

It really is just an incredible tablet.The screen and picture quality are really nothing short of stunning.Bright,crisp,rich colors with an amazing resolution.The sound is first rate too.After setting up my wireless router,I was enjoying my Kindle Fire and all of it's wonderful features.Viewing movies is a great experience.Surfing the web is also excellent.Lightening fast browsing.The tablet itself is very thin and has a \"well made\" feel to it.The battery is very long lasting from my experience.I honestly wish that I could have given this product 10 stars.The size is perfect.A 7\" tablet is too small to fully enjoy,while a 10\" tablet is too large for true portability.The 8.9\" is perfection.As for choosing the Kindle Fire over other brands of tablets,to me the choice was easy.An iPad tablet can not match the viewing experience for watching movies.The Kindle Fire leaves the iPad in the dust.Widescreen movies are viewed on the Kindle Fire in true 16:9 ratio,where as they are displayed on the iPad in 4:3 ratio with black bars on the bottom and top greatly diminishing the viewing experience.Not to mention the dual Dolby speakers on the Kindle Fire blows the iPad single speaker away.Simply put,the iPad costs double what the Kindle Fire does and has an inferior 4:3 display for widescreen movies and far inferior sound.The Kindle Fire's \"brightness\" level is beyond belief.It rates \"higher\" on tests than virtually any other tablet on the market.This is a very important quality in a tablet,although seldom gets mentioned in reviews.Amazon has a true winner with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet.I honestly can not understand why some would rate this tablet with a poor review.In my opinion,it has to be one of four things. 1).Their wireless connection is less than stellar (you can't blame the tablet for this).2).They are die hard Apple fans who paid double for their iPads and refuse to admit that a tablet actually exists that is as good (or) better at half the cost.3).They failed to read the product details such as not including the wall charger.4).Some people will simply not be happy with any product.In conclusion,I feel that my purchase was one of the wisest decisions I have ever made.For those looking for an incredible tablet that is about as close to perfection as can be on this earth,look no further than the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".You will love it.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "ScreenDim saved the kindle fire HD", "Author": "Manoranjan", "ReviewID": "R2O2MQKR4K60XK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned the second generation kindle and this is my first kindle fire. I have been using this for close to 3 months now and my review is below:Size (4 stars):* The size is good for me to read books and watch videos.* Since I read more books than watch videos I might have preferred the apples iPad dimensions probably better (little more wider). However it is also much costlier than the fire.Screen (3 stars):* Screen is very good and crisp.* Sometimes I feel I pressed a link but it will actually press the one below - so not very accurate to touch. This is sometimes annoying.* It is really bright to read at night when the lights are turned off - even when the brightness settings is set to the lowest. This was the biggest deal breaker for me. However the screen dim app saved the kindle and I did not send it back. That is the best app for the kindle for my usage.Power button (3 stars):* The power button is placed in the top of the kindle almost very hard to find without looking at it.Software (1 star):* The software is just horrible. They have heavily customized android as many know. It has crashed on me close to 10 times in the last 3 months. The whole device will suddenly become unresponsive and it will automatically restart after 2 to 3 minutes.* I was looking forward to use the silk browser after I saw the amazon demo. It was easily the worst browser so far. It crashes almost all the time. I am now using the dolphin browser which is decent.* Many people complain about the carousel (homepage) but I think I got used to it now.* Accessing amazon's content is awesome - they have done that very well. It is easy to access videos, books, etc. I believe this was the primary purpose for the kindle when amazon built it probably. This is excellent.* Email app - It is not good and I dont use it. The push notifications of gmail did not work for me but I did not care to check it since my phone has a much better app than fighting with this.Apps (3 stars):* Apps are very limited to the kindle as many know. I knew this before I bought it so this is ok.* I installed the 1mobile app and that gave me access to almost all the android apps. Many dont work as expected like chrome browser, firefox, etc. However dolphin browser, dropbox and some other apps works. I had to get the apk file of 1mobile and install it - I think they call this process sideloading.Will I recommend it or buy it again:It will be a NO. The software provided is so limited to use for anything else apart from browsing amazon content that paying $249 (I got this in a deal) seems high. If I had known these issues before I would have probably went for the iPad mini or a prev generation iPad by paying a little extra. If the only reason you buy is to access amazon content (which I think many wont) this will be an excellent choice. If not, it is better to shell out the little extra to get the iOS tables or android tablets.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overcontrolled", "Author": "S.

It works fairly well, and I've never really had any issues with the quality of the picture and sound. The primary weakness of the kindle is it's horrible creator's app store. In their attempt to force you to use their various cloud services, they heavily limit what you can do on the device.To get around that, I rooted the thing in the first week I had it, allowing me to finally use the play store, which voids the warranty, which I could live with. I uninstalled a few system apps, installed at least 30 apps from the play store, and then a few dozen from the internet itself. After that, I loved this thing, it ran perfectly, I had a really nice collection of apps and I could watch videos and TV and read ebooks from anywhere, not just amazon.About 2 or 3 days ago, Amazon SCREWED everyone who had their device rooted and installed an OTA update (Which I thought I had disabled with a play store app, kindlefree). They completely upgraded OS, deleted my root backups, re-installed every system app and un-installed all my system apps like play store and supersu. Now around ~20% of my apps don't work, soon to be more most likely if I don't fix it. Needless to say I was angry and called Amazon, they basically told me it sucks but there's nothing they can do.They pretty much ruined the $300 device for me, and apparently this update patched the method of rooting I had used.So let me summarize-Picture is great-Audio is great-Interface is okay-App selection is awful-Customer support is fairly useless regarding kindles", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as Good as the Fire", "Author": "Disgruntled", "ReviewID": "R24QPQ2USNLPLT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I owned a Kindle Fire for over a year, and I found that one to be great with just a few expected limitations.I just bought the Fire HD 8.9 inch one month ago.

The new display is very bright and clear and the new speakers sound great when watching a video.Overall, this second generation device seems to address all the critisisms I had of my Kindle Fire 7\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers.  The touch screen is much more accurate and responsive than the original one, the updated Silk web browser is faster and displays non-mobile formated pages much better, and the autocorrection when typing works much better than before.

I was toying with the idea of a tablet for awhile and did a lot of side-by-side comparisons by playing with them in stores. I liked the idea of a tablet mainly for media consumption reasons. I like ebooks (I also have an older eReader), I stream lots of movies and content from Netflix/Hulu+ and have an audible membership. Games are funner to play on bigger screens too. For these needs, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is perfect. It has a nice screen resolution, the sound quality is excellent and gets really loud when you need it to. The dual band means that it is kicking my laptop's butt in streaming quality, especially in my bedroom where the wifi in our house drops out a bit. My laptop is usually hiccuping in there, while my kindle runs smoothly. And you know what, the price is right too! I am also an amazon prime member so being able to check out kindle books and have access to other free content is nice. The Prime Video content isn't that different from what Netflix has but it's still a nice bonus. Screen is a perfect size too. It's big enough so that it doesn't have that \"I'm reading on a giant cell phone\" feeling that you get from 7\" tablets. And pretty much the perfect device to sync all of my other amazon content to- for instance, I already used my cloud drive extensively for documents, buy mainly amazon music, and am an audible member. On my iPhone, I can stream my amazon content, but not purchase any additional content, and even if you download it from your cloud drive, on an apple device, you can't access it through anything but the app that downloaded it. I always thought that was lame and was one of the reason I didn't want an iPad.Cons to the device: The camera is a bit lacking (reminds me of the camera on my first cameraphone) but still functional. App library is not nearly as extensive as the android or apple app store. (some work arounds available for android apps though0- think getjar). Lack of expandable media really bugs me. I mean, even apple, who is notorious about locking people out of their devices, offers a camera (SD) card reader as an accessory. I have yet to see that for kindle, which is disappointing because otherwise this would be in my camera bag all the time. I will just have to try to find a solution that works with the micro usb port. So no, this is not an iPad 4, but then again, it costs about $200 less so I think these are fair trades.

When my co-worker purchased his Kindle Fire HD 8.9, we did a basic side by side compare, and the Kindle just blew the IPAD 2 out of the water in picture quality.  We played the same movie side by side, and it was a pronounced difference.The biggest difference to me is the download speed, which a lot of people might dismiss.  I did a unscientific test and downloaded the same episode of big bang theroy on my ipad and then seperatly on my kindle.  Standing in the same spot right beside my router.  The kindle downloaded the episode in just over 5 minutes, then IPAD 2 took 21 minutes.  I was blown away.  While I don't expect these types of results typically, the kindle HD is consistently faster no matter what network I am on.  To me that made the kindle worth the upgrade right there.

This is annoying to say the least. I never realized how much stuff uses flash until I didn't have it. This often results in YouTube videos not functioning. There is allegedly a work-around involving using the Dolphin browser instead of Silk, but I'm not savvy enough to get it to function. If you're a techno-peasant like me, you'll have to learn to live with spotty YouTube application or get someone to configure it for you.Reading books on the Fire is far better than I expected it to be. Which leads me to a related issue. The Amazon prime membership has many great perks, but the \"kindle owners lending library\" is not one of them. Meaning, the selection of free monthly books is horrible. With the exception of the three Hunger Games series books and some classics, it's a bunch of trash no one has ever heard of, much of it bordering on porn. Forget \"borrowing\" a free book that's a best seller, not going to happen. Expect to pay $10-$13 for most anything you'd find at a bookstore.On a brighter note, the Prime live movie streaming is flawless! With the purchase of a $6 micro-usb cable you can connect your Fire HD to your HDTV and watch crystal clear, no stuttering, HD movies. The selection of free stuff is not super current/just released, but still very good.My point is, don't get lost in the advertising hype. No tablet does everything.

I love my Kindle e-reader. I REALLY wanted to LOVE my Kindle Fire 8.9\" (not 4G).Since you should always start with the positives:I'm incredibly impressed with the video and sound on the Kindle Fire!Amazon customer service is very nice!Ok. Now the negatives:The Internet browser is worthless. \"Silk not responding.\" SO excrutiatingly slow! No Flash player. The web pages don't look normal. Half of the options for Yahoo, MSN are cut off. I can't find anything. This is a pretty big deal, since the main purpose of a tablet is its portability for internet browsing. One should be able to pick it up, browse, shop.My first app download wasn't compatible. Another app slowed the whole system to a crawl. Had to delete it everywhere, reset Kindle.Takes forever to charge. Leaving it plugged in all night should be sufficient, wouldn't you think? Nope, that gets you about 35% battery. It also will not charge while it's being used. If it's out of battery (which happens quickly), you can't use it.Typing is INSANE. You would think that a keyboard would type exactly what you type. No. It guesses the word you want and imports it, sometimes twice right in a row! So, you have to back space. (There's no delete key). When you turn OFF all of the keyboard options, you still get two spaces after an apostrophe, random capitalization, and double words. Also, it's so slow you often have to type three letters, wait until they appear, then type three more.The touch screen is off, sometimes I have to press too hard, other times so soft. My son saw my trying to unlock the Kindle (slide to unlock), I was flicking my finger over and over, harder, softer, slightly above, below, longer, shorter. He said, \"Why does it do that? That happened to me too.\" One time I tried over 100 flicks and could not unlock it. Had to put it down and come back later. UGHGHGHGH!!!The screen locks up! I wait. I tap all over, try the home button, it's completely locked. I close the cover and the Kindle Fire is still on with the cover closed. It's completely locked. The only option is to hold the off button for 30 seconds.And the final straw. It now turns off randomly ALL the time. Right in the middle of a game or TV show, or a magazine article. Whether the Kindle is moved or stationary, doesn't matter. The screen just disappears. Even with full battery. Sometimes I can still hear the sound but the screen is gone. Sometimes it completely turns off, no sound no picture. I just sit there starring at a blank screen like, \"Are you kidding me?!\"  I've almost thrown it against the wall several times.I find myself using my laptop more and more and the Kindle Fire less and less and the Fire is only 3 months old. Very sad.Amazon will not lose me as a customer. They have earned my loyalty. I wanted to be able to spend my Tablet dollars with them. But sadly, I will have to go to the competitor to fulfill Tablet \"needs.\" Luckily the competitor does not also sell Organic/Gluten-Free foods, craft and pet supplies, nutritional supplements, and everything else I could possibly need at awesome prices, fast shipping with satisfaction guaranteed.Update: I now have the competitor's newest product and it has none of the problems that the Fire has. However, the Fire has better looking video and better sound. But now I can't get the Fire's battery to charge. I leave it plugged in all night  and all the following day, come home from work - 40 % charged. I watch 15 minutes of Netflix and I get the \"only 15% battery remaining\" warning. Arghghgh!!!

I bought two of these WITH wall chargers through the Amazon \"Deal of the Day\" discount a few days ago.  My wife and I bought the original Kindle Fire last year, decided to upgrade, and give the hand-me-downs to the kids.  For $258 each, INCLUDING CHARGER, it was an easy decision.Maybe it's just me, but it's rare when I can't get something to work correctly.  Right out of the box, both Kindle HDs \"fired\" up, and the set-up was so simple that I think most elementary-age kids could manage it.  All the more widely used apps were downloaded and Amazon purchases sync'd in just a few minutes.  The size is right, the video excellent, and the sound improved.  Although the web browser was working well, on the advice of some experienced users, I turned off the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" in Applications / Silk.I'm a regular Amazon customer, so the \"Special Offer\" advertising on the lock screen falls squarely into the \"no big deal\" category.  Ignore it, or pay $15 more to make it go away.  Just don't complain because you didn't read the product description!A few observations:- Because the screen is bigger than its 7-inch brother, the keyboard is also bigger; this is a really good thing if you have fingers wider than a pencil.- Web browsing and video downloads are fast and crystal clear, but I also have a solid cable internet connection and a good wireless router (plus a downstairs amplifier).  Perhaps the problems that some have with web connections are more their wireless setup than their Kindle device.- Although it charges properly with the Kindle wall charger, it wouldn't with my Samsung Galaxy USB charger.  I'll need to experiment with a few others to see if this problem extends further.- On the original Kindle Fire, the power button had an LED light that indicated a charging / fully charged condition.  The power button on the \"HD\" model is just an on/off type with no LED.I use tablets for reading books, web-browsing on the couch or while away from home, or to watch the occasional video.  Whenever I want to do something substantial with a computer, I sit down at my desk and work with a keyboard and a full-size monitor.  That's why some of the more capable (but also more expensive) tablets were more than what I needed or wanted.  I was leaning towards purchasing the 8.9 inch HD before the discount.  It lines up very well with tablets in the $300-400 dollar range.

This one will be short to start with and I imagine I will add to it later as I tend to analyze things in detail.But, I wanted to cut to the chase - I had no idea what I would think of this device, but it was love at first click.Now, I buy a new computer-type device every two years.  I just got a new ultrabook for work/travel purposes in the summer.I spent six months studying every pad in great detail, talked to friends and family, and finally decided on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".First off, it came sooner than expected.  Yay.  Wanted it the minute I ordered it so the wait was tough, but coming early was a bonus.Secondly, the box, the device, every design and display aspect of the Fire HD is gorgeous: sleek, elegant, sophisticated, vivid.  Love that.There were far more apps and features available than I imagined.  It is like being a kid in a candy store.  And the quality is high.  Could it be higher? Maybe, but I don't drive a Jaguar, I am happy with high, not ultimate quality.Like so many things, if someone knows the difference between one HD TV and another, that is their talent.  Mine is getting a great item for a great price and that is what the Fire HD is on both counts.I ordered the sleek little power charger and it arrived instantly - its just as beautiful as the Fire.  So, good on that.  I am awaiting my 'skin' with excitement, due tomorrow (but who knows, maybe today?). Fun.  I topped it off with clear screen protectors.  I am all set now.The Fire took 10 hours to charge through the computer - expected that.  The power charger should cut that in half.  So, charge at night, right?Lastly, let me fully disclose I am an Amazon fanatic.  The company never fails - customer service is a mouse click or phone call away and they are so competent and attentive, they restore my faith in large companies.  So, it didn't take much to convince me I would be right at home in an Amazon environment.That said, let me also say I have Acers, HPs, a Vaio, Mac's, an iPod - I love those brands too - none of them have ever let me down.And finally, I am pretty picky - with Virgo-like insistence on detail and perfection, so if this Fire continues to please me, believe me, you would have to be overly ocd not to like it too.I will keep this updated - gotta go play with my Kindle.Okay, one week or so later and after reading all the cranky reviews as well as the laudatory ones like mine:Here is the way I see it. The Kindle Fire should have every accessory, come in a sleek box but be perfectly and flawlessly protected, should offer every single luxury that anyone anywhere on the planet could imagine. And should cost almost nothing.When I read posts complaining about delivery issues, packaging, and all the things that the uninformed buyers were unaware of because they failed to do their homework, in short those of all the demanding complainers, I wonder what they can be thinking. This device is so cheap and so elegant and so robust. Be grateful. If you lived twenty years ago, you wouldn't even dream this was possible.I liked the box mine came in. It protected it perfectly. For ten dollars I bought the super charger that charges my Kindle Fire in three hours, well worth it. The device itself is beautiful, works flawlessly and has everything I can imagine wanting, and I am pretty demanding.If it makes me happy, then I know the complainers are asking for the moon.Period.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Even Close to an iPad", "Author": "Shannon Heskett", "ReviewID": "RDEDPST1V7729", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire HD for my 12 year old son as a less expensive alternative to the 2 iPads that we already owned.

While the Kindle fire was great (wth a few annoying issues) but I ended up selling it. mainly because I wanted  something bigger. and whle the kindle fire hd is pretty much the ame equipment as the 8.9 except for the larger screen, there are a few major differences. One is blutooth. I never understood why the orginal kindle fire did not have this feature. I didn't watch movies on my old one bcause I'd have to listen through corded headphones. If you are out and about, say at a train station or airport you want felxibility. This one has that. but you can buy a kickstand case and then listen to movie with a blutooth headset. I really wanted that feature on my old one, but amazon didn't just upgrade this device incrementally, they basically started from the beginning. You get blutooth and a forward facing camera along with book features like xray. The only negative thing is my covers do not show up on the carousel (it's hit or miss for the actual books I have) However they show up in the book section. I used calibre to side load books bought previously or belonged to other readers.I id try out the Nook tablet and I was greatly disappinted (Ihaven't seen or worked with their hd version. That was based on the color/touch screen version. That one didn't hang around long, but about that time i heard of the kindle fire HD coming out. and me being the nerd that I am had to get the one with more storage and blutooth features (I have a $90 set of headphones so combined with the the Kindle fire hd itself, it all works out great. The video quality is great and I was really impressed by the sound out of the speakers The stereo speakers was a great touch.I have never owned any other tablets except for nook and fire, so I can't say much about the ipad though I've played with one before. pretty much I have seen/touched most of the tablets and the fire is not only affordable (well compared to what you are getting) and has everything I need right now.I am really impressed by this reader. So there isn't much need to go for the bigger/more expensive tablets. Besides some actually act more like a laptop so if you want something with a good size screen that's more portable then this is the way to go. While my device has no adds under the carousel if you are to highlight something (let's just say an app)then it shows \"recommended for you\" and while this is a petty gripe I think since i didn't pay for the adds, then I shouldn't be getting those either.But overall it's a great device looks/sounds wonderful.and with the 8.9 screen you get more breathing room and a better showcase for your movies etc. This one does come with a a sync cable which the orginal fire didn't. There is no wall charger by the way. But amazon probably has one for  a good price. Right now I don't need it though.  So that's fine with me at least for now.  It's pretty easy to learn, and also if you buy certain marked cds through amazon marketplace they will rip it to the cloud for you (another great service) And it doesn't count towards your alloted storage limit. so that way if you are connected  t wi-fi you can listen to your online collection which is a definite plus.there isn't much left to say really.

I was going to go with the 7\" but the Wifey said, \"Might as well get the newest one.\"  She's usually right about everything and so I went with her suggestion.  She was right,  Of course.I unboxed this thing and Wallah! I was super psyched.  The thing runs flawlessly.  There were a pretty good amount of apps in the app store and I was even able to dim the brightness and make the book pages sepia, much easier on the eyes for me.Netflix literally zoomed 1080p hd and delivered impressive sound from the side/rear mounted speakers.  Very impressive.  Especially with our internet speed... I can't talk about that it makes me want to cry...I installed all the essential apps that I could find and there is where I hit my first snag.  There were a bunch off android apps that I really like to use that aren't available in the Amazon App Store.  So I looked around and there was a setting to allow 3rd party Apps but it doesn't really give you access to the great android apps or the apps on Google Play.  I don't know why they nerfed the OS like this but most likely it was to make more money. I'm hoping in the future they allow us more freedom to choose the apps we want from where we want them. C'est la vie.My second point of contention is the Mini HDMI port.  I have a couple devices that use the mini to large cables and they are both the same.  The port on the Kindle is tiny and weird and so I will have to fork out about 6 bucks for one which isn't a big deal, I just wish they would have let me know it was going to be proprietary so I could have ordered it at the same time.(It's a micro HDMI type D to HDMI Type A... just to save you the hassle of trying to figure it out.)Finally, the Kindle Quick Charger.  Another way to squeeze a couple bucks out of you.  Luckily I already had a wall socket usb quick charger so it's not a big deal.  However for those who don't happen to have one and opt out on the Kindle Quick Charger there is this caveat!((Dramatic pause of silence))It charges in under fourteen hours from your computers usb port.  Wait did that say 14 hours?  The battery life is 10 hours.  I may not have a doctorate in math but something just doesn't add up there.Still over all I give this 5 stars.  I got exactly what they promised and it was only my expectations that let me down, just a little.I love this Kindle and recommend it to anyone looking for a multi purposed e-reader.

The answer is YES.This is my 2nd kindle. The first was the KindleFire sold in USA November 2011.Both are good tablets. They each come with excellent customer support and a healthy customer knowledge base.Improvements: the AC adapter. The older adapter was beginning to fail on some first gen. KindleFire. Overtime the connection from cord to machine becomes fussy. The metal connector is small prone to dust, temp, etc. If one could not get the connector to properly sit within the KindleFire. The machine would not get charged.Now a two part charger is the norm (sold separately) it is similar to a dual ended wire. The small end goes to the kindle the large end goes to the AC wall plug.Considering the number of first gen KindleFire to lose ground because of traditional AC adapter. This is a welcome Improvement. Good that the AC adapter is sold separately as this keeps other companies competitive as well as keeps cost down of KindleFire.Lastly - do I read more because I have KindleFire?

In my opinion it easily beats out the comparable Nook just for the sheer fact you can hook up your Prime account.  I have watched enough MST3K in the month I have had it to make the purchase alone worth it.I am also sticking with the ads because it reminds me of some of the Kindle daily deals that are available so I don't forget to grab something I want.  If you are worried about the ads getting in the way, don't.  They are only on the lock screen and sometimes in a bottom corner.  This is not like the ads we are used to seeing as banners at the bottom of apps, the Kindle ads are unobtrusive and sometimes informative.Overall I will say if you are debating between this, the Nook HD and the iPad.

Hansen", "ReviewID": "R3Q55SPS9GDB2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this when it was on sale just before Christmas ($249). I wanted something that I could use to take notes in class, and use for textbooks. I also bought the otterbox defender for the Kindle. When the box showed up with both items the Kindle went straight into the Otterbox. Initially I had trouble using a stylus with the Otterbox, but that has resolved itself. There are several note taking apps that downloaded, and I'm still working out which one I like best. But, this is for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 so here goes:The Kindle itself:WOW! The graphics are amazing. I've seen other tablets around campus, and this one is by far the best looking. Not by a little, I mean noticeably better.I bought the non-4G version with special offers. I have access to wireless anywhere on campus, at home etc so I don't need 4G. YMMV. Regarding the special offers: I don't find them annoying or intrusive in any way. Matter of fact, I've found that the more I use it the better Amazon is at predicting what may interest me. I went from just ignoring them on the start screen to actually glancing at them to see if it's something I want.The key is that if I'm not interested it takes less time to just continue on than it does to think about it. So, for me, it's not even worth the $15 extra to do away with the offers.The performance is good. I have had a few times that it's been slow when doing something on the net, but that's a function of the campus network. Whenever I have full wireless service bars it's just plain fast.Movies....What can I say, they work well, and the picture is outstanding and the sound is great.  I haven't used the HDMI out, so I can't comment on that.Books: Nothing short of excellent. Easy to see, easy to customize the view, easy to purchase.Websurfing: Not the best, mostly due to Silk (the native browser). It works, mostly well. The biggest problem I have is with drop-down menus on the web. Silk is not good at that. Oh and it won't do Flash player either. Searching the web there is a way to do it, but not using Silk. When I get around to downloading another browser I'll update this.The biggest negative that I've run into so far is that I have a hard time keeping it. The wife and kids seem to think it's great for playing games. Don't they know this is a serious tool?! Actually, the wife has decided that if I don't give her this one then she's buying one for herself.There are plenty of options now for tablets, and this market section is growing exponentially so by this time next year I expect this will be out of date. Will this/Amazon allow an update to Jelly Bean? I dunno, but from what I've heard it's possible. In the meantime, I'm plumb happy with my Kindle!", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Device", "Author": "Synieth", "ReviewID": "R1ORSLYIMWHEO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this item about a month ago, but I wanted to really use it for a while before reviewing it.First, my reasons for purchasing this: I already had a regular kindle and I used it for reading regularly. I've almost stopped buying paperback books completely. I finally felt it was time to upgrade. There were a few things I specifically wanted in a tablet.  I wanted apps such as netflix, and gmail, facebook, youtube, etc. I wanted to be able to read my kindle books, and watch my prime videos on amazon. Because my tablet is primarily for entertainment purposes getting the kindle was a no-brainer. I did some research on other tablets that had more customization and more options, but finally settled on the kindle because it does everything I want for a much better price.  Knowing that bias, now on to my review:VIDEOS:This device is amazing for videos. Especially ones that run in HD are exceptional. The screen is crystal clear and almost perfect. I say almost because there is so glare especially in bright light. For me, I do most of my movie/tv watching at night or in my dark bedroom with its heavy curtains, so this isn't usually a problem. But once or twice I have tried watching shows in the living room during the day, and if the sun is shining right in the windows, I can see more of my reflected face (especially in dark scenes) then I can of the movie. Again, this is only in almost direct sun. In softer light, or lower light, it isn't an issue, and even when it is you can usually find an angle that works. It is a small annoyance for me, but one that might be a bigger annoyance for someone who does a lot of video watching in bright light.READING:The screen for reading books is very bright, which I like. It can be turned down, or even switched to white on black. I have little problem reading even in bright sun. I am especially in love with how easy it is to highlight and make notes in the text.  I also have a copy of the OED on my kindle, so I can jump right to that from whatever book I am reading if I need a full definition of a word, which is amazing and has helped me out with some of my college classes. I've also tried reading some magazines and comic books which look amazing. DC comics recent reset some of their comics and I started reading the new Batman comics. The pages are pretty clear, and if you need to you can zoom in on panels to marvel at the artwork or read smaller writing. I might, when I can afford to, look into getting a magazine subscription like national geographic or something, just to see what that is like, but the few free ones I've tried look nice.APPS:My primary apps are Gmail, Facebook, Netflix, Skype, and Adobe Reader (for classes). These all work just fine on the kindle. I guess Youtube isn't available but there are ways to get it. I don't use it that often, and don't mind going to the website on the rare occasions I do, which works fine. Skype works pretty well, though it does get a little weird if you happen to adjust the kindle so the screen flips. It's just a small blip. Facebook, Gmail and Netflix all work perfectly, though I greatly prefer amazon videos to netflix, the amazon viewer just seems nicer and the videos look nicer.GAMES:I don't play a lot of games. I play words with friends now and then, but I did try out a couple of the more advanced graphic games such as the Sims game and Dungeon Hunter, both of which run without a problem and look amazing.SOUND:The sound on this thing is amazing. The case does change it a bit, but not drastically. I hardly use headphones with it because I most often use it alone at home. I don't even need it at full volume to hear it perfectly. It sounds as good as any TV.BATTERY:I had to go to the hospital when my sister was having her baby, and I spent all day, almost twelve hours, hanging out in the waiting room with nothing but my kindle. The battery held up well for just reading, but I didn't watch any videos because those do drain the battery quicker and I didn't want to run out. However, I can usually watch 3-4 hours of hd video before I get a notification to plug in my kindle. Which makes sense, things that use more power to run (videos, games) drain the battery faster than just reading.  It holds up well on tuesdays which are the days I spend almost all day on campus using it in class for web-searches or reading pdfs in the adobe app. I've never had it run out of battery when I need it, though I usually have to plug it in each night. It does take a long time to charge, even when plugged into the wall.OTHER THOUGHTS:Being less customizable than even a smart phone is a bit of a draw back. I wouldn't mind being able to set a background picture like I can on my android phone, for example. Or have a screen of apps like you can on most tablets.  While the carousel is convenient for getting to my things, I don't like that if I use something once it automatically goes to my carousel, like every time a view a webpage it is there at the front of my carousel and I have to remove it, because each new thing I try pushes the things I use most often back so I have to scroll over to it. Also, for some reason Facebook is constantly moving down to the end of the carousel even though I use it a lot. It gets shoved behind things I don't even use, which is weird. I'm always having to scroll over to find facebook.I purchased the $45 case that goes with this and don't regret it. I couldn't have lived without it. the kindle on its own without a case I fear too much for it getting broken or scratched. The case is amazing, I can stand it up and watch tv or read while I'm cooking or cleaning. and I feel safe putting it in my bag with my books and notebooks with the hard case. So I recommend it to anyone who gets the kindle, it is a bit expensive but it is a must-have.Also, a side-note about smudges. The screen smudges something awful. I've taken to carrying a cloth with me for cleaning the screen regularly. It is a must. But it really can't be helped.The kindle isn't perfect. But it is perfect for me. It does everything I need it to, and it does it beautifully. I can see it not being for everyone, especially someone who is looking for a tablet that can serve almost as a laptop replacement for the office. But if your primary use for it is watching/reading amazon content, social networking, emailing, and web browsing, than this is a great option at a great price and I would strongly recommend it.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Say hello to my little friend", "Author": "Marc aka Network XXIII", "ReviewID": "R3SO30H6UI4JHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, its not that little since I went with the 8.9 inch instead of the 7 inch.

I have a MacMini at home connected to my TV for movies (Amazon Prime Video mostly), music, Hulu, etc.  My wife also has an Air & an iPhone, my oldest son has an Air & iPhone, and my two youngest have iPad 2's.  We are big users of the iCloud, particularly the calendar - it's the only way we keep things straight.  So, we are ***deep*** into the Apple ecosystem (cult?).  We also use Amazon quite a bit - goods, food, video, music, etc.  We're Amazon Prime members too.  And I use Google services all the time (maps, Drive, Google+, Reader, etc.), both for work and home.So when I started looking at tablets for myself - something I could use while I workout, go on trips with, etc. - all three ecosystems (Apple, Amazon, & Google) were 'on the table'.  I looked at the iPad Mini, the Nexus 7, and the Kindle HD 7.

But my wonderful wife bought me the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for Christmas (on that sale day that it was $249).  I've been playing with it daily for almost a month now, and I have to say I like it a lot.  It's got a great screen, nice sounding speakers, decent battery life, nice industrial design - it's nice to hold (though I do find it difficult to find the on/off button).  I use it in the following manner: - Amazon Video while I spin - Kindle lending library & Overdrive for reading books - Internet news (via Dolphin browser, which I prefer to Silk) - Google reader & Google+ via browser only (those Google Apps aren't available) - Words with friends - email, but just a little bit - at home only, not at workThere are some things it doesn't do well, like calendar (can't access iCloud), and the email program isn't great.  And it's frustrating to me that I can't access Google Play even though it's Android.  (I have used 1mobile.com to sideload some apps, like the Dolphin browser.)

We're a pretty digital group, with many PCs, an assortment of laptops, this Kindle, iMacs, several iPod iterations, a smaller Android tablet and a Transformer, and a very wide, full assortment of smart phones (S3, G2x etc.), so a weakling is quickly routed out and abandoned.  And yes - they are all capable of playing nicely with each other on our network (no easy feat).The Kindle is simply perfect for what it is, and performs at least as well as we had hoped.  The display is rich and compelling and the ergonomics are good.  The Amazon flavored Android is glitch free, and while some settings are veiled, with some time they can be found and optimized.  For Amazon content, it is very nearly perfect; the delivery speed is excellent and the chance of a kid or uninformed adult accidentally screwing things up is minimal.  The Free Time is what sets it apart, and in a VERY good way.  Our teenagers have Android tablets also, but the younger kids would have no idea how to manipulate settings or install anything if it involved anything more than a click, so we got this purposely for a 7 (8 in days) and a 9 y/o to be able to read books, watch appropriate videos, play some learning type games and, in a perfect world, learn something while having fun.  They continually bicker over my wife's iMac and tie up the main TV on Netflix, so we wanted to get them their own devices, namely this and a Win8 laptop.  In retrospect, the jump to W8 at the same time as adopting a distinctly flavored Android variant was a little taxing, but we're working through it.  The trades between the new laptop and the Kindle are carefully negotiated affairs, and the only user complaint is the time it takes to recharge when the battery dies (and it IS used until the battery dies every single time).The one disappointment (beside the missing SD slot we knew about beforehand) is the difficulty of accessing the PlayStore on the Kindle.  It was fairly easy to get the Amazon content onto the Asus tablets, but another thing entirely going the other way.  This brings to light the main difference between the Kindle and any other tablet; while the Android units are more or less designed to be easy to change, root, mod, and restore if it goes south, the Kindle is not.  Being under warranty has prevented  any attempt to root it, and they've done an admirable job of making the garden walls high and sturdy. I'm sure that at some point a non invasive method of getting PlayStore apps to run will be figured out, but for now (given the ages of the main users), Amazon has everything we need on this device, and with Free Time, there is very little chance they'll access inappropriate content or brick the unit itself.  We also have iProducts galore, so the notion of controlled access and throttled content is not new to us, but at the same time, there ARE some things on PlayStore that have no equivalent on Amazon, and it would be nice to be able to access them on the Kindle too.The sound is MUCH better quality than any other tablet (and 99% of the laptops), but due to the sheer number of devices in use at any given time, headphones are the norm here.The bottom line is that the display is absolutely gorgeous, the download speeds are excellent, the content is great (and growing), and the technical skills needed to use it are nil.  For tech averted adults or growing kids, this is the ideal tablet.  It never hangs, crashes or misbehaves like it's speedier, more adaptable but less stable counterparts, and Free Time alone should warrant a very close look if you have younger kids (or a technophobe) in the house.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "20 3/4 stars!", "Author": "Shanks", "ReviewID": "R3KHD2A26BLJX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife...

The weight of this kindle is the same as my older first generation kindle fire, that my 2 year old now inherited.I also purchased a blue tooth keyboard and a stylus for this one so I use it like a netbook. I purchased the ad version that displays an ad everytime you take it out of sleep mode. At any time if you don't want the ads you can sign into your account and pay to have the ads removed. They don't bother me so I left the ad's on. Thank You again Amazon for another amazing kindle. My only hopes for the future of this kindle is that an update for flash will come out and I will be able to once again check my email from the silk browser instead of the dolphin browswer.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brilliant!", "Author": "Big_Mike", "ReviewID": "R3GR3KT9YCY37Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did side-by-side comparisons versus the iPad mini and Nexus 10 before deciding on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Great value for the money!I bought one for myself and one for my 26 year old daughter and we're both very pleased. We decided we didn't need a full featured tablet, since we already have powerful ultra-light notebooks and top-of-the-line smartphones, so this fit nicely into our needs. Great as an eBook reader, with very good media options for listening, watching, and generic internet access (including emails).The initial set-up of the Kindle HD Fire was fast, easy, and intuitive. My daughter & I both downloaded books from Amazon's library and were impressed at the ease & speed. I downloaded a 6 novel set of Tom Clancy books (7-12) in a matter of seconds. We also \"upgraded\" the Kindle to 32GB, paid $15 more for the \"without special offers\" option, and glad we did.The only (minor) complaint I have is the PowerFast charger is extra and not included in box, Fortunately I already knew this, with some advanced research, and we made sure to buy the charger (at a discounted price) with when buying the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Being able to charge the Kindle using a USB port on another pc is ok, but being able to charge it with a standard electrical outlet makes better sense.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Gift", "Author": "Rhino", "ReviewID": "R18T9CRE9XD10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my wife Kindle Fire HD for her BD and after she started using it, I fell in love with hers.

I might have given the tablet 5 stars if it were not for the ads and plugin charger. Note to Amazon: just increase the price up front and take care of these two complaints.My family has five Kindle products (Keyboard, Paperwhite, Fire, Fire HD 7\" and, of course, the Fire HD 8.9\") and we like all five especially the Fire HD's. On the 8.9\" the extra screen size really makes watching movies more enjoyable and reading is better. I was really surprised by how much more I enjoyed reading because of the screen size (not to mention the HD resolution). It is just easier on the eyes. The new screen also has less reflection than the old Fire.The camera addition is a good one. We enjoy using Skype for family contact and find the camera resolution to be very good.The dolby sound on the 8.9\" is great. You can enjoy movies, music or games without earbuds and/or sound boosters. The dynamics are super, too.As this tablet has the best processor of the Kindles it is more responsive even though I find surfing the web to be a bit sluggish at times. Still a nice improvement over lesser Kindle models as one would expect.This is a good size for a tablet for the things noted above, but I find it a bit large and heavy for reading in bed. You will agree if you doze off as I did and have it thunk you in the head. That is where the Paperwhite shines with its reduced weight and size.Overall, my impressions of the Fire HD 8.9\" are very favorable and I recommend it if you are not tied to the Apple world.

I'm not sure if anyone has had that problem, but it's not a big deal pulling the books down from the kindle.I was able to easily side load Maxthon as an alternative web browser to Amazon's silk browser.  I run several other androids app including New 360 and YouTube, and Netflix.  Netflix performs very well which is consistent with what other reviewers have reported.Rather than go with the $499 and ATT plan, it has made more sense to use my smart phone's Hotspot feature so I can browse the web when I don't have WIFI available.My advice to prospective buyers is to define your goals and make sure the kindle features line up with what you are trying to do.  Also, read the description of what you are getting so we don't get any more reviews complaining the charger is not thrown in and you the kindle doesn't support flash.

(But don't all 1st gens do?)I now have the newest kindle; I bought the Cadillac of the series, with all the bells and whistles, and as much storage capacity as it offered.First the Pros:1 The picture is beautiful; crystal clear resolution, and great color.2. The interface is a little different than the first Fire, but it was easy enough to learn.3. The picture size is a LOT better, both for watching movies, and for playing games like \"Bad Piggies\".4. Both the case and the unit are very sturdy- I've dropped it a couple of times, and no harm at all!5. The X-Ray option is great!  I don't have to worry about reaching for my iPhone to use Google to look up the Actor's bio. (Haven't used the text-to-speech yet, so I can't comment on this feature.)6. I like the fact that the display stays on, if you want it while the film plays.  (How long left to go in the film, battery life, 10 sec. \"rewind\" option.) I like to pause films all the time, and the fact it stays on makes it easier to do so.7. Being a Prime member, there's so much free content, it's fantastic!8. I love the fact that the Fire can be put to sleep by just closing the cover- very efficient.Now for the Cons:1. I realize that the speakers can't be large, but your ads are very misleading about their power.  This is one of the main reasons I bought the new Kindle Fire, because the first one was too hard to hear without headphones.  So much for the portable advantage.While the speakers are louder than the first one, they still have a LONG way to go to live up to your hype.  Even some of your own guides you offer say headphones are the best way to listen.2. Who was the design genius who decided to put the charger on the bottom?  When my Fire's getting low on power, I can't use the case to prop it up, because the charger is in the way! I have to lay it flat- once again, not the most watchable experience. The first version had it right- the charger was on the side; no need to change.3. I guess the same design genius decided we don't need a charging light that is visible, either.  I like to know when my machines are charging by having an indicator to look at.  (I can see if it's charging when I wake it up, but I still like an indicator when it's asleep, like the old one.)4. I have yet to successfully establish by connection with AT&T.;  When I put in my password, it tells me I need my last four digits of my SS number.  When I put in my SS number, I cannot add my password, when I do, the SS number disappears.5.There is an option to back up ten seconds in playback.  Couldn't there be an option to skip ahead about the same time period?Well, for what it's worth, that's my review of the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD.  Not perfect by any means, but still one heck of a lot of fun!  Amazon will always be one of my favorite places to shop!EDITED ON 12-14-12I found a good work-around for the problem of the charger being on the bottom.  I bought a cheap stand that is used for holding decorative plates.  The Kindle fits perfectly on the stand, with plenty of room for the charger to be plugged in.I've only used it in the horizontal position, though.  The vertical seems a bit too unstable for my liking.  Now, on to trying to boost the speakers...EDITED ON 4-23-14The only way I've found to improve the speakers was to add external portable speakers.  The ones I've found to be the best are ROKONO.  I'm sure others are as good, but, in my experience, these are very good, with long lasting battery life, and decent sound.  I usually use two, because I use the Kindle mainly in the kitchen, with the washer, dryer, and running water noise to overcome.Another problem- I'm a Prime member, and use the free streaming shows quite a bit.  I often get an \"error code 13\"- can't play the video at this time.  This is SO frustrating.  I know it's not my internet connection, because the same video will play with no problem on my Mac.But all-in-all, it's still not a bad unit.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "best tablet for the price", "Author": "robert orona", "ReviewID": "R3EW1VIZK5KED6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "awesome speed, the graphics are great.

I could not blog for hours on nuances of android operating systems or systemic differences between Nexus 7 vs. Fire HD.  I am the average user that wants a tablet but hates to be tied to Apple and its runaway proprietary chain that comes with all of their products.  I had the original Kindle and the subsequent Fire and I liked both for what they were, simple...more so for Kindle, a little less so for the Fire.  The Fire was buggy.  I have found my Fire HD is also buggy.Problems:Web Browser: I received the notice that my web browser was not responding, this happened 7 times within a few minutes until I was forced to restart my browser.  It was a nuisance out of the gate when I am simply trying to read the news.Google:  It appears the only way I am able to voice/video chat is through Skype, which means I have to subscribe to another service and pay a fee for a number.  I know Skype is great and useable around the globe...so is Google+/video chat.  There is no Amazon App to use Google+/video chat.  Also the web browsing version is scaled down to the point where I cannot actually web chat through the browser.LTE:  My mistake but, I thought part of the increased payment for the HD W/4G LTE was the initial year of 4G service for $50.00; a great deal.  I did not know that I still had to pay the $50 after the fact.  Small sure, but all these small things begin to compound.Not problems:The screen is so much more vivid.  External controls are a major plus.  Sound is fantastic, and battery life is quite good.So if the above problems do not factor against you, I think you will be pretty happy with the Fire HD.  If you are like me and stopped using ITunes, have a Prime account, and order almost everything from Amazon, the HD is a great purchase. Unfortunately Fire HD is less functional than I need it to be.  Otherwise it is a great piece of gear and you should Fire HD!Some updates after further use:Problem:Power and Volume Buttons: Simply put they are too close, I shut off the screen a couple time while trying to adjust the volume.  Perhaps in the next iteration, these buttons are on either side of the tablet.Not Problems:Ads:  I have noticed the ads but not found them to be a major distraction to my use of the Fire HD.  I get the ad at start up and I believe I have seen the ad one other time but it was not a distraction from my overall Fire activities.Silk:  Since the initial bugginess, I have not experienced any further problems...I don't browse a lot with the Fire (thus far).  I am a creature of habit and go to the same sites or apps over and over again.Apps: yes, I do miss some of my Apple Apps, mostly I miss AutoBlog.  I am not a real car guy but that app excited me because it distills the important car info that has come out without having to trek through a dense website.  Other apps, I don't miss and most of the good ones I get: Stumble upon, Flipboard, Shazam, etc...Google integration:  I like the instantaneous integration on my Google calendar, address book, Gmail throughout my Samsung galaxy III Smartphone, Fire HD, and Apple Computer.  I still miss Google+ video chat on the Fire HD, I have to do that on my phone.WiFi Streaming: I watched a full HD movie last night via Prime, I have the lowest data speed via my internet provider...no buffering, no diminished picture; it was a fantastic experience.  The image quality of the screen and the movie was simply amazing.  The volume never distorted through the speakers during loud scenes or heavy bass.  Same goes with streaming music, never a problem, fantastic sound quality.HD Port:  I have yet to try this but, I like the idea that I can plug this into my HD TV and stream Prime, I will let you know how the picture quality translates.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Victoria I.

And now it even underlines your miss spelled words in red so you can correct them!*Amazon Silk browser is faster & more compatible with different websites. On the older model some websites wouldn't cooperate and let me scroll so I would have to use Opera Mini browser to get around that.*Volume controls on the outside now!*Speakers are spaced out better*Finally a webcam & mic to Skype or take pictures and videos.*HDMI connector.CON'S:*No more Adobe Flash. Which means I can't view videos on some websites, because Adobe is no longer making it for Android or mobile devices. Which means on older websites that still use flash instead of HTML5 you cannot view videos. (Original Kindle Fire had flash installed).*Certain games that you may have purchased for the original are not compatible yet with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  (Facebook App is not loading newsfeed correctly on the 8.9, it stops loading after about 12 newsfeed updates).*Silk Browser seems to crash more often if you have 'Accelerate Pages' box checked in browser options. (Maybe an update will address this).*TV & Movies sound amazing with the dolby audio, but I found playing music through the speakers didn't have the same quality. And there's no equalizer in the newer model.*Lot's of Ad's. Supposedly you can pay $15 to disable all the ad's permanently. But, I did find in settings/applications you can turn off some of the recommendations. The only thing you can't disable is the ad's that show up on the screen when it's locked.All in all I'm quite happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9.

I already had a Kindle KB charger and a cell phone charger both of which work fine with my 8.9\" device.  That said, I am really liking this device.  The color is fantastic, sound is great and have learned very quickly how to navigate on it.  The only thing I don't like is the carousel.  I would prefer to have a desktop like on my PC and have apps and websites represented by icons.  Tapping would open an app or connect to a website.  I sent feedback on this to Amazon today.  One minor complaint about a couple of apps I downloaded:  tried to open them multiple times but each time they would quit working.  I paid a small charge for one but the other was free.  Have not watched any videos or movies but probably will over the Thanksgiving weekend.  All in all, Amazon, a great device!  Oh, and one more thing, somebody please, please make the Scrabble app work on the KFHD.It is Dec 7 and I have had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for 3 weeks. I had a few minor problems figuring the device out but managed fine on my own (I am 83) and have everything resolved.  The Battery HD app works well to keep up with battery charging.  I am enjoying game apps and have watched movies (since my earlier review).  My only difficulty is that my hearing is very bad and I have to use earphones to be able to hear dialog in movies. The control buttons are not a problem and I know exactly which port is for the USB charger. I still give it 5 stars.

The device does not come with a plug in to charge via wall outlet.  Instead, it comes with the USB tethering cable and that is it.Edit*Since my original review, I have removed the \"Special Offers\".  It was a bit tedious trying to figure out how to remove them.  In order to remove them, you have to sign in to Amazon and find the link that takes you to the management of your Kindle.  From there, you can rename the device and remove the offers.  Because I had the original Kindle Fire when I activated the new HD, the HD had \"(my name)'s 2nd Kindle\".  I was happy to change it to just \"(my name)'s Kindle\".One con that I have found with the Fire HD is the buttons are a bit tricky to turn the device on and off.  I do like that there is an external volume control, but the button to bring it out of \"sleep\" is so small.  I have seen cases that will automatically put the device to sleep or wake it up when using it, but I chose to go with a more durable case.Also, the Kindle Fire HD had some sort of \"upgrading\".

After I put the device through its paces, I will update.PROS:- Really impressed with the out of the box functionality.  Very little setup required. I'm very tech savvy, but it is really nice when a device comes out of the box, drops a software update and is ready to rock in minutes.  Very slick.- E-Mail, Web, other basics very easy to set up- App store (what it contains) works well and in 10 minutes I had my basics (Weather, Vevo, Netflix, HBO GO, Pandora and Myfitnesspal) downloaded and running- Sound is very nice both via speakers and headphones.  I can really tell the difference in speaker quality between this Kindle and my wife's Ipad 2- File transfer -- particularly music -- is really easy.  All my itunes purchased music (except the odd drm stuff) is dropping right onto the device and playing.- Music plays while reading with no work arounds or issues (maybe I'm dating myself here, but this was a huge issue on many of the devices I've had over the years)- Form factor, weight, etc. works just fine -- two points I have huge hands and I bought a case so your experience may not match, but this easily works for me as a tablet and e-reader on the \"holdability\" side- e-reader works well and screen does not bother me for reading (glare, etc.)WAITING TO SEE- The carousel function of display takes some getting use to -- but it is growing on me as I learn to quickly add and delete.- Screen resolution for videos looks good so far, but for me the proof is in the longer term viewing (i.e. do I give up and just wait to fire up the big screen because it feels fuzzy / low resolution).  This more of a feel factor for me -- so it will take some viewing hours to determine.- Reading on the screen.  I'm not giving up my old kindle yet for reading books -- I'll have to see if the screen works long term- Video files -- I've attempted no file transfers yetCONS- Limited android application download.  I've had this less than 6 hours and it already bugs me that I can't download apps from Google Play and/or that many applications are unavailable. If you are an android application freak and/or can't live without X -- check before you buy and think carefully.- Charging.  When plugged into my computer there is nothing but a trickle charge -- you really do need the amazon charger which, given they don't include in the package, is a negative.- No desktop management software.  I intend to use this device as one of my primary multi-media consumption platforms, it would be nice to have some (even stripped down) desktop software to manage books, music, videos etc. I'm fine with opening the device directory and dropping in, but some automation and management would have been really nice.I will update after I play with the device, use around town, and try and use bluetooth keyboards etc., but so far this device is a very solid hand-held multi-media tablet.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "worst tablet", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R2GLMWG699XXCF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first review I have ever writen. being a long time amazon costumer and Kindle user I thought I'dd give the Fire a try.

If So, You May Also Ejoy Using Kindle Fire", "Author": "HJW \"o8Heather8o\"", "ReviewID": "R2HA2KXSD40Z5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By this point in time, all that should be said about the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD has already been said by other reviewers, so I will comment on some of the unique aspects of my experience with it.First & foremost, if you're undecided about getting one, I would say, ask yourself this... \"How much do you enjoy hanging out at Amazon's website?  How often do you visit their site, & what do you like to do when you're here?  Do you prefer visiting a different bookstore's site?\"  I would recommend the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD to you if your answer runs along the lines of, \"I log into Amazon almost every single day, usually at least several times a week...& I get lost online here...I lose hours just immersed in all of the different 'cool stuff' there is to see & read about here.  A huge percentage of the things I can't buy locally, I buy from Amazon...& I admit that I dig hanging out on their website, just checking things out & maybe commenting on them.\"I say this not because we're all going to shop ourselves into sweet oblivion on this tablet (although at times we may), but because if you like visiting Amazon.com & spending time in Amazon's unique \"ecosystem\" in general, & if you like what it \"feels like\" to be here - you will probably also enjoy the new Kindle Fire HD.  If you like the feel of hanging out in an ever-changing atmosphere & look forward to seeing what's new at this particular \"virtual bookstore\" - it's likely you may also like spending time on its tablet too.  It's easy to either like or dislike both Amazon & this tablet for the same reasons.  Because I very much like Amazon's site, I immediately liked this tablet - because it offers that familiar feeling of \"cruising Amazon,\" & being able to take the entire contents of your digital account there with you, wherever you go.  My one wish that would make it perfect...is if it served fresh cappuccino lattes from a virtual espresso bar.  :) Ah well, I can dream.All of which leads to Amazon's excellent continuing tech support.  With many tablets, & the manufacturer will help you to set it up, & iron out any initial technical issues, then after that - you're on your own.  Which is Ok.  But if you have an issue with an item on your Kindle Fire HD, Amazon's Kindle Customer Service Dept. is just a phone call away, 24/7.  This has been quite handy, & they've stood behind their product with me so far.  As an example, for some reason I could not access over half of my music downloads, & they helped me to retrieve all of my purchases, so I can hear them as I read.  Help with malfunctioning apps ordered from Amazon is also a huge plus.  So far I am impressed, & I hope this does not change.I read some dour complaints about this Kindle Fire's limitations as a tablet, & really expected nothing more than a glorified eReader & a portable iHeart Radio & Netflix machine, & that was Ok with me.  I am graduating from the \"Kindle 3G With Keys,\" & I chose it.  But what really surprised me, was how much I can actually DO on it...besides access all my books.  There's basic internet & email access, which is a must, & I also insisted on smooth, high-def video Netflix access.  But if you're a casual gamer & an e-gadget lover, there are SO many nifty & often free apps available to you, that you may forget to even open your books...  I have a nice collection really great books, but in the 5 weeks that I've owned this Kindle, I have actually have spent more time goofing off with my apps (like issuing howls of laughter at smashing things in \"Let's Break Stuff!\" Premium)...than I actually have reading.  And new & interesting apps are arriving each & every day.  In fact, Amazon offers Kindle Fire owners a \"Free App Of The Day\" daily for your consideration & enjoyment.  Some of the stuff you'll see featured there is creative & amazing...& some not.  But it's always fun to look forward to seeing what's next tomorrow.  If these ideas appeals to you (& you don't really just wish you could buy an iPad, but are settling for a Kindle)...you may really enjoy the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.Also, I am impressed with the screen sensitivity.  I have tried tablets that I really had to *press* on hard, to get to respond.  In my experience, I find that the better the quality is of the tablet stylus I use, the better & faster the screen responds to it.  And the more cheaply made the stylus is, the more poorly it performs.  For me, using a different stylus (even though they may look almost identical) results in differing performance that is almost like using 2 different tablets.  When selecting a stylus, go with \"what feels right in your hand\".  Stylus reviews are hit & miss, & only you will know what's right for you.  It's cheap of them but probably just as well that Amazon does not include a stylus with this tablet, because half the people would probably hate it...although it would be nice for emergencies when your stylus of choice has wandered elsewhere.Those are the pros, now for the cons...I actually give this tablet 4 1/2 Stars primarily because it needs to use a little faster processing speed than what it comes with, for what it's trying to do.  It's good enough for most average functions, but if you're used to technology that really flies, you may feel a slight sense of lag with the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.Also, the price gouging on the 32GB version of this tablet & the deliberate lack of an SD card port, is a major issue.  You can always keep most of your less frequently used books, music, & apps in your \"Amazon Cloud\"...but it's amazing how eerily fast the memory in that 16GB (part of which is taken up by the O/S) starts to fill up.  I never thought I'd use so much internal memory so fast, but after a few weeks, the increased memory usage is sneaking up on me like an evening shadow.  If you generally use up a lot of external memory in other areas of your life (eg. PC, phone, cameras, etc.)...you may want to bite the bullet & get the 32GB version of this tablet, just for the greater elbow room.  I wish I had, but I was too stubborn to pay for it.  That said, I actually would have paid the 32GB price if what it offered instead was an external SD memory card port capable of accessing cards up to 64GB.  That price I could live with.Furthermore, I give it 4 1/2 Stars due to its average battery life.  Like my cordless phone, my Kindle Fire HD always seems to be on the charger.  I would like a tablet that can do this much to hold a charge 30-50% longer than mine does.  Also, it came with a USB cable, but when I plug it into the PC to access it, it actually loses charge, instead of gaining it.  That's unfortunate, because after I use & unplug it at my PC, I still have to charge it from my wall outlet.  IMO...that's just wrong.  And the PC USB charging that occurs during \"sleep mode\" has been barely noticeable.Also, if you decide to purchase this tablet, I highly recommend also getting a supportive, well-constructed cover.  You will not \"love\" all of the covers out there (believe me...) but using this tablet \"bare\" feels very risky for a device of this value, & I highly recommend protecting your new investment with a Kindle cover that you can at least \"like\".  For this purpose, I prefer the over-priced bonded (Ok, barely) leather cover that Amazon makes Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Royal Purple - even though the color actually arrived a murky \"burgundy\"...because I have tried equally expensive covers much worse.  Amazon's cover focuses on durability, surrounding & cradling their new Kindle HD with rubber bumpers on all 4 sides, to see it more safely see the bumps & clunks of life on the move.  Short of a \"Nerf Cover,\" this magnetized cover will offer protection for your Kindle if you hope to toss it into your purse or tote bag, to take with you on the go.  It's also good if you tend to absent-mindledly bump things around while your mind races onto its next great idea, Kindle in hand.  For me, the sleep/wake cover feature really was its best selling point.  No matter what you do though, make sure you find this device a good cover that you can live with.  Because even though it's not flimsy, life will happen to it.Overall...  I give the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet 4 1/2 Stars, because if Amazon were a real brick & mortar book store...I would probably live there...sipping lattes & eating scones in a wireless hot spot.  And because during my free time, this Kindle Fire has practically been my right hand since it arrived, & it's been hard to put down.  Also, the round the clock tech support has been great.  But I believe somewhat higher specs should have been offered for this device to match its capabilities, & at reasonable prices.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than the original", "Author": "Noname", "ReviewID": "RRVE50PDAHK7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the original Kindle Fire.  When my husband asked me what I want for Christmas, I told him a Fire HD 8.9\".  I got to play with my present early, and it is so worth it.SETUPSetup was a cinch.  It came registered to my account.  I just had to turn it on.  There was a short tour on screen, but I barely looked at it.  I can't even tell you what it said.  If you've had a Fire, this is just as easy.  Your favorites are at the bottom of the screen when you press the star.  Swipe from the top down to get at the settings.  Swipe back up to bring back your screen.BETTER THAN THE ORIGINALThe main reason I wanted the Fire HD is the larger screen.  I read a lot, and the larger screen size is so much kinder on the eyes.  Videos and photos are also much more vivid, and they stream smoothly.The new Fire HD has Bluetooth technology.  Finally, I can pair it with my Bluetooth keyboard and my Bluetooth speakers.  They make the tablet experience so much richer.Also included is a camera on the screen side facing the user.  I downloaded the free Photo Editor app to take advantage of it.  Too bad the camera isn't on the other side.  I'd find that more useful, but a front facing camera is better than no camera.Other advantages are external volume control buttons and a power button located on the *top* of the Fire.  No more accidentally turning the screen off.WiFi is very good.  While the WiFi signal on my old Fire keeps cutting out, the one on my Fire HD is constant and strong.SOME DRAWBACKSI don't care for the placement of the micro USB port along the longer side.  My cases and sleeves open at the top, so I can't charge the Fire HD while it's in the case because of the location of the power port.Also, although most of my apps that I use on my old Fire could be downloaded on the Fire HD, a few of them are not compatible.Flash is not supported.  This has not been a problem for me, but it may concern others.  I've run into a few instances where video wouldn't play, but I can live with that.  There are workarounds, but it's more work than I care for.Lastly, bigger means it won't fit in my purse.  We can't have it all.WITH SPECIAL OFFERSI got the Fire HD with special offers.  It gives me a beautiful ad at the startup screen.  No big deal.  I was hoping for coupons, but I'll take the ads.  So far, they have all been pleasing to the eye.CONCLUSIONI'm so happy I got a Fire HD.  It really is an upgrade from the original.

For this reason I am sticking with Amazon.This is a wonderful device for folks that love to consume media, and want a portable and easy to use product.  We have both a 7 and 8.9 HD versions now.  The extra screen size does mean a little more in size and weight but may be easier to read and view movies, etc.  I find that by double clicking the 7 inch I can easily increase  my text so this is not really an issue.I described my experience with the first 7 inch HD that I had to return and am monitoring the new one to see if the same problem develops.  However, I do not consider this issue to be a deal breaker.  Basically I have multiple email accounts and when I would check them from time to time, inevitably at least 1 would give me a connection error.

Time to compare and contrast. My Kindle is a reading device first and foremost for me. My husband's relationship with his iPad is much more \"intimate.\" He does more with his iPad than I do with my Kindle and is his constant companion when he is on the road.  I watch the occasional movie or other video content on my Kindle via Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant video, check e-mail, and of course visit Facebook. Sadly Facebook does not look as good on the Kindle as it does on the iPad.  I know that's an app issue, but if you're a Facebook addict, that might be a factor for you to consider when deciding on what sort of tablet device to buy.  The \"Silk\" browser is a bit clunky compared to Chrome or Safari, but it's okay for the occasional search, but for \"deep searches\" I put down my Kindle and fire up my MacBook Pro and do serious work there.The Kindle HD is perfect for reading, video viewing, and light web browsing and of course......shopping on Amazon!Well, I finally got a tablet device.  Being a long time Apple computer owner currently with my fourth Mac, and owner of an iPhone, one would think I'd automatically go for an iPad.  Nope.  I decided to patiently wait for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" to come out. I pre-ordered mine in September and it arrived a week before Thanksgiving.....sooner than expected!I bought the Kindle because I like the Amazon \"ecosystem\" better than the iTunes \"ecosystem\" for purchasing and renting various media.  What music I have lives on my iPhone and it is music I've burned from CDs I already own. So music portability and storage is not that big a deal for me.  What is important is access to books, magazines, video, and movies and TV.  I like how Amazon presents its content better than the way iTunes does.Technically the Kindle Fire HD pulls in the wifi signal from the other side of our 1800 square foot house better than my iPhone and Macbook Pro do.  Perhaps its the dual antennae in the Kindle. I'm no tech geek, so I'm just guessing there.  The HD picture quality is spectacular.  I rented and viewed Tim Burton-Johnny Depp's \"Dark Shadows\" on my Kindle.  The clarity of the image and the colors popped right out as I watched from the cozy comfort of  my bed! I used basic headphones for listening and the audio was also very good.  I've also got a Pandora radio station streaming some of my favorite \"progressive\" rock music from the seventies and eighties. I've also downloaded a couple of free, public domain books to my Kindle and also purchased a Kindle edition of an interesting murder mystery novel.  It does not replace my Macbook Pro, but will be a wonderful traveling companion for portable communications when I don't want to dig out my regular computer.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Happy With the Kindle Fire 8.9\"!", "Author": "christine", "ReviewID": "RUHHLL73Q5O1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leaps and bounds over the earlier Kindle Fire.The perfect size screen, smooth performance and comfortable to hold.It's so good I sold my iPad....The new Kindle Fire 8.9 does everything I need.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfaction", "Author": "thekfchero", "ReviewID": "RUZPLX3K32CVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm typing this from my new kindle and I've got to say, I'm thoroughly impressed. This feels like a premium tablet. The screen is vivid and crisp, on par with the iPad. The sound is out of this world. It's actually hard to describe how good the sound is. It's super loud and it really mimics surround sound beautifully. I would also say this tablet is super comfy to hold, even with one hand. It's not too heavy but also carries enough weight so that it doesn't feel like a toy.Of course, there are some caveats. The browser is *slightly* slower than the iPad's but its still a massive improvement over the original Kindle Fire. There is no Flash but no mobile device currently under production runs Flash anymore. Personally, the lock screen ads don't bother me but the \"customers also bought\" on the home screen does piss me off. Fortunately, you can turn this off in the settings. Finally, the app selection leaves something to be desired, but for the most part, there is usually an \"app for that\".Overall, this is an amazing tablet for the price it and goes toe to toe with the iPad 4. If you are willing to forego apps selection for the ultimate tablet media experience, I would totally recommend this tablet over the iPad, the iPad mini, and the Nexus 10.EDITAfter tinkering around with it, I managed to install Chrome onto the device.

Phillips \"tx.parrothead\"", "ReviewID": "R3EZ9MGH16LLNG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Six hours after I received my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 it was packed up and ready to return to Amazon.  Read on and I'll tell you why.  I bought this tablet because my 2+ year old Pantech Element suddenly died one day a few weeks ago.  It simply would not power up.  I tried for a week, doing everything I knew and could find out to get it to work, but I concluded after a week it was a lost cause - I'll tell you more about this in a moment.  So I went tablet shopping.  I had a list or requirements:1)  NOT AN IPAD - I will not be a slave of Apple and iTunes.  Before you label me an Apple basher, let me point out we have a Macbook Pro, an iPad Mini and iPhone 4 in our household.  I am not a fanatic, I just feel Android offers much more potential than Apple does.2)  4G capable.3)  External SD card support.4)  An 8\"-9\" screen  -  7\" is too small and the 10+\" are too big.I am a technically able person and this list of requirements didn't seem like it would be too hard to fill.  It turns out it is.  There is virtually nothing out there that will meet every one of those requirements.  Interestingly my beloved Pantech Element does, but it has been discontinued.  After a few days of searching I decided I was going to have to compromise on one or more of my requirements.  I settled on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 even though it did not support an external SD card.  I figured the 32G of internal memory would make up for it.  Maybe that would have worked out, I don't know.  There were other issues, one in particular, that would ultimately make that question moot.  Right out of the box, after an hour to update the software, I decided I did not care for the interface.  I realize this is a personal preference, others may love it.  I didn't. Being accustomed to the \"normal\" ICS interface, I found the \"carousel\" too busy/pushy/inflexible for me.  Couldn't change it either, can't even change the wallpaper.  Also the font seemed tiny, fine print on a medicine bottle tiny.  I thought, no problem, I'll go to settings and change it.  Guess what - you can't.  An hour of research on the internet indicated that this can't be changed and seems to be a common complaint.  Amazon customer support confirmed this can't be changed.  After two hours of playing with the tablet, my eyes literally ached.  At that point I decided this had to go back.  I can't enjoy this tablet and this was a deal breaker for me.  But there are some good points about this tablet.  I give my opinion of the good and bad below.  These are only my views and may differ from yours.  I offer them only as points for consideration:Pros:32G internal memory (almost makes up for the lack of SD card support).Nice screen size, 8.9\".The $50, 12 month, 250M data plan is a great value.Cons:Not the most comfortable tablet to hold in one hand, at least for me.  I am used to holding my 8\" Pantech with one hand while reading.  This tablet is more difficult to hold in one hand.  Why don't tablet makers make the back of their tablets with either a textured finish or some kind of non-slip material?No SD card support.  Why is this?  Should be a must for all tablets.Android version locked up tighter than Fort Knox.  I won't say I tried and can't say I didn't, but even rooting this is nearly impossible at this time.  It seems Amazon has gone to great lengths to stop this useful and sometimes necessary practice.Tied to the Amazon Kindle HD app store.  This is a sore spot for me because I don't want to be tied to their app store any more than I want to be held hostage by Apple and iTunes.  See requirement number 1 above.  BTW, Kindle HD app store is sorely lacking in some of the apps I use regularly.  For example, Tom-Tom is not there, Cool Reader (the BEST free e-reading app, bar none, IMO) is not available and many others I use all the time.  And you can't download them as a regular app either, Amazon won't let you, see lock-down comment above.Limited ability to configure the system .  My Pantech was running ICS, 4.0.4, which allowed quite a bit of user control.  Whatever version of Android this device is running (I couldn't tell) will not allow you access to some of the most basic settings.  I could not even change the system font size in the display menu, it's not there.  This leads me to my biggest complaint of all -System font is so small it hurt these middle-age eyes after a couple of hours trying to deal with it and cannot be increased.  This was the deal breaker for me. Yes, within some apps the font size can be changed, but these are generally limited to e-reading apps.  You can't change the font in file manager app, for example.  This applies to most other apps.In conclusion, although there are a number of good things about this tablet, the negatives far outweighed the positives for me.  I also do not believe this good choice for anyone with any kind of vision difficulties.  The text in many, if not most, apps can be difficult to read.  Finally, two days after I ordered the Kindle, my Pantech suddenly came back to life.  It has been working fine ever since.  I still don't know what happened, but I continue my quest for its eventual replacement.  Even at over two years old, consider it a better choice for me than the Kindle Fire HD.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "KNOW WHAT YOU WANT", "Author": "Edward G. Taylor \"Nahum 1:7\"", "ReviewID": "R2EH4GJTBUFP13", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" when Amazon had a $50.00 off one-day sale before Christmas.  It has proven well worth the money.  Being money conscious, but somewhat techie oriented, I wanted the quality hardware (high ppi, gorilla glass, fast) and up-to-date OS that this provided without an Apple price tag.The HD 8.9 has proven itself an excellent value.  My needs were pretty basic:  reading-including digital magazine(s),  web surfing, a few specific apps, possibly note taking, games, Amazon Prime Instant Movies.THE GOOD-- I have already read a library book on my HD.  I enjoyed the experience very much.  I ride public transportation (commuter train and bus) to & from work.  The HD has been very nice in all lighting conditions experienced so far.  Time will tell how it does in bright summer sunshine.-- I subscribed to Motorcyclist magazine and it is awesome.  Easy to read...pinch & zoom works great.  Easy to navigate.-- Surfing the web is easy.  I prefer my laptop, but I occasionally use the HD for convenience sake.  I wouldn't want to count on it as my primary web access tool.  I have not yet tried alternate browsers.-- The specific apps I have tried have been excellent quality.  I already knew what I wanted was available for the fire.  I had to sideload some of them, but without rooting the device.  I recommend researching your desired apps before buying to be sure they will work ok on the HD.-- Note taking is dependent on the app.  I find the on-board keyboard too small for my large hands.  I have yet to try out my flex keyboard, but am hoping that will work well. This is my lowest priority use for the HD, so not too important.  I will mention the app itself is excellent.  There are several available.-- The games I have tried are a lot of fun.  I am totally undemanding in this regard, so caveat emptor, however I have enjoyed free versions/clones of Bejeweled, Solitaire, Sudoku and Bubble Shoot.  All have played well and looked great.-- Viewing movies from Amazon Prime has been a treat.  The sound on my Bose headphones is excellent, the screen resolution/contrast/colors terrific.  I have a 15mbit/sec wifi (DSL) at home which is shared by the tablet, 3 computers (rarely running at the same time), and 3 roku boxes.  I've yet to experience buffering during a Prime movie.  I have once during a Netflix movie, but my internet provider has had problems now and then and I suspect them, not the HD or Netflix as the source of the problem.THE BAD-- I paid the extra $15 to avoid the advertisements.  When in Landscape mode, on the home screen, I don't get them.  If I turn to Portrait mode (some apps work in Portrait mode only), I get them anyway.  I'm rather disappointed about this, even though they are NOT all that annoying.  It's just that I feel I should have gotten what I paid for.  Be aware that a lot of free apps come with advertising as well.-- It is annoying that it does not work while charging.  I often lay in bed and surf or play or read on my 15.6\" laptop, with it plugged in.  I cannot do the same with the MUCH lighter Fire HD 8.9\".RECOMMENDATIONS:-- Got money?  Buy Apple.  But I have to say this Amazon Fire HD 8.9\" is an excellent choice for me.-- I did not buy the fast power adapter, but I am going to get one.  It is slow charging on a plug in USB phone charger or on my $10 Big Lots universal Home/Car USB charger.-- I don't get it.  People argue over hundreds of thousands of iApps, at least a hundred thousand Android Apps, and 10's of thousands of Amazon Apps.  Except for the specific apps I needed, and verified in advance would sideload to the Fire, I have found more than enough variety of apps for common uses.  I downloaded \"250+ Best Kindle Fire & Fire HD APPS For the New Kindle Fire Owner\" by Tom and Jenna Edwards.  Their advise and research proved valuable in finding good Apps early on.-- KNOW THYSELF.  Don't buy a tablet until you know why you want it, how you expect to use it, and what is REALLY important to you.  I read a hundred reviews of the 8.9\" before making the leap.  It was clear to me that the majority of nay sayers either thought the tablet would be a lightweight PC (capability wise), or were disappointed that yet another relatively inexpensive tablet failed to do everything the Apple product could exactly as well, and with as many software choices.  Give Amazon a break...they don't claim to be an iPad.  If that's what you want...work, save, beg, etc. until you can buy what you want.  But if you want do do basic things, this tablet has the capability, and is an excellent value for most people.One more thing.  When you go to Disneyland/Disneyworld, are you disappointed when you go into the Main Street stores and find a lot of MIckey Mouse ears, stuffed dolls, spoons, cups and other Disney fare?  NO...in fact, you buy some of it.  For crying out loud, don't get mad at Amazon, a for-profit business, for making it easy for you to buy STUFF from them on your Fire!  CONTROL YOURSELF.

Using Amazon prime to shop and watch videos is totally a pleasant experience. Using the micro hdmi cable plugged in your TV is an amazing feature to watch videos. Performance is OK, not the fastest tablet but for reading a book, watch movies and shop Amazon goods you don't really need a huge power house, and it is not expensive compared to other tablets. It has a vivid screen with excellent resolution ideal for reading books and magazines and watch photos and movies in full HD. I like the speakers a lot, they aren't very loud but sound quality is way superior to other tablets I have. So far this device has become my primary tablet, I use it every day to read the news, emails, books and browse the web instead of using my smartphone.The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because unfortunately the tablet is still plagued with bugs and crashes easily with the Silk browser. So far the bugs that I have caught are the following:+ The Silk browser delivers a very bad user experience. It crashes very often even if you just leave the tablet idle while reading a webpage, you will be asked many times to reload your tabs. In some cases, the whole tablet is unresponsive while using Silk, and it reboots after 2 or 3 minutes of being frozen. If you try to open more than two websites with the tabs, Silk slows down significantly and begins to shutdown your previously opened webpages (when you return to them it reloads everything again so you lose track of what where you doing) this is really bad if i.e. you are filling a form or making a payment (you need to enter all the information again), I would expect this behavior to happen when you open around 5 or 6 websites to prevent running out of memory perhaps, but not 3 tabs. You can side load Dolphin browser to mitigate these issues, however there is no excuse of why Silk performs so poorly.+ The keyboard input has a considerable lag, you can't write too fast since it will begin to miss key inputs, this forces you to write slowly (lag is less/more depending on the application you are using). Also something quite annoying I found is if I press the space key in the left/right edges while in landscape (just below, the 'x' and the 'b' keys respectively) it doesn't register any input even if you get the sound feedback you did press the key, to make it work you need to press around the center of the key.+ If I transfer 1080p videos from my smartphone they don't play properly. However 720p videos work fine.+ Sometimes the calendar app is shown as a gray empty rectangle in the carrousel instead of showing the correct date.+ It happened to me that while using the Shop application and the Silk browser sometimes I see black rectangles randomly in the screen (seems like a rendering issue from the graphics processor), most of the time going to the homescreen and returning to the app fixes the issue. In the case of Silk, reloading the webpage makes the trick.In summary, the tablet excels at watching movies, reading magazines, reading books, playing games and shopping amazon goods. Up to date it performs poorly as a web browser so if this is your priority task you may need to look for another tablet or wait until this is fixed by Amazon (I would rate 5 stars if the previous bugs where not present).Note: All the issues above have been reported already to Amazon, hopefully they create an update to fix them.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Nat", "ReviewID": "R2EPYHSU6PH8LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought this would be daunting, book to read, all kinds of technical stuff, nothing.....you just need to sit with it, play with it and in a couple of hours you're moving around like a pro...very simple for someone who is technically challanged like me.

After 3 calls to Amazon Customer service I had come to the conclusion that if this was working as intended, I was going to re-package both units and send them back to Amazon for a full refund. If I couldn't charge the tablets with the supplied USB cables, there was no point in keeping them.As was always the case with Amazon, they were willing to supply us with the adapters that plugged into the walls at no cost to us. I am no expert but I have come to the conclusion the USB power stream is not enough to push power into the Kindle Fire 8.9\" battery.  You may convince me of that if it were not for the fact that I had two brand new units, both with the same charging problems. This may be something Amazon will wish to address in the near future.As long as the outlet adaptor and cable they are sending me work in charging this device, I will gladly recommend it's purchase to anyone. I will give and update to this in the near future.***Update*** Change from 4 stars to 5 due to Amazon's Customer service and how great they were in resolving my issue.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am in love!", "Author": "Jill Genn", "ReviewID": "RZ3F5ITYNKPTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my new kindle on Friday (earlier than expected) and it has exceeded my expectations.

Of course, this is just my opinion, and it really depends on what you use it for, but I will point out a few of the contrasts between the two in my opinion.  First, obviously since the 8.9 has a bigger screen, I found it more difficult to use for games, because the screen is larger and to swipe or slide your finger around the screen requires you to cover more real estate, so to speak, and therefore it's a bit more tedious.  I also found it to be less responsive than the 7\" version.  I found myself having to tap or slide sometimes more than once on the 8.9, which never happens on the 7.I understand the the screen resolution is higher on the 8.9, but quite honestly, I really can't tell the difference, even when watching high def movies or videos.  If there is a difference, to me it's not really noticeable.  One other downside is it really takes a long time to charge.  of course a bigger screen requires a bigger battery which explains the extended charge time, but for me, I am always on the go, so I don't always have 8 to 12 hours to wait for it to charge.  Also, the 7 fits in my pocket and I mostly can't even tell it's there most of the time.  The 8.9 is of course bigger and more cumbersome.So, my bottom line is that if you watch a lot of videos and a larger screen is a must, then go with the 8.9.  Otherwise, I prefer the 7 for everything else, including the price.  So for me, that's what I do with them.  Watch videos on the 8.9, and use the 7 on the go and for everything else.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor battery performance", "Author": "Kflan61", "ReviewID": "R1S0NJU5SZDW7R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Battery life was very poor.

I used the 7\u201d just for reading and will do pretty much the same with the 8.9\u201d. The 8.9\u201d is much faster with a higher resolution screen, and in landscape orientation it allows for 2-column reading vs. a single column for the 7\u201d. Text rendering of the 8.9\u201d is very sharp. (For both tablets, I use white text on a black background to extend battery life.)2. Unlike the 7\u201d, the speed and screen size (almost 75% bigger viewing area) of the 8.9\u201d make web surfing a realistic possibility.3. While much bigger, the 8.9\u201d seems no harder to handle or use for reading than the 7\u201d, and it gives an overall higher sense of quality and good design.4. I never used the speakers on the 7\u201d; sound quality from the 8.9\u201d seems good enough.5. Advertising on the lock screen does not bother me\u2014I never look at it. But the 8.9\u201d seems to have many more hooks into the Amazon selling ecosystem. You may want to be more careful when you are clicking away that you don\u2019t accidentally buy something.6. I bought a protective case with the Fire HD 8.9\u201d but bought the wrong one; guess I assumed that the HD 8.9\u201d and the HDX 8.9\u201d are the same size. They are not; the HDX is apparently slightly smaller overall in both width and height. So for $9.99 I bought another case (CaseCrown Bold Trifold Case) that fits and well works in every way.7.

Beer.\"", "ReviewID": "RY0OKKORA6NRX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this as a holiday gift. The cool factor of having (another) tablet did not last more than a day for a few reasons. I love Android OS.The most frustrating feature of the Kindle is the on board web browser Silk. It is clumsy and does not offer advanced privacy options. This is my paramount desire. Alternating between the Amazon accelerated/encrypted browsing off and on, several of the websites I visit most are slow. I am looking at a very popular sport team's fan site, which was claimed to have been optimized for most modern browsers. The text forums take over a minute to load and scrolling is disjointed and clunky. Every time I exit silk, I must remember to delete all temporary files, settings, and passwords as I do not trust storing them, or the cookies and silk contains no setting to automatically browse \"in private\" (even though even with Firefox that is a misnomer, and other precautions should be taken).The Amazon app store is equally clumsy. Try searching for a specific item. I was looking for Final Fantasy games, and results ended up with items that obviously were not what I was searching for. There aren't enough controls or oversight on the content available, and it is hard to determine if the software (app) you are considering is what you actually desire. As much as I hate Apple, I do also have an IPad and, as much as I loathe DRM, Apple's presentation is much more polished. Both could stand slight updates in allowing additional advanced search options in regards to their respective digital store fronts. If I can't tell if the results from my search are a word document, a picture, a video, or a game then there is a very big problem.This introduces a criticism where these two issues merge: The app store does not currently offer any other reputable web browser options. Silk is terrrrrible, and Mozilla products are tagged as not currently available. After some quick internet searching, I figured out how to get on the beta releases for one of the more popular browser options that gives the end user more control. I have yet to be able to devote the time necessary to make it fully compatible with my needs; flash is not readily available and my web browsing is limited as a result. I still have to use Silk if I want to watch YouTube.What I actually want in a tablet is something that gives me control over my product, without challenging me to change it without voiding the warranty. I want to be able to change the wallpaper. I do not want to see an advertisement every time I pick it up; in all likelihood, I am probably not going to buy the junk you are trying to sell to me. I can't stand the carousel. Every time I finish with something I remove it from the home screen. If someone truly enjoys that type of file management assistance, they should go with an MS product. The constant monitoring Amazon does on the device limits the performance of the hardware, and robs resources that would otherwise enhance performance. Pass on this. I think the only way I will get what I want is if I build it myself, or root something with the hardware I need.Edit: I forgot to mention charging, which took 10 hours to go from 3% to 100%.

I am a prime member and it is pretty sweet for my needs. 95% entertainment and just a smidge of other stuff.  So far all the games and apps I want I have been able to get and all of them were free.  I use Flixter for my UV copies of movies I own so I can watch them while offline if I download them. Granted they are standard def, but they still help to pass the time when I am not on a wireless or want to play a game.  I have streamed The Avengers from Prime and it looked fantastic, not buffering no \"in/out\" of HD.  The dual antenna did it's job. The screen is fantastic compared to my wife's Kindle Fire 7\" 1st Gen.  The speakers sound really good too. So for movies it is a fantastic device.  Silk is ok but I just go to google, using Silk and surf using Google and it works great.  It is a little heavy but, that honestly does not bother me, I kinda like the weight as it seems, in my head at least, like the lighter devices feel \"cheaper\" even though reality , tells me they are not.Now I agree a charger should have been included but it wasn't. So instead of paying the $20 for the \"official\" Kindle wall charger I did more digging and found a great one with fantastic reviews that is super fast. The RAVPower\u00ae RP-UC05 Dual USB Travel Wall Charger, it does the trick and has some built-in device protection, and is half the cost.  When I charge the Kindle I turn off the wireless so it charges faster, and it fully charges in @1 hr. (The lowest I have gotten the battery life before charging it is 15%).  For me the battery life is fine.  I think it is like my Galaxy media player where if I turn off the wireless, the battery lasts a lot longer.  So far I have done so and the Kindle last a lot longer.  So if you are not using the wireless, turn it off, because it will continually scan for networks and will make the Kindle work harder and thus drain the battery quicker.  Also dial back the brightness, mine is at about 75% and still plenty bright.  But both these suggestions should be common knowledge these days as far as prolonging charges.The part that confuses me, is a lot of the reviews.  It is as if the majority of negative reviewers did not spend one second reading other reviews or the product description and just made a blind buy.  First thing I noticed while reading other reviews esp the very first \"Most Helpful Review\" (Which is great) and the comments for that specific review, is that is said it does not come with a wall charger.  So I knew what to expect.  But for the people who were suprised about this...do you not read reviews????  If you also would have looked at \"what is included in the box\" you will not see a charger, again, do you research people.  There were reviews complaining about being surprised about lack of Flash Player...again, READ REVIEWS.  There are reviews that will state that it is not supported (not a kindle issue, it is Adobe that has made that decision).  So how can you be surprised?  There were some that gave it 1 star because the screen cracked when they dropped it.  Umm, how is that the devices fault that you cannot hang onto it?  Just dumb.  I don't get why for an expensive purchase like this, people seem to not do any research and then give negative reviews because they are \"unaware\" or \"surprised\" about a certain aspect of the device.  Or blame the device for not having something that is just not possible either due to the ecosystem or the particular programs' origin.  Duh, DO YOUR RESEARCH TO MAKE AN EDUCATED AND FAIR JUDGEMENT AND DECISION.Again, this is my first tablet.  AFTER DOING A BUNCH OF RESEARCH, I feel this matches my needs.  I could not justify spending almost twice as much for an Apple product.  I am glad I went with the bigger 8.9\" HD vs the equally priced 7\" HDX.  The faster processor interested me with the HDX but the bigger screen made more sense for what I wanted.  For reference, the 8.9\" screen itself is as big as the entire 7\" device.  My best suggestion, is go to Best Buy if you can, and give them a test drive.  Just cuz this is the \"older\" OS and \"slower\" processor does NOT necessarily make this the \"red headed step child\" of tablets.  Let's face it just 365 days ago this was THE Kindle to get.  I am glad I got the device I did, but it is ALL personal taste.  Do your research to find what will fit YOUR needs the best as every device will have its positives and it's drawbacks.

Download from the Amazon Appstore Es File Explorer (3). Go to the web and search - download dolphin browser. (4). Then using dolphin browser search - download Adobe flash player 11. (5). If needed go to Es File Explorer, go to downloads and install from there. That's it. Now you should have flash player. However, to use the flash player you need to use the dolphin browser because it will not work on the Kindle fire's Silk browser. The Silk browser has an experimental video streamer but it does not work on all videos.Without flash the Kindle Fire is still a great tablet, so, either way enjoy.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Silk  Browser is Terrible!!", "Author": "Mary Mathews", "ReviewID": "R3JPXPDBAVDO8F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Silk  Browser is terrible!!

I call this review before and after because over time some of the features I loved have changed.Initially when I got the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" I was in love, the screen was beautiful, sound quality was amazing and it was so user intuitive. I'm a major media consumer so there was no other device for me. Movies looked gorgeous, books were crisp to read and songs sounded like I was in a concert hall. I could fill a medium sized conference room with my music. It also was light enough and the screen was large enough for me to study for hours on it. With a few simple apps I could review lecture notes and practice past paper questions. As another Christmas approaches I can't help but think back to where my device is coming from and compare that to where it is now.Now I still love my kindle, no other device allows me to share books and media with my family the way kindle does. They were all purchased by the same person so we can see what each person has read and share media on cloud. I just wish that the quality of the device had remained the same. My audio is inconsistent, the volume can audibly be heard to change in intensity without me adjusting the volume. In fact the device sounds muted overall compared to what it was initially. Every now and then the volume will chip in and sound as loud and clear as it once was but that happens infrequently. Another problem is that occasionally images remain on the screen even after I've switched to another page. This is particularly distressing because I end up with one image overlapping the other. I also can't predict when it is going to happen so for weeks I may enjoy good visual and then a couple days of overlapping images.I still rate this device as 4/5 because it has truly lived up to my expectations of it but the quality deteriorated. In fact as I typed this a spot on the screen that corresponded with the 'I' on the keypad became unresponsive for a few minutes. Go figure. If I wasnt such a lover of books I would probably rate this device lower...I honestly just wish my device would go back to working the way it used to and I don't have the money in my budget right now to get the HDX.

Super price, I found mine on sale at a brick and mortar store. This has the options you need in a tablet today. It's funny with cars, people choose what they buy for a price, not every product needs every option and this has all you want. To get this beauty with an easy to use operating system and beast of tech hardware for such a low price is Genius.Key Elements I reviewed compared to other tablets:  Amazon's modified Android works elegantly. The experience feels a bit magical as you glide through flowing crisp carousels of your web sites, app's, books and movies important to you. Whatever Amazon did, it makes Android better than buying true Android, no worries. Compare to true Android and you will likely run to the Kindle Fire. Buy or try a Nexus product (for a full day to really see) as that's the closest thing to true Android. Ok, so programmer or 'hackers' as they call themselves love stock Android but it's less intuitive, harder to get things done for the rest of us. Even HTC and Samsung give you modified Android to make it a bit easier. Kindle like Apple IOS attempts to simplify how you find and work with your content and the device itself. So they bring tasks or actions to you to get done, less time figuring out how.  User be warned, that does not mean there's no learning curve, there is!  Like all tech, you need to still learn briefly how to find your way around but it's less than typical Android that's for sure and I suspect in some ways easier than apple simply because it's meant to be used to enjoy your content.  Size and weight of a new tablet are fine. This was my big hang up holding me back from picking any new tablet in general... I am glad I went bigger this time. My previous tablet (HTC Flyer) was a 7 inch and I found it more than acceptable for one 2 1/2 years old and still a joy to use when rarely I want something small. The extra 2 inches of this larger Fire screen keeps me engaged longer when I read or surf the web. The weight by the way is no problem either as it's no heavier than an Apple of similar size and since the tablet is larger, your handling of the extra ounces is distributed naturally in your hand, lap or chest so I find it just fine.  Back Facing Camera, you have a smart phone! For many of us we don't care if it does not have a back facing camera. Hauling around a tablet for filming movies or pictures? Been there-did that. I do it with a smaller smart phone these days.  You pay for options. Do you need options you wont use?  Lack of choice in using other's app store and web browser? Come on, this is Amazon... I was using their app store as much as Google play before this so it's not a big deal only using the largest online retailer in the world's app store.  the Kindle fire browser is very sweet - I would ignore tech site reviews complaining about not having a choice (because they want Firefox or something) this Silk browser I now use is as nice as any and better than most and I wont waste your time comparing.  Final thought, Jeff Bezos. Why don't we speak more of Jeff Bezos? He deserves more noteworthy credit as a master contributor to the cause of American ingenuity.

It's smooth, it's durable, and the HD is great. I can play videos no problem, the sound is AMAZING, and I'm able to do almost everything I want with it.Some of the things that the Kindle are unable to do is the availability of the apps. There are many apps that are available on other tablets but cannot be accessed by the Kindle, which makes it sort of behind in the tablet world. Another is the lack of a good camera. The front-facing camera is nice, but I think a rear-facing camera would also be extremely useful and make the tablet much more appealing. The app built into the Kindle itself to take pictures is also VERY basic, showing only the digital viewing screen and the button to take the picture: no settings, no zoom, nothing. If you want to do anything more than simply take pictures with the camera, you have to download a camera app, which most cost money.The web browser built in to the Kindle is also nice, but I'm disappointed in the lack of other browsers available to download, such as Chrome. However, Silk is a fast, easy to maneuver browser, and it's suitable enough for the browsing that I do on the tablet.The things that I do like are the sound, which far exceeded my expectations of what I thought it would be. It's crisp, clear, and even with a cover on it it still feels like a small surround sound system. I also like the many features that come with the Kindle such as the cloud storage, the easy access to amazon itself, and having everything all on one screen, unlike the iPad and other tablets. The e-reader aspect of it is also very nice, I love how it records my reading speed and tells me how much longer I have in the current chapter or in the book itself. The options for the page viewing is also nice and I would definitely keep using my Kindle even if it was able to do just this.In all, I am very pleased with the Kindle and what it has done for me in the two months that I have had it so far, but it could come much farther as a tablet. It's great if you aren't tech savvy whatsoever, have a family to share it with, or if you simply don't want much out of the tablet, but if you are wanting something that is very close to a laptop computer, I would suggest getting something that is capable of doing much, much more.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "I take it everywhere, I love reading on it...", "Author": "twins mom110", "ReviewID": "ROM8LV3JXQTV7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my kindle fire, the apps are great, I just wish it was a little lighter, I had the original kindle fire and i smashed the screen and got this one as the replacement.. it obviously has a lot more to offer than the first one i had but its a little bigger and weighs more, I like that i can watch movies on it , read my books, i take it camping, or if i go out of town, to long appointments..

I did a lot of research before making this decision.First, I ruled out Apple because I don't like Apple so my research did not include them other than a comparison of the Kindle Fire to the iPad 7.My only previous experience with a tablet has been my HP Touchpad, which I got in the fire sale. I loaded Android ICS on it and for the most part it worked fine.  My wife had one as well but both started getting buggy and I wanted a `real' device.After doing a lot of reading on forums and tech sites about `the best Android tablet' I narrowed the choice to two: the Kindle 8.9 and the Asus TF300. Both fell into my price range and got good reviews.What the TF300 had going for it was being a 10\" tablet running Android. What it had going against it was a proprietary charging system (not mini usb) and some reports of bugginess. The charging thing ultimately killed it in my mind. I have tons of mini usb chargers in my house so I can plug in practically anywhere. And when I travel, I only need one charger for my tablet and phone.So I took a leap of faith and went with the Kindle 8.9. My impressions over the last couple of weeks:The screen is smaller than a 10\" tablet, but it plays Netflix and Hulu at the size as my Touchpad does because there is less letter-boxing top/bottom, so that isn't a problem. It did take me a week or so to get used to a smaller screen when visiting websites though.The first day I had my Kindle, Silk (Kindle's web browser) crashed every.single.time I tried to use it. I rebooted and I've only had one crash in the last two weeks. My wife also has a Kindle 8.9 and has never reported a Silk crash happening to her. Others have noted this problem so hopefully a patch will coming along at some point.Amazon did their own thing and layered over Android. The App store isn't as large as Android and many of the apps I had free on Android cost on Kindle because the vendor only offers the pay version. Not a deal breaker given the general cost of apps and you can side load apps if you really want to. \"I Love My Kindle (fire)\" is a good blog about the fun things that can be done with a Kindle Fire.It is smaller and lighter than my Touchpad. The screen is amazing and it has good sound overall. It's a very responsive device; opening apps quickly. I've had no problems with any apps.Battery life is amazing. I find myself forgetting when I charged it last, even after streaming movies.You have to buy an outlet charger separate. It's $19.99 but sometimes you can get it for $9.99. I assume not including one was a way to keep costs down but seems silly.I bought one without ads. My wife has the ads and doesn't mind them but it kind of annoyed me. Costs $15 so it may or may not be worth it to you.Since we have a Prime account, the integration with Amazon is really nice. I can easily access all my books and videos from the top menu bar. No more logging into Amazon to get to my videos and I don't have to open the kindle app to get to my books. These are all a swipe away.The Kindle has its own desktop, using a carousel and bookshelf. The thing I don't like about this is everything gets ordered by last use, making locating things a bit of a challenge because they are never in the same place. But there is a \"favorites\" where you can put stuff so this isn't a big deal.  And if you really hate it, you can side load a program that gives you the Android option of multiple screens.

Got it on sale (same price it's selling for now apparently) plus used some Amazon points so it wasn't that much more than the 7.  Bigger screen than the 7\" tablets or the mini makes web use and movie watching a lot nicer.

I figured I should post a review on it, so here it is. I'll break it down by sections, as the Amazon page has the different features broken down:Display:They weren't kidding, this screen has to be seen to be believed. I haven't compared it to the latest gen iPad, but it's really gorgeous. I've played back Wreck It Ralph in full HD on it and wow, it just pops. Singularly the best screen I've seen, and I've seen many. :)Regarding reduced screen glare, I guess I can see where other displays could have caused glare where this one didn't, but it's such a non-issue in day-to-day use that I just really can't comment much on it. I would have to do further specific testing to see if this is the case with a similar screen to see if there is indeed a difference.Sound:Although it's not \"booming sound\", it certainly beats the pants off of any other tablet I've used in terms of loudness and quality. I have an iPad 2 and a Nook Tablet, and both frustrated me with how low their sound output was. Not a problem with the Fire HD. I personally haven't really heard any virtual surround sound effects as yet (Waiting to get the money to buy something that'll actually use it, like say the Band of Brothers series in full HD), so that's also a non-issue for me now. Will update when I get a chance to test that specific function.Dual-Band Wifi:I have a MIMO router, and I've attempted to use it to transfer large files over (In my test case scenario, downloading the full HD version of Wreck It Ralph to my Fire HD). It's seamless, but I wouldn't say it's 43% faster than the new iPad or 65% faster than the Nexus 7. I don't have a specific rating, but to me it just felt about 20% faster than using straight up 802.11g. Still, it's a nice bonus.Processor Speed:No complaints with the OMAP4470, it does just about everything I've thrown at it with aplomb. The SGX544 graphics core was able to handle the most graphically intensive game I could get (A Bard's Tale) with zero problems. The only thing that was perplexing was that I was unable to get MKV files converted to MP4 format to play, but I'm rather suspecting that it's a converter issue, so I'm not holding that against the Fire HD. I'll try again later with other MP4 files that I know are good and report back.Storage:I got the 16GB version, of which 12.8 is user available. If you can swing it, I highly suggest the 32GB version. When I downloaded an HD movie (About 8GB), along with two other SD TV episodes (40 mins each) and a few hundred MP3's, I was getting some serious space issues. I really, really, REALLY wished the Fire HD had a microSD slot, and I'm going to knock a star off for just that. It's really annoying having to constantly shuffle content around just because of space issues. I'm actually considering gifting this one to my wife and moving to the 32GB version just because of that, but that extra expense wouldn't have been needed if they just put in a microSD card slot. :(Amazon Prime:Pretty freaking awesome. However, that's not germane (much) to the review of the device itself (Barring the ability to borrow books from the Amazon Lending Library and Prime Instant Video), so suffice to say that you should consider getting Prime if you buy a Fire HD.Apps:Getting better day by day, and the Free App of the Day is actually pretty neat, but still lags behind what's in the Google Play market. However, they got most of the popular apps available, so that's a plus. Still as yet have to see any real Fire exclusive apps, but I'm not holding my breath on that as yet. Quick note (And again, not related specifically to the device), the Facebook app (As of 3/19/13) still is pretty buggy. Just a head's up.Content Availability:This is Amazon we're talking about. They have quite a bit of content available, and growing day by day. So you're covered on that front. :)Book Reading:My first and foremost use of my Fire HD is an eReader. In actuality I almost got the Paperwhite because that's what I really wanted. However, since I had lost my Nook Tablet I was without a media consumption device (My Vita doesn't count), I decided that the Fire HD would do it for me. Reading on an LCD screen doesn't bother me (Although I know for some they get eye fatigue), so I figured it would be okay for that purpose. Indeed, it is. Although this might sound like a minor thing, but I really like the default background color they use when you're reading a book. It makes the letters stand out like a real book would, and reduces eye strain. However, if that's not your cup of tea you can change it. The fonts and sizes of said fonts are also changable if you so wish to do so (I found the defaults to work fine). All the usual e-reader things are available (Thesaurus if you double-tap a word, highlighting passages of interesting, sharing passages on your social networks, etc..), and it takes DRM-free e-books just fine (I had purchased a Tom Clancy novel from another vendor, an e-pub file, and it worked fine once I copied it over to the Fire HD). In addition, to those folks who need bigger print to read, I can see this device be very handy for them.The only downside to this device as an e-ready is very simple... Weight.While laying down in bed and holding it with one hand aloft reading it will tire out your hand/arm quickly enough. While not a MAJOR problem, you need to be aware of it. If you want something light enough for that to not be an issue, I would suggest looking hard at the Paperwhite. In fact, I'm STILL considering a Paperwhite for just this reason, as I tend to read a LOT in bed.Side note: I attempted to test out the Text to Speech option. It's okay in a pinch, but the synthetic voice would drive me a bit insane after a while. :) THAT being said, I have NOT tried the \"Professional Reading\" option that you have on certain books. I'm sure that would make a BIG difference! I'll report back when I test that out. Note: This option is a bit of an extra charge.Magazine Reading:I decided to put this in it's own category because I thought that it was important enough of a distinction from book reading. On the whole magazines look very crisp and sharp (Actually, comparing my in-print copy of Maxim to the digital version I think the digital version is sharper on the HD!), and for some magazines (For example, the latest issue of the SI Swimsuit Edition) they add tons of additional content that you can't get with print, such as video clip add-ons and the like (The coolest was a live Twitter feed of the SI models, creative!). You can zoom in to see details or just go page by page, as you prefer. Very nicely done!Music/MP3's:I've been transitioning away from iTunes for some time now, so I've got a decent selection from Amazon's MP3 store. It was seamless to transfer the songs over, using the same app that's on my phone. So no worries there.Audiobooks:I was unaware that Amazon had purchased Audible, and I had several audiobooks with them already. Transferring them over was cake, and worked just fine. Good stuff there.X-Ray:A cool feature, but not one that I've used at all. I just haven't really seen a need to. Still, it's cool.Skype:Works like a champ, but then again I'm not expecting anything different.Kindle Free Time:Although I have kids, they have their own (low cost) tablets, so there is no need for them to share mine. Thus it wasn't tested. However, I can see that this would be great for families that are sharing the Fire.Browser:Drives me a bit batty, but that's just me. I eventually am going to try and side load Chrome on this, but the default browser drives me a bit nuts. That being said, at least YouTube works in it (Especially critical because there is no native YouTube app!). Generally I try to avoid the browser whenever I can. Again, for most folks I guess it would be fine, but I'm a bit of a browser snob. ;)Photos:I LOVED the fact that it would automatically download all of my Facebook pictures into my Fire. Other than that, it's a standard photo app, nothing to write home about. =)Shopping:Obviously the Fire HD is a great window into all the wares that Amazon has to offer. It's way, way, way too easy to do so. =DWell, that's about it. I hope that I was some help to some that are thinking about the device. I'm giving it a four out of five stars, with losing a star because of the lack of expandable storage and because of the weight (.90 of a star for the former, .10 for the latter, if you want to know my breakdown). So yes, a SOLID device. :)", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "SO FAR, GREAT!", "Author": "DAG", "ReviewID": "R2L3ND8T00GDEV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet after purchasing and iPAD mini for my son for Christmas, the iPAD work flawlessly as much as I was able to determine for the short time I was able to use it.

The picture is extremely good, especially on the two HD movies I bought to test - \"The Town\" and \"The 'A' Team.\" If, when contemplating your purchase, you are contemplating skipping out on the HD videos because the quality won't be a big difference (I do that with DVDs compared to Blu-Ray because my eye can't necessarily tell the difference even on a 47\" screen), you should reconsider. On the SD videos I bought or already had - \"Toy Story 3\" and the 2 seasons of \"Dark Blue,\" the quality of the video was not nearly as good. So, if you are planning on sticking with HD videos, this device will be a good buy for you. With HD source videos, the picture is nice and clear. You do get some glare, but it's about the same as with other devices. The HDMI out works fine, I bought an HDMI A-to-D cable and hooked it up to my TV, no big deal.Now... The sound. Devices claiming to have superior sound are a dime a dozen. This one gets the prize, though - it has the best sound by far of any other tablet, phone, or laptop I have owned (note, I have never owned an iDevice of any sort so I can't speak to that). The \"Dolby Surround\" is truly great, especially at higher volumes and while watching things such as action movie trailers that are packed with explosions and deep bass. Sound is also decent through bluetooth - I have a Bluetooth speaker and a pair of headphones, and they both perform about as well with the Fire as with as with my other devices.I hate to say it, but the hype about the wi-fi on this device is mostly that, hype - at least for those of us with regular-speed Internet (DSL/cable) and N-routers. I haven't tried it with a dual band router and FiOS or something equivalent, maybe it would outperform its competition on something like that, I don't know.The Facebook app for the Kindle is terrible - this is not Amazon's fault, but Facebook's - I feel this is worth noting, since a lot of people would want to use it. The last I checked, Facebook is claiming that they are working on a fix, but I won't hold my breath. Also worth noting that the Fire HD is not flash compatible, meaning that you will not be able to watch a lot of online videos out of the box - again, not Amazon's fault, but Adobe's, as far as I know, Adobe is not providing support for Flash on any new mobile devices.Again, I have not compared this device against an iPad 3 - but at this price point, if you just want a device to browse the Net and watch some videos, this is a great choice.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9", "Author": "Gail Joramo", "ReviewID": "R1NR7BUXKTGSC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to make you aware that I had my son and many of my friends help me research which type of e-reader I should buy and I was torn between the IPad and the Kindle Fire so when the 8.9 made its way onto the scene and I saw the reviews...I was sold.

I'm a big Amazon fan, but I like having access to the greater number of apps available to the Nexus. But what tilted me in the Kindle's favor was getting 2 Amazon gift cards for $100 each, for early Christmas presents. I'd only have to shell out $169. The Google Nexus 10 with 32 GB was $499 and I wasn't willing to go that high, so I bought the 8.9 with 32 GB. I researched both units thoroughly and knew that I better order a charger to save $10 and I picked up the CaseCrown Ridge Standby case for about $15 with shipping CaseCrown Ridge Standby Case (Blue) for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Inch (Built-in magnet for sleep / wake feature)  along with a 3-pack of cheap screen protectors. So many people complain that the Kindle arrives sans charger. Does anybody read product descriptions?Since I had read so many reviews about the new Kindles not having Adobe Flash, I immediately remedied that by finding it online, along with a suitable version of the Dolphin Browser, which negated the Silk Browser's shortcomings. I'm not much of a game player so those apps were unimportant to me. What I do miss in the apps realm, is the Time-Warner TV app, which can turn a tablet into a little wireless flat-screen to watch your cable TV.  I found an older version and installed it, but it wanted to upgrade to the latest version to work, and took me to the Google store, so I struck out on that. I suspect that down the road, the Time Warner TV app will be added to the Amazon App store, as well as a few others, that people deem critical to their enjoyment. Patience is a virtue in this area!This Kindle has an excellent screen and the Dolby Sound is an added bonus! I've watched Netflix material in bed with the Kindle tilted on its case and I swear that the audio creates a virtual 3-dimensional field ...it's great! Netflix material looks better on the Kindle than my 55\" TV!  The CaseCrown cover has a built-in magnet that turns the unit on and off, so you don't have to find the On-Off button, a great convenience! The Kindle 8.9 also a great e-reader, and with having a Touch and original Kindle Fire, there's always reading material close by.  I'm enjoying it more and more, as time goes by.As much as I like Apple stuff, I would not buy an iPad due to the inability to easily replace the battery. Apple's iPad and iPod Touch battery replacement would challenge the skills of a brain surgeon. No! Wait... brain surgery is easier! I've checked out the teardown videos of all my Kindles ...and battery replacement, when the time comes, will be done by me!!!!!P.S. I got my Kindle 8.9 32GB for $319. I ordered it on a Thursday and by late Sunday night it was on sale ...for $50 off. Hey, fifty bucks is fifty bucks! I called CS and they said I had to order another one and send the first one back.

The new Kindle Fire competes with many of the new tablet devices on the market today.  I had my parents purchase the Fire for me, and then they shipped to me.  I live in Shanghai.  The package was held by customs, and I was required to pay an import tax of 10%  of the total value (30USD=195RMB).  It was worth it.PROS:The numerous forums and discussion post that can be found about the Kindle make using it a breeze.  AS others have stated, using the kindle as is does have its limitations (movies must be converted to MP4 in order to be played on the Kindle My Video Player) but a minor problem quickly solved with the download of a free third party app, EZ File Explorer.  With this you can add multiple third party apps that run on the Android iOS.Excellent video quality.  When buying a video through Amazon you are given a choice of quality to download.  Lower quality = quicker download time.Speakers.  Fantastic sound quality from the new Fire.  I ran FUN Some Nights at full volume against my friends iPad 2.  Sound was clear, with no distortion, and noticeably louder than the iPad.Prime Members have access to a vast selection of Movies and TV Shows to stream, and access to an extensive lender library for eBooks.Office Suite Professional 6.  Upon starting my Kindle Fire for the first time, and after initial setup I began exploring and working things out for myself.  I opened the Office Suite 6 app for the first time and was asked if I wished to upgrade to professional.  It was free.  I now have the ability to Open, Edit, Save, and Create Word Documents, Excel Spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.  A wonderful application that helps the Kindle compete with many of the other tablets on the market today.Screen Resolution.  Having subscribed to my favorite magazines I was stunned by the excellent picture quality.  While reading with the Kindle held in portrait mode results in a block of empty black space at the bottom, it does not interrupt reading.  Works well in landscape mode as well.Reading.  While reading, you can change between a white background with black letters, a black background with white letters, or the sepia background with black letters.  While personally have not, do think I will be reading white letters on a black background, the options are nice help to meet a variety of preferences.Keyboard.  The touch keyboard is quick to respond and easy to navigate.  Letters, Numbers, and Symbols are well organized and easy to find and use.  While typing very quickly can result in a brief lag time, it is the same lag I experience with my iPhone 4.Cloud Storage.  The inclusion of Cloud Storage is a great addition to the Kindle, and greatly increases your storage space.  There is plenty of space for a nice collection of movies, music, and books for any Kindle Holder.Bluetooth Capabilities.  I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard to use with the Kindle as well.  It is a wonderful addition turning my kindle into a portable net book.  It beats having to carry 17\" HP Laptop to the office every morning that is for sure.Ads.  Not as bothersome as I thought they would be.  The lock screen will feature and ad.  Slide to the right to learn more, slide to the left to unlock.  If it is not an ad, it is just a random picture of a book or colorscape.  Not at all bothersome, and I would not spend $15 to rid the Fire of Ads and instead use that $15 to purchase an Italo Calvino novel from the Kindle Store.CONS:No VPN.  One con, which others may not find as bothersome as I do, is that currently there is no working VPN for the Kindle Fire that I know of.  I currently run Astril on my home computer, but they have yet to release an app for the current version of the Android iOS the Fire runs.  The only working VPN is one that requires Cisco systems corporate servers.  A VPN should not be a make or break point for those considering the Fire.  I live in Shanghai, and the Great Firewall of China is bothersome, blocking not only Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media sites, but also randomly blocking sites for unknown reasons; marthastewart.com, punchfork.com.  I do hope that either Amazon or a third party can get a working VPN out soon.No wall charger.  Out of the box you will get your Kindle and the new black mini USB cable.  The fast charger is available, for $19.99.  This is slightly bothersome as I need to keep my Fire plugged into my computer to charge.  Also, I am warned that my Fire may not charge while in use.OVERALL:All in all, I am loving my new Fire.  In less than a week of use I am pleased with the new Fire and see.

I do have a few gripes.I use my fire to do quick internet checks as it starts up much faster than a computer. I have a few eBooks and a LOT of audio books. Since our family has Amazon Prime and Netflix accounts I can also watch video on it when convenient. Finally, I surprisingly enjoy gaming on the tablet. I have a few gaming systems and with excellent games like Rayman Jungle Run, Cut the Rope, and Stupid Zombies 2,to name a few, I probably play games on the kindle more than on my PSP.So whats better? The new Kindles have an app called Free Time which finally gives parental control options for the device. And you can opt into the Free Time Unlimited service which is basically like Netflix for children's programming. This includes apps, videos and over 1,000 books. It's good but not perfect. I can micro-manage and designate how much time the kids can spend playing games versus reading for example. Or I can simply give them 2hrs per day and they can do what ever they choose. But I can't give them a different time allowance for weekends which is not cool. I'd like to, for example, have the option to maybe give them 2 hrs on school days and 5hrs on the weekends. Another shortcoming is that there is no way that a kid can log out of their account without a parent entering the password. This probably isn't an issue if the kid is the sole user of the tablet but I have 2 kids sharing so when they need to switch I have to log them out every time. It would have made more sense to let them log out to the profile selection screen and require a password only if backing out of that space. This wouldn't work for 5 year olds but at least allow this option for older kids who can have passwords. On the positive side, the parental feature disables ads and in-game purchasing in the child accounts. Unfortunately you still can't have more than 1 adult account though.Another new feature than I really enjoy is the immersive reading. If I have the eBook and audio book for select titles I can sync them. So I can look at the eBook text which highlights words in real time as the audio book plays. Or I can listen to my book during my commute and then read the ebook at home and the ebook will sync up to where the audio book left off. Thats very cool. The speaker sound is also much improved.The new models also have more storage. The screen also looks really good though I admit it doesn't really make that much of a difference for streaming video. It also had an HDMI port, but it's micro HDMI so you'll have to get the cable as it's unlikely you own one. On the up side it now has physical volume buttons. The virtual volume controls still exist. On the down side, the new models don't come with chargers included anymore and it seems to take much longer to charge than before. They can be purchased though.  Thats about all I can say. It does have a few more tricks like  wireless options and wifi, bluetooth for access external keyboards, and skype capabilities if you have the model with the built in camera. You can also take pics but since there is only the front facing camera it might be a bit awkward for taking pics of anything but yourself. And there are also new apps like the mail client, but since I share my tablet and you can't have more than one adult account I am unlikely to use it. Also I miss seeing the glowing power button or the charging battery animation when my old kindle charges. The new one doesn't seem to have it.One odd thing to mention is that the partially subsidized models (which is probably what you'll get if you buy from a physical store - Amazon calls it \"special offers\" on their site) have ads on the screen saver. You buy it a few bucks cheaper but you see the adds. If that bothers you, you can still pay the difference (one time fee - just a few dollars) to not see them though.Overall I like it. If you own a 1st gen and the new features don't appeal to you then stick with the first gen. Otherwise I think its a good buy.

However, I still did my homework before I made the purchase including playing with both side by side for over an hour.  Since the iPad is the benchmark everyone seems to use, I will make some comparisons to that tablet.  First of all, the cost for a comparable tablet (I purchased a 32GB model) was considerably less for the Kindle Fire HD.  You only get the single camera with the Kindle Fire and the screen is smaller (8.9\" versus 9.7\" for the iPad) which wasn't a big factor for me.  What was a factor is that the Kindle Fire is lighter and a bit thinner, has dual Dolby speakers (compared to one for the iPad) and dual WiFi antennas.  The resolution on the new iPad is exceptional, but then again so is the Kindle Fire.  You need to compare them side by side to see if there is enough difference to justify the added cost of the iPad.  Battery life is advertised as about the same (11 hours for Kindle, 10 for iPad).  There are some minor design glitches on the Kindle Fire HD that have been covered in other reviews.  (1)The location of the power switch is not only hard to find, but you find yourself accidentally touching it frequently and turning off the tablet. I partially solved this problem by taking a silver marking pen and placing a dot next to where the power button is so that you don't have to turn the unit sideways to look for it and you can avoid it more easily with the dot marking the spot.  (2) the connection for the power cable is located at the bottom of the tablet (if you are holding the tablet horizontally).  If you are watching a movie and want to have the power cable connected, the plug rests on the surface which crimps the wire a bit and can't be good for the plug and wire.  I place two paperback books under the tablet at about the height of the plug which keeps it off the surface.  Obviously when you use the tablet on battery which is probably the majority of the time, this isn't an issue.  I have watched about 10 movies since I received my Kindle Fire and I must say that I am very impressed.  I have a high speed wireless internet connection (18 Mbs) and the movies are delivered without any pauses or jerky motions.  It is just like watching a movie on TV.  The sound is very good and the picture is truly HD quality.  Navigating around the Kindle Fire takes some practice.  The Help pages that Amazon provides are worth printing off for reference but still do not provide a full user's manual.  With time, I found that I liked how the screens were displayed and moving between the Amazon cloud and items loaded on the device a snap.  While it is not all totally intuitive, it doesn't take long to master the major steps to get through books, movies, etc.  Email was a little harder for me.  I have AT&T; (Uverse) email and there were some issues (for example not syncing contacts) that you won't face with something like gmail.  Finally, I saw a lot of comments on the case that is custom made for the Kindle Fire HD (about $54).  I didn't care whether it looked like leather or not.  I wanted something that had a custom fit look and protected my Kindle.  It does that.  The material it is made of looks more like a polycarbonate material and the cost is probably higher than it should be, but so far, I like it.  I have very little slippage problem when I stand it up on a hard surface.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that isn't an Apple fanatic.  I was all prepared to consider the new iPad, but I just didn't see enough difference that mattered to me to justify the added cost, but then each of you has your idea of what features matter the most.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9", "Author": "AnnS", "ReviewID": "R2GL8BMGQ6OE37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third kindle and I am happier than ever!

The Kindle HD won hands down.The build is very solid, however this Pro comes with a caveat (see below).The software, with one exception (see below) is very solid-responsive and quick.The sound quality through the on-board speakers or through headphones is quite good. The Cons:It boots up slowly.It is too heavy, in my opinion, in relationship to it's size. It has a smaller footprint than the Tab or the iPad, but weighs more (the caveat mentioned in Pros).Buttons are too small, poorly placed, and unresponsive, in my opinion.The software issue I mentioned in Pros was the email app. I use Gmail and the interface presented in the mail app is lacking in functionality and lacks the simplicity Gmail usually presents.It takes a LONG time to recharge, even plugged in to the wallNo access to the Play Store. I realize it's a closed system but it is too closed. Apps I use often that I am unable to access on the Kindle include:DropBox, Directv, Delta, an actual Gmail app, Google drive, Logitech Alert, American Express, and Scrabble. Summary:A well built, albeit heavier machine. As mentioned, the picture, sound and content purchase options are great. The buttons need work, the apps need work, the closed system needs work. If you are looking for a device to mostly consume items from the Amazon storefront(s)and do not mind some functionality trade offs, this device will work for you.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mostly good, room for improvement and all about usage", "Author": "Caveat Emptor", "ReviewID": "R294HEUKT520ZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kindle's HD 8.9 is a product I had waited for since before it was even a rumor.  On balance its actual performance should please some, displease some and mostly be found a welcome addition for those whose digital world is centered in the Amazon eco-system.  It all rather depends on what you are looking for--- even within the Amazon system.  As an owner of the iPad's every generation, a couple of iterations of various android tablets, iPods/iPhones and the odd e-reader, including the original kindle, I believe I have a better grasp than many on the real world factors which judge success and failure in such devices generally.Without trying to reinvent the wheel in this review or go too far afield in measurements and techno-speak, I feel a select group of factors are to the point particularly with this specific item and I will confine comments to those, so that a concise and understandable comparison with not only choices of other devices, but most importantly the unique and singular needs this one fulfills best.Specific factors: size, screen quality, form factor, durability, flexibility, value (cost/what you get) and continued satisfaction in longterm.This version of the Kindle has a number of capabilities: as a limited personal computing device for web-surfing, document handling and light office duty, as an ebook reader, streaming media player, etc., but not to get into the weeds of such a shopping list I will jump to the end and simply state that what it is or should be seen as is as a media player which occasionally is used for some of these other  tasks.  A laptop, even a lightweight and inexpensive ultra-book is going to do office jobs and web-surfing better, a couple of tablets, most notably the Nexus and the iPad are more flexible and higher powered for running apps, with greater libraries of apps to draw on even.  A smartphone is lighter and more portable.  However--beginning with a screen that is absolutely comparable with the deservedly touted retina display, a nimble combination of hardware components that make for stellar responsiveness-- especially for those persons within the Amazon Prime family, this tablet leaves all others in the dust for the breadth of high quality media (movies predominantly) delivered.As a streaming media device the amount of storage is of relatively minor impact as what is left of the baseline 16 gigs should absolutely be more than enough for a few apps, pictures, a moderately robust collection of audio books, books and music (think of this device as the equivalent of your everyday carry bag or commuter backpack for your media).  Since you are streaming your movie content from Amazon and have an infinite storage space for your Amazon content: books, audio books and music; you really shouldn't be storing much on it.If you are more about a purse or a briefcase or if what you are predominantly doing is reading ebooks then you need to look to the 7\" little brother with its lower price, as the greater real estate of the 8.9 inch doesn't do for you or doesn't appreciably add, respectively.  Similarly, if your primary thrust is for your children, since it is easier in smaller hands and comes with all of the same services, the smaller/less expensive version is your sweet spot.It feels solid and sturdy, much more so than a number of similarly sized android tablets.  It has a nicely finished surface for gripping and has an edge to edge glass screen which is scratch resistant and tolerably low in reflective glare.  Though some reports have contested the claim of its speedy wifi connectivity, for streaming video it is second to none and flawless with no discernible stuttering, freezing or hiccuping for buffering.  The pricey, optional Amazon tablet cover/case preserves all the physical aspects of the tablet including its svelte lines, further extending its durability without turning it into a giant plastic brick.Finally, while including most every nicety you find on other tablets bluetooth, hdmi out, support for Exchange based corporate email, Skype and social media integration--- it adds a few of its own, Amazon specific extras like Read to me, Whispersync, integration into the Amazon shopping experience including product suggestions etc, the new X-ray function for most consumable content, a huge lending library of free books and a gigantic and heavily discounted textbook rental library-- making overall value untouchable (again for those in the Amazon system) by any of its tablet competitors.The single, largest deficit is the battery life.  While an improvement on the earlier version of the Fire, the 10 hour claim is pure marketing fantasy.  One of the real pluses, its thinness, doesn't leave enough room for a sufficiently sized battery. The real world battery usage will run between 6-71/2 hours depending on screen brightness being set anywhere from 50-100%.  While minimally acceptable, in the age of similar devices running in excess of 10 hours, this is far from ideal. On the flip side of that, with the speedy charger (which should be free, but isn't) the recharge time from near 0 to fully charged is considerably under the 5 hours they promise---taking roughly 3 1/2 hours or around 2 1/2 hours for 80%.The single biggest asset of the device is Amazon, itself.  Its track record, its overall services, but most of all its customer service--which in my considered opinion is not only light years ahead of its nearest rival, Apple, but in a consumer world of deception, built in obsolescence and recorded telephone loops...the closest thing to absolute perfection any of us will ever see from a business.  For this alone you may bank on the long term reliability and value of your purchase.Final thoughts:  I underscore that this is a media streaming device, if your primary thrust is something else, look elsewhere (though as an affordable electronic babysitter or a way of cutting textbook costs it may likewise prove the singular touchstone for those strongly of those needs).  The 4G LTE option is potentially a killer for Amazon, but not as it exists now.  Until Amazon can work out a deal with a cellular provider based upon the muscle of their client base so that an unlimited or at least a very large allotment per month (5-10 gigs) for a reasonable, flat yearly charge, it is all but useless.  For a media streaming device, what does the present allotment buy you in terms of streaming--1/2 of one movie?  Why would you pay double for the LTE version, essentially so you could do email and download that book which you JUST can't put off another 15 minutes until you reach home, office, Starbucks or the train? I don't think so!!If there were a percentage rating possible I would have given something in the mid to upper 80s, even with the very disappointing battery life, but with stars it has to be 4 until that one problem is substantially solved.

The physical construction of both is quite good, although I find the smaller Fire much easier to move around with, and I like its implementation of the Starter page for the Web browser infinitely better than that of the HD, which sticks one with a bunch of crappy \"Selected\" sites that apparently pay Amazon to stick links on your screen that you have zero control over, and a bunch more of \"Trending\" stuff that I would love to disable. I would really like to have MY Selected sites (favorites) displayed on screen in lieu of Amazon's, and perhaps more of my recent history.  However, two thirds of the screen is consumed by the Amazon-imposed links.  I also miss the externally viewable LED indication of \"Fully Charged/Charging\" status...if the HD is turned off, I have to turn it on to see if it is charged, which seems a bit regressive in terms of human design.  However, the addition of an external volume control with the HD implementation is quite helpful.  As for the power button, I like the Fire's better because of instant feedback, where with the HD I just have to wait to see if I depressed it far enough.  That a minor annoyance, at most, but one designers may want to look at in the future,As I noted, the physical quality of the units is excellent, so my beefs are with the software/firmware limitations.  My major grouse is the intentional blocking of apps that run fine on other Androids, but apparently Amazon has crippled their version so that it will accept only apps obtained via Amazon.  Worse yet, some apps that would run on the Fire won't run on the Fire HD.  Let me state now that if one is technically proficient and determined, one can often \"sideload\" apps not approved by Amazon which work fine...in fact, I routinely use a browser on my HD that I find more responsive than Amazon's and it displays what I want displayed, not what Amazon selects for me, plus I can watch webcasts and similar videos which apparently Amazon hasn't figured out how to handle since Adobe refused to support Flash Player on Android. I understand the desire to control what is loaded, but some of their protection is clearly self-serving, and not about users at all (at least in my opinion).  So here is the important take-away from this:  If you are willing to live exclusively in a world where Amazon dictates what is available to you, you'll love the unit.  Otherwise, get ready to live without some really useful apps or to take the risk of running them down on the net and side-loading them (some of which can indeed booger up your system).By the way, for those grousing about the power charging unit not being included, that is clear in the material and ordering process. Since some people already have several adequate charging modules, and since Amazon cuts you a deal when you order if you don't already have one, that's just not a legitimate gripe!  After all, why should those who don't need a charger have to buy one anyway?However, when one pays to avoid advertising content, only to have it imposed on the start page of the browser in terms of \"Selected\" internet sites not controlled by the user, I feel that I have been had.  However, as stated above, I don't necessarily use their browser that much anyway, so what the heck!  It is just so dishonest!If I buy another tablet, it will absolutely be a tablet upon which I can load whatever I want to load so long as it is written for Android, so it will likely not be another Amazon product, unless they alter course considerably.  Of course, they make their choices, and we all have to ultimately make ours.  Just be fully informed, check out some online demo's or evaluations and/or check out a friend's before you buy.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "product is great.......app selection is for children.", "Author": "taw", "ReviewID": "R16I64A9SAVD8J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a huge amazon fan for a long time. So when I was looking around for a tablet or reader my first thought obviously went to amazon.  The quality of the actual kindle is great.

Much to my surprise I can't get my local bank app,  groupon which has my local discounts, nor can I  get my local news app just to name a few.

Elmore", "ReviewID": "R1H44HTPSIK1MY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I sew a lot, so I keep movies and tv shows streaming on my computer for entertainment. I'm also read a lot. I also buy a lot of music. All of these things have Amazon in common.  I am a good customer.  So since my computer was suffering under the weight of all of those downloaded files and since I was getting the blue screen of death about once a week, I decided to take action.I researched and looked for a solution.My thinking: if I could get a tablet that could take the Amazon content off my computer, I might be able to extend the life of my laptop.  I looked at the Microsoft Surface and the Amazon Kindle seriously. I read all of the reviews, I put out messages to friends who have one or the other, I asked questions.  In the end, mostly because of price and ties to Amazon, I opted to get the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  Since most of my online activity includes Amazon, I thought it would be the better purchase.My first complaint is about the shipping service. I am a Prime customer. I deserve better shipping than what I got.  Now, I do have many of my Amazon purchases sent to a PO Box.  I know, how un-American of me, but I don't live in a sweet little neighborhood with mailboxes out front. I live in the wild west with directions to houses that go something like this: Go five miles out and take the only road that you see left. Go another 2.56 miles and when you see the bush on the left, turn right.  Now, the UPS driver that serves our area knows all of us. He knows where we live, he knows where we work, he knows our children and where they work. He knows if he can get down our road if it rains, he knows who our friends are and where he can leave it if our road is impassable.  Fed Ex sends a different driver almost every time. Packages get lost or left with the wrong person. No worries. They signed for it!!  Now, if you were me, would you have your expensive Kindle purchase sent to your house or would you go ahead and have it sent to your PO Box.  Most people can find the post office. Even FedEx.  My Kindle sat at the FedEX facility in a large city in my state for 36 hours!!!  There is no excuse for that.  The post office does have expedited shipping, why can't Amazon use that?  Or let me have the choice between UPS and FedEX on everything that I purchase. That would be great and worth the $79 that I spend every year to enjoy Prime shipping.Right out of the box, I could have used a manual.  I'm not stupid and I'm not of the \"no tech\" generation.  I'm of the \"it's passing me by\" generation.  The little iphone sized card called \"Getting Started\" isn't very informative. I found the on/off button and the volume.  I found the USB charger outlet thing. That mini USB connection feels so fragile. I miss the big ones. They at least felt like you could plug it in and not be damaging it.  The cord and the connector are stiff and I'm really worried that I'll mess those pins up when I plug it in.  I don't care for fragile things.  I like things with a more substantial feel.So, I finally get my Kindle.  Being so rural, I admit that my internet options are limited. But, I chatted online with someone from Amazon about the Kindle and the possibility that the internet wouldn't work.  It does work, but it doesn't work like Amazon said it would. I said that I have DSL. I didn't hide anything. Internet reception is just ok.  If you live in a really rural area and you have to rely on DSL, it is going to be slow.  The Kindle will stream a little less well than streaming on your computer. It won't get better. You've been warned.Next, I have had a few electronic devices. I was a technology geek for awhile, but just got tired of trying to keep up. So, I know some things and haven't a clue about others.  Here is something I do know. Screens need to be calibrated.  If Kindle has a way to calibrate screens, I haven't found it.  Another good topic for a manual.  The reason I say this is because when I try to move a book off of my device or from the carousel, I'm supposed to be able to put my finger on the image and hold. After holding, a menu pops up and says, \"remove from device, or carousel\" depending upon which screen you are in.  This is the most frustrating procedure!! Six, eight times I placed my finger and hold and the image just shivers and there is no menu.  And typing a help message to the Kindle crew was a disaster. The space bar wouldn't engage and if I wanted to move the cursor, I couldn't move it with a key, I had to place my finger on the message in the approximate position and  hold. It took me 30 minutes to type a simple help message of 5 lines.  The screen needs to be calibrated.Next, my audible books didn't transfer.  I had my audible account long before Amazon bought them, so my passwords were not synced.  Last night, when I tried to use the help, I got a \"contact us\" (the awful email). This morning when I looked I got an explanation.  I changed my audible account in order to use my Amazon credentials.  Still nothing. There is no way, that I can find, that will let my Kindle know that I've made the changes.  Help search was no help and this would be a good time for a manual.  I still have had no word from the help team at Amazon.  I also had trouble with my email account, but that did work itself our this morning.Finally, as I'm checking out all of the features, I went into books.  I downloaded several books and went exploring.  I went into my ESV Bible hoping that I could take my Kindle to church (larger fonts).  I could not figure out how to move around in the book.  Once you are in it, any book, all of the options, like the back arrow and the home button disappear.  Okay, maybe you access those buttons like the settings, you pull down with your finger from the top, right? No.  I completely stumbled on tapping the book to get the options back.  Manual. Or at least another little iphone sized card with helpful hints.  Good Grief.By this time, I'm pretty frustrated. I'm happy that I saved my boxes and that I opened everything carefully.After sleeping on it, I got up this morning to take another look. I did get my email account on, but I still don't have access to my Audible account. I can access Prime Instant video and it will stream. Until the buffer is full, it pauses about every 30 seconds.  I pause at the beginning and then once it buffers, I watch.  But that dual antenna thing doesn't work in rural areas.  That was the main question that I asked, and I always got the same answer: If you can stream on your computer, you can stream on a Kindle. True, but you neglected to mention that it doesn't stream AS WELL.What do I like?The picture and the video are good.The sound is good.I like the fact that I can move content from Kindle to Cloud and back again.  That feature on the PC versions of Kindle and Unbox would have been very helpful and I wouldn't have found myself in that original predicament.  Anyway, I'm glad to have that ability. That is probably THE reason that I won't return this to Amazon.The core stuff that the Kindle is meant to do...works.I uninstalled Unbox off of my computer this morning and regained 220 GB of space. My computer already runs a little better.Bottom line: After taking some time with the Kindle Fire, I'll keep it.  I think that it will do what I wanted it to do. It will take over my Amazon content. I can do my browsing on it. I don't go that many places.  I can't watch hulu because I don't have a hulu plus membership and I can't watch anything on CBS, but I can still do that on my computer.  I'm going to reserve judgement about whether I'd buy the Kindle again. Maybe in time, I'll love it or at least like it better.`", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire great when it works", "Author": "judith wallace", "ReviewID": "R1XYS4NJZ61159", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited when I got my first kindle as a gift from my husband.

The reason is that I found the 7 inch screen to small to comfortably watch movies or do much of anything else. Also, the Nexus 7 had terrible wifi reception for me. I would need to stay within about 30 feet of my router to get at least two bars out of four. And forget about getting any reception once I walked out the front door. The Kindle Fire has been much better. Whereas I was not getting any reception bars just outside my front door with the Nexus 7, I am still getting 3 bars out of four with the Kindle Fire 8.9. I am finding that no matter where I go in my home, I am able to get a good reception. Also, the extra two inches and increased resolution of the Kindle Fire makes a world of difference. I talked myself into thinking that a pure version of android, which the Nexus 7 had, would be great. But I found I only need or would use maybe 30 or so apps. So why on Earth would I need over 700,000 apps, or even have the time to look at that many apps? The only negative I have with the Kindle Fire 8.9 is that just like other tablets, it is hard to use  in sunlight with all the glare.

I ordered it on Friday morning around 7a.m. central time, and requested next day delivery.  Sure enough, it was delivered before noon Saturday.  I immediately signed up for Amazon Prime and ATT 4GLTE service.  I later discovered that you can't access AMAZON PRIME videos from the 4GLTE connection.  Why?  I'd like to know!!!!  You can only access it from the Wi-Fi connection.  Which I CANNOT do when my computer is on (apparently 100% of my ATT DSL speed is good enough to stream Amazon Prime, but 50% is just NOT enough as it kept exiting after about 30 seconds because the vid hadn't started yet.  It wouldn't even BUFFER).  But I have watched vid on it while the computer was off, and it does work fine on my wi-fi connection.  It just needs to be alone.  For the record, I have DSL that is rated at 50X faster than dial-up.  In my area that is the 2nd tier of service, with 2 tiers above it (I believe 75 and 100X faster than dial-up).  The video NEVER exhibited any flaws while I was watching.  I have yet to explore all of the AKFHD's features, but I am enjoying this little black box.  I even found myself \"Borrowing\" a book from Amazon Prime today.  I have to be honest, I did not think I would be able to read a story that was not on paper, but this has changed my mind.  I won't stop collecting paper books, mind you.  If anything I think they will become much more valuable and desirable in years to come.  But the AKFHD is usable and I will most certainly be borrowing and probably purchasing books digitally.  I hope this review helps someone.  And if I may make a suggestion... if and when you order yours, get the QUICK CHARGER (you'll be glad you did), and get a COVER or CASE as well.  I did not get the case, so now I have to make the big decision.

Let me just say that one of the reasons I upgraded to the larger tablet is because I want to watch movies on it and not have to watch it on a micro mini screen. The reason I bought the KINDLE as opposed to the Motorola or the Ipad are a bit more involved. I have the Motorola tablet - admittedly an older one - but it was very heavy and it used Windows which meant I had to have a browser - Google or Firefox or whatever. I found it to be sluggish and confusing. Enough said. I refuse to buy into the Apple world simply because they are trying to set themselves up with the snob factor, like - I own a Mercedes Benz, aren't I cool? NO!! You aren't cool when you could have bought TWO really nice Buicks or Hondas for the same price - buy one for yourself and buy one for the poor family in the next, lower class neighborhood who can barely keep their old car running! Oh, I own an Ipad, I paid twice as much as the cool Kindle, but don't I look successful???? NO! You look like somebody who doesn't care that there are people starving and freezing because they can't afford food and oil. Take the extra $300 you paid for the Ipad and donate it to the nearest homeless shelter!OK, I had to get that out of my system because it really is something I do not understand in humanity today. The Kindle - I LOVE the Silk they use. I can move around in my Kindle just as fast as I can in my laptop. I love the book section and spend more than my share of time browsing around. There are a ton of really good FREE books you can get. Plus, unlike the other snobby tablet, you can buy books at other estores, too! Isn't sharing nice? I LOVE the movies. Oh my goodness!! I just got this tablet Tuesday night and luckily, the young lady who took my order had it all set up for me so I just opened it, plugged it in, and there everything was! With the exception of my notepad, which I had to hand type from the old Kindle to the new one. Small issue. Anyway, I plugged in my earphones and flipped into a movie supplier and BOOM!! The sound was outstanding. I cannot tell you how amazing it was. The difference between the sound in this Kindle and the non HD Kindle without Dolby sound is spectacular. I am going to get Titanic out tomorrow JUST for the sound!!! The picture is so clear, honestly is hurt my eyes (I am just too used to blurry pictures, my eyes need to literally adjust to the pure clarity of this larger HD Kindle).So, yes, I LOVE this Kindle. So, why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because, the reason I upgraded from the regular to the tablet HD was that the Keyboard was so wonky, I had trouble ALL THE TIME. I thought it was broken, honestly. But, this one does the same thing. Also? I cannot for the life of me get my email working or Facebook to work. Not a BIG deal since it is fast and easy to get on the web and get there that way, but I just think they could have gotten the glitches OUT of these Kindles by now!!! Those are my two reasons for them losing a star.Another thing I LOVE about the Kindle (in general) is the Carousel. I don't know why it is so easy for me to get around using the Carousel, other than the fact that the things you use most (having Facebook and my email up there would be nice!), books, movies, weather apps, games, magazines, whatever you use most are always right up front on the Carousel when you open it. So convenient! And as for jumping on the web, it's also on a sort of Carousel above the Carousel. In other words, if you want to go to your books section, it is written across the top of the Carousel, along with the movie section, the magazine section, the app section and the web. The web is SO EASY TO USE on Kindle. What I have learned to do is simply leave FB open in a tab (not my email, having had someone TRY to hack it in January), so I go up and hit web and flip open Facebook and voila! There it is! Oh, also, you have the really wonderful Mp3 Amazon Cloud Player which I also LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Again, not snobby in that you can ONLY by from Amazon, but you can buy from other stores as well (unlike the snobby tablet). I found it easy to use and the sound is spectacular. Again, you can also find some awesome free music there as well.So, yes, I am a Kindle all the way kind of girl. That's my opinion and the fact that this tablet is so thin and light, there is a lot of WOW factors there! One more thing? I want to shout out to the Customer Service Reps at Amazon. Because I am an Amazon junkie, I end up talking to a lot of Customer Service people. Once in a while I get a clunker, but that is rare. I have found most reps to be very helpful. I buy from other sources as well, but hands down, Amazon has the BEST Customer Service that I deal with. So, I HIGHLY recommend, for the money and the experience, getting a Kindle instead of \"other\" tablets. Still need to work on the keyboard, my phone has a MUCH better keyboard than the Kindle, but I can live with it. The set up, the books, the sound, the convenience, the fast pace, is superb. Get thyself out and buy the Kindle. Pay the extra $50 and get the HD, too.

So how can I complain if the price was only $249 ($50 off when Amazon ran the 1-day discount). I was using IPAD2 for the same purposes with a price for $500.If you have an Amazon prime, that's even better, you will get a FREE Two-Day Shipping, Prime Instant Videos, Kindle Owners' Lending Library, free 5GB to your Amazon cloud account, and unlimited space for all the Amazon content you buy.Amazon produced a tablet that probably coincides with what the most users want from a tablet with a very good price.I recommend this device for everybody who has a laptop because it won't replace a PC or a lap tap but just for entertainment.I give it 5 stars of the good quality and the price.

Granted, I turn up the volume all the way, but there is zero distortion and the quality of the sound is quite highBattery indicator- I read a lot of reviews before I bought this and many complained there was no battery charge indicator on the tablet. This was obviously corrected by Amazon before I got my tablet because there most certainly IS a battery charging indicator. Granted, there is no light indicator to show when fully charged, but this is not needed.The OS- Many complaints focused on this being a locked down version of Android, can't customize, blah blah. It's true, it is \"locked down\", but everyone should bear in mind so is the IPAD and more so than this tablet. Many complained there was a software glitch in the carousel where you could not remove items, this has obviously been fixed because it works perfectly. In general, I like the carousel and the general operation of the OS. It's super fast and super easy, between the favorites star and the carousel you have pretty much everything you needThe app store- The app store is very good, easy to navigate and purchase. True, they don't have everything, but they have a LOT of thingsThe browser- I had no issues at all with the stock browser, but thought I'd pass this on. There were a great many people saying to use the \"Dolphin\" browser because it was supposed to be a great browser and also because it supported flash so you could work around the \"no flash\" issue. There were tons of remarks about having to \"sideload\" Dolphin and about a million different instructions on doing so. Forget all that. You don't need to do that. You can just download an alternate app store called \"good e reader\", there are excellent instructions on youtube, not that it's really needed, you literally have to change one setting and then you can download it normally, there is nothing strange or exotic required. Once you have this app store, IT has the Dolphin HD browser, flash, and probably a ton of other stuff, I haven't downloaded much else. The point is, you can just download from this appstore, there is no \"sideloading\" shennanigans needed and have the Dolphin Browser. I will say, the Dolphin browser DOES live up to its billing, it's fantastic, I'm glad I downloaded itAmazon ecosystem- amazing, far better than apple's in every regard except number of apps. The music is far superior as are the video offerings. I have watched a bunch of free stuff with my prime membership and it works flawlessly. Shopping directly from amazon for anything else on the planet is super convenient and works flawlesslySize/Shape compared to full sized IPAD: The 8.9 is almost identical to IPAD in Height. The difference is really in the width, the fire HD is narrower than the IPAD, which mostly accounts for it's reduced spec of 8.9 as compared to 9.9. What this really amounts to is the IPAD is much more of a square shape, it's almost like a 4:3 aspect ratio TV. The Fire HD is shaped much more like a modern TV or computer monitor, with a 16:9 ratio. One benefit besides better movie and TV shape that I did not expect is that if you turn the tablet into a \"portrait\" orientation to type, you can type very quickly with both thumbs just like a cellphone.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "update:  charging issues", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2DTAARDLGF0T4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an entertainment device, not a computer tablet, unless you willing to root.

Not being able to use it here, and being limited to a clunky email program is very frustrating.2.  No Google Play.  After spending time trying to work with the Amazon Cloud Player, I bailed - the thought of paying for what I was getting free on Google Play wasn't sitting well with me.  I was able to get my music transferred over to the Kindle Fire via USB, but for some reason some of the album artwork covers aren't displaying.  They display fine in iTunes and in Google Play, but not here.  I have no idea if something isn't embedded properly, but........  somehow it all magically worked in Google Play and iTunes.  So, i'm annoyed that I'm spending time trying to figure out what's wrong with 500 of my 3500 music files.  It's important to figure out, because the music display is primarily the album covers - having tons of matching grey ones is not helpful3.  Clunky music interface.  There's no way to play by genre.  Your only options are playlists/artists/albums/songs.  Do I really have to make a playlist for each genre?  Also, the search capability is poor, it's hard to maneuver around even if you know exactly what you're trying to play.  Because I used the USB to transfer my music, I have no playlists transferred, so i have to recreate painfully on the device.  Also because I'm not paying for the cloud, I can't do my playlists on a laptop and transfer them.  Again, it's frustrating because none of these are issues on Google Play. I'm finding I'm pulling out my phone and playing music on my phone 'cause it's easier to maneuver.4.  No categories/folders in the books area.  I am heavily dependent on that on my Kindle Touch to sort into different categories.  Here, I'm supposed to buy another app that doesn't work seamlessly with the Kindle Fire?

My uses for it:1.  Reading my comic book collection.2.  Reading books purchased from Amazon.3.  Reading ebooks checked out from my local library.4.  Looking up people/movies on IMDB.5.  Watching move trailers.Pros:  1. Price.  Especially today with the $50 discount.  I didn't get it when I originally ordered it 3 weeks ago but customer support gave it to me anyway when I asked for it.  2.  Screen quality.  It's very nice.  video is clear.  Images are sharp.  Refresh rate is good.  3.  Sound is good for two little speakers.  I use a wireless bluetooth Plantronics BackBeat 903+ Headset when I watch movies.  Sound is great then.  4.  Router connectivity.  The Kindle found my Cisco-Linksys E2000 Advanced Wireless-N Router right away.Cons:  1.  The power button is hard to find with my finger.  That's not a big deal though.  I only turn it off at night.  2.  It insists on adding apps/doc that I open to the carousel.  I don't want it to do that because I don't want seldom used apps/docs to clutter up the carousel.  3.  DRM has been an issue.  I've purchased several books but couldn't open them due to DRM.  That's frustrating because reading books is what this thing is for and anything purchased from Amazon should work on Amazon's tablet IMHO.  I returned them without a problem.  4.  App selection is limited in Amazon's store.  5.  Browser is buggy.Work arounds: 1.  I install apps from another app store to work around Amazon's limited selection.  I use 1Mobile Market.2.

I have a prime membership which I enjoy quite a bit and my wife and I have purchased numerous Kindle products over the years for ourselves and family members.I have been going back and forth for the last month on purchasing a new tablet with a HD screen. I was torn between the new Ipad, the Asus TF700 and the Kindle fire HD 8.9. On a side note I am heavily invested in Apple as well as I own several of there products including an Apple TV and earlier Ipad models, 1 and 2.In the end I picked the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because of the beautiful screen and very attractive price. I went to Best Buy to purchase the Kindle only because I had a $50 gift card that I put towards the purchase price, otherwise I would have brought it from Amazon.I came home excited, opened the package and started to set up my new Kindle. The screen is stunning to say the least and it appeared to work much faster then the original Kindle Fire we brought last year. I knew I was going to enjoy my tablet.That is until I plugged it in to charge. I notice that the charge indicator kept turning green which meant it was charging, but then it would stop after a few minutes. I had a charger from our original Kindle Fire we were using and verified it worked with the other Kindles in our household. At one point it appeared the charge was holding so off I went to attend to other errands. When I came back the Kindle was at 17% charge, and the indicator was no longer showing green. I ended up getting another charger in the house and tried that one to no avail. I ended up buying the Kindle accelerated charger and that did not work as well, but it worked for our original Kindle fire. I gave up a little upset but I also understand these things happen to electronic products. I took the Kindle back to Best Buy which was a no fuss process and they took it back with no complaints. It was exchanged for a new Kindle Fire HD 8.9.I went home excited once again and went through the previous process of setting it up. Once done I plugged it into the Kindle charger we had brought and once again the indicator came on that it was charging. At least it was working. I came back about an hour later and saw that the indicator was off and the Kindle had not charged. I could not get the Kindle to charge no matter what I did.Frustrated, I drove once again to Best Buy and they tested it out and had the same outcome. They brought another Kindle Fire to me, but this time they allowed me to open it up in the store to make sure this one worked. Can you believe three different Kindle Fire HD, and all 3 had the same issue. At this point I gave up and ended up purchasing an Asus TF700, which up to this point has worked as advertised and whose screen is equally stunning.Again, I'm not naive to know things happen like this, but after 3 attempts it appears there is an issue because I have now seen other reviews describing the same issue. I love Amazon and our other Kindle products have work with no problem.

I'm completely satisfied with all the other features except email - which I consider one of, if not the most important functions of the internet.  After contacting customer service 4 times on this issue, they reluctantly devulged that the upgraded software version is probably not compatible (yet) with Comcast's email since the 8.9\" tablet is so new (in other words - it was rushed into market). They have no idea when this problem will be addressed by their programmers...not my words - theirs. Here's the problem(s): Comcast email must be set-up manually on the Kindle HD.  After verifying all info with their tech support reps it seemed that the service worked OK once or twice, then it ceased to operate - it actually wiped itself clean from the Kindle upon startup.  When I went back into the email accounts area - Comcast was \"gone\" - and I had to go thru the set-up function again.  This happened several times; it failed to perform properly every day after \"sleeping\" for a while; usually not finding any mail when I had personally sent some from my other computers. By the way, I'm not new at this - I've been around computers for over 40 years and taught electronics in the Army. My temporary solution - I went into my Comcast email account and activated email \"forwarding\" to my Gmail account; then set-up my Gmail account on the Kindle HD.  If you decide to go this way, be sure to \"keep a copy of emails\" in your Comcast box so you can access them from your computer.

I want to love it, but it has some clunky features that make it not very loveable to me.  I am also an owner of a first generation Fire which I loved.  If it didn't have charging issues, I would not have sought a replacement.I will start with the good points.The screen is lovely, large and clear.Overall, it is not heavy for the size.There are more apps available on this version and some are ones that I had been wishing for.The browser is much more stable.The e-mail program is far superior.Now for the bad points.The charging port could not be in a worse location.  It is right at the bottom of the screen.  For someone holding the tablet while charging it is either pointing at you, potentially causing harm to the port or pointing straight up which means it is in your way constantly.  It was on the side on the first generation and is on the HDX so I guess lessson learned from this model.  If you like to watch video while using a standing cover like I do, you have to delicately balance it on the edge of a table or dresser so the charging cord can be plugged in.The mini HDMI port is in the same location with the same issues.The power button is inferior, it is hard to push, it is a small rectangular button flush with the edge of the screen.  It also does not have any indicator light.  The only way to know that your tablet is charging is to open the cover, turn it on and look at the corner of the screen.  That's also the only way to know the charge is complete.  The first gen had a nice round button on the side, it glowed orange while charging or starting up and green when the charge was complete.These issues seem minor until you realize how much time you are going to be charging this tablet.  It takes hours to charge, probably close to 4 or 5 for a full charge.  I use the tablet for about 30 minutes in the morning, surfing the web and checking e-mail and then in the evening for the same for another 45 minutes or so and then to stream 2 hours or so of video.  That fully depletes the battery daily.  If I forget to charge during the day, I have to have it plugged in while I stream the video which requires dealing with the charging cord hanging out of the bottom.In short, I should have ponied up the money for the HDX, but I didn't check these features before buying.

Speed isn't an issue, usability is. I sometimes do not visit links because I don't want to fight the silk browser. This would be less of a problem if not for the second issue, which is huge. Kindle's are locked out of many apps for android devices. I knew this going in and almost did not buy one for this reason. You simply cannot download many android apps. It sucks. Can't replace the silk browser. Can't use many apps.I would recommend the Kindle for someone that is not very interested in app variety and if you can get them for a cheap price. Not worth the MSRP, but they frequently go on sale. If you are a heavy Prime video user and don't require much variety in apps, or want one to read from they are worth while I guess. I don't plan to buy another one at this time. I'll get a regular android tablet next time.

Lately we, the wife and I, were using the iPad 80% of the time, fighting as to who would get iPad.  We decided to get another tablet.  I was using the iPad for reading the daily news and to read books.  After reading reviews, we decided to get a Kindle.  We are both retired in our late 60's, so a large screen was essential.  For most things, the iPad and Kindle HD are comparable.  The iPad has a much bigger selection of apps.  The Kindle is better at downloading books, mainly free books from the library and from the other free book sites.  We do buy an occasional book from Amazon.  All these books can be viewed on the iPad or the other devices.  There are a few Kindle apps not available on the iPad.  All in all, the Kindle has been an economical way to get another large screen tablet.  I bought the 9W charging adapter which I don't think necessary.  I use the small charger from my old kindle and charge over night every other day.

It is great as an e-reader and I love that it syncs with the Kindle apps on my other devices (at least most of the time). It is also my first time owning a tablet. I must say that this device is at best disappointing when it comes to any function other than the e-reader. The device itself is pretty glitchy. For example, when you tap on the screen to move the cursor while typing, the cursor only goes to where you tapped about half the time (and that's being generous). The rest of the time it appears where you tapped for a split second and then automatically jumps to another spot in the text field, sometimes clear on the other side of the text field. The Facebook app is incredibly glitchy and in group pages will show the first five posts, but beyond that it's just a gray background with posts shown, but no way to like or comment on the post itself, and no way to click on the post or the author's profile. In these posts the pictures are also not displayed. That is very frustrating since one of the main reasons I bought this device is to use it to buy/sell items in fb buy/sell/trade groups. It is impossible for me to do that since I can't even see what other people are posting. I called Kindle tech support about this two weeks ago and  they said they could not find a fix because it was a previously unknown issue, even though I can see in the Kindle forums where people have been having this exact same problem since at least 2012. I keep getting emails from them saying they have not yet found a fix and are continuing to look into the problem. I doubt it will ever get fixed. The app selection is disappointing also, because of the exclusion of Google based apps, and other fairly common apps in Android and Apple stores. If you plan to use this as a tablet, don't waste your money. A device that is functional solely through the use of it's apps becomes useless when it's apps themselves are not up to speed, and the selection of available apps leaves a lot to be desired. I researched for a long time before making this purchase and thought I was making a wise decision going with the Kindle. I expected it to be fun to use and helpful, but it's been one disappointment after another.

I have used Ipads frequently, and have an Iphone so I'm used to the operating system so going that direction seemed the most logical however they are just so damned expensive. Upon reading lots of reviews, as well as trying out a few of my friends different tablets I decided I was going to get either the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" or the Kindle Fire HDX 7\".  I liked the idea of having both the front and rear camera as well as the ability to download videos for prime in order to watch them without wifi, but decided I would try this first and upgrade in the future if I thought it was neccesary. All I can say is this does everything I need an more. I use it so much it has completely replaced the use of my PC. If you do your research there are plenty of \"must have\" apps out there that let you get the most out of your kindle fire.  I would also highly reccommend that you have an Amazon Prime account, otherwise you won't be able to fully utilize this tablet.You have have read reviews complaining about the advertising, that had me somewhat skeptical to begin with, but the complainers neglect to mention the advertisements are only on the locked screen. Whenever you turn on the kinle you see an advertisement and an unlock Icon. Once you swipe into your home screen there are no more ads to worry about. To me this isn't a big deal, and occasionally the ads are very interesting, such as a book or movie that Amazon wants to reccommend.As far as screen clarity, I can't tell a difference between this an ANY of the Ipads I have used (I haven't used the newest Ipad air yet) and the resolution is crystal clear. The volume is impressive for a device this size, and its amazingly light weight. I was suprised by how little it weighed when i first picked it up. The battery is impressive, when they say it lasts ten hours they mean it. I watched 6 hours of a TV series from the netflix app over 2 days without charging it, and still had about 20% battery life left.If you are new to the world of tablets and aren't going to be a \"power user\" this should be more than enough for you, and at a price that is much better than most of the other's out there.

They only appear when you turn on the Kindle and once you unlock it they don't reappear.I took my time deciding which Kindle to purchase. I finally decided to buy the 8.9. I expected that it would do so much that it would replace my laptop, I was extremely disappointed within an hour of using it. It seemed that I could have gotten the same benefit with the $69 Kindle reader. Then it happened--Amazon began sending me offers for additional Apps--now I can do so much with it.There are many, many free Apps--games, printing, streaming, etc., etc. etc., so explore those first. I also got \"tokens\" for buying it that I can use to buy more apps. I'm also trying Amazon Prime for 30 days--movie and TV program streaming, but still undecided about it.I like that my Kindle has built in speakers, a great picture--I find it sharper than my HD TV. I leave the music playing in the background, while I explore other apps. Now what to do with my laptop???If you are buying this for a child, don't set up the \"one-button payment\" feature. It is easy to run up a large bill.You'll need to buy a charger, because it only comes with the USB cable.The next challenge was getting a case for it, without breaking the bank. I'm still waiting for the one I decided upon--$5.95 vs. another I saw for $54, so I can't make a recommendation right now. I also bought a stylus, because I hate to see fingerprints on my screen and because I press the wrong links when using my fingers. I sent for the Marware Stylus, based on reviews. It is expensive--$15, but sounds like the best one. I'll review it when I get it.I recommend assessing what you will do with the Kindle and using the comparison feature on Amazon, before buying. If you just want it as a reader, buy the $69 Kindle.

Kindle may not have as many in terms of shear quantity but it has everything one would need and the majority perform better than android.

I rate the Kindle display the best of the them due to its color, definition, brightness and responsiveness. I also rate the network ability of the Kindle the best due to the MIMO built into it along with it's dual band ability. It can be put on your routers 5Ghz band while the other machines are using the 2.4Ghz band your in video and internet response heaven. Ipad has always been know for having difficulties in the dual band arena. The Kindle runs dual band with out any problems.

Freedman", "ReviewID": "R2QJSB8EYN3KH6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have owned many apple \"i\"devices over the years and we finally decided that Apple has lost its edge but not its price tag.  So we bought a Barnes and Noble Nook.  The nook quickly proved to be a poor tablet.  Very limited utility and awful to configure and use.  And exceptionally difficult customer service (bought at a university bookstore three hours from our house and the local B&N; store could not accept the return - return was expensive and difficult).So we bought a Kindle Fire HD.  Now it is worth noting that we have three black and white kindle devices in the house.  The Kindle Fire HD is a whole new device - it is a computer.Good Points*Fast response times - operating on our \"n\" wifi network the machine is very fast*Good selection of apps and media (our interest is movies)*excellent screen quality - movies really pop*great battery life - generally runs eight hours before next charge*My son is dyslexic - the \"immersive reading\" option for many books is fantastic - my son hears the book being read, by a talented human not a computer, while he watches the words highlighted - can be run at slower speeds without materially changing the comprehensionWeak Points*The primary interface is poor - the apps are (apparently) only offered in a \"ribbon\" which is fine until you have tons of apps, books, etc.  There are favorite lists and other ways to search but all are a pain.  I don't know why they can't use the accepted device of having all the apps in small pictures on sortable pages for quick location and use.  This is an \"Achilles heel\" for the device and must be pushing away potential buyers.*The charger is extra - who sells an electronic device without the charger (it runs off of any USB charger so we are able to use our own kindle chargers and the computer)Overall for the price this is a very good value.  It accomplishes our goals of being a well rounded entertainment device at half the price of a iPad.  In general the only advantage of iPad is a more user friendly interface.

Hanenberg \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RFVTDEVOCAD73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For normal reading I use the Kindle Paperwhite.  I like the fact that it looks like paper.  Like paper it depends on an external source of light.  I do not like reading on screens where the light shines at me from behind the screen.Which is what the Kindle Fire does.  However, the Paperwhite is not useful for books which are colorful, or which have irregular fonts or complex formatting.  I originally bought the Kindle Fire because I wanted to own a certain book on plants.  This book was full of pictures.  A friend of mine owned it, but I could not find another copy anywhere.  It was an old book and out of print, the author had long since died and there was no copy in any library in the state of California and none for sale anywhere on the internet.So I borrowed my friend's book, bought a Kindle Fire and scanned the entire book into a group of PDF files.  There is a fine app for viewing pdf files on the Kindle Fire.  The photographs were perfectly clear, and using my fingers with a reverse pinching motion, I could enlarge any part of a photograph.  You could get the same effect with a paper book using a magnifying glass, but this was easier.Later I found similar uses for the Kindle Fire.  I had always wanted to own a facsimile of the First Folio, but I never could bring myself to buy one.  However, there is a free pdf file of the First Folio on the internet.  Now I have it on my Kindle Fire.  To my surprise, I found it was more satisfying to read King Lear in the First Folio than in a modern, annotated version.  I had also wanted for a long time to own a facsimile of a medieval book called the Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry, but it would have been too expensive to buy one.  I could not find the whole thing on the internet, but a found a part of it as a pdf file, and now can look at it on the Kindle Fire.  Or: I was helping my nephew apply to college.  It turns out to be an easy thing to download an entire college handbook of several hundred pages, and read it in its original formatting.  Later I wanted a government report on the economic value of college majors.  They give this out for free as a pdf file, and with the Kindle Fire I could read the whole 200 page book in its original formatting.I read magazines on the Paperwhite.  But certain graphs, tables and pictures do not show up in the Kindle Paperwhite.  Images, even at their best, loose much of their value on the Paperwhite. Sometimes, as in the Economist's edition for the Paperwhite, the images are skipped altogether.  I keep finding something like \"See figure 1\" and there is no figure 1.  Or, you might have a tabulation, but when you zoom in on it, all you get is a blank screen.So when I find it absolutely necessary to look at a graph, table or image, I open the same magazine in the Kindle Fire, which has no trouble displaying any image, tabulation or graph.The Kindle Fire is also a tablet.  Young people will like it for this reason.  You can do many of the things you do on a laptop, such as write documents and send emails.  I read my email in the morning, and look at the weather forecast, before turning on my computer.  But I do not do complicated work on it.Movies are a joy on this machine.  Netflix (the movies which are streamed) and Amazon's Prime videos come through flawlessly.  I find the speakers of the Kindle Fire adequate for most movies.The main problem, aside from the fact that the Kindle Fire is useless in bright light and irritating when reading long texts, is that it is heavy when reading in certain positions.  I like to read lying on my back, but the Kindle Fire is too heavy to hold in front of my eyes for very long (I have the larger 8.6 inch display).So I bought a stand to support it (\"LEVO Deluxe iPad Floor Stand for all iPads Galaxy Xoom Nook and Other eBooks and Tablets\").  You can attach any eBook to this stand.  I often fix the Kindle Fire to the stand, which has a long arm which can position the device at any point in space.  I lie on my back in bed at night and watch movies.  I use the same stand for reading on my Kindle Paperwhite.  You cannot use the stand to read a paper book, because there is no mechanism for turning the pages.  But with an eBook you can swipe the screen to turn a page.There is something very decadent in all this.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I use it every day....all day long", "Author": "Pepper", "ReviewID": "R33H9ZSNMCJR5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so pleased with this item.

I have purchased 5 for myself and at least 6 for friends and family.  I like this product.  I also own two iPads and still think KINDLES are amazing.  With that said, after I purchased the Kindle listed above, I found I had some 'issues' that I didn't have with any of the others.1) The charging port (I am not terribly computer literate, so forgive me if I use the wrong terms...) is on the left side of the KINDLE.  It makes it difficult if you want to use the KINDLE while it's charging because you can't open the cover easily.  And, if it's closed when you start charging, you can't open the cover completely because it gets caught up on the cord.  The charging port is comfortably on the bottom of all my other KINDLES.2) The camera takes a picture facing you with no way to turn it out.  If I want to take a picture looking at something, I have to maneuver myself so that I'm twisted around looking at the screen so I can see if I'm taking the picture I want or simply aim and shoot and hope I get the picture I want.  The pictures are beautiful.  The configuration to take a picture, no so great.  I use my iPad to take tablet pictures.3) The power button on the bottom of the Kindle is narrow and close to the body of the KINDLE so it's hard to press and I'm never sure if I pressed it correctly.  (This is unlike the other KINDLES that have a nice little round button that you can feel comfortably and can tell when you press it.)  Unfortunately I have spent too much time pressing, waiting, pressing, waiting, pressing, waiting until the screen lights up.  I like the little easy to feel, easy to press buttons.  I also have some nerve damage in my fingers which make turning on the KINDLE a little more difficult.4)  The 4G LTE 'function'???  I thought this would make it possible to pick up the internet in locations where you can't get Wi-Fi, like you can get cell phones.  So far, not so much.  I've been disappointed.  I can see the bars (or icon) lit up indicating I have the 4G LTE service available, I think, but can't get the internet or anything else that I can't get on any of the other KINDLES.  Also, I'm paying a monthly fee for the service and don't think I'm getting my money's worth.  I probably won't continue this service when my current contract expires.  Note:  I am virtually ignorant regarding the 4G LTE world so I may simply not understand what it is, what it does and how to use it.  I'll give you that, so this comment may simply be exposing my ignorance.  But that's okay.  I'm fairly certain there are others of us out there who don't understand this stuff.  \"Hi to you all!\"I believe those are my 'issues'.  I am still sold on the KINDLE products and have continued to buy KINDLES for friends since I purchased this one.  I will continue to be an exuberant customer and talk up the product to everyone, but, the most expensive, fanciest one turns out to be the one I like least.Still, BUY A KINDLE, THEY'RE THE BEST!!!  You can't get a better quality or cost efficient product of this type anywhere.  Oh yeah, and your customer service is the GREATEST.  You can actually understand the folks who man your phones.

Instead of a general review (of which there are already too many to read) I am posting some specific comments on the micro HDMI port.The FireHD has a micro USB not a mini USB port. I think the micro tends to be used more by tablets and smartphones and the mini tends to be used more by cameras and videocams.The micro HDMI port on the Kindle Fire HD does not deliver audio, it delivers high definition video only I don't know whether this is a limitation of the micro HDMI specification but in any case Amazon has elected to crippl the FireHD HDMI capability to video only. Like so many limitations it is probably related to \"protecting\" digital content \"property rights.\" Amazon has never claimed that the micro HDMI port delivers audio but you sure have to dig deep to find this out...Amazon markets the HDMI capability of the Fire HD 8.9\" to gamers and movie watchers and says nothing about its value for other uses.  One nice feature of Kindle Fire HD's HDMI implementation is that it does deliver the text of Kindle books to a large screen; at least it does on my setup. Before I bought my Fire HD 8.9\" I called Amazon Kindle support to specifically ask about this and after some earnest fumbling about they said it probably does not. Lo and behold, when my Fire HD 8.9\" arrived I found that it does. This was a very nice surprise as one of my main uses for My Fire HD is \"immersion reading\" and it's great to \"follow the bouncing ball\" on a large screen  When I'm doing this I rely on either bluetoth or the headphone jack (analog out) to hear the \"professional narration.\"", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Made for Amazon Prime", "Author": "Daniel M.

It's little life support system stopped working, and the power just wouldn't flow into it.

I like the size, thickness and  graphics, but mostly bought this for the larger screen.  I am indifferent about the screensaver ads and the endless recommendations I get with my existing apps, since these apparently allowed me to buy at a discount (advertised as \"Special Offers\").  I see no difference in the upgraded Wi-Fi (the signal dead spots in my house are the same in either model) and the sound (other than a bit more volume).The three things that ARE problematic are the power/volume buttons, the power/HDMI connections and the magnetic on/off switch.1.  The power and volume buttons are located next to each other on one side of the case.  This is more a first world problem, but when using manually turning the device off, it is common to change the volume instead, and if you are manually changing the volume, you can easily turn off the device.  I would have stayed with a software volume control only, like the original.2.  While the display rotates to adjust to the position of the the device, there is still a default position.  For apps like Netflix, this means that the device has to be in the horizontal with the power and hdmi connections at the bottom.  When using a case or propping it up for viewing, this means that you can't have the power or HDMI connected without raising the device up a few inches. I would have run these from the side (like the original) or out the top.  When running multimedia like video, the power doesn't last long enough for a full movie, so a power connection is a must.3.  I bought a case to protect my Kindle since I tend to be hard on my electronics.  There are magnets in the cover that turns the Kindle off when closing.  This is a nice feature with one drawback.  When using the Kindle, I fold the front cover to the back, but since the device is so thin, the magnets turn the Kindle off from the back.  I find myself removing the case more often than not to avoid this.  Since the case is from a secondary vendor, I can't say this is a consistent problem.An additional issue is that some apps I bought for the old Kindle are not compatible with the new one.  I bought Monopoly and Dungeon Hunter 2, to find that they supposedly don't work with the HD version.  There may be others I haven't looked for yet, but this is maddening in that these apps should at least be patched or upgraded, since they are Android tablet apps.  If the rate of app obsolescence is going to be this high with every upgrade, I would advise anyone to be VERY picky about their app purchases from Amazon.One last item is the speakers, which reside somewhat on the sides and wrap to the back.  I found that by cupping the speakers to direct the sound to the front during use improves the volume and quality tremendously.  This isn't possible when using a case.  I assume the position of the speakers is for better sound distribution, specifically when using as a radio or MP3 player, but for movies and games it sucks.I have already given my old Kindle to my daughter, so I can't go back.

Have had my Kindle for about three weeks now. I am accustomed to Android Smartphones and therefore Google Play. As mentioned in many of the other reviews, the world of Kindle does not include Google Play. But every app I use, or a similiar version of the app, can be found in the Amazon App store and 1 Mobile Market. And by the way, OfficeSuite and ES File Manager work with Google Drive. Other apps like X-Plore require a Google account, and some apps have partial functionality without the Google account. Also, the onboard Silk web browser does not support Flash. But nowadays many browsers don't. The Dolphin browser supports Flash and works great with my Kindle. I use the Dolphin browser most of the time. Learned this from my experiences with the Droid 2 and 4. My Kindle is protected with the Manvex cover. I am typing this review using the KT-1167 keyboard, and I use a capacitive stylus. If you have thick fingers the stylus will be used often. Still looking for a separate bluetooth mouse. Really don't want to use a trackpad that is part of a keyboard. I have made my investment into the world of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and so far I am not disappointed. Right price, right size screen, good audio quality.

I waited over a week to do this review because I didn't want it to be compromised due to my overall excitement. I was tied between a kindle fire HD and an iPad mini. After doing some research and making my pro/con list, kindle won due to its affordable price, I even got the 32GB. I am a huge fan of amazon and already own a kindle keyboard. Not really a fan of apple, the only apple product I own is an iPod touch that I got over 4 years ago.The display of the kindle fire HD is AH-MAZING. I was blown away at the crisp display. It makes everything look good, even the font! I find myself watching movies/shows on it rather than my 46 inch screen TV because I am just mesmerized by the display. There are plenty of apps. Since I don't own many apple products I don't have anything else to compare the apps too, but I am satisfied with what is given. Reading on the kindle fire is amazing as well, I am an avid reader so this is a huge plus. Upgrading from the kindle keyboard to the fire's back light did take some adjusting but after a day or two of reading I was comfortable with it. It has pretty cool features too such as seeing how much of the book is left displayed on the bottom of the screen and it also states up many more minutes till the next chapter! As well as some other new kinks. The speakers are nice and clear, although I wish they were a bit louder, I understand it's not suppose to be a stereo but slighter volume would of been a plus. The web experience is very nice, but it does lack flash. I heard there is a way around that, but it doesn't bother me (yet). Since I got the kindle (about 8 days ago) the web page crashed only once and that's because I had a lot of things going on at once (7+ pages open + pandora)...They don't include a charger in the package which I think was a HUGE mistake on amazons part. The Amazon Kindle Power Fast adapter is a NECESSITY unless you want to wait 16+ hours to get your kindle charged. I used my other kindle adapter and only had it changed at 50% after 9 hours and drained to 15% after two hours of use. The very next day I went and got this charger, now it takes 6-7 hours for a full charge and the charge can last an entire day to two days depending on what you are using the kindle for.Since I got the kindle fire HD I also signed up for amazon prime to get the full experience. There are plenty of free shows and movies to watch!

I use it as my portable computer.  I take it with me into the kitchen and I can listen or watch various webinars or other programs I subscribe to. I hook it up to a speaker system in order to hear it better, although the speakers in the Kindle are much better than the ones in my Kindle Fire.I use it to check my email, and I can also easily respond to my email because I bought the Belkin Keyboard and Case, so it's much easier to type on it than with the virtual keyboard.One thing I DON'T like is that it isn't designed to be able to use Flash, and I use that a lot to access the videos in the webinars.  I was finally able to access Flash using a work-around. I had to go to YouTube to find out how!  I ended up downloading Dolphin as my browser so I could download Flash. I now have it and it works great, but it sure seems like it should have been integrated into the Kindle from the beginning.I love the portability of the Kindle, especially since I use it as a computer much of the time.I also love that this model includes the text to voice feature, so I can have my books read to me while I'm working in the kitchen or driving.It's easy to use, and easy to get around. I find it quite intuitive.  I wish there were better instructions that came with it, but I was able to download a Kindle book of instructions for a small price -- about $2.99 I think. That was helpful.As I said in the beginning, I still use my other Kindle for some of my reading just because the smaller size is easier to hold.

To me it's like buying a record player that will only play one label's records. Here's why Amazon won me over:- I can sideload apps. Barnes and Noble forced my switch from a Nook Tablet to the Kindle Fire when they updated their device to block sideloaded apps. I hate being chained against my will to a company's logo, and being told what I can do with my own tablet. If you've invested in a library for the Nook, you can read those books on your Fire via the Nook app. Most other apps I've tried that for whatever reason are not in the Amazon app store seem to run fine.- I can sideload legally purchased content I ripped/stripped myself, and it's easy. If you're up for learning how, you can find a way to get all your existing content onto the Fire, with covers that show on your shelf, etc.- Amazon is simply the best online bookstore. If you have Prime, with all the accompanying perks, you'll be very happy with Amazon's content on other fronts. And with free shipping you can save a lot of money on ordinary purchases.- The performance of the Kindle Fire hardware is excellent. Lightweight, looks great, sounds great, very responsive.The only reason I gave the device four stars instead of five is the interface.

I wanted to get her a tablet that had a great HD screen, was easy to use and wasn\u2019t too expensive. My mom is not tech savvy so I thought getting her a higher-end more competitive tablet (ipad, surface, etc.) would be a waste because she wouldn\u2019t use it to its potential.She absolutely loves it!!! I spent time setting it up and helped her understand how to use it. This does not come with a paper manual, but it has a quick tutorial when you start it up and there is a manual on the tablet if you need one to use.`The Short Answer:Yes, I would recommend this tablet to someone who is:a.New to tabletsb.Someone who is not tech savvyc.Someone who wants an excellent eReaderd.Someone who casually uses computers and would like to have a tabletDon\u2019t get this tablet if you must have the latest and greatest in apps (the app store is limited & no Google play store) or you want an android tablet that you can customize to your own preference.I would also let someone know while recommending this tablet that it does NOT come with the wall charger only the USB chord to connect to a computer to charge and the charging time can be a long time. But if you want to wait and see if you must have it or need it I have seen them for sale at the big box stores that sell kindles (I saw it for sure at office depot and at best buy), so if you don\u2019t get it, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to get it should you decide it\u2019s something you need.Also, it comes with ads that show on it and you can remove them for an extra $15 either at the point of sale or later. Since this was a gift, I left the ads on there (as I understand some people don\u2019t mind them while others are very against them) but I did include an amazon gift card so if my mom wanted to remove them she wouldn\u2019t have to spend her own money.How I decided on this tablet:I did some research online \u2013 the biggest selling point was the screen. I figured that my mom would use it more to read books and watch movies & TV shows, she may play some games from the app store but nothing too complex.The next thing I did was go and find one to try out at a major box store. I watched some movie trailers and played some games, went through the demo, read some paragraphs got on the internet and it was wonderful for what it would be used for. I wanted to get a good idea of how it would function and run so that when my Mom got hers and we fired it up I would know if it was working fine or not.I cannot stress \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d enough.  If you aren\u2019t sure or do not have any experience with tablets go to the store and try them out! If you have questions, ask \u2013 even though this isn\u2019t as expensive as some other tablets, it is still a major purchase and you want to make sure you make the correct decision.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "love hate relationship", "Author": "Michael Gray", "ReviewID": "R1GBS49WBBUQ5R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this for Christmas and wanted to wait 6 months before reviewing. Not so sure we will make it that long, so here goes.When everything works properly I love this pad. Just the right size, great sound and good color.Battery life is OK some of the time but can be inconsistent. That is the first problem. I have gone to bed without charging, as I thought there was plenty of power left, just to wake up to a dead unit. Charges pretty quick, but I like to be able to use it first thing when I get up.The second major problem is the browser. It constantly tells me tabs are not responding and offers to restart them. Most of the time there appears to be no problem with what I am viewing, but the notification pops right up in the middle of the page blocking what I am reading. Sometimes this will happen several times while attempting to read a single paragraph of text.Finally the pad will sometimes just freeze. This mostly again seems to be related to Silk when using the browser directly or when redirected by some apps. Keep in mind also that there are limited apps available and many do not seem well developed to work with the Kindle Fire or it's browser.In the last month or so all of these problems seem to be getting worse so that is why I thought it wise to review at this time. We still have some good days but the devices performance is just too inconsistent to warrant more than 2 stars.Update 7/31/13After writing my review I was contacted by Amazon customer service. They had some suggestions and talked me through them. They said they would call back in a few days. They never called back. What they had me do wiped all my data from Silk. Their suggestion to turn the device off to save battery just makes the pad less convenient to pick up and use and has done nothing to improve battery drain in use or efficiency in charging. The final problem has been that frequently when using Silk the pad will just reboot.Now the good news. Did a little online research and found that some Google apps can be side loaded. I now have Google Chrome for my browser and the Maps app. I'm not a big fan of Chrome but it does sync with Chrome on my PC and android phone. The pad no longer reboots for no reason. Still get an occasional freeze but rarely.I would consider adding a star if I had not been required to fix all this myself. Also the battery problem has not improved much. I am trying the new battery saver app for Kindle but so far I don't think it's doing much. I'm also using the new Mobile Desktop app and love it. You still have to go through the carousel to get to it but from there it's great.If this thing makes it to a year I might add a star yet. If Amazon would admit they have problems and make efforts to correct them they could get another star for sure.

I was amazed at how easy it is to type on my iPad vs the Kindle. I'm a writer and was hoping to use it for stories and journaling, but that won't work for me. (This is my experience). The bar with matching words or similar words that pops up causes all words typed to be underlined... this also prevents the space bar from registering sometimes, which is a real handicap for a fast writer.The unit also \"sometimes\" won't load content.

I use my Kindle as my primary reading source and the old chapter navigation was driving me bonkers - especially when reading a reference book where jumping around is pretty useful.I have a tablet PC, but it's not easy to access your books and videos from Amazon that way.  I am a software developer and very comfortable with computers, but nobody wants to see that you need to update something before you can sit down and read a book or watch a video.  Still, I really didn't think I'd be using the Fire for anything but books because I had my tablet.Wrong.  I use my Fire all the time.  For books, videos, games, surfing the web before bed.  Love it so much.Highlights for me:- Navigation on the device itself (between books, videos, games, etc) is very intuitive and easy.  You can move through the categories or choose something from the list of recently accessed items.  Very user friendly interface to learn and re-use.- The chapter navigation in all of the books I have tried is improved immensely.  It makes using my Fire for reference books easy.  And when I forget what happened a couple of chapters ago in a novel, skipping back very quickly to remind myself is easy.- Streaming videos from Amazon Prime in bed with headphones while my husband is asleep lets me catch up on \"Me TV\" without waking the baby in the next room or him.- Swype on the onscreen keyboard.  Typing on any smartphone/tablet style device without Swype is just plain silly.  Swype makes it so fast and so easy.  Love Swype.  Love, love, love Swype.- Web surfing anywhere in the house just got a lot easier.  My tablet gets hot and it feels less portable/more breakable for some reason.  If I just want to surf, the Fire is ready, willing, portable and fast!Cons (so far):- Sometimes the browser gets stuck and has to be closed and reopened.- Amazon should really include the AC adapter for what they call \"fast\" charging and what I call \"normal\" charging.  It's only $10, but it's just silly it isn't standard equipment.- I wish the headphone jack and mini USB port were easier to find in the dark.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple Who?", "Author": "Harperblue", "ReviewID": "R2JBZ5YVGEJCVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire provides everything I need in a tablet and then some.

I was able to get a lot of free apps that made it easy to go online and could easily get my email from various email addresses.  Then they came out with the kindle 8.9 inch hd.  I decided to upgrade to this unit as I had a little problem reading somethings on the 7\".  This new upgrade is fabulous!!  The resolution is as terrific as Amazon is claiming it is.  The dual antennas were a great idea.  I have wireless N in my home and was able to get 63 mbs with the original Kindle Fire and that was pretty good, just a little longer bringing up a web page, but now with this kindlle with dual antennas, I am now getting 117 and often times 130 mbs.!!!!!  Everything works faster, the upgraded processor is a plus.  I could not see paying $500 plus to get a tablet from Apple when you can get such a great one from Amazon for $200 less.  It was great that all the books and and apps that I had downloaded for my other kindle fire were available so easily from the cloud.  Amazon made it very easy to watch videos on the new kindle if you have amazon prime.  I decided to try it last November and so far the service has been terrific, it really is 2 day delivery, around the holidays it may have been a day more but that is understandable for that time of year.  The only downside I see to it is that a few apps that are available in google play are not yet available on the fire.  I'm hoping more of them will be available in the future.  The videos run very well, by that I mean Amazon instant video and Netflix.

For example, I have had to \"bother\" Amazon tech support to get their very stupid auto-correct turned off. At first I couldn't even figure out why everything I typed was being morphed into something unintelligible. Then I noticed... you will realize that I am older, have come into the age of computers from the days of kerosene lanterns and outhouses. Well, in that I am not the Lone Ranger.If I had hours to read online instructions, I might have found how to fix that problem without bothering Amazon techs, but I don't have those hours. Again, I am not the Lone Ranger in that.I did manage to get my email set up by myself but cannot access my drafts folders on the Kindle. Tech told me they are working on that issue. Hope so; otherwise I can't do needed work from the Kindle. One-click payment as set up on the Kindle is not satisfactory as it does not show the total at check-out. Turns out you have to use your regular computer to turn that off. 'Nother call to tech support. There is no way to turn on video subtitles. Tech support told me I need to download an \"app\" for that but was unable to tell me which one would provide subtitle capability and whether it would be free. I use subtitles even to understand British English as across-the-pond actors so often swallow their words.But here's the thing: This device is absolutely fabulous despite these frustrations. And Amazon appears to be constantly working to improve it and claims to be listening to customer feedback. I suspect they really are. So I will take the extra time to communicate. And Amazon's tech support is the best ever!!! That alone ensures my continued existence as an enthusiastic Amazon money-spender.The picture is To Die For. Sound is crappy (of course - what can you expect?) but I use headphones - easy enough and then really, really good. Features are amazing for the money. I especially like the new Amazon \"Auto-Rip\" feature that has delivered both music and video without me asking or having to figure out how. If content gets too large for existing memory (inability to do later memory upgrades is unwise engineering decision, IMO), I can simply delete because it still exists in this unseen Cloud.

The camera worked very well with the Skype application and I was able to visit with my husband and little dog while away. The video and sound quality was excellent. I loaded up the tablet with a book from the Amazon Lending Library and read the book very comfortably with the larger screen. My old lady eyes did OK with the smaller Kindle Fire, but I definitely needed the larger screen for a more comfortable read.  I also downloaded my latest audible.com book in the device and enjoyed excellent sound.  AND THE WIFI!!  WOW! Very powerful and easily picked up and logged me on to WiFis in airports, train stations, hotel rooms, friends' homes, etc.  The WiFi signal was strong and reliable. Quick downloads, easy Email access and the TuneIn Radio app worked great to pick up interesting local stations as well as my international favorites. Not only was I able to access the stations, my Dolby speakers gave me a rich, vibrant sound. I also loaded the device with favorite photos, knitting patterns, videos of our grandchildren and important .pdf documents.  Everything looked gorgeous, especially the grandchildren.  :))  Well I could go on and on but I think you get the idea.

I was considering an iPad, but I'm so tied to Amazon with my music, shopping, videos, and books (both e-books and audible books), that I really didn't want to pay more money for a product that would not do everything as easily as my Kindle Fire.  Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problems with Apple, in fact, I have an iPhone 5 and love it as a phone.  I just really love the functionality of the Kindle Fire and how seamlessly it integrated all the services I use from Amazon.  I turned it on and all my libraries were there.  My kindle books and my audiobooks were instantly available and easy to get to.  It really lets me take full advantage of my Amazon Prime membership.

The screen is of a high enough resolution that the text is easy to read and is an improvement over most computer screens.As a student I have to read a lot of pdf's.

First let me say that I am not considered a  \" tech savy \" person, so please consider this review as from an ordinary lay person who LIKES technological devices.You can be sure that the Kindle Fire HD is not a device that you'll need a lot of technical expertise to operate. It is very straight forward and the options are easy to understand. At this point I have owned at one time or another a Kindle, I have a Droid smart phone and my husband has an I Pad from work, so I also have had a chance to compare the I Pad with the Kindle Fire.  The Ipad devices do have larger displays than the Fire HD, but the crispness of the images on the Fire is every bit as good as the Ipad. If you regularly shop on Amazon , the Kindle Fire excels in being integrated with the Amazon store with the options of getting videos and audio very easily. From what I saw and experimented with on my husband's Ipad, there is no such easy integration on the Ipad.I know that the IPad is one of the most highly regarded tablets on the market,but I have to say that the price difference PLUS the easy integration with Amazon's huge library of content makes it a strong competitor and for me the price difference plus the easy integration with Amazon was the deciding factor for me and this was BEFORE I bought the device. Since I have had it in my possession, I can only say I have absolutely NO regrets!Also I find it easy to find great apps. The Android operating system allows you to install any app you want. The Amazon app store is the default app provider for the Kindle Fire, but if you want to get something else, you can manage, it takes a bit of doing to accomplish this though.I am also a prime member and this has made it a breeze to watch many videos and movies for free that you would have to rent if not a member. The Cloud feature  is also a great feature because for Amazon content, the cloud storage quota is unlimited!I would say that in the entertainment category, this device is phenomenal. You will be able to download and access many types of entertainment, such as music, books, videos, apps, the web, Docs, the newsstand etc etc. I could go on and on about this and the more I learn, the more I am so glad that I decided to get this device.I would recomment to download the Kindle Fire HD manual, especially if you are not used to an android device. This manual has been updated for the Kindle Fire HD and even if there is a bit of difference in locating the options, it will be easy to figure out. Another good reference is \" Help Me! Guide to the Kindle Fire HD: Charles Huges\" . They both have a wealth of practical information. I downloaded these two to my Kindle Touch, so I could follow the directions when they were side by side and not have to flip back all the time.As far as any cons:1.  The power button seems a bit awkward in the portrait position because if you are holding the device with both hands, it is  easy for your hand to hit the power button. It might be better to have that button closer to the left of the volume button.2.  The directions for the web searches seem somewhat cumbersome  but once you go through the instructions, it gets better.I might have to update this review later on, since I have only had the Kindle Fire HD for a little while. I am going through the two manuals page by page and learning a lot. So far I am very impressed with what this device is capable of. That said, my husband loves his Ipad, but he uses it mostly for his work and does not deal with Amazon as much as I do.

I've been very pleased with it, and even though I suffered from major envy when the HD came out, I figured I would hold onto my Fire for at least another year.  But when the 8.9\" HD was a lightning deal for $50 off, I just couldn't resist.  And I'm very pleased I gave in.The HD is a vast improvement over the original Fire, beginning most notably with the picture.  When I compare the two side by side, it's clear that Amazon put a lot of focus into picture quality this time around.  Watching video is a much better experience, and the larger screen doesn't hurt.  Sound quality has noticeably improved, as well.Battery life, one of my complaints with the original Fire, seems improved.  This will never be perfect, and Amazon does not help matters by forcing us to pay for a separate charger. OK - grumbling over.I'm not big on apps, although I do check out the free \"App of the Day,\" and I've obtained some fun and/or useful apps at no cost.  I'd recommend checking this out every day to see if there is a free app that appeals to you.  I've also loaded up on lots of free e-books, the vast majority of which I assume I will never read.  Of the ones I have read, however, there is a huge range in quality.  A lot are, frankly, terrible, but there are some gems to be found.  I also have Prime, and while the free movies and TV shows are not as numerous as Netflix, there are plenty of good options, and they look great in HD.Finally, I'd like to recommend an inexpensive, quality case: Blurex Slim Case for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 -- With Built in Multi-Angle Stand.

After giving the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 a try, I discovered that it had many of the same features I was looking for, but wasn\u2019t going to break the bank.I\u2019ve had the Kindle now for a few weeks, and I\u2019m certainly not disappointed.  It has an absolutely gorgeous screen.  Pictures and especially HD movies or TV shows look spectacular!  The sound quality is also pretty good too \u2013 stereo sound!  I never thought I would use the device to watch so many movies and TV shows as I do; I planned to use it more for reading, but find myself glued to watching HD movies on it more times than not.Reading is great to on this device.  All of my textbooks (via an online college) are available free with e-text, and the Kindle makes it easy to get my work and studying done on the go!  This was my main reason in pursuing a tablet in the first place, and the Kindle Fire works great as an e-reader (as well as a tablet.)If you are used to the look and feel of most android devices, this may not be the tablet for you.  Though it works on ICS android operating system, it has its own user interface that is pretty different from your typical android phone or tablet.  This was initially concerning to me, as I really like the standard android interface (widgets and all,) but I\u2019ve come to appreciate the work and beauty put into the design of the Kindle Fire interface.  For one, the Kindle Fire interface is very stable - I haven\u2019t crashed the Kindle once so far, but I\u2019ve crashed my other android devices plenty of times.Overall, I\u2019m very satisfied with this product.  It does all that I need it to do (and more.)  It does have a different feel than the typical android device, but it is a very fast and dependable tablet (at a very reasonable price.)", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "absolutely LOVE IT", "Author": "houle01", "ReviewID": "R3IDEKP24U4XMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best thing since sliced bread!! it is so easy to use and I can take it anywhere so I can read my books and magazines or play games check emails  I love it . thank you", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Christmas gift", "Author": "Mary Joyce Burger", "ReviewID": "R2P4LBFYOOUYJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is soooo much more than just a reader ...... my husband can't put it down .... and at a much nicer price than an iPad mini !", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dream Come True", "Author": "Greg Kahler", "ReviewID": "R3S2MF1GXUH14I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've figured out exactly why I LOVE my Kindle Fire so much.

I came into it knowing about the issues that most people write/complain about (charger, flash etc)-ScreenThe screen is all its cracked up to be. Colors are vibrant, text is crisp. Viewing web pages is a pleasure, as it watching videos or reading books.-SoundThe Sound is fine. No one will mistake your KF for a home theater system but it sounds fine and really, what else can you expect from a tablet.-DesignYes, the button placement could be better. The tablet was clearly geared to be held landscape because the buttons are on the short side, with the micro-USB on the long side. I would suggest putting the volume and power on different sides on the next generation and making them slightly bigger. That being said I can still work all of the functions with ease. As stated above the screen is excellent and the processor seems good enough.-InterfaceAs anyone who reads this should know, KF runs a customized Android (ICS) interface. I'm not too fond of the carousel but I can make it work. It would have been nice for Amazon to give us more options for the layout (ie no carousel, change the layout of the tabs or drop some).-AppsNo there is no google store. It's no surprise, Amazon makes no money on the hardware, so they need to be the one selling you apps. It doesn't have all the android apps that I want yet. I suspect it will eventually. To me, this feels like early android in that regard. I have side-loaded Dolphin, Flash and Youtube. I highly recommend the Dolphin browser. If you don't like Silk, google how to get Dolphin-Web browsingPages are rendered quickly and easily on Dolphin. I have reasonably fast internet and have seen no real difference between page loading on my laptop vs KFHD-TypingTyping by and large works fine. It is certainly not a physical keyboard but its a lot easier than typing on my android phone.-Overall-This is a solid 4 star tablet. If Amazon works on increasing available apps and working out the bugs I could give it an extra .25 star. Ditto for more customization. But in the last 2 weeks I can count on one hand the number of times I took out my laptop. That should tell you how well the KF is working out for me.BTW I would *not* pay to remove ads. The ones that appear on your homescreen, you can remove for free in settings. You can pay $15 to remove lockscreen ads but I don't mind them at all and sometimes you get free vouchers.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE, LOVE IT", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R2BJQ9LV3C9MQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not being to computer savey, I had my reservations but told myself I must try.

A replacement Kindle was sent out that Friday afternoon with a courtesy Saturday delivery.  I received the package before 10:30 A.M!Fast, excellent screen, great audio for its size. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a tablet that won't break the bank, but delivers great content.Compared to my Kindle Fire, I would say this is a great leap forward.  The HD movies are crisp and clear,and the HD audio really surprised me.  Setting up Wi-Fi was very easy, as was setting up my email accounts.

The latter is one of the major factors in wanting the Kindle, as Newsweek has stopped their print magazine and is now on-line only.

I own the original Fire 7\" as well, so I'm familiar with the product already.  I wasn't expecting an iPad, so I'm a bit less critical than many of the reviewers on here.What I like:- The screen is phenomenal.  Pics, videos, apps...all of them display clearly and crisply.  The best I've seen (and my wife has an iPad 4)- The updated carousel - I actually like the recommendations...helps me see what else is out there- Wi-Fi connected easily, and works great...thinking that most people are having issues with their service provider, not the Fire.- Ease of use- very intuitive...my kids picked it up in no time!- Cloud- I have a ton of music, and I can access it easily as long as I have wi-fi (which I do at work and home, so why pay for 4G?).- Overall speed- MUCH quicker and more responsive than the original Fire.- Prime - I don't know who wouldn't pay the $79 per year for this gem.  Between free shipping and free movies...it's a no brainer.- Size- I always felt the 7\" screen was just too small for anything besides reading.  The 8.9 is perfect for reading (love the new two-page layout), watching movies, playing games, typing...great job Amazon!What's Not-so-great:- Silk - After all the hoopla regarding speed with this browser setup, I'm still left unimpressed.  Hangs up often, lags, takes too long to get rolling.  It's not horrible (I remember dial-up), but just not what you'd expect with all the lingo thrown around.- Apps - Let me say that if an app is designed for the Fire HD, then it's amazing on this device.  However, even some of the simplest apps (Feedly, for one) have issues.  I know these can (and hopefully will) be resolved as more people move to these devices, but it is an issue nonetheless. And I'm still not sure of how I update an app...some of the technical aspects could be made simpler to go along with the overall ease of using this tablet.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the Fire.  I wasn't going to upgrade just yet, but when Amazon offered it @ a $50 discount, I figured \"why not?\" I don't regret the investment one bit.  If you go into this expecting an iPad, you'll be disappointed.  You get what you pay for with the iPad and Apple's ecosystem.  The Fire is designed to immerse you in Amazon, and if you're like me and buy your books and music there (it's cheaper btw), it's an amazing device.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the size!", "Author": "John S.

I ordered the 32 GB version to allow me to display all the bodies of work from photography, fine art to my own animations. The display is sharp and clear and the size is perfect. With all the high resolution art I placed on my Kindle plus my massive book collection, it has hardly mad a dent in my memory. All the other wonderful things packed into this device are just added attractions that make me grin with complete satisfaction every time I turn it on. No longer disturbing my wife to watch movies in the middle of the night, my headphones and netflix or reading a book in bed. How many ways can I say I love my Kindle HD 8.9  My only complaint is the camera. A camera that point only at me is useless, I'm not into video chat, but I am into photographing and would like to see a camera that is better than 1 mega pixel, low res. (10mp hi res.)

An affordable tablet with fabulous color, Dolby sound, and a reasonable price?  What was not to like.I wish I could say my excitement lasted once I got my hands on the device itself.  Unfortunately, that wasn't to be.The first device I received froze up time and again, but Amazon, true to their EXCELLENT customer service, sent me a replacement.  The replacement almost never freezes up.  So why don't I like it?  Keeping in mind the fact that this is one user's experience, here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:* The e-reader can't be beat.  A great visual experience and the almost seamless ability to purchase/borrow books.*  The Kindle Fire is first-class when it comes to downloading and watching videos, especially if you're an Amazon Prime member and have lots of free videos to choose from.*  The HD experience is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!*  Plenty of useful apps for download, many of them free.*  The size is really nice.Cons:*  Amazon Silk is herky-jerky at best.  Crashes frequently, even after reboot.  Links are often unresponsive.  Doesn't support Flash.*  Hate, hate, hate the carousel.  Cluttered and ungainly and pretty much useless.  Would much rather be able to put my favorite applications on the home screen.*  Actually, this brings us to one of my biggest gripes against the Kindle Fire HD, i.e., the lack of personalization options.  Amazon has pretty much locked you into their concept of usability ... and brother, it's not mine!*  The Dolby speakers ain't all they're cracked up to be.I guess my biggest problem with the Kindle Fire HD echoes a problem I have with Apple products, namely, the user doesn't seem to come first here.  The business plan comes first.  Selling stuff comes first.Basically, I would say if you're after a terrific e-reader and a device you can use to watch videos in glorious color, this would be a good choice.

First the positives though:Good:It's a somewhat cheap device for accessing the internet and amazon content.Bad:Basically everything else.1. Wi-fi connection speed in my home was awful... I could load webpages 4-5 times faster on my iPhone 5 and even my old iPhone 3GS. YouTube videos for the most part just wouldn't load. On every other device, iphones, ps3, ipad, etc... no problems in the same room.2. Touchscreen was having all sorts of problems. Typing was an exercise in futility at times. I'd press the same letter key dozens of times before it was recognized. And it seemed to not be an issue with one location on the screen... just generally unresponsive.3. The absolute worst is the content. Paying for a service like Prime, you'd think would be similar to Netflix since they are positioned as a competitor. It's nothing like Netflix. The available TV and Movie content (PAID content, mind you) is miserable. There is no use for getting prime unless you constantly read books. The worst thing is that they have a MASSIVE catalog of movies, but they have their own rental and purchase prices ON TOP of prime. Some of these go for as much as $20 for HD. That means there is no excuse for not improving the selection of Prime content. I really don't understand why they don't boost their prime content to make it more attractive and leave the new releases as pay per view.Conclusion:I think the best think about the whole situation is that Amazon really does have amazing return policies. That sounds like a backhanded comment, but really if you are interested in trying it out Amazon will give you 30 days to do whatever you want... even give you a trial of prime.

I had done A LOT of searching, reviewing, and comparing other tablets before purchasing this one. I finally decided that though the KF HD lacked the latest Android OS, and would be centered around the Amazon universe (no Google Play apps, etc) this would be a good beginner tablet. I wasn't wrong about the ease of use and I don't particularly mind not being able to download apps from other than Amazon, especially since everything appears in the Cloud and I can easily delete/retrieve apps at will.However, I was NOT prepared for all the problems I have had with the device since almost day one. I initially had issues with the device locking up all the time and the battery life seemed waaaay short for the time usage. I did my homework and learned to shut down the device by the hard/cold reset. Thought I was home free for a couple of days til the device would no longer charge at all even though there was nothing wrong with my charger. Spoke to customer service for the 3rd time and they sent out THEIR rapid charger because obviously mine was inferior (not her exact words, but that's the gist) I will admit that the tablet absolutely charged better and even performed better with the rapid charger. I was really starting to enjoy using the tablet and happily played games/read my books with little problems for almost 2 WHOLE weeks...until today.I was in the middle of playing a game when it suddenly froze. I had no choice but to shut it down via the hard reset. When I powered it back on, the load screen ran continuously. After an several hours of trying to resolve it on my own, I grudgingly called CS again. The guy was really nice and tried to remotely reset the device (or something to that effect) but when that failed, he offered to replace the device.I am REALLY hoping I simply had a DUD because there are several features i really liked about this tablet. 1.) the screen brightness is awesome for bright days - not so good for battery life but you can really see the screen well.2.) the auto-sleep sensor is awesome when using a case that supports it.3.) size is perfect for me due to poor vision, I felt the 7\" was too small and a 10\" was just too bulky 4.) the gorilla glass screen is really durable and sensitive to the touch. I had a screen protector but took it off when the stylus had too much drag for sketching/drawing. 5.) the carousel is nicer than I thought it would be, keeps the apps and books easily accessible with a simple flick of a finger.Time will tell if the replacement KF HD will perform better than my first one. I will be happy to change my rating! The only reason I didn't rate it lower to begin with is because I really enjoy the tablet when its working and customer service has been quite good, albeit a little stubborn at times.UPDATE July 2013: The replacement KF HD 8.9\" is performing MUCH better than my first one, therefore I will now give the device 4 stars. There are still some issues that prevent me from giving a 5 star rating.  For some weird reason, my carousel will randomly disappear and I am left with a black screen with the menus at the top. Luckily the menus are still there and I can simply  There really seems to be no rhyme or reason for this and in all fairness I haven't spoken to CS yet to see if there's a resolution. Another thing is there are often errors when I download apps from the app store and I end up having to redownload them. I don't know if this is a device issue for certain, but it is annoying.As an added note, I had the opportunity to play around with an Asus 10 \" tablet a few weeks ago and was jealous she could have an animated background that changed with the times of day!

I read comparisons between the Kindle, IPad and Nexus 7 for weeks and the bottom line is people i.e. reviewers like what they like and it doesn\u2019t take long when they are comparing the various devices to see if they are IPad, Nexus or Kindle fans.  You can compare processors, screen contrast, memory, etc. until you are blue in the face; I personally can\u2019t see anything in the way of speed, sound and display when using the Kindle that would cause me to switch to an IPad or Nexus.  I will say I\u2019m not a big fan of Apple; they seem to nickel and dime you to death and are rarely competitive when it comes to price.  I am an Prime Amazon consumer i.e. I buy everything under the sun from Amazon and like the idea that the Kindle is tailored for their website and products.  I like the idea that Amazon does offer the consumer books and magazines for FREE; if nothing else it is a great gesture from a retailer to a consumer.Last night I streamed a movie, surfed the web, listen to my music as well loaded roughly 5600 mp3 to the cloud last night (It took about 8 hours) so that I can have them at my finger tips with the Kindle.  The entire Kindle experience was satisfying.  Being a man that doesn\u2019t carry a purse, backpack, clutch or anything along those lines, I decided on the 8.9 inch version; the 7 inch wouldn\u2019t fit in my pants pocket, so what was the point in passing up a larger screen for roughly the same price as the 7 inch.  Women on the other hand carry a suitcase around daily so the 7 inch may be better, if you are considering portability.If you like one stop shopping the IPad and Kindle are what you are looking for.  If you want to be locked inside a room with only a front door and no key, I would say stick with Apple products and buy an IPad.  If you would like the option of a locked front door and an unlocked back door then I\u2019d say go with the Kindle and Amazon\u2019s products.  If you want a front and back door with a window and a key to lock and unlock both doors, then go with a Nexus; you will however have to find independent sites to buy your movies, music, books, magazines, etc.  Personally, I don\u2019t have the time or desire to go from site to site trying to find media and audio content for my entertainment device.Lastly, I own 3 PCs, 1 Netbook, 1 Apple Mini computer, 1 Barnes and Noble Nook,  a Kindle DX and now the Kindle Fire.  I believe in buying the right tool for the job.  If I wanted the fastest CPU and was doing serious multitasking on the go, I would buy a notebook computer, not a tablet that is designed for pure entertainment which both the IPad and Kindle are really design to accommodate.

As far as getting on the internet it is easy and is very fast.  I love to watch netflix movies on it and it has great picture and sound.  Skyping is great.  Downloading apps from the android market is quick and easy.  Love reading books on my kindle.If you are looking to buy one that plays all those facebook games, might as well spend the extra $$ to get an ipad so you can do that.Seems to freeze up more times than what seems normal.  Not sure if this is just mine or something that happens to all of them.

Rhodes", "ReviewID": "R1L32CWT9OXCFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over the years technology has changed so much.  And so quickly.  I still remember when the first Kindle came out and pretty much changed the world.  It was a revolution for book readers.  And then other things happened.  The release of the iPad, for instance, which caused everyone to jump up and make a tablet.  Now there are so many to choose from that when I considered buying a tablet I wasn't sure what to go with.  In the end I went with the Kindle Fire HD.  The price was good and I've been a part of the Amazon community for years on end.  I haven't been disappointed in my purchase one bit.  There are a couple of small gripes that add up, but nothing much.I won't spend much time talking about the technical specs of the Kindle Fire HD.  I have the 16GB one that's 8.9 inches.  It comes with a USB cord, but doesn't come with one of those actual chargers.  This isn't too bad, because if you already have a smart phone that charger will suffice, but if you don't have a charger already it's kind of silly that you get the cord but not the charger itself and you immediately need to pay $20 on top of this.Setting up your kindle is pretty simple.  If you've already got an Amazon account you can connect to that easily.  If you are not an Amazon Prime member you can start a free trial.  If you have a Kindle, however, I urge you become a part of Amazon Prime.  It'll be a good decision in the long run.  It not only gives you some pretty decent shipping prices, but for people who own a Kindle Fire you'll be able to have access to a few things you wouldn't otherwise, such as television shows on the IMDB.  Or you can \"borrow\" books for free from the Amazon Library for as long as you want without having to pay a dime.  If you have a kindle, you might as well get prime on top of it.  It's not bad for a years time.The tablet itself is extremely light and feels pretty nice and sleek.  There are two speakers on the back near the bottom that give off some good sound, but you can always plug in head phones or a speaker if you want.  There is also a camera that should be at the top if you hold it for a landscape view, and on the left if you're holding it like a book.  The orientation will adjust automatically (though you can lock the orientation if you so choose to), but some applications and games will have a preset orientation you cannot change.  Likewise, I would highly suggest a case and a screen protector for your Kindle fire HD immediately.  It's light and simple.  Perfect for on the go stuff.  All the more reason to have a case.  And if you're going to constantly be having your fingers on it a screen protector will do nice so that the screen doesn't smudge.The display itself is pretty crisp.  Everything being displayed in fine HD.  You can adjust the brightness in the settings menu if you want just about any time you want with a pretty easy interface of a menu.  Even if you're in the middle of an app or a book you can access the settings by sliding your finger (or stylus, as I prefer to use) down from the top and it allows quick access to things like your settings, notifications wi-fi access, etc.  The user interface of the Kindle Fire HD is pretty easy stuff.  And no matter where you are it's easy to return to the home menu at any time.Any time you leave a program, app or book, it will be on display in your \"carousal\" which allows you to go through every item.  Recently downloaded items also appear here.  If your carousal gets too crowded you can always hold your finger (or stylus) on the item and select to remove it from the carousal.  You can also put it on your favorites for easier access.  The carousal is a good idea, but I've found that mine gets crowded a little too easy.  I use a lot of apps and read a lot of books and from time to time browse the web.  Every now and then my carousal gets too full and I have to go through removing stuff from it one by one by one.  There is no option to universally clear your carousal.There's Bluetooth and Wifi on the Kindle Fire HD.  I did not purchase the one with 4G so I can't tell you about that.  It's pretty easy to connect to the internet.  And it'll be able to store all kinds of wireless networks in its memory.  The only problem that I have is that the web browser itself is not that good.  More often than not when I'm surfing the web and read news stories or going to certain sites that no application exist for, I'll get a message that the browser has stopped working or that the tab I'm using has stopped working.  These messages are not infrequent in the slightest. I would highly recommend downloading a different browser as opposed to using the default browser.  Most other browsers are a lot better.Of course, one of the biggest tenants you're looking for is probably the apps.  And there are a lot of apps to choose from on the Kindle Fire HD.  Cheap as well as expensive.  The good news is that you can always get a sense of what you're in for because there are always reviews for each app.  They download fast (most of the time, if they're not too big).  There are 16GB of space available on my tablet (there is a 32GB one available, if you wish) and even that feels like a lot.  Apps and books are pretty small and take up nearly no space whatsoever.  In fact, most of the space on mine is occupied by the professional narration on some of the books I have.  Case in point, unless you're feeling like you'll download tons of movies or things which take up whole gigabytes of space, the 16GB hard drive is more than enough to satisfy.When you download movies they come up very crisp indeed, but I don't download a lot of movies to my tablet.  I use my Ultraviolet account a lot, but that uses the internet to stream from my collection (and a handy little application called Flixster for that).  It's the books I'm more interested in.  There are LOTS of classic literature books you can download for free.  When you download books you can add professional narration to them as well.  Sometimes it's free and sometimes it isn't.  It's more or less like putting an audiobook version to your standard book.  Most times the professional narration is unabridged.  I've yet to find an abridged one.  For some books there is still an option to tap to hear text read aloud, but since it's not the \"professional\" narration it's just a robotic voice that really drones on (and it's boring... very boring).  So if you feel the need to listen to your books, the professional narration is pretty amazing.  If you feel like reading, however, you can adjust the settings by changing the background, font size and even the font itself.  But the best feature is the ability to \"X-Ray\" the book.  You can see certain terms used a lot and how often.  You can read about certain things that other kindle users highlighted.  But you can go deeper and read about the author himself or herself.  You can look up terms and locations.  You'll instantly be taken to the web if you see something you may not know about and you're curious to learn.  It's overall pretty handy to X-Ray a book.  You can also make as many notes as you like on your book.When you're finished with a book (or when you X-Ray) it always offers suggestions of where to go from there or what to read next.  It's always offering suggestions and you can always find reviews if you like to help you out.You can use that USB cord to connect your Kindle Fire HD to your computer at any time and put documents from your computer or even a few other things if you desire.  Sometimes this is pretty nice.  I was able to transfer documents to my Kindle from my laptop pretty easily.  This includes music and movies if you want them.  And the Kindle can read quite a few formats.There are a few things that can be urksome about the Kindle Fire.  Some are little and some are bigger problems.  The first is that it isn't easy to access the files.  Unless you download an outside app for that.  You can get into the basic stuff like your music, books and movies.  But if you want to go just a little deeper you have to download an outside app for that.  Likewise, it's difficult to move things from one folder to another.  If you put a document on your Kindle Fire and it automatically puts it in the books (I'm not sure why mine did this) it's not easy to move it over without going onto your laptop to do so, or downloading a document manager app of sorts.  It just seems strange to me that management type options wouldn't be built into the Kindle itself from the get go.  Instead you need an app.  It's a free app, but why should I have to do this?Another strange problem I've run into is that my kindle, from time to time, freezes or just goes blank for no apparent reason.  Then it'll suddenly start rebooting.  I'm not sure what happens.  This doesn't happen often, but it happens often enough to be noticeable.  There were also times when it lagged so much that I wasn't sure if my clicking on certain links, apps or books was actually registering.  Come to find out that sometimes it registers just a little too late.  And other times it just so happens my Kindle has frozen on me and I have to shut it down and restart it.  Again, not too often, but often enough to be noticeable.  I have also run into times when it can't seem to seek out the wireless network in the area.  The solution is--you guessed it--I have to shut down and reboot the Kindle Fire HD (although for this little problem sometimes putting it in sleep mode and then bringing it out works just the same).  Like the other two issues, this doesn't happen often--but it happens often enough to be noticeable.Overall, though, I like my Kindle Fire HD a lot.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Not an iPad or a Nexus 7 or any other tablet.  The problems I've encountered aren't big enough and it's very possible that no one is experiencing some of the things I experience at all.  I've been enjoying my Kindle Fire because it's made a lot of my life simpler.  Particularly when I travel.  It's nice to have all my books in one place without having to have a bag full of six or seven when I'm out.  And I can also get magazine subscriptions and go to Youtube or whatever without hassle at all.  If you're looking for a nice, inexpensive tablet, then the Kindle Fire HD is a pretty good deal.  You'll end up having to splurge a few extra bucks for some much needed accessories (charger, case, screen protector and stylus are the ones I recommend most) but in the end it is definitely worth while to do so.  It's a solid tablet, and I give it a four.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ah yes!

After comparing most of the popular tablets, I was down to the iPad and the Fire 8.9 HD 4G. The iPad was a bit more expensive, and had more features and more apps, but the Kindle allows you access to a lot more free media if you get an Amazon Prime account, which we had planned to do anyway.(Honestly, if you want productivity and real-world WORK capability, like document production, etc., buy an iPad, or really, buy a laptop. The laptop will be cheaper.)The screen is bright,clear and the video and audio quality is very good. The touch screen can be a bit balky at times, though. I'd recommend buying a stylus. It is far smoother with that than with your finger.Make sure your hands are clean and not sweaty or greasy.The loading is fast...VERY fast if you have either a good WiFi signal, or are connected to 4G. Which is another issue. 4G is not always available...if you are on trips, driving, like we do, then you will find a lot of areas where you will find yourself hooked to 3G or Edge instead, which is much slower. Grrrr.Forget streaming video if you are on Edge. It's too slow. However, you CAN download content, and then play it back at your leisure...but some HD movies are larger than your memory, unless you have the 64Gb memory, so there's another issue.Also, you cannot play ANY Flash content, like, say, a lot of YouTube videos, and some commercial websites. This is not Amazon's fault. Adobe no longer supports ANY mobile devices, including phones or iPads.Don't worry...there is a work-around. You just download the ES File Explorer from the app store(which, believe me, you are going to want anyway. It's a super useful app.) and then you download the Dolphin web browser, and then (finally!) you can go get Flash Player 11 for mobile devices, which runs with Dolphin, but not Silk. (Silk is the web browser that comes with your Kindle.) Supposedly, in the future, this will not be an issue since most websites are supposed to be switching to HTML5.Bottom line: We pretty much like it. If we had it to do over, we'd still buy two more Kindle Fire's, in spite of the above noted glitches. It still has more upside than downside. The huge availability of media content of all types makes up for the shortcomings.

I typically have to look.Location of USB/HDMI - Really bad design and I can't believe no one caught this in development very annoying.On Screen Keyboard - The return key is often missing and it makes working with some apps difficult.Lacking Device to play through wireless? - Have not found a way to mirror this over wireless (like Apple TV).I found most apps I use on the iPad to be available either at the kindle store or via adding another app store.  My issues with the power button were mostly overcome by adding a case because now it comes back on automatically when I open the case so I only need to find the power button if I need to turn the device off completely(almost never).  My brother and I both bought the kindle at the same time and I love mine overall, but he was so annoyed about the issues with the on screen keyboard and the fact that twitter doesn't allow copy and paste in their andriod app that he will probably return his.

E-mail.  I am not sure if I am missing something, but I wish there was some kind of notification of when I get new e-mail.  The iPad beeps just like my computer.

I do own an original Kindle, which died 2 weeks ago.Well, that pushed me right over the edge. I determined in short order that the new 8.9\" form factor and HD screen moved this away from simple e-reader to tablet. Also, as I live in the boonies with just one broadband card for my desktop, plus I travel frequently for work, plus my addiction to the NY Times; I felt that 4G was a must. So I went all in, except I did stick with the 32GB memory.It arrived almost a week earlier than I'd been warned at the time of purchase and so far so good. It was a little cranky to get my subscriptions sorted out (NYT can only be \"bound\" to one device, and I had to get support to assist with that.)I did not realize it required an AT&T; plan at the time of purchase, I had assumed it was like my old Kindle with the WhisperNet thing. Still, the intro deal at $49.95 for 12 months is fair. When I see what it goes up to after that, I may scream bloody murder!! In any case, the AT&T; deal was easy to set up and works flawlessly.I think this thing is a winner. EMail is great, Silk works well and quickly, and of course there's the improved layout of NYT and other pubs over the text-only view on my old Kindle.

I was going to use it mainly for keeping books and documents on my device and as a medical study tool. I am an avid Google user, so naturally I was torn between the new Nexus 7 FDH and this. Because of an amazing deal that Amazon ordered I decided to go with the kindle. I was excited. Once I received my device, the hidden disappointments began to roll in. Carousel; is pointless and rather aggravating to use. It becomes an endless list that's annoying to continually delete programs from. My other disappointment is how shallow the app base is for the kindle. Very controlling; almost like Apple but without the massive app resources. I can't use Google chrome, google docs (side note: amazon does have their own versions of cloud storage, but I prefer the seamless browsing that google provides) or any google play apps or even Itunes apps; only amazon apps (mainly consisting of paid apps). The tablet is a beautify made and the screen is crisp and responsive. The real power of the kindle comes from the massive Amazon prime account. So if you're not into that, you're pretty much missing out on the true point of this tablet; a media devouring machine. This thing has potential, but Amazon put's limits of what could be an amazing device. Despite it's beautiful screen, the adds, the limited app store, the need to get an amazon prime account to get real use out of it, the useless Carousel option, the lack of support for google made it a no for me.

After much research, we decided on the Kindle Fire 8.9.I must say the picture quality is great on the device itself, however, I also purchased an HDMI cable to stream movies from Prime on the Kindle to our TV. This is where it breaks down. While the picture quality on the Kindle itself is great, the picture quality on our TV was horrible. The colors where way off and the picture was hazy. Almost like viewing a 3D movie without the glasses. We were hoping to use this feature when we travel, but it doesn't look like it now.Then there was the connecting the Kindle to my husbands PC to download files and pictures. It never could find the device driver to install, and therefore he is unable to connect and download anything. When he went to the help screen at Amazon, he notice that this is a very common problem. He tried some of the fixes, but nothing worked. He then started a chat with the technical support and that was a joke. After an hour, the tech support came to the conclusion that my Kindle was defective, even though many other customers were having the same problem. He then tried connecting to my computer and it connected right away. He advised the tech support person, and asked where he could get the device driver to download to his computer, since that seem to be the problem. The tech support response was that they don't make one since the Kindle doesn't need it....Really!!! So, now to download files from his computer, he has to download to a flash drive, upload to my computer, then download to the Kindle. Very cumbersome, but it's all we have, since Amazon doesn't have a workaround themselves.If you are only going to use the Kindle by itself, it is a great tablet, but beware of it's shortcomings, if you intend to use it for some other purpose.

I have owned several different versions of the Kindle and also the first Kindle Fire.  When I got the new 8.9 HD, I was so excitied.  First, it's beautiful!  Second, OMG the image is clear, crisp and so sharp.  The Kindle Fire HD is very easy to use with on screen instructions and tips.  It is very easy to connect to all of your social media including, facebook, twitter and my space.  You also have access to all of your yahoo, hotmail and gmail accounts.  The app store is not as robust as Google Play however there are some decent apps out there.I am a Prime member, so I have all of my books, music and movies on Amazon.  I really worried with this one how surfing the web would be as the last fire seemed to be rather cumbersome and slow.  The Fire HD is FAST!  I have a newer Dell laptop core i5 and this new Kindle Fire loads just as quick if not quicker in some instances than my laptop.I have spent about a week now with my new Fire HD and my love and awe continue.  I love being able to do everything online that I need to do, check my bank, check my school work, office work, shop, play games and facebook.  I really barely use my laptop these days unless I have to type something.  I do hope they come out with keyboard case for the Kindle Fire.Now on to Kindle Free time - I have a 5 year old who loves my Kindle.  I started up the free time for him and set up his profile.  We downloaded all of his apps and books and he clicks on his name to see just his stuff when he wants to use the Kindle.  I am rather disappointed that the books that I have ordered for him say text to speech is enabled but it only reads the credit of the books.  I was hoping that he would be able to read along with the stories.  Hope this gets fixed soon!Ipad vs. Kindle Fire HD - I also own and IPad.. and to be honest, I hate it.  It sits here and I never use it.  It's heavy and cold.  I really hate the metal feel in my hands and the price is ungodly.  The Ipad2 is also much slower than the Fire HD.  That being said I was very happy with the price for the Fire HD.  I opted to purchace the one without special ads.  I was really bothered that the Fire HD only comes with the cable for charging and not the actual wall charger.  You have to buy this seperatly for 19.99.So why the 4 star review and not 5 if I love it?  Well for one the fact that I have to pay for a charger.  This in my opinion is BS.  Two, we need more apps... and some of the apps that are out there just don't work, even after uninstalling and reinstalling (slotomania and scramble with friends).  There are also paid versions of the apps that I have on my Samsung Galaxy SIII that I would love to put on my Kindle Fire but that is sadly not available.

Due to a few issues, I gave it a four because it's not possible to give a half star, otherwise I would have given it a four and a half.I've had a first generation Fire since they came out, and loved it from the start. There are some great improvements on this new one that I really love, but there are also a few things that I think could be better.  First, the good:The screen really does look as gorgeous as Amazon promised. The first thing I did when I received it was go to videos and watch the trailer for the movie \"Brave\", and I must say, I was absolutely blown away at the incredibly beautiful quality of the screen.  It's amazing!  After watching more videos, I am still just as impressed - they look fabulous and run smoothly with no lag. I'm also extremely happy with how spectacular my magazines look.The sound is great, and hugely improved over the first generation Kindle Fire, which makes enjoying video and music all the better.I love the larger size of the 8.9\".  It makes the whole Kindle Fire experience even more enjoyable without being hard to handle.  Feels just right, nice and thin, and not heavy to hold.Processing speed is great, and so is Wifi speed.  Screen operation is very smooth, with scrolling much smoother than the first Kindle Fire.Very happy to have the camera to Skype on this Fire - I'll be Skyping with my friend in France who I don't get to see all that often, so for me that's a nice plus.  I know some people are complaining about the lack of another camera, but I knew that before I purchased it, and I don't intend to take pictures with my Fire so it's not an issue for me.Ok, now for the things that need improvement:I don't know what they were thinking when they decided on the on/off and volume buttons - they're hard to feel or see, and I quickly got sick of hunting for them.  However, I just received a case I ordered from Amazon, and now with the cut-out holes for the buttons in the case, they are easier to find.  Also the case automatically wakes/sleeps the Fire, so that's less pressing of the on/off button for me as well.  By the way, you don't have to spend a small fortune for a case - mine is really nice and it only cost about $15 on Amazon.Yesterday when I typed on my new Fire I had no problems.  Today, though I still have auto capitalization and word suggestions turned on (I checked), the auto caps and word suggestions are not working.  I'm going to call Amazon about this, but I would hope that issues like these will be fixed with the next automatic update.The Silk browser crashed several times yesterday as soon as I opened more than one tab, though it's been ok today.  Again, another issue that will hopefully be fixed with an update, as I believe Amazon did for the Silk browser on the first generation Fires (initially I had problems with Silk being unstable on my first Fire, but that issue was resolved).I found Amazon's \"recommendations\" for me below my carousel annoying, so I got rid of them by going to Settings, then Applications, then Home Recommendations and turning them off.  Annoying problem solved.  As for the ads on the opening screen, they don't bother me as they're only there briefly till I swipe the screen.Based on the experience I had with my first Kindle Fire, I think once there is an update for the new Kindle Fire HD, many of the kinks that I and others are experiencing should be solved (except, of course, for the buttons). Overall, I do love my new Fire, and I hope to be just as happy with it as I have been with my first generation Fire.  Hopefully after fixes, the only thing that would keep me from giving it a five-star review would be the on/off and volume buttons.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice improvement over the original Kindle Fire", "Author": "Dave Edmiston", "ReviewID": "R3NERQJ227KFUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using my original Kindle Fire for about a year now, and I've been using Kindle eBook readers since the original version of the Kindle (K1), so I have many years worth of likes and dislikes with the Kindle devices.  I've been using this new Fire HD 8.9\" for about four days now and am very happy with it, with a few notable exceptions.  In general though, it's an amazing device and I'm pretty thrilled with it.I'm not happy about the lack of Flash, but that's inevitable based on Adobe's removal of Flash from the Android world.  My bigger complaint is over the lack of autocomplete in the Silk browser. I don't get it. They also changed the keyboard layout a little bit so that punctuation characters like the comma, the apostrophe, the question mark, etc. aren't available by just pressing and holding the period. So between the lack of autocomplete and the new location for these characters, typing text is clunkier than it was on the original Fire.Other than that, I really do love the new Fire.It's super fast. They really enhanced the browser and the CPU speed. Having a larger screen makes it easier to work with too. They also improved a lot of things on the UI to make the experience better.They stopped dumping your entire Library to the Carousel, which makes it a lot less cluttered when you initially start it up.I don't really care for the Related Items below the Carousel though (where the Favorites used to be). It's a pretty ham handed attempt to funnel you back to the Amazon store.The Facebook app stinks, but the screen is large enough and the tablet is fast enough that it's easier just to use the full Web-based version instead of the app or the mobile version.The product Offers on the home screen aren't as annoying as I had expected. I actually like them more than the screen saver images on the original Fire. At least these change up more often and give more variety.I like the new camera and the ability to use Skype.I like the attempts at location services, but it probably would have been easier just to put a cheap GPS radio in it.I thought I would really love the new location for the power button and the physical volume up/down buttons. The buttons are cheap though. I tried pushing volume down + power to take a screenshot (a feature that I was really hoping for), but the key combination never worked for me. This actually caused the power button to get stuck. With the power button stuck, there was no way to turn the device back on. I had to thump on the button with my finger a bunch of times to get it to unstick. I'll probably need to have Amazon replace this unit for me, because that's not OK.The Dolby speakers that Amazon touted so hard are actually really nice. I was surprised how good the sound quality is.For me the biggest and most awesome improvement is in the actual Book reader app. Reading Kindle books on the Fire HD 8.9\" is amazing. The larger screen is so much easier to read on. And one very cool feature is that when you turn the device to landscape view, it gives you a two-page view. This is a very comfortable way to read. (My wife says she's had the two-page view in her iPad's Kindle app for a long time.)I've heard a lot of people complain about the lack of power adapter.  You get a USB cord, and the idea is that you plug this into your PC.  If you stick with this option, you will get a very slow charge from your Kindle.  If you have an original Kindle Fire, you are much better off using that charger for the new Fire HD.  I actually like the fact that it comes with a good USB cable.  I have plenty of 2.1A USB chargers around the house, so I'll use the cable with those chargers.All in all, I'm really happy with the fire.

Easy to use and lightweight enough to carry like a small book.2. I like the moving home button. That's one thing that annoyed me about the iPad when I played with it in the Apple store is that the home button was a physical button. The home button is a soft button on the screen that moves around as the screen does. It is at a convenient location all the time so that helps.3. I can now read my tech books while lying down on the bed, which are usually heavy and a pain to carry around. I used my laptop before ( too big) and my iPhone ( too small) too and neither were comfortable for me to read while I was lying in bed or just lounging around at a cafe. I feel like Goldilocks when I say this but the 8.9 kindle fire is just right.4. The sound and video quality is pretty good. so are apps on the Amazon.5. Going to the store and buying the apps/games/books/music/video is pretty easy, smooth and very quick over wireless.Things I didn't like:1. Packaging. I felt like besides that small thin USB cable, it could have included something else. Like maybe an power adapter that should NOT be 10 dollars more. I don't know what the iPad comes with but I have an iPhone and iPod touch and they both came with their own adapters. I luckily , like every other tech junkie out there, already have a belk USB adapter so its not like I was totally inconvenienced or something. Just enough to crib about it on Amazon anyway. I also thought it should have come with its own earphones. It doesn't. you have to get those too. :(. I just think it sweetens the deal, that's all. Then again, I might be totally spoiled by Apple.2. Keyboard. The keyboard is easy enough to use but the response seems to have a little lag and it isn't as smooth as one might think it could be. it has suggested words on top of the keyboard which does help speed up searches. Luckily I'm not going to be using it much for typing.3. Auto correct. I do like features like these when I am texting and it is a great help. Usually, but the auto correct kept correcting my name when I used it as a proper noun in most instances like while entering it in fields like \"first or last name\" or \"username\" or other places where you would think it shouldn't matter what you typed in because it specifically asks for uniqueness. iPhone had that problem too but I fixed that by entering it in the address field. Which I felt I shouldn't have to do because guess what? The thing is registered to me and it says so on the top left hand corner too that this is \"Sonali's Kindle\". So it should stop auto correcting it to Somalia.  I spent a good 4 minutes entering my name over and over again because it kept auto correcting it. It needs to get a clue that after the first try the \"typo\" was intentional.4. GUI to the amazon store to buy physical stuff is clunky and non responsive. I wanted to buy a cover for my kindle. It just didn't respond to my touch to enter payment information or address and I kept trying. I've also notice some apps like Netflix and facebook have really slow response times and at times they just hang. Since I don't face any problem with response when I use the ebook reader or the app store and certain games, I am not sure if this one can be blamed on the kindle but on the app developers.Overall it's doing what I want it to do.

I hemmed and hawed over getting a Fire because we already had 3 nook tablets (a decision made due to BN having a better presence in kids books when we started three years ago- and the 1st tablet was for a 2 year old.  Not a device issue.)  And didn't want to have to start over with apps and such.  Then they started Kindle FreeTime and I knew it was time to go all Kindle (the grownups all read on Kindles!)FreeTime is an amazing value for kids.  It gives them access to all the books and apps that they want.  Not cheesy free or 99cent variety ones- but name brand Disney and the like that you would be paying $12-$15/book for.The parental controls- if you use them like I do, to make sure your kid doesn't accidentally get on the web or delete or buy stuff- are a little cumbersome.  Basically I want to be the one to turn wifi on/off.  Well, once you are in freetime- that requires a ridiculous number of password entries.  You have to enter your password to even bring up the menu to get to turning the wifi on, then enter it again to enter that section of the menu, and then yes, a third time to actually turn it on.  YIKES!  The nukes don't have this much security!  And if your child is sitting there watching- they are going to learn your password pretty quick.  Luckily my kid isn't trying to bypass me- but if you have a more sneaky kid, be forewarned.  It is easier too exit freetime and do any adjustments, then reopen freetime. (even if you remove turning wifi on/off from being controlled- there is still no way to get to the menu to turn it on or off without entering your password.  It is crazy. I would just leave the wifi on, but it uses so much battery when we aren't using the fire.As a parent, I think once I have entered my password to get into parental controls- that should be enough.  I don't want to use it again at every step.

It has been a source of enjoyment. I use it for videos, music, shopping, email and many other things. The enjoyment part ended recently when the Silk Browser became an object of frustration. If you don't know, the Silk Browser is Kindle's access to the internet. It is down, not working, more than it is up and working. When you are in the middle of completing some business, and the Silk Browser goes down,  you get to start all over when it comes back, when/if it comes back. This creates a very frustrating situation. This happens too many times. Amazon has a fix for this but it means putting your entire Kindle content in the cloud. This creates a ton of frustration and download time. Trouble is, the fix doesn't last and soon, you are back with an internet browser that does not work. Forget it if you think Amazon will give you a refund on this defective product. NO WAY. This is the attitude of the largest retailer in the world? Give me a break. If you want a tablet that is internet worthy, do not buy a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Amazon finally, after much unpleasant argument, sent me a replacement of the same model I had purchased. Do I expect a better browser from this paltry offering. No. In the mean time, I have purchased an iPad.

These tablets use a customized Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. Apps have to be purchased from the Amazon App store for installation in order to be supported by Amazon. Apps purchased  through the App store and installed may not perform properly and may not be supported by Amazon. By default the tablets are set up to only  download and install Apps from the Amazon App store. You can change this setting but Amazon does not recommend it. Many of the Android apps that you are used to using on other Android tablets and smart phones are not available for the Kindle fire HD.I have used these tablets to stream video from two sources, Amazon Prime and Netflix. The main issue I have with the video streaming is when you first start streaming the video will not be at full resolution for the first 60 seconds or so and is choppy and blurry. Exactly what causes this is unknown but it happens on both Amazon Prime and Netflix and on all of the Fire HD tablets that I have used. It is not a wireless or bandwidth issue as I have much more capacity than these tablets need for streaming.This is a great tablet for using on Skype. It works well and the video quality is great and the battery lasts a good 5 hours when using video messaging. I initially had issues with Skype SMS using the touchscreen keyboard. The cursor would not stay at the end of the sentence being typed and the keyboard would not function properly reacting slowly and not entering the letters correctly. After two replacement Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablets, Amazon changed the version of Skype they had in the App store and the issue is resolved I am happy to say.The Amazon Silk browser works well but Flash is not supported so video sometimes does not work using the browser. The browser operates well and is easy to navigate.The Kindle Fire HD does a great job with e-mail, supporting all of the popular e-mail providers as well as corporate e-mail. Amazon brings all your e-mail accounts together in a single application.If you are planning on using this tablet in place of a Laptop it would not be a good choice. The productivity software available is not that good and is not compatible with Windows based programs such as Office. If you plan to do  lot of typing such as in e-mails I suggest you buy the Amazon Basics Bluetooth keyboard to use instead of the on screen keyboard.If you are looking for a tablet to use as an e-reader, to stream video on the device or to your tv via HDMI port and access your e-mail it is a decent choice.

I was so happy I caused two of my relatives to buy it as well. However the honeymoon period is long gone. after a couple of months the performance started declining considerably. Although I removed most of the apps I am not using and keep good eye on cleaning the cache etc, it did not improve at all. My main use of the tablet is internet browsing and there you are very limited with your browser options. Silk, the default browser, is the worst I have ever seen. If Amazon needs to fire some employees, it should start with the developpers of this nasty browser. It crashes a minimum of 5-6 times in less than 30 minutes of browsing. Otherwise, it is extremely slow and mostly inadequate in performance. Amazon's arrogance to create a monopoly over that browser is really irritating as well. (we can not get puffin e.g) Apart from the browsing experience, the app selection is limited and the general operation is slow and unreliable. It may take an easy 60 seconds to start up. Besides, one of the three items I purchased had a charging problem showing 0% no matter what and shuts down as we disconnect from the charger.

By the way, your best person that helped us was the last woman that spoke great English (probably a American) and she believed what we told her about the fixing it over the phone process that we already tried with others before her.  Also she had the UPS return sticker sent to UPS, instead of me. that was a great help to us.  As I said before, we left on Vacation without your kindle fire and the charger and of course we didn't need a cover for it.

I guess you have to be careful with these types of batteries.  I read that on a forum after I'd already messed it up.Anyway.  I contacted customer service and they were amazing.  Absolutely no hassle whatsoever, very nice and respectful.  They talked me through the trouble shooting and then sent me a free PowerFast adapter to see if that would bring it back to life.  It didn't, so I contacted them again and they immediately offered to send me another kindle fire, free of charge.  It will be here in 2 days, and I can ship the old one back for free in the box the new one comes in.  Both times I talked to them online using the \"contact us\" button and the conversations were quick and easy.The Kindle worked great right up until I killed the battery.

But be forewarned; this device is NOT an iPad and to expect any Amazon device to function anywhere close to an iPad is an unrealistic expectation.  If you're in the market for a tablet and you really want an iPad, then save up for an iPad.  I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because a) it was cheaper, and b) for the amount of screen real estate that I was getting at the price of it, it was too good to pass up.  But here's a few pro's and con's that I've noticed with it...Pro's:-The HD display does not disappoint!  I bought an episode of the Twilight Zone and threw it on my KF HD and it looks phenomenal.  The audio is as good as advertised, although to really get the most out of audio, you'll want to get a good set of earphones or earbuds as the speakers can be drowned out if there is something going on in the background (i.e. screaming kids, dishwasher, whatever).-The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 doesn't weigh much, so lugging it around with you is no big deal.  I take mine to work everyday in my backpack and I can't tell that it's in there.  In fact, I sometimes forget it's in there.-There aren't a whole lot of apps to choose from as compared to the Apple App Store, but if you go to a site like Good e-reader you can sideload a ton of decent apps to go along with your Kindle Fire HD.Con's:-I'm not crazy about where the ports are for this device.  The power charger and the HDMI output are technically on the bottom, thus making it useless to try to charge my Kindle and keep it on its stand at the same time.  While we are discussing the placement of things on the device, the power and volume control is in an annoying place.  That is one thing I believe the old Kindle Fire has over the new(er) HD model with having the power control on bottom.-Battery life can be a little deceiving on most electronics, and I think there's no exception when it comes to the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  If I stream anything on Netflix, my battery is almost depleted in a couple of hours.  If I'm reading, watching something on YouTube, or surfing the web/checking email, battery life is awesome.  And while we're at it, if you plan on purchasing any Kindle Fire products, BE SURE TO PURCHASE THE FAST CHARGER!!!  I have no clue why this doesn't ship automatically with the device (shame on you Amazon) but for $19 you can charge your device much quicker than with an iPhone cube or connected to your computer.All things considered, I still love this device, and I realize it's not perfect, but for the price I can't argue.

Then the battery started really getting bad and would last about an hour. Then, it stopped working even while plugged in. I thought it was the battery, so I replaced it with the kit sold here. This is definitely not for the faint of heart--this thing is put together like a swiss watch, and it's no fun doing surgery on this thing. That said, it came apart and went back together OK, but it's still completely dead.

Well, this review isn't one of those.I never thought I would say this...as I really have tried so hard to avoid being one of \"those people,\" but after using the Kindle Fire, it's safe to say, yes, I am an Apple person.Right now I am using the iPhone 5, and the Kindle HD 8.9, and there is just no comparison when it comes to the quality. The following is a brief bullet pointed list of problems I have with the Kindle, that I do not have on the iPhone:- The glare. Oh god, the glare!!! Isn't this device advertised as being better than the iPad when it comes to glare? I don't see how that can be possible, because looking at this screen is like looking in the mirror. That is how reflective it is. And if you should want to watch a movie or tv show that's primarily dark, well good luck, because you're basically going to be staring at yourself for the next hour or two. IT IS TERRIBLE!- Startup. Start up is sloooooooow. I mean, this thing takes minutes to start up. And even then, once it's actually started, it's gonna take another few minutes to wait in order to pull up any of the apps, otherwise they will just freeze and/or crash. Best thing to do when you want to use it is press the start key, and then walk away and come back in another 15 minutes. Then you should finally be good to go.- App availability. It's really unfair to yourself to ever purchase and Apple product and then get a device that is going to use an android app, because let's face it - we all know there are a million more apps for Apple. That said, I thought there would still be a decent enough amount of apps to choose from on the Kindle, being that Amazon owns the other half of our world. Nope. Not even close. I looked up the apps I have on my Apple, and only was able to find about 1/8 of them. Let me repeat - about 1/8. That is unreal, and frankly, unacceptable. The entire device is built around apps, therefore one would expect there to be a decent amount.- App functionality. The few apps I have been able to find and download regularly freeze and crash, and are generally much slower than Apple apps to start up. Some of them were in fact so unreliable that I ended up just deleting them.- Customizable options. Ummm, yeah...there aren't any. At all. Being somewhat tech savvy, I enjoy the ability to greatly customize my devices. I choose different backgrounds, different start up screens, password protect my devices, etc. That I have found, you can do NONE of that on the Kindle. You're basically stuck with that glaring black background, and that stupid \"carousel\" app display.- Sound. The sound stinks as well. If you want to watch or listen to anything, just plan on having to turn the volume up all the way. And that's in a quiet, child-free household. If you have children or a loud house, just plan on not being able to hear it at all.- Buttons. If you can find the buttons, good luck pressing the right one. Half the time I press the shut down button trying to press the volume because they put all three of them right in a row. I get that they were trying to make the buttons blend in with the device for sleekness, but sometimes functionality over looks is the better way to go.Basically, I will use this thing until I can save up enough for an iPad. That's how terrible I think it is - and it is brand new. Do yourself a favor and save up a little extra cash and get the iPad.

I had read dozens of user reviews in advance and really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, probably because I was not yet familiar enough with it, relying on it caused me to miss a crucial email and a long-awaited meeting. This one was my bad, not Kindle's.Back home, I started using it more and found it difficult or impossible to access the online versions of my mail subscriptions. A magazine sample downloaded from Amazon Kindle site froze at 48% and did not let me advance. First star lost. Accessing my Gmail account was still cumbersome -- second star lost. For me, it was best for reading books: the vertical page size is about the same as a paper book's, and an off-white background selection is easy on the eyes.Now comes the function that dropped the third star: it goes dead frequently and is a hassle to revive. The first time it happened, the user guide was useless and online instructions did not work. I had to contact Kindle Help who walked me through it on two calls, one hour apart. The second time around, I followed the steps that Kindle Help had shown me. Again, it took an hour to revive it. Too labor intensive for me! I want something that comes to life when I plug it in to recharge it. Preferably something with a clear on-off button and a power indicator like my laptop and my phone.Kindle Fire may be an excellent tablet for most users, just not for me. I need something that makes it easy to read my newspaper and magazine subscriptions and access email. It also has to be available when I need it without an hour-long multi-step revival process. I guess I have been spoiled by the ease of using and recharging cellular phones and laptops. After eight months of intermittent use and comparing notes with savvy friends, I have concluded that an up-to-date smartphone and a 13-inch notebook will bridge all my needs, and I no longer even need a tablet.

I like this tablet, the sound is good, the screen is excellent, and for the most part it runs smoothly for a dual core system.  My gripe with this is first, the wifi distance is weak.  On my laptop I will get very good download speeds at almost 50 feet from my gateway roughly 15+ megs per second.  On the Kindle it's well  below that.  When I try to watch Netflix it constantly freezes up and goes into buffering.  On web pages the load time is excessive.  When I am closer to the gateway though, the Kindle runs fast.  My second complaint is the gated community that Kindle users are forced into so we can't use Google Play and download a large number of apps.  Silk is a horrible web browser also.*********UPDATE 12/30/2013: I did research on Google and I guess it's Google that won't allow Kindle in. Also, the Silk web browser seems to be working better now for whatever reason. It's not as slow as before. On the WiFi distance issue I solved that by raising the gateway on a top shelf near the ceiling and now the Kindle picks up the signal no problem.

I read reviews and ended up purchasing it instead of the iPad air. It arrived very quickly. I set it up and began it play around with its features. Here are my thoughts:I won't get into the pros too much because I'm pretty sure those are quite easy to see: screen, sound, size, price. I just want to get into the reasons why I sent it back.First the internet connection was really finicky when starting it up after it was locked. It would take quite a while to find the connection and sometimes required a restart to connect again.One of the main reasons I bought this was so I could video chat with my family. I couldn't get Skype to function properly. The audio was so quiet I couldn't hear anything people were saying. It would freeze the whole tablet, requiring me to force a restart. It is incredibly disappointing to have to force restarts on a brand new device. I troubleshot it for a couple of days, uninstalling/reinstalling and what not, but I couldn't get it to function. I'm sure I could have contacted amazon for some more troubleshooting, but I decided to send it back before reaching that point.I was really uncomfortable using the carousel function. It was neat to see the icons so big, but that was about it. Other than that it seemed like a huge waste of space to have only one or two massive icons available on the screen at one time.The App Store left a lot to be desired. There just weren't that many interesting options. Maybe I was just spoiled by my iPhone, but it feels really lacking to me.The straw that broke the camels back, prompting me to immediately return it, was something so simple and tiny: I wasn't able to save pictures from my email. How silly. A function that simple should be included without a doubt.In the end, it looks good, feels good, and sounds good. It was the tiny stuff that frustrated me to the pointof returning it. I didn't want to troubleshoot the device just to get it operational. I didn't want to deal with a finicky internet connection. I didn't like the lack off App Store options. Skype was a mess.

Out of curiosity, I tried reading on my boyfriend's Kindle Fire and was instantly hooked. I love that the Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (to avoid wearing reading glasses, I read with a large font) and I love that I can see the book covers in color. And while reading in the dark I can dim the screen to a comfortable level. What I do not like is that I cannot arrange my books into categories, but this is an inconvenience with which I can live. I find the carousel simply annoying and wish there was a way to turn it off.Anyone who has a Kindle Fire absolutely must sign up for Amazon Prime in order to take advantage of the free videos. (No, I don't work for Amazon.) I didn't think I would enjoy watching movies and television shows on such a small screen, but the picture is unbelievably sharp and crisp, the sound is good, and is even better with headphones (not earbuds) on, and you can watch in bed without disturbing your partner.I can't speak to all the many other features because, as yet, I've not had time to try them, but I will update my review as I do.UPDATE: 1/27/2014. I lowered by rating from five stars to three, and had considered giving only two. Lately, my Kindle Fire has constantly been freezing up as I'm reading and, sometimes, restarting it does not fix the problem, so that I have to dig out my old Paperwhite to continue reading. I have had no problems with the Paperwhite, only the Fire. Sometimes, when I turn on the Fire, I get a blank, black page - no carousel, no bookshelves, no nothing.

I only set it up for him and played with it a little so the updated review will straight from my my 5 year old later tonight. But so far so GREAT +_ free shipping thanks !***UPDATE***DAD THIS IS AWSOME !!! And that is straight from my son's mouth !! Wehn he first opened the Kindle he was a little confused, it had his name and Free Time was all set up for him to go, but he was not used to seeing content just for his age. To be honest he was used to his I Pad touch and my wifes IPad.So after a little selling and showing him that he could have  most of his normal games and Netflix on the same pad he started to explore the free time.And to be honest no BS he has not switched back to the reg Kindle side of the pad other than to watch Netflix. HE LOVES IT & ITS ALL HIS books games etc etc. And I dont have to worry if the shows or games are right for his age.For all of you parents who have tech savy little ones let me tell you that the \" Free TIme\" for 2.99 is OUTSTANDING ! There are easy over 1000 books all age driven the games are great & the vids are a little young for my boy but he has found enough to keep him busy. Its just so much for 2.99 !The pad & the free time app are perfect !!Update ***** jan 1 the Kindle keeps crashing and freezing I have reset it twice to try to fix but it keeps bogging down freezing and apps just close and stop working. I don't get or maybe I do we are through the 30 period and it's prob going to totally fail. I thought this was a pretty fast pad but after using an ipad air and a hp slate this thing IS SLOWWWWW buyer beware. I still give the free time 10 stars fantastic but you can't add music to that side AND maybe Amazon should let us parents include some apps from the reg kindle side to the free time side have to drop it to ** 2 stars  just for the frustration maybe someone can give me a hint on this freezing and app crashes !!ANOTHER UPDATE NOW THE FIRE SAYS I AM OUT OF STORAGE SPACE ????!!!

BUT! !!!!!!", "Author": "David Ecale", "ReviewID": "R36633LI3FPEG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was planning on waiting another year for the KF HDX 8.9 as I'm not *that* rich and it's price was just too much for my pocket, but this unit's price (refurbished, 64gb, 4G LTE, SP Offers) minus a 20% discount sold me. ... That and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 (original) just plain blows up with the latest Kindle App (which is a piece of unmitigated bloatware)! ***SPECIAL NOTE: See below for the fix for Kindle Bloat on the Samsung Galaxy Tab!*** So:The Good: larger screen; nice layout; fast enough to run the kindle App (bloatware that it has become); lots of space (64gb selected); good price; more to come, I'm sure. ...The Bad: no GOOGLE Play Store - I have a bunch of paid4apps to reload the hard way; A bit choppy when scrolling; Not the easiest interface to live with after 2+ years with ANDROID 2.2 on 3 other machines. I do miss the freedom of a cleaner ANDROID interface, then again, it's a KINDLE, not an ANDROID!The OK: Special Offers (non Special Offers version was not available with the 20% discount, 64 GB, and 8.9) aren't much of a problem. The splash screen has a rotating offer & there's also a(n almost) hidden Special Offers Tab. This is not as much an annoyance as I expected & just maybe I'll hit something that I'll buy; Speed is good, but not great. Expected as this is an incremental upgrade & not the HDX. Price/Performance tradeoff applies here. ...The Frustrating: It doesn't fit in my custom 7\" bag from Eddie Bauer ($5.00 from the local Thrift Shop), but that's my problem as I selected the 8.9 vs. the 7; The HD & HDX don't have the sound out port next to the mini-HDMI port like the original Kindle Fire (Grace Digital docking system frustration).OK. All things considered, a great machine at a great price. I'm in the process of dumping my bloatware Kindle App from my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0. .......One other note: I have had my Kindle Keyboard since it first came out. I'm not abandoning it for the simple reason that I can read it in bright daylight outside. This is one limitation of the Color machines. That and battery life. So, I trade off as the day develops.(300+ books and counting. Alternate free book sources include ManyBooks_dot_net & Gutenberg_dot_org).-----Additions after a week of use:1) My case (from eBay as I didn't like the Amazon cases) has 3 small magnets in it. This means that it activates the Kindle HD's magic (magnetic) auto-off switch when I close the cover. This is a nice feature; however, it is quite annoying when I am reading with several interruptions. Example: loading 22 DVDs into a Kubuntu (Linux-based) system required interruptions in my reading every several minutes as I had to swap DVDs. Closing the cover (to protect the screen) as I placed the Kindle down meant that I had to re-login to continue reading. An annoyance! Furthermore, I am unable to find anywhere where I can explicitly turn this truly annoying feature off! I'd prefer the option to manually switch the unit off, or let it time out (currently set at 30 minutes).2) It is a bit klutzy to adjust screen brightness when reading a book. This used to be in the aaAA section on the older B&W; kindles & in the Kindle App for Android. Sadly, not in the Kindle Fire HD! Thus one step has morphed to three steps. Gaaaaa!3) Bloatware. I purchased this unit because it was capable of operating the latest Kindle App at a reasonable speed. The Kindle App for Android has bloated to the point that it is almost completely useless on my Samsung Galaxy Tab (P100) unit. The real crime here is that I can't back-load to an earlier version that actually works on the P100! Shame on you Amazon!4) SP Offers. After a week, I know that my next Kindle will definitely *not* have special offers. They aren't that ugly, just persistently annoying over time. I do like the (almost hidden) Special Offers tab on the top selection bar, but the continuous cycling of offers does become tiresome as I use the machine. Oh well, I'd have paid for the no special offers option, if I had known, but it wasn't available in the features that I wanted on the refurbished model. Live & learn.5) Wireless: I have the 4G LTE version w/ATT. ... No choice here when I purchased the Kindle, except that I'd have preferred the Verizon version. I have had lousy reception with ATT over the years, so I'll take this one with a grain of salt. I haven't turned this feature on & have it in reserve, so we'll see in the next few years if ATT has improved their coverage. PS. ATT coverage in my home sucks rocks. The only way to call by cell phone is to have a WI-FI connection to a router & a cable modem! //This is mostly as my home is in a geographic shadow for the local ATT & T-Mobile cell towers. When I had an ATT cell phone, I had to go outside and stand in my front yard (in winter) to actually complete a cell phone call (not fun at 30 below in Minnesota)! WI-FI call switching has saved me from many potential frostbite episodes over the years.//And, after 2 weeks, some insights:1) If I get tired of the ads, then I have the option to pay an additional $15 & Amazon will shut off the special offers. I am considering this, but have not yet made a decision.2) After I got everything up & running on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, I decided that it was time to work on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I saved off all of my critical data. Then I performed a *HARD* reset & wiped the tablet clean! This erased all existing memory & all downloaded apps on the tablet, then reloaded the built-in apps from the ROM memory. !!! And a miracle occurred! !!! The pig of a Kindle App with all of it's bloatware was blasted into never-never land and the pre-loaded Kindle App from ROM was re-installed! The older app works like a champ! It has revitalized my Galaxy Tab as a 7\" eReader! So, absolutely, positively, no Kindle upgrades ever again on the Galaxy Tab. Why replace a GREYHOUND with a PIG when you don't need to!Now I have both a working 7\" Kindle eReader & an 8.9\" Kindle eReader!More to come. ....", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "lmmwals", "ReviewID": "R2M9CZZ3UVA0ZQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't like this Kindle as much as my previous one.

Now that I have received it and used it for a few weeks I am very happy with it. I couldn't believe how cool it was the day it arrived. I spent hours and hours with it for a whole week! I couldn't put it down. I still use it daily and would feel lost without it. The screen resolution is fantastic. It's fast over wi-fi (I didn't opt for the 4G but I'm sure that's great as well), and has lots of great apps, with more being added all the time. I have Hulu+, Netflix and Spotify on it but with Amazon Prime alone, I can watch thousands of video movies and tv shows. With an added HDMI mini cable you can connect it to your digital tv and watch videos from amazon or the other apps on your tv! I highly recommend the kindle fire hd if you have amazon prime or are considering getting it. I have used prime for years to get free shipping on prime eligible items of which I can almost always find. I use it a lot for reading magazines and it saves trees. Also books. I have had kindles since the 1st generation ereader and have a lot of books from those previous purchases. The only negative remark I have is that the speakers were not as great as I expected. The newer model might be better for that feature. I really don't know. I would recommend buying the fast charger adapter. The device doesn't come with an adapter at all so if you don't buy one or have one already, you will have to charge it via USB on your computer. I had an adapter but it didn't charge very fast at all. The one for fast charging does a better job. I highly recommend the insurance too. It's well worth the money.

If a few unimaginable, disappointing problems hadn't reared their ugly head just recently I'd give the Kindle a 5-star rating, unfortunately for now, kindle is just mediocre. ;/Let's start it this way... until yesterday I WANTED to <3 the Kindle. I've gotten 3, the Kindle, Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and Kindle Fire HD 7.I was sharing my son's Kindle for reading books until I got my Kindle this month (I have the 7\" Kindle Fire HD) I ignored some of the \"glitches\" thinking I'd take the time to straighten things out once I had my personal Kindle...well no such luck.1) There is no way to keep content from anyone you share an account with, be it a spouse, parent or child. Meaning my horror books are visible to my son, no matter what I do, unless I want to delete my purchased content. I personally like to read and reread books, now I'm forced to waste money and get rid of a book...bummer!! Luckily my son is not a kid to open something that's not his BUT some of the title pages are scary for a young child, so I'm left with only one option. Don't buy, or buy and delete, which still makes the cover photo available while I'm reading the book.2) There is an app for monitoring your children's Kindle activity (Kindle Freetime) but it's a pay for app and the ONLY way to keep adult content, inappropriate content from a child's view. Disappointing! I should be able to block material. This could be a solution to above complaint.3) There is no way to organize your books and apps. For someone who has purchased dozens and dozens of books in 8 months, this is a real pain in the bottom. Considering it's actually available on the earlier and less expensive versions...why leave that option off the Kindle Fire HD? Again, this could be an easy solution to the above frustrating complaints.These are enough for me to be disappointed with the Kindle. I'm considering returning the 2 most recent purchases, and no longer purchasing Kindle eBooks, so that I don't risk my son being exposed to books I'd rather he not see.BTW before anyone comments back the books I'm personally discussing are true crime, mystery, suspense books, nothing crazy, no smut, no triple x, I just don't want my son seeing the cover to Black Dahlia or the likes. My son won't be looking for them but he simply can't AVOID seeing them as they are listed in the cloud ;/There should be a way to organize or remove books from view.Darn Kindle I wanted so badly to like you.

This is my third Kindle.  The only reason I bought this latest one is that my first generation Kindle Fire stopped charging (after only having it for 1 year 4 months).  Amazon customer service told me that these units are well known for this issue.When ordering this (via a customer service rep on the phone), I said I wanted a KF without the \"special offers\".  He said they didn't have any available (?), but I could simply pay $15 to have the ads removed via their website.  Interestingly enough, it arrived WITHOUT the special offers, and it didn't cost me a dime.  Way to go, Amazon!I love the larger screen... the clarity is amazing.  And I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound - I don't need to use headphones any more when watching a movie.  I sometimes even have to turn the volume DOWN, it's that good.I don't have the same problem I've seen other reviewers mention... the lagging internet speed.  Mind seems to go lickety split with no trouble.  And yes, the power off/on button at the top is sometimes difficult to find, but I don't think that's anything worth complaining about.The only negative I have (so far) is the battery.  It takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R to recharge it... whether I use the USB cable that came with the unit (and their PowerFast for Accelerated Charging plug), or another similar cable.  My previous KF used to charge in 2-3 hours... now, it often takes 10+ hours to get it charged enough to use it without being attached to a cable.  Seems a tad long, in my humble estimation.The charge also doesn't last very long... I can have the thing fully charged (100%), and it goes down to 25% VERY rapidly - even if all I'm doing is reading a book.  I HATE that.All-in-all, I am reasonably happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" unit.  Would I have been AS happy to stick with my first generation Kindle (if it hadn't stopped charging)?  You bet.  Would I have preferred to replace my non-charging first generation Kindle with a plain ol' Kindle Fire Tablet 7\" LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8GB and save $25.00??  Yup, I probably would have been just as happy with that.

Outside camera, not just the camera for skyping facing the user.2.

Also, sometimes letters need a firm press to work.Wishlist: once you hit \"space\" after using the symbols keyboard, I wish the keyboard would return to the letter keyboard.It still works great and am happy to have it.UPDATEEmail is working again and has been working for the past week. I really enjoy using my Kindle Fire HD and it has replaced my iPod.However, the office app that is pre-downloaded onto the KF is terrible. Only some of the PDF files will actually open and the ones that don't, there's an option to \"send error\" and I do that. I received an email this morning with one solution, upgrade the office program. I went to do that and the app COSTS $15!!! So, if your Kindle is going to be used for business, you may want to look at other tablets.UPDATEThe \"on\" button at the top of the device is not working anymore. There is plenty of battery left in the device, as I charged it last night.

There is only one huge con to note. The buttons are tiny and they fit into the sides of the kindle in a way that make it really hard to press them. If you buy this, make sure you get a case that can take advantage of the open/close wake/sleep feature.  No back camera. I don't really care about this, but I know this will likely be an issue for some.PROS:  Perfect size. It doesn't feel like an oversized phone, and it doesn't feel like I'm carrying around a giant cutting board. I like the 8.9 size better than any other tablet I've used.  Battery life. The battery life is great. It's kind of necessary since its main purpose is for reading books, but still, it's worth noting.  Lightweight. It's weight is almost perfect. Light enough that you'll never tire of holding it, while heavy enough that it has substance while you're holding it and using it. It doesn't get uncomfortable, and you won't ever thing about the weight. Definitely a good thing.  Simple interface. The interface is extremely accessible and intuitive at all times. It's simple and doesn't have the usual \"dominoes on a table\" style interface I've come to hate so much. This is definitely a more personal and subjective pro, but I thought I'd mention it. Just remember that the interface may be a con for some people.  Fast wifi. What can I say? The wifi works well. If I'm not mistaken, it has some of the best wifi technology available at the moment.  Front camera. The front camera is good for Skype. Means I can do video calls when I'm on vacation/not at home. Don't really know what else you'd use it for though.  Auto adjust brightness. This is old news, but I find that my kindle's auto adjust seems to work better than my phone's. (Samsung galaxy s2) This is probably more my phone's than the kindle. The point is if you're not trying to conserve battery, just use the auto. It works well.  Swype. I haven't really kept up with Apple recently, but last I heard, android was the only thing with Swype. Definitely a pro. I wouldn't even think of buying a tablet without it. I'm writing this review on my kindle. It would have taken 10x as long without Swype or a keyboard. That's just what Swype does, allows you to keep your wpm up while freeing you from keyboards. This allows you the freedom a tablet should have. In fact, that's kind of the whole point of tablets. Besides, Bluetooth keyboard are mini sized so your wpm is going to suffer in whatever keyboard size you start using less. Again, not sure, but if the iPad doesn't have Swype, then I'd buy this over that regardless of anything else.  Kindle perks. Kindles get some special perks if your an Amazon prime member. You can borrow one free book a month. It's a bit underwhelming, but free is free and pros are pros.  Amazon integration. This will be a huge con for some and a huge pro for others. I use Amazon for a ton of stuff so I enjoy it. if you have Amazon prime, then you'll also get a seamless integration of Amazon instant video. The kindle also syncs with all of your Amazon cloud data. This makes it really easy to keep up with everything on multiple devices.OVERALL: I think it's pretty clear how I feel about the kindle fire HD 8.9. It's a great tablet for a great price. It's probably worth a lot more to anyone with an Amazon prime account. I'm sure there are a ton of pros that I forgot, and at least a few more cons I haven't really thought of yet, but suffice it to say that I'm very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Adequate but lacking.", "Author": "Kyle D Esala", "ReviewID": "R144B2NKRB6R0U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Web browsing is an extreme pain on this device.

I must say, it is not an issue, and would not be worth the money to get the No-Ad version. The ads are more of a screensaver, with a touch and slide to the right to open the ad. To get to my Kindle content there is a touch and slide to the left to open the Kindle. Now either way, you have to touch and slide. To me, the ad version is not annoying at all and I simply view it as a screensaver. So save your money and don't pay for the ad removal.UPDATE 10/9/13: I have had no issues with my KF HD and it continues to perform well. I take it everywhere with me. I also just learned that the KF charger does a fine job of charging my smartphone Droid4, so no switching of chargers in home or car YAY!!. Also the fact that I felt so happy and confident with my experiences with my KF HD that, early September I purchased an identical KF HD 8.9 for my Granddaughter. I have not formally reviewed that Kindle, but so far, it has worked fine and my son is in charge of the usage of my 8 yr old GD. She LOVES reading on the Kindle Fire. DS is using Parental Controls and states it works well. He can completely block the internet, limit the game time, and no limit on reading time. So GD is happy she gets some games with lots of reading.UPDATE 2/7/14 No issues. Works like new. GKs Kindle Fire HD 8.9 has no issues either.

I'm sure if there's a new version that comes out, I'll probably find an excuse to buy it at some point as I keep finding uses for the older ones. That said, it took me a while to warm up to the Fire HD. Perhaps because I expected so much from it, it being the first real tablet Kindle to come out, even though I'm not going to rave about Apple or the others.At first I mainly stuck to the reading and video capabilities - of course it's easy to download, manage and read material on the Fire HD. Videos look great on the screen as well, and as someone who streams their Prime account as well as Hulu and Netflix all of the time, I haven't noticed any issues with the video quality or capability. Some days I watch more on my Fire HD than I do my tv.Music streams and plays well, also (though have a complaint with the playlists on Kindles and how they can time out. Why no loop feature, Amazon?).I'm not the biggest app person out there - I've been able to eventually track down what I need and notice that there's more out there all of the time, but again, it's not like I hit the app store that often. I've never had an issue with the apps I have downloaded.It took me a while to get used to the Silk/internet feature. I'm not the biggest fan of this aspect of the Fire HD - if there was something to detract stars from,t his wold be it. Maybe because on a regular pc I'd have a couple of dozen tabs open and tons of bookmarks, and I don't think the bookmark nature of Silk is very intuitive and I have to remember to keep the tabs to a minimum for it to function well. Here's hoping to improvements in future upgrades.All in all, the Fire HD is a great tablet/multi-media/entertainment device.

An example: my 5 year old & I watch a few funny youtube videos before his bedtime, and the screen resolution is much better and more clear on my samsung galaxy s 3.

I switched to the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD because of the way magazines and newspapers are formatted (i.e. clear index and perfect reading layout of each article), the ease of emailing in PDFs and then reading them in Kindle or the Adobe App (where they automatically show up), and the ability to easily hold the 8.9 in one hand without a case.  If you have a laptop and an iPhone as I do, the new Kindle 8.9 is a perfect in between for users who read a lot.  And if you want some tunes while you are reading, Amazon's music product is pretty good (not to mention plenty of storage options for those who want some movies or TV handy for plane rides).Since I plan on sticking with the Kindle 8.9 platform for a long time, I do look forward to a few improvements on version 2.0.

Over time, Amazon certainly wants to be a leading seller of music/streaming and, after listening to hi-quality MOG or Apple Lossless, the Kindle 8.9 tunes sound a bit lame.  Lastly, while I love the Kindle reading products, there is less you can do with an article than on iPad - Kindle needs more tools to forward, post, copy, and highlight.  Sure some of these are available for some products (like highlighting in Kindle books, for example) but the Newsstand offers almost nothing (you can't even save articles anywhere).So it's a great reading device - great enough to make me swap out an iPad Retina - but it's my guess/hope that v 2.0 will be the ultimate (for me anyway).", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it", "Author": "Barbara J.

I am glad I got the larger size and 4G service when I am out of Wi-Fi range. I now carry it with me every day. Two complaints. I had to return the first Kindle I received due to its inability to receive e-mails on my 3 accounts. The second Kindle is much better though it can be hinky at times at receiving and opening e-mails; it is especially important to trash deleted e-mails to prevent clogging of e-mails.

I have been wanting a tablet, namely an Ipad for a long time now but just could never justify or get a good feeling about the cost, I have the money, just could never get a warm fuzzy feeling about spending the amount that Apple requires to carry their products around.After quite a few hours of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  When it arrived, it was almost alll the way charged, configuration with my wireless and Amazon account was extremely easy and I was quickly on my way to \"playing\" on it.I've read a lot of reviews that talk about the lack of apps, but all the heavy  hitters are there.  Facebook, Netflix, Pinterest, more than enough weather apps, Allrecipies, MyFitnessPal, all the latest games...........other than my personal bank or local television station, I can't really think of anything else that I would like that I'm missing.I'm not a gadget guru, but I have used a couple others and while it affects nothing of my  Kindle experience, I do see where the Kindle does not scroll as beautifully as the Ipad, page turning in the books is not as cool as Nook's actual page turning when I touch the screen, but again, these are very small insignificant things.I spent the better part of the weekend learning my new gadget and I'm in love with it.  The Silk browser is fast,  I can bookmark my webpages that I like to frequent for easier access.  I read the better part of a book and really enjoyed the Sephia option of page color, white seemed a little bright.  I watched a couple episodes of a TV show on NetFlix, my husband watched an AmazonPrime movie and we both surfed the net and played games on it all weekend.  Everything I needed in a tablet is there and the fact that it's half the price of what I've been wanting makes me feel even better about my purchase!!I would certainly recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a lot when it's only going to be used for entertainment.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD", "Author": "Gary Powell", "ReviewID": "R2LAFWGBDE6X8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first step into the 21st century, and what a great one it is.

The built quality looks and feels good and the device has a nice rubberized back that feels good in the hand. The user interface and functionality of the Kindle uses an Amazon software overlay, but the user experience feels very android-like once apps are installed.I noticed that PDF's and PPT files lag a little on the device. Sometimes I have to touch the screen multiple times to get the home button to appear in order to exit the PDF viewing program. Most other apps have run well with little hiccups.My only true complaint is that my screen has dead pixels. For most people a dead pixel is unnoticeable, but it is annoying for users who view a lot of PDF's or read books with a white background. I constantly find myself wiping the screen trying to get rid of speck. I called Amazon and was sent a replacement Kindle which also contained a dead pixel, this time in the center of the screen. Most companies allow a certain number of LCD display defects to pass through inspection since LCD's are an expensive component to replace. With the Kindle priced so attractively I understand that quality control would be set with tolerances that allowed for small variations that most consumers wouldn't notice or be concerned with.In short, I like the device. I think it's great addition to add to the Amazon ecosystem, especially if you purchase a lot of content through Amazon. I like the price point. Is the Kindle as good as an Ipad? Most would say no. Is it more than half as good as an Ipad? Certainly. And considering the price point it is a much better value.Are the components for the Kindle sourced cheaply? Probably- most device components are. Will this result in dead pixels on your Kindle screen? So far for me it has.I will call Amazon today and see what my options are. If I can't get a device I am happy with then I will return.

You won't go wrong with any tablets that these companies offer, they're all wonderful devices. That said, I would have preferred a Nexus 10, but for a college student's budget, the kindle fire was an easy choice.If there is anything that the Fire falls short in, it would be the app selection. I mean, nothing really critical is missing (except for YouTube seriously Amazon get a proper YouTube app already) so it isn't really detrimental, but there are a few apps I wish Amazon offered.Other than that, everything works flawlessly. As a previous reviewer stated, the position of the micro usb port is a major pain, but little I can do about it. Books, movies, music, apps, games; the Fire can do anything the iPad can, despite what the rabid fanatics tell you.The true power user will probably want to invest in a Nexus, but for the money, this is a great media consumption device. I wasn't looking to replace my brand new laptop anyway. I can manage my emails, check mission critical websites, and get most of my day to day activities done fine on my Fire. It's my best morning coffee buddy.Also no, it does not come with a charger, but I knew that beforehand because I read. That college education sure comes in handy, don't it. If you do not do your research, do not whine to all in sundry about information widely and readily available. Also they aren't expensive and are sold at many brick and mortar stores.Well that wraps up what I have to say about my favorite toy. Take it for what it's worth to you, and happy surfing.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly worth the money, I use it more than my iPod and cancelled Netflix due to it, but the Silk Browser seems unstable", "Author": "Adore Yourself", "ReviewID": "R3KUWJ0VJGRVYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually got tears in my eyes today at the amazing beauty of my Kindle. It truly is amazing. I have Amazon Prime and was sick in bed today and it was a sheet joy to have the Kindle to help me get through the day in bed. I was stunned at how simple and easy streaming shows was on the Kindle, I watched episodes of NOVA today seamlessly. I also am impressed with the sound and picture quality. It did not feel like I was using a small device at all. I love how the cloud makes it easy to get my books from my old Kindle and music I bought in the past into the new one. I think the Prime idea with the streaming content is going to get bigger and bigger, perhaps even upending the entire cable tv market and Netflix. I cancelled Netflix this week due to the Amazon Prime offerings...on the whole, this device is wildly impressive. A large clear HD screen, pretty high quality sound, and great amounts of content, from apps to music to tv shows to books...this is an entertainment system that fits into your hand!! Also, this week I used the camera at Malibu and the quality is amazing! The yellow on the flowers on the hills was stunning both in person and on the pictures I took with my Kindle. I was able to easily transfer the pictures to my laptop and was also able to email some of the pictures to a friend without any problem from my Kindle too. I never listen to music on my ipod anymore and listen to it on my Kindle. I also no longer play Solitaire on my iPod and play it on my Kindle instead. I am liking a lot of the applications for Kindle too, ranging from turning the screen into a playable keyboard to showing a map of the night's sky. So far, I am thoroughly pleased and even impressed, with my new Kindle. I like the touch screen, that is nice and most of the navigation of the Kindle is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.On the downside, I did not like and felt it was manipulative to make it so only music bought on Amazon could be easily put onto the Kindle, and that I had to download a special uploader which seems to have problems as well, giving a notice with every upload that it may not work...but was able, with some hassle, to get music from my computer onto the Kindle, but it should have been as easy as moving the files from the laptop to the Kindle but it was not. (You are supposed to be able to transfer the files easily but I was not able to get that to happen.) There was this weird third step of having to download their special app then having to upload your music from laptop to the loader then back to the Kindle. I would like to encourage to not be like Apple...I still, 3 years into owning my iPod, cannot figure out how to get music onto my iPod!! And it pisses me off. Still, the Kindle made it easier to get music onto my Kindle than iPod music uploads have been.The biggest complaint I have re this Kindle is the Silk browser is unstable and I really cannot use this Kindle for much in the way of web use. I can look at static pages, without interactivity. But almost none of the things I need to do can be done online using the Kindle. It seems to not allow you to look at pdfs and even tho I downloaded an app from Adobe to read pdfs they still are not being read...I do a lot of research on ProQuest for instance, and I cannot see any of the articles using the Silk browser. Additionally, it does not seem to work with Flash!! I cannot play any games on Lumosity, for instance, on the Kindle due to some kind of Flash issue and when I tried to find an app to fix this, I could not find it. With no ability to see pdfs or Flash websites, or no way that is obvious to me (and I am in a graduate level tech/design degree program, so I am no idiot when it comes to tech), it severely limits the utility of this device as it applies to the web. Also, the Silk browser freezes up constantly. It needs to be improved. I would have preferred a more stable browser such as Firefox. Almost every time I go online to any site other than Amazon's stores, it freezes and when I do get to websites, they are very limited when the pdfs and flash do not work. It is also unclear whether we are charged money to transfer documents to this Kindle. I believe on my old Kindle they charged us if we sent documents to ourselves. I am unclear if I send documents to the email address of my Kindle HD if I pay for each upload and I wish they would make that clear somewhere. On the whole, though, I am wildly impressed with this Kindle. I really beg Amazon to avoid the pitfall of Apple of making things only work within the itunes store for the ipod making it nearly impossible to upload anything else to the device. I do not like the additional steps to upload my own music onto the Kindle and hope Amazon moves away from that type of thinking on its devices. I hate Apple and avoid their products due to the way they make them so incompatible with everything else. I resent it. I hope Amazon realizes this device has so much utility, enough for them to not have to play games re content. Let us upload our own content plus things we bought at Amazon, with equal ease.I highly recommend this device. It has enhanced my entire life for a month now. It has become my #1 music, movie, game center and favorite camera to boot! Not to mention my primary reading source. Great screen! Great sound! Great utility! Great job, Amazon!!", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very good product with a few flaws", "Author": "judy mulack", "ReviewID": "R27Y13GPQ41LR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the 8.9 kindle fire HD as an early birthday present to myself.  Overall, the experience has been good.  When I first received it, the silk browser would not load.  It kept saying that there was a fatal flaw and that the browser needed to be restarted.  The only problem is that every time I restarted it, it gave me the same error.  This is detrimental to the kindle overall, but it is not a problem for me.  I simply side-loaded Dolphin (my preferred mobile browser) onto my kindle.  As a lover of the original kindle fire, I was pleased with the changes I found on the new HD.> The sound, for a tablet, is outstanding.  True, it is not booming, but it is true stereo sound which is pretty impressive for a tablet.> The HD is beautiful, but that was not the greatest selling point of the screen for me.  With my first generation kindle fire, going outside was out unless I could find a shady spot or if it was really cloudy.  I *LOVE* the anti-glare screen incorporated into the new HD.  I can sit outside in direct sunlight and still see my screen.  This is a great thing!>The \"ads\" that show up on the lock screen are no big deal.  I just do not pay them any mind when I turn my kindle on.  I do have to say that, even though a lot of people seem to complain about the recommendations offered on the home screen, I actually find myself scrolling through them.  They show you games/apps/books that you may like based on the app/book that is front and center on the home screen.  I do not worry about my kids or myself accidentally purchasing, that is what my password lock is for.>My favorite pre-installed app on this new device is Freetime.  I wish that I could download it on my first generation (I have two kids).  For $3 a month my kids have unlimited access to children's videos, games, apps, and books!  The videos need a wifi connection, but once they access/download an app or book onto the device it is there in the freetime app.  This was a great little discovery when I was stuck at the doctor's office with my toddler a few days ago.  There are literally HUNDREDS of choices for them.>I also really appreciate the fact that I am no longer allocated a miniscule amount of space for apps.  My kindle comes with 13 Gb's of free space, and if I want to allocate all 13 gigs to apps and games, that is my prerogative. It drove me nuts that I was only allowed 1.17 gigs of space out of 6.5 gigs of free space for apps on my first generation.>I **DO NOT** like the placement of the USB port for charging.  The reason is that I like to say in bed and watch movies while going to sleep at night.  I can not use the case to prop the kindle up in landscape mode and charge the kindle at the same time.  I like the placement of the USB port on the first generation much better.  This one little thorn in my side is the main reason that I am only giving this product four stars.>I played with the camera a little bit.  I was not really impressed with it.  I do like how it uses the screen as a flash, but the pictures always seem to come out grainy.  I thought that it was supposed to be an HD camera.  Hey, and how about a video camera option??  This also helped contribute to this product losing one star in my review.This is all.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.  I recommend this product.  It is great for the price (I got it for $269 the week before Valentine's).", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Ashley G", "ReviewID": "R1RD1XQ6NS4E32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot put it down.

They have an app just for them to use also so you can share it. It's worth every penny and you will enjoy this very much. Excellent gift idea.

It's not obtrusive due to the size of the screen.  It might be less awesome on the smaller version, though.Better speakers (it still sounds better with headphones, but the speakers are usable if, for example, your cat chewed through ANOTHER headphone cord and left the pieces on your pillow, as a gift).CONS:Power button hard to see/find and it doesn't have a light (so unless you actually open up the case, you can't make sure that it's actually plugged in.  See prior note about cat and delicious, delicious cords).A little heavy for holding in one hand, especially in a case.Still more glare than I would like...not impossible to use in daylight, but not great.Battery life is longer?  AHAHAHAHAHA.  Surprisingly, movies/tv seem to suck the least juice. Reading eats the battery, and playing games (like Angry Birds and Cubistry) kills it.Formatting issues with some books and games.Generally, I am very pleased with it.  I find that I watch a lot more movies & tv shows because of the larger screen.  Also, I can set the text size a little bigger and not have to turn pages as often...as I am rapidly approaching the Age of Reading Glasses, I like this feature. I just wish the power button had a light like the 1st gen. Fire, and that it was slightly raised and not flush with the case.

Amazon did not choke me down with product advertisements and things simply felt as they should be. The 32GB is sufficient for my needs and although I would have preferred expandable storage the Dolby audio was too irresistible.

SO EXCITED!  (Will update as time passes!)", "Author": "cjmanning86", "ReviewID": "R1YWMEBBPZS1HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the title suggests... I have just received my Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD (without 4G) a couple hours ago!  I work in the IT and Data Management fields, love electronics and many devices.  I will be able to honestly and thoroughly review this product for those of you out there still looking to buy one or be informed.Packaging -  The packaging used to hold my Kindle Fire was typical Amazon style.  It came in it's own 'Kindle' box with the manifest attached.  While I worry about this, I can say my device is without defect and it seems their box is more protective than it seems.  I also must say I like that they use recycled material that is also further recyclable... very 'green' of them and it's appreciated from a passive standpoint.Directions -  I must say this is splitting hairs a little... but I am dissappointed that they don't provide at least some basic instructions as to whether you can start charging it right out of the box or not.  I assume that the battery needs to be fully charged and then fully used until it dies and then fully charged again to charge all possible cells thoroughly?  I know some phones were like this, and still are in some cases with other devices too.  Right now I'm trying to charge it and then after that I will see what the battery life is initially and report it, and then charge fully after death and then see what it is after a complete recharge and report it too :)Accessories -  I don't know if most people order accessories right off the bat or not, but I made sure to buy a good screen protector and leather folio/bluetooth keyboard case for mine.  I recommend Tech Armor's Lifetime warrantied HD screen protectors.  Since the Kindle Fire HD already has anti glare built into it's glass, no need for matte types of screen protectors.  Matte types take away from the crispness of the HD screen anyways.  I also recommend MoKo's Bluetooth Keyboard Case... it is of great quality, and after tons of research of the other brands, this one had the reviews that made me feel safest with the stitching, compatibleness with ALL of the function buttons, and charging time and more.  Other than that, it's up to you... but I'd say these two are a must!  Check them out!Feel and Initial Reactions -  This device is heavier than I expected, but that is no complaint!  It feels natural, almost like it is in that sweet spot for a device to not be too heavy and not too light.  I was actually worried of dropping it because it's not as grippy as one would think or expect either, and I didn't want to touch the screen until my protector was on it either!  It is just the right size though, and fits in your hand well.  It's very thin, cool to the touch, and it's display is absolutely marvelous!  The colors are deep and sharp, but not too bright.  THe brightness is sensitive I will say, with half way down being almost unreadable in any indoor lighting.  I am making use of the auto brightness to help save battery while keeping proper reading brightness readily set.  It's also responsive, easy to use.  The on screen keyboard and feel to manipulate the OS takes a few seconds to get used to, but that's to be expected as I have only iphones in my house, and the first generation Kindle Fire which is sluggish and drull compared to this one.  The advertisements aren't that bad... honestly, who cares?  I'm sure there's an easy way my IT mind could find to take those out, but I did save money with them being there so I'll prolly leave them there for now.Features -  With everything making an attempt to be separate, but all be synced together at the same time... it's no surprise to see Facebook and Twitter instantly be found on this device upon setup.  Especially since I have both accounts and have shared items on the webpage with them (Amazon.com).  The dual WiFi antenna and dualbands make it really speedy compared to my iphone 4S's wifi speeds, and even here at work where our mobile network gets bogged down... it's almost expecting too much out of itself in regards to the warning I got that the network is slow and that I should update in the background upon setup (haha, it actually finished fast... it's too hard on itself!).Overall -  I am very pleased and I cannot wait to keep you all updated with my further review updates!

I'm very impressed with this little machine. I've had an iPad2 since release day and use it daily. I had no need for anything else, but decided to purchase the Fire to use mainly as a digital wifi picture frame. Now that it's here I have a feeling I'll be putting my Kindle Keyboard away and using this for my main reading device... especially since I now know how to get whispersync working on non-Amazon, non-DRM books and documents via Amazon's cloud, between all my devices using the Kindle apps.So why do I like this? For one is the price... I got it for $250 which is a fair price point for this device. I don't think I'd love it as much at $299 and would probably have bought an iPad mini at that point. Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't.The screen is gorgeous! I don't have a retina iPad so I'm comparing it to my iPad2 and Macbook Pro. I love it.The build is substantial. It feels like a quality product... not a cheap tablet... and it looks beautiful.The packaging is very Apple-like. Simple and sleek. Felt very nice to open and reveal the toy inside.The Amazon integration is wonderful. If you have Prime this is a no-brainer.What I don't like... it has a bit of a lag and feels slower than my iPad. Not quite as responsive, but not bad enough to make the device seem unusable.I also don't like the location of the charging port. Being on the long-side of the device made it a little tricky to find a stand that would accommodate the longish stem on the included USB cable when docking horizontally. I was able to get around this by finding a micro-usb cable with a very tiny head so there's a bit more clearance between the KF and the table when set in a generic tablet stand. I'd be much happier if the charging port was on the short-side of the device. Charging while watching a movie, or in my case using as a photo frame, is sometimes a necessity.So far those are the only cons I've discovered with this little tablet. I've only had it for about 3 days so that may change, but I all-in-all I'm quite impressed... and that's saying something as I'm quite an Apple fan girl and never expected to own any tablet other than an iPad.I would recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 to anyone considering a tablet on a budget... especially if you are a Prime member. The integration is wonderful and the ease of use is nothing to sneeze at.

Unless money is not a constraint, you can save over $250 by purchasing the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" instead of the iPad 4.DESIGN:Although the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is cheap, the chassis feels solid. It's not the aluminum build that you'll find on an iPad, but it's well-constructed nonetheless. The Volume and On/Off buttons are not as flush with the body as they are on the 7'' version.PERFORMANCE:The iPad 4 and Nexus 10 offer smoother performance, better processors, and a better web browsing experience. The Kindle can't compete in these categories. Nevertheless, the Kindle Fire HD has a very responsive interface in its own right. Do not expect glitch-ridden, shoddy performance simply because of the low price.SCREEN AND SPEAKERS:Picture quality on the screen is sharp, clear, and vivacious. It is a joy to read or watch anything on the Kindle Fire HD. Amazon fused the touch sensor with the LCD display to reduce screen glare. This is crucial for people who like to use their tablets outdoors or in well-lit conditions.Most tablets use a single speaker to simulate stereo sound. The Kindle Fire HD actually uses two speakers that are visible externally. The result is that the sound produced by the Kindle Fire HD is incomparable among tablets.PORTS:I was able to connect the Kindle to my projector via the micro-HDMI port, and the results were outstanding: 110 inches of HD content on my living room wall, originating from my Kindle Fire!FINAL WORD:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is an amazing tablet at a very affordable price.

It's great to have all my streaming content from Netflix and Amazon wherever I go.  I did sideload the Dolphin browser and a version of flash that works with it, so that I can watch other video formats.The APP store is really overloaded with games for kids.  I guess people must use their devices as babysitters.  But I did find some useful free APPS.  I recommend YOUZEEK, which seems to have all the music on youtube in categories, by artist. I am a guitar player, so I can plug my Kindle Fire HD into my PA, fire up YOUZEEK and jam along with my favorite artists while I watch the video (if youtube has the video). I also recommend the PBS video APP, Flixter, Urbanspoon, IMDb, Norton Mobile Security free APPS.I purchased the powerfast charger with my Kindle and it works great.I also bought a rooCase for it which is a great value.  It puts the Kindle to sleep when closed and wakes it up when you open the case.

Two months ago my wife bought me the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and it blew me away. Every complaint that I had about the original fire was addressed, and then some. The 8.9 is great, it serves its purpose as a media consumption device but its size makes it useful for school work also (buy a good BT keyboard). Some people complain about the ads, but honestly I enjoy them, some of the advertisements are pretty cool and some of the offers are pretty good. In my opinion it is not worth $15 to disable them.Pros:-A must have for Amazon prime members-fast and powerful processing and browsing-great screen resolution-Great speakers (this was a major complaint with the original fire I can now watch NBA league pass with the speakers turned up without earphones)-Great price-Great book/movie/app selection-X-Ray (I didn't think i would use this feature at first but it is actually pretty cool. Watching movies and being able to get information and recommendations is great)-Upgraded the silk browser (I didn't love the original silk browser but this version is pretty awesome, the suggestions and bookmark tab is very useful)Free time (love this app, easy to set up and very useful for anyone who has kids)-Upgraded book and magazine experience (scrolling and page turning animations are smoother, pages look crisp and easy on the eyes).Cons:-Customization (This is really a stretch considering the fact that i actually like the UI used for the fire, but it is not a native android experience and thus not very customization)-No memory expansion (this would have taken the 8.9 from 5 stars to 7 stars. I understand why Amazon did not do it but it would have been nice)-No front facing camera or GPS (these are really minor issues, there was only one time where I could have used the front facing camera but I also have a smart phone so no real complaint)I love my Kindle fire HD I would recommend it to anyone.

She was always complaining that she could never get on the computer because of me!  I will not make this a long review, as others have already done so.  I will say, however, that the Kindle has exceeded all of my wife's expectations, as well as my own.  It was not difficult to set the email account up with Verizon on the Kindle.  She has enjoyed the Facebook app. and uses it daily.  She finds it very easy to surf through the Internet, and equally as easy to send and receive email.  I have had a lot of fun with Amazon Prime watching the old Western \"B\" movies...movies I have not seen in 50 years--Roy Rogers, Johnny Mack Brown, Gene Autry, etc.  There are an awful lot of movies offered through Amazon Prime that are free to download, and I find this feature to be most useful and a super value.  New owners of a Kindle get a free 30 day membership with Prime, and after that, it is $79 a year.  I expect full well to renew after the 30 days is up.  I did have one problem however;  for some reason I was unable to download videos after 10 days.  I called Amazon service on a weekend, and they told me they would turn it over to the technical department.  I called the next day to see the status of it, and was told it would take up to 3 business days to address my problem.  I received an email from Amazon late the same day, tried the video downloads, and yep, it is now working.  As far as the charger not included with the unit, I don't think that is a big deal.  I purchased a wall charger, cord, car charger and a nice protective leather (like) cover for under $15.00 over E-Bay which included shipping.  So, I was able to purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for $249.00 on a one day only sale, and I think this was a terrific value for the money.  Knowing what I know now, would I make the same decision?

That is not a problem with the Kindle, but with Amazon's marketing strategy.I would recommend a design change to put the connection ports on the side. With the Kindle in a cover, the only way to close the cover is to position the Kindle with the ports along the lower edge.

I went to a nearby store to test the actual product, and walked out shortly after that with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and immediately fell in love. I have an Asus Transformer Prime rooted and ROM'ed, but the kids don't do so well with it's large size. My three year old gets especially frustrated trying to play a game on the Asus. I got the KFHD set up with FreeTime, and he went to town with it, no frustration.The screen is worlds better, although it's over an inch smaller diagonally. Still not as bright as the iPad mini, but pound for pound, on par with the best displays on the market today.I opted to buy the 32GB WiFi only tablet, and the price was hard to beat for the included hardware. I was a little sad to see a lack of SDHC expansion, as my Asus has over 40GB full already.Battery life so far is great. Out of the box it went over six hours of continuous use before it needed charged up. I charged it overnight, and have not put it down in the last 8 hours. I watched a full movie, set up some new apps, played Angry Birds, and the processor got quite warm. It currently is holding a 40% charge. Not bad.The WiFi speeds coupled with the powerful dual core CPU clocked at 1.5ghz make for a super responsive and smooth experience during use.I was able to use WiFi hotspot on my Sprint phone to allow the KFHD 8.9 an internet connection while in the car last night, and I must say, it works so much better than the Asus ever does. I suspect the KFHD Dual Band Dual Antenna may be the difference.I was also ecstatic to learn that students get an Amazon Prime membership for only $39 PER YEAR. And with all the features that come with Prime membership, this is one of the best deals.The only disappointments I have are the lack of Google Play Store, and that the non-slip back will not allow my company's vinyl sticker to adhere. The volume of apps available from Amazon makes up for the first, and finding a case or cover will solve the latter.Bottom Line: Great product. It is not an iPad or true Android, but in many ways it is better. And I walked out of the store only having spent $400.

I was cool with that, on 11/28 it arrived way EARLIER than expected. The packaging was nice, and snug. No dirt, not wet or anything. I couldn't wait to open it ... and when I did OH WOW ! The screen is fantastic, clear and very crisp. I have even used Netflix and Amazon Prime to watch movies/videos, and the sound is very loud & clear. It has the surround sound effect. I LOVE to read, and when I read, it feels like a real book. The web browser and everything else moves very quick and easy, I haven't experienced a lag of any kind yet! Sure, It didn't come with instructions, but in this day in age, everything you need to know about anything, can be found online. It is very user friendly and initial set-up took about 5mins. I am a previous owner of a blackberry, an android smart phone, and now I have a iPhone 4s, and a Macbook Which I love! (This is my first KF, btw) True enough, it did not come with a wall charger, I was about to be charged $19.99 for the charger, until I called amazon and told them, about the promo I saw, and they immediately changed the price to $9.99. And my previous android charger, works just fine. So far so good! I have also bought a Malware Case, Screen Protector, 2-yr Protection plan and the wall charger. Which I all love, and haven't had any issues with. All together, with tax included I spent under $460 for everything. iPad is nice, I used one before, But I WILL NOT pay $200-$300 more for it. KF does/has the exact same thing, minus the two cameras, free engraving etc. I'm only giving it 4 stars, bc it doesn't have the Google Play store, I was fully aware that this device wouldn't be flash capable too.

She kept telling me she wouldn't like one, but I knew she would if she'd take the time to play around w/ it & I was right.I only bought the 16 GB model & was worried about how quick she'd fill it up.  So far, she's downloaded several books & has only used about 13 MB of space on the Kindle - this also includes a few apps that I downloaded for her.My parents have an unsecured wifi connection set up at their house & it connected w/ ease, no issues what-so-ever, as it did at my house w/ a secured connection.With that being said, I personally have the iPad 3.  As far as I'm concerned I wouldn't trade my iPad for a Kindle... ever! (Hence the 4 * rating.)  I feel like my iPad is much more responsive (screen, touch) & faster (wifi) & way more apps available.  I have the Kindle app on my iPad also, so I'm still able to download & read books if I want.  The Kindle Fire is, obviously, geared more towards avid readers, which I am not.  So, if you're a reader, I think you'll love the Kindle Fire HD, but if you want to be able to do a lot more on a tablet (& can afford it), I would recommend the iPad.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle Fire!!

I've owned an iPad 1 since it launched, and while I love it, it's recently slowed down and isn't compatible with iOS 6.  So, I had been considering moving on to a more current tablet.  The newest iPad was an obvious choice, but when I considered what I primarily used the iPad for - reading books and comics, surfing the internet while on the couch, watching video - I realized that I didn't necessarily NEED to live within Apple's ecosystem.  Sure, they offer a ton more apps, but I don't use enough of them to justify another $500 purchase.So, I looked to either the Nexus 10 or Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Ultimately, I chose the Kindle Fire HD because of its integration with the Amazon store.  I'm already a Prime member, I have a vast library of Kindle books, and I use they're Cloud music player because it works with just about any device I'd want.I'm glad I went with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It's a good, not great, device.  When I first received it, and put it through its paces, I was a little disappointed.  It doesn't run as smooth as the iPad, and again, few apps are as polished.  And then there's Silk... the world's worst browser.  It's slow, clunky, and doesn't do anything better than any other browser out there.  Fortunately, the more time I spent with the Kindle Fire HD, the more I learned about it and came to enjoy it.When you get past the fact that it's not the iPad, you can appreciate the Kindle Fire HD for what it is - an amazing e-reader that also happens to be an adequate tablet.  Seriously, this is the best Kindle experience you'll find.  Books are baked seamlessly into the OS, the Kindle UI is excellent, X-Ray is cool, and the text to speech feature works amazingly well.  Not the Audible option, mind you, but the standard text to speech option available on any book.Besides book integration, the Kindle Fire excels at delivering all Amazon content, which should be obvious.  Movies are quick to load, music stored in the Cloud work perfectly, and photos are easily synced with your Facebook account.  Again, it's just a darn good personal tablet.  The fact that it's $200 less than an entry level iPad shouldn't be ignored either.Outside of seamless access to Amazon content, the best reason to own a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is its beautiful screen.  As someone who owned an iPad before it had a retina screen, I can tell you the difference is staggering.  Everything is clear and crisp.  Reading is enjoyable, and movies have excellent black levels.  For an avid comic reader like myself, the Kindle Fire HD is a godsend.  Even though the size of the screen is slightly smaller than that of an actual comic book, everything is perfectly legible because of the high resolution.In short, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It's not an iPad, but really, you shouldn't have expected it to be.  It's a great reader (books and comics) and video player, and has an adequate number of tablet apps.  Is the lack of specialty apps worth the $200 savings?  I'd say so.  Especially if you're already knee deep in the Amazon ecosystem.  If you're a Prime member, and also use the Cloud Music Match service, it's close to a must buy.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Review", "Author": "Margie Burns", "ReviewID": "R3JYDUBADVCA5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", but I had a hard time operating it at first, have gotten better but just wish that there were better instructions on line.

For the short period of time that I have had it, I keep  finding more and more uses, things,apps and all around really neat things this Fire can do. I was a little leary of buying this, even though I have had an older model Kindle reader with apx. 160 books on it and have never had any issue of function of this product. When I received this unit I carefully unpacked and fired it up. I was so impressed with the functions, HD colors and just general feel of this product, that my main response was, WHY DID I WAIT THIS LONG TO BUY THIS UNIT! I know I have really only scratched the surface of the functions of this and can't wait to discover all.One point that I have to share is that I am a retired Law Enforcement Officer and have gone on to getting my NRA and State certification for firearm instruction. As such I haveto haul around a large laptop case and a digital projection case as well as a large rolling box with a number of firearms for demonstrative purposes. As Iget older this becomes a rather difficult venture. With the Kindle Fire HD, I was able to download the NRA program onto the Kindle and using the proper cable, etc. I now can leave my laptop at home, thereby reducing that weight, my next step is to purchase a hand held projecter, available from Amazon, and further reduce the amount of equiptment. I now can load up and go to locations and use my energy to teaching my students all the proper instruction in safely using, care and feeding of same. Point is, without the Kindle Fire HD, I would properly reduce the number of classes that I perform. Without any doubt, if the reader is thinking of purchasing any other tablet, Ipad or others take a good long look at the 8.9\" Kindle and I am sure that this will meet most, if not all.

I've had it for approximately one month and my husband is joking about how it is 'glued' to me.  Literally, I find it hard to part with it!  I have all my music at hand with Amazon's cloud, all my books, and can easily view almost any movie I wish by accessing my Netflix, HBO, or Amazon accounts.  How nice to have your whole digital library travel with you!Although I almost bought the smaller 7 inch, I'm glad I decided on this one.  It seems like the perfect compromise between the larger Ipad and the smaller tablets. Its more weighty, but I can appreciate the extra screen space and think I would have been frustrated with a smaller one.  Its nicely thin, its battery life is decent, and I've had no bugs surface yet. Getting used to the interface was very intuitive.  I do have 'Special Offers' version and don't find the ads to be a problem.I am amazed at the sound that comes from this little device-  especially pleased with the way Dolby digital can immerse you with  sound seeming to surround you.  The picture is also super-clear and I've had no problem connecting to WiFi and getting a decent signal.  Movies run great and smoothly.  As to Apps, I've found some great ones that are keeping me way too busy, and although the selection may not be as great as the Ipad has available, I'm sure the market will improve, increase, and blossom.The reason I went with the Kindle Fire HD was the good reviews its been getting and the attractive price... but Amazon's good customer service that I've enjoyed over the years definitely was a big deciding factor.  This Kindle has so far been problem-free, but I did have a small sound issue that was my fault in not understanding the controls fully.  In the Kindle's help files it gave me a choice to have Customer service call me to resolve my issue.  No sooner did I click on that then my home phone rang with a polite & helpful Amazon customer service representative asking if I needed help!  I didn't think I could be more of a fan of Amazon's customer service, but now I think I worship at their feet!!Areas that could improve on this Kindle (Nothing is ever perfect, mind you!):1) sometimes I find the 'touch' controls to be too sensitive when I am scrolling- especially albums in the music section.  Wish there was more of a border/neutral area to swipe so that I'm not constantly opening albums when I just want to do a gentle scroll.2) Shopping is way too easy...(I don't expect they would even want to change this, LOL)3) Sound and on/off button IS sometimes hard to access easily, although having a cover that turns it on/off is a plus...4) Wish it was lighter in weight (as I want to carry it everywhere)  It fits nicely in my pocketbook, but it IS a weight to carry around after a while.I rarely write reviews, but had to this time because I love this little device so!

I originally did not want a tablet; I already had a Kindle 3G (which I love) and a smart phone (which I hate) and my desktop computer for internet when I needed to do something online. I have been pleasantly surprised. I am not technologically dumb, or especially tech-savy, but contrary to many reviews I read I found the Fire to be pretty easy to use. Maybe because I took time to figure it out and had no preconceived notions or expectations? I don't know.Short versioin: Do I like it? Yes! Could I live without it? Yes. Are there things I would change? Of course. But I like it! :DLong version:-Physical features. Heavier than I expected, but manageable. Occasionally I turn it off without meaning to, usually when I'm trying to adjust the volume and hit power instead. I wish the power button lit up when plugged in to let you know if it was fully charged or charging. Its kind of wierd that the speakers are on the back of the device; the sound can either be amplified or dampened depending on where and how you have it sitting. It does not come with a charger, only a USB cord, which I think is stupid, but since I already had one from my Kindle 3G it wasnt as big a deal as it would have been. It does charge a little slower than I expected, and the battery only lasts about 8-10 hours, less if you're playing a game.-Readablilty. I like that I can adjust the screen brightness for interior light. BUT the screen glares horribly outside, even in the shade. If I know I'm going to be outside, I take my Kindle 3G instead. Otherwise, I have no problems.-Ease of use. I don't know how other tablets are set up, since this is my first, but I find it fairly easy. The carousel holds all of the content you have accessed recently so you can scroll through and find what you want. There are also tabs at the top marked games, books, apps, etc so that you can search by media type. There is a search bar above that, but I haven't used it at all so can't say whether or not it's good. When away from the home page, a bar at the bottom offers home, back, search, and favorite buttons. You drag down the top bar for settings, which is where you go for parental controls, applications, security, etc. Books in the carousel tell you the percentage you've read at the top corner, but I do wish I could sort my books into \"read\", \"new\", etc, like the regular Kindles. Overall, I think it's pretty simple.-Preloaded content. The HD comes preloaded with a few things I find helpful, such as Skype, Facebook, Pandora, and an email management program that allows me access to multiple email accounts from one location, which I really like. It also comes with Kindle Free Time (which my kids are mostly too old for), OfficeSuite (which I'm still trying to figure out if I even need) and IMDB (which for me is a waste of space). You cannot remove these from the device. Why must this stuff take up space if I am not going to use it, EVER? They are not necessary, so why are they there? That's that much more space I could have for books! But then again, they only bug me when I notice them, which is not very often.-Silk browser/WiFi. I had a bit of trouble connecting to the internet at first, but a 15-20 minute phone conversation with tech support got the problem (my router, not the Kindle) sorted out. I have taken my Kindle all over and had no problems with the WiFi anywhere that has a signal, even a low one. Even out in the boonies. Silk browser works fine for me, have no problems with speed unless my internet service is being wonky. It comes with Bing.com as the default search engine, but you can change this in the settings. Absolutely love that I can use it for recipes without having to drag the laptop to my tiny kitchen!-Movie/sound quality. I have only watched YouTube and FB videos so far, so no movie opinions yet. YT and FB seem to be fine, relative to the quality uploaded to the site. Sound is better than my laptop, not as good as my iPod. Again, wierd that the speakers are on the bottom.-Camera. I dislike that the camera only faces one way. To take pics of something other than yourself, you have to turn it and look at a wierd angle. Pic quality was not great, either, but that might have been operator error.-Shopping. The Fire HD has two quick-links to Amazon shopping; the \"Shop\" tab at the top, and the \"Shop Amazon\" widget in the carousel. My biggest complaint is that when shopping for books and apps the page is a little hard to navigate. In all fairness, I'm comparing the \"computer store\" to the \"tablet store\", but it seems that some categories available on the computer are not available on the tablet. I can still find what I'm looking for, but it takes longer, especially if just browsing.-The ads. A lot of people have a problem with the preloaded ads on the Kindle. If an ad doesn't interest me, I don't pay it any attention, just like tv. The recommendations at the bottom of the carousel also don't bother me, and if they do, I can turn it off. If you think they will bother you, then either get the more expensive one with no preloaded ads, or pay the $15 or whatever to have them removed.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Changes made from the original, not good changes!", "Author": "Jeramie Coffelt", "ReviewID": "R35IV1CM2VASVF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A couple of things, first Flash is NO LONGER SUPPORTED.

Of them all, I like the Kindle App on my iPad the best (because it allows outside content to be saved on it, ie not only from Amazon). Apart from that, I like, or dislike, each of the Kindles for different reasons.Since this review is about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", I'll just refer to the others where it's relevant.Bear in mind that I'm 72, and I'm Australian (with an Australian billing address), and I'm currently in South Korea (where I'll be for a while). Those three pieces of information are relevant to what I have to say.KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9\"When I bought my Kindle Fire HD, I was actually on a trip to America. Naively, I thought that - having bought the Kindle Fire HD in America (although using my Australian billing address), I'd be able to download movies, for watching while I'm traveling around (which I do a lot). Moreover, I thought I would be able to join Amazon Prime, and have access to all the thousands of movies, and TV programs, that Prime members can download - just for their $79-per-year subscription. Also, I expected that I'd be able to get access to individual songs, as MP3 downloads.However, despite the fact that, as soon as I got my Kindle Fire HD, I was sent an e-mail from Amazon, telling me all the wonderful things I'd get as a Prime subscriber (including free 2-day shipping) - and giving me a one-month trial to boot - I could not, in fact, be a Prime member.  As soon as I tried to activate Prime, I was told that I was geographically restricted - couldn't even get one-track MP3 downloads. It seems that - to get into the Prime deal - one must have a US billing address, and a US home address.So that was a big disappointment. I was initially so miffed that I thought I'd return the Kindle Fire HD to Amazon, especially since I was still in the US at the time I found I would be subject to geographic restriction. But I kept the Kindle Fire HD because I realized that it was better for a few other functions, than either the Kindle Keyboard, or the Paperwhite.PLUS FACTORS for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"1) AUDIOBOOKSIt seems that audiobooks don't have geographic restrictions, as movies, TV programs, and music have. So I've bought several audiobooks and, although the speakers aren't really powerful, they are powerful enough, if you are sitting in a quiet room, to hear the book reading very clearly. In addition, it's possible to use a bluetooth speaker, to get louder sound if it's wanted. Since I majored in English Literature - many years ago! - I'm on a mission to listen my way through all of the classics of the English language (which is so much more relaxing, via listening, than doing all that eye-wearing reading, with a hard-to-hold paperback that won't stay open at the pages you want it to). For example, I've just finished listening to \"The Great Gatsby\" and that was easy listening - except that the reader, Jake Gyllenhaal, wasn't able to project any sort of vocal personality for the all-important females - Daisy in particular. Just listening to Jake Gyllanhaal's effort to \"find\" a voice for Daisy (unsuccessfully) left me feeling there'd be no way that a listener/reader (who didn't already know the book well) could believe in Gatsby's obsession with a Daisy that the wish-washy unnoticeable voice personality that Jake Gyllenhaal's narration assigned to her.Given that it would surely not be easy for a man to render the voice of a young, upper-class, beautiful temptress, with any subtlety or authenticity, I think Audible should use cheaper unknown actors, so the budget could stretch to both a male and female narrator. What Audible seems to be doing is trying to tempt buyers by hiring big-name actors to do the narration. If Jake Gyllenhaal's no-impact rendition of Daisy is an example of the worth of using famous actors, it's a strategy that could backfire.2) MUSIC VIA THE AMAZON CLOUDAlthough I can't get single-track MP3 downloads, I can get instant music to the Kindle Fire HD, if I buy CDs (with AutoRip). As soon as you pay for those CDs - to be delivered to somewhere (anywhere for CDs - expensive shipping to Korea or Australia, but cheap to a friend in America, especially with free shipping for an order over $25), all of the songs are automatically delivered to your Kindle Fire HD (as well as to your PC, Kindle App, etc.) So I'm very happy with that - I've now got about 17 albums loaded up: everything from Vera Lynn and Frank Sinatra to Jackie Evancho and Josh Groban. As I write now, on my PC, I have \"David Foster: Hit Man and Friends\" playing in the background (on the Kindle Fire) - a bit away from me, rather than blasting out of the PC in front of me, to distract me.3) GADGET/SOFTWARE INSTRUCTION BOOKS (IN KINDLE FORMAT)Amazon has zillions of instruction books for IT gadgets and software programs: Kindle Fire HD itself, iPad, Android, Dropbox, Evernote, etc. For those sorts of instruction books - which have colored pictures, and screenshots, it's useless trying to learn from them, on a Kindle Keyboard, or Kindle Paperwhite: the pictures, tables, and screenshots don't translate well into black and white format, and the screens are too small to be able to get  \"pageful\" of text and graphics at the same time. I've never used a Kindle Fire 7\", but I'd expect that Kindle to also have a screen which is be too small for these kinds of instructions book. But the screen size of the Kindle Fire HD is perfect for showing pretty much the information (plus graphics) that would fit on the page of a real book - or on the iPad screen.A second advantage of having those gadget/software instruction books on the Kindle Fire HD is that you can keep the \"pages\" open on the Kindle Fire while you are trying out operations and techniques on, for example, the Kindle App on the iPad, or on the iPad itself. So it's really like having a book beside you.A third advantage is that, if you had those instruction books on an iPad, (for using as a reference book \"beside\" you, while you learn on another gadget), too much of the iPad charge is being used up to keep the books \"open\" for long periods of time. (It seems that the iPad gobbles up power a lot faster than the Kindle Fire HD does.) So, if you keep the iPad on its default auto-off setting (2 mins), to save the charge, it keeps turning itself off - unless you are actually touching the screen. The Kindle Fire HD stays \"on\" better, because there's not such a risk of running out of power too soon, if you leave it set at a higher time period for auto-off (such as 30 mins). Of course, it's possible to set both gadgets to \"Never\" to keep them on all the time you want that \"reference book\" open beside you - and I did that once, with the iPad. But I forgot to put it back to \"2 mins\" when I'd finished. So the iPad stayed on \"forever\" - presumably keeping a sensor fully employed, checking for Wifi hotspots wherever I went (even though it wouldn't have found many that I could connect to, since I don't have a cell-phone with a Wifi hotspot). The result was that, the next time I went to use the iPad - thinking it was still well charged - it was stone dead! Well, the Kindle Fire HD doesn't run out of charge as fast as the iPad, so it seems safe to leave it set on something like 30 minutes (auto-off) all the time - although it would probably be a good idea to set it back to 5 minutes, when finished using it.4)GOOD FONT/BACKGROUND COLOR OPTION FOR GLARE-SENSITIVE EYESI have eyes that are very sensitive to glare - white glare from screens, and glossy surfaces. The Kindle Fire HD, unfortunately, has a very glossy screen (compared to the Kindle Keyboard, and Kindle Paperwhite). But I've found a very good way to deal with that glare, such that I can comfortably read from the Kindle Fire HD screen. You can choose your default screen colours - with three options: black font on white background; black font on off-white (sort of like the Kindle Keyboard buff color), and white font on black background. I find that, even with the Kindle Fire HD's glossy screen, I can read very comfortably with that white lettering on a black background. It's a great way to reduce all the glare we get from white screens.NEGATIVE FACTORS for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"1. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTION FOR MOVIES, TV PROGRAMS, MP3 MUSIC DOWNLOADS, AND PRIMEOne big negative, for me, was outlined above: with an Australian bill-paying account, I can't download movies, TV programs, or MP3 music tracks - or be a member of Amazon Prime (although on my account screen, I keep getting messages that inform me I should join Prime, to reduce the shipping charges that I'm incurring - to Korea,mostly, and that's definitely not a free 2-day deal).2. KINDLE KEYBOARD AND KINDLE PAPERWHITE BETTER FOR READING LONG BOOKSDespite being able to set the screen for white lettering on a black background, it's nowhere near as comfortable to read lengthy books (such as novels) on the glossy KINDLE FIRE HD screen - and it's quite a bit heavier to hold up. For general book reading, I actually prefer the Kindle Keyboard best of all - with the e-ink off-white background that's not so glary, although it's handy to have back-lighting on the Paperwhite for reading at night, on airplanes.3. CAN'T PLACE YOUR ITEM ICONS WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT THEM, AND MAKE THEM STAY THERE!If you've got a lot of books loaded on to the Kindle Fire HD (and this is also relevant for the iPad Kindle App), you can't make them stay on the Home screen, in some order that suits you. It always happens that, as soon as you access one book, it comes to the top of the heap (so to speak), and so you've lost your grouping of similar kinds of books. In my case, I've got a bunch of RV books, many Instruction books for gadgets, various Travel guides, and Novels, etc. So it annoys the hell out of me when I've gone to the trouble to have all similar books \"sitting\" arranged beside each other, on the Home screen display. Then, as soon as I access one book, that book comes to the top of the display (or the beginning of the display), and will then end up mixed up with other books that are not in a similar category.Now, compare this with iBooks, on the iPad - which is excellent from this point of view.When you save a book for reading in iBooks, you can hold your finger on the book (or pdf) icon, and then move the icon to wherever you want it to be, in your collection. Subsequently, having placed each icon where you want it to be, it stays there - such that, every time you access that book (or pdf), or any other, the items go back \"to bed\" at the place on the \"bookrack\" where you put them. Not only does that allow you to keep all your collections grouped together, but it also facilitates developing a visual memory of where particular books or pdf files are, on the bookshelf - very useful if you've got a large collection of pdf files, and they all look pretty much alike, until you bring them up on to the reading screen where you can read the \"cover\" print more easily.This feature (or non-feature) is particularly a pain (on the Kindle iPad app), with Lonely Planet pdf files of their guidebooks. Lonely Planet has a few guidebooks as single-file pdf files. But, mostly, they supply the books as a bunch of separate chapters (like mini-books)- without an overall single-file pdf for the books that you've bought. So, just imagine what a mess you can get into with all those individual chapters - especially since the topics of the individual chapters can't easily be read until you bring them up fully on the screen. In addition, for almost all of the guidebooks that come in chapter bundles, the background colors are the same. Each country group of chapters has a unique picture on the cover of every chapter in the collection, but the pictures are small and you can't really see them until you bring a book (a chapter mini-book) up for reading.Consequently, you get a really messy situation because of Kindles (for the iPad app, or stand-alone Kindles)not allowing you to place your books, in the display, where you want them - and where they will return to after use. For instance, if I bring up a chapter of \"Nicaragua\" (out of perhaps 13 chapters), and then I bring up a chapter of \"Columbia\", and then one of \"Bolivia\" and also \"Peru\" - all of which I've got on my iPad (saved in both the Kindle App, and iBooks) - I end up with all of the chapters totally scrambled in the filing system; that occurs because no one chapter goes back to \"its place\" among the other chapters for the guidebook that it belongs to.So I have to use up more of my iPad's memory than I'd like, by saving all those chapter pdf files into both places: in iBooks, to keep the chapters where I want them to be \"filed\"; in the Kindle App, so I can access the contents page, touch on a topic in the contents, and get taken immediately wherever I choose to go. (With iBooks, for the same LP guide books, you can't access the contents page as a list, touch on a topic you want to go to, and be routed instantly to that topic - a very helpful feature of the Kindle App.)4. CAN'T USE THE AMAZON CLOUD TO COPY PDF FILES)FROM THE iPAD KINDLE APP TO THE KINDLE FIRE HD.When I buy those pdf files of guidebooks, from Lonely Planet (and they are not the same as buying Kindle-ized books of LP guidebooks - which are usually awful, with unreadable maps), I can save those pdf files to the Kindle App on the iPad, and that's fine - except for the mini-book chapters not staying where I want them to stay! However, the Amazon Cloud doesn't seem to allow me to then copy those pdf files on to the Kindle Fire HD - where I'd really like to have them.Imagine wandering around the back streets of just about any Latin American city (where I intend to be for some months of next year), with your iPad in your hand for consulting your off-Wifi guidebook. If you're foolish enough to be doing that - particularly an old woman like me - there's a pretty good chance some local desperado will grab the iPad and run. On the other hand, a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" would be a way less attractive trophy for a street-roaming snatcher (one who can tell an iPad from a Kindle Fire HD!); the Kindle Fire HD would also be much lighter for carrying around all day, and consulting; plus, even if the Kindle Fire HD does get grabbed, it's a whole lot cheaper to replace than an iPad.So I'd really like the Amazon Cloud to allow copying of pdf files from my iPad Kindle App, to my Kindle Fire HD. It's probably possible but I can't figure out how to do it. The Amazon Cloud doesn't seem to want to talk to anything not directly bought from Amazon, even if the pdf files are now \"in the Amazon system\" by virtue of being saved into the Kindle App on the iPad. .Now, here's the point of this for Amazon's bottom line. The Kindle Fire HD, as we all know, was designed to make it easy for all of us to buy Amazon books, audiobooks, movies, etc - although I, with an Australian billing address, can't manage to buy movies, TV programs, MP3 downloads (or join Amazon Prime). We know, and accept, that this gadget was definitely not dreamed up by Amazon, to facilitate open-sourced buying. But you would think that a Kindle App on an iPad would be able to talk to a stand-alone Kindle, via the Amazon Cloud. Seems not - friends only if Apple is the friendship broker.Nevertheless, it seems to me that Amazon could benefit from allowing Lonely Planet pdf files to be transferred, via the Amazon Cloud, to a Kindle Fire HD. Why? Well, as most people have probably discovered, it's nice to do all the travel research on an electronic gadget. But, when it comes to the boots-on-the-ground traveling, nothing beats having an actual dead-tree guidebook - extensively thumbed, and defaced with with notes, stickers on pages, and highlighted text. It's very difficult to have those user-friendly possibilities if you are interacting with any kind of tablet, except for trivialities - such as the best places to sleep or eat.Therefore, allowing Lonely Planet's pdf files to be uploaded on to one's Kindle Fire HD, from an iPad Kindle app, would probably produce sales, from Amazon, of the real books when the travel time comes. Why again? It's way cheaper to buy the actual LP books from Amazon than from Lonely Planet, even if you live in Lonely Planet's country: Australia. For me, the price of buying an LP guidebook, in Australia, is about twice the price that I'd pay from Amazon (with no shipping charge, if I was passing through America, on my way to all those Latin American countries, and had the books delivered to my USA-transit accommodation, before my arrival in America).For example, I made a trip just to San Francisco about three months ago and, despite having some LP chapters, for San Francisco, on my iPad (as pdf files - before my arrival), I still bought two other SF guidebooks, from Amazon, and had them delivered to the place I intended staying at, in SF. Plus, also from Amazon on that SF trip, I bought several real guidebooks for Japan: Tokyo, Kyoto, Walking in Japan, etc.So if Amazon allows the uploading of LP pdf files on to a Kindle Fire HP - as Amazon Cloud transfers from an iPad Kindle Fire app, it doesn't mean that Amazon will go broke supporting non-Amazon booksellers. In fact, by allowing such transfers, it just builds greater customer loyalty to Amazon, and its Kindles - AND it's pretty good advertising if little old ladies, like me, are wandering around Nicaragua, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Costa Rica - and Japan - with their Kindle Fire HD's constantly on show. Amazon couldn't get that kind of advertising if the company paid for it!Therefore, I think there is a good reason for Amazon not to block pdf files from other publishers - especially from guidebook publishers, such as Lonely Planet, and especially if the pdf files are already in the Amazon system, saved into a Kindle App on an iPad..", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Good Tablet for a Good Price, but Not Without Some Drawbacks", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3CFX2CRLKRCQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HD is a very good tablet for the price. I quickly bought the first generation Fire upon its release, and it was my first tablet. After using that smaller tablet for over a year, I decided to pick up the larger 8.9 inch HD model. After using it, I must say I actually prefer a smaller, 7 inch tablet. This is not a knock against the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, just a personal preference of mine regarding the size.The Pros:The price is a big selling point, in my opinion. I do not believe you can find another tablet this size for a cheaper price, but I may be wrong.The graphics and resolution are wonderful, and colors are very vibrant!The operating system is a step-up from first generation Kindles, but still not perfect (more on that in a bit).Some areas of content have a great selection! If you want to watch movies on your tablet, this is a great one to have! Amazon has a very good selection of films to rent or buy. And of course, don't forget about books. Amazon's selection of books is unmatched, and purchasing and downloading are very easy. I especially like how Kindles \"communicate\" between each other. For example, if I stop reading on my Kindle Fire HD, my other Kindle knows where I left off, which makes reading across devices very easy. The fact that all Kindles on an account sync with each other, if you want them to, is very helpful.The Cons:The app store just isn't very good. There are some decent games (my son enjoys many of them) but not anywhere close to the games available for Apple, or even Google Play for that matter. There are even fewer productivity apps, which is a big drawback for me. There also seems to be quite a few cheaply made, low quality bad apps. Because of this, the Fire is essentially a device to consume media on-that's it! If you're wanting to edit video or play around with photos, you'll be disappointed by the Fire.The camera is pretty weak, and is really only for video conferencing.The operating system, as noted elsewhere, is a heavily modified Android (and by heavily modified, I mean basically unrecognizable). I have an Apple phone, and love the iOS. I have never used a straight Android operating system, but only played around with devices. From my very limited experience, I think the unmodified Android is far better than what Amazon gives us on the Fire, and wish they would stop tinkering with it so much.Rumor has it a Kindle Fire HD 2 will be available later in 2013, and upon its release I look forward to seeing what improvements have been made. If enough enhancements have been done, I will most likely buy a 7 inch. While the Kindle Fire is not the best family of tablets, it is a good tablet at a good price that fits perfectly into the Amazon ecosystem of which I am firmly entrenched.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "a ebook reader with tablet function", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1HNZPN3EP8HR2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to say, I have high expectation of this kindle fire hd. I've used it for a few months now, and I feel disappointed. The pros are obvious, I like the high res screen, the amazon content, both books and prime videos. These are big big advantage over the ipad and other tablets, and that's the reason I didn't return it.The CONS are so many, I just list a few I don't like the most:1. low quality apps. not many really useful apps you can find. The app quality is worse. Take skype for example, it always drops connection, and has much lower video quality than my ipad2. my old ipad2 seldom drops connection.2. Web browser app, Silk, is a pain. I don't know how many people really use it to browse the web. It's slow, inefficient. even with its much larger screen, I still prefer browse on my iphone use chrome.3. Even the native kindle book reader app, is not as good as on iOS. Though amazon brag it's audio book sync function, but i don't find that much useful for me. To activate the dictionary, you need to pinpoint your finger right on the words very precisely, I often find myself trying two or three times before get the right words I want to touch. But using Kindle app on iOS, I never had this problem. Guess it's mostly due to the kindle fire operating system amazon stocked.4. Battery life is a pain as well. I didn't tested seriously, but in my impression, it's way worse than ipad2. I used ipad2 more than this kindle fire hd, but charge ipad2 less frequently.5. The audio quality is a selling point when Bezos introduce this kindle fire hd in the keynotes, but I have to say, when watching videos, I always felt the sound is too little and it feels like the sound goes away from me (rather than towards me). Speakers are on the back, maybe that's the reason. But why ipad2 doesn't give me this feeling? I am so confused.All in all, you get what you paid for.

And before anyone has a chance to question it, though this is not a verified purchase, I DO own this device. My folks were kind enough to let me purchase this through my Dad's account, and pay him back over time. But anyhooooo, about the device...The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was how thin the Fire was! The original Fire, though I absolutely love mine, was rather blocky. My new baby was charged up, so I turned it on and checked out the picture. Absolutely freaking beautiful! Before I really played with it, I plugged it in and charged it up. No, a charger was not included with it. But I READ the product description and knew that, so I had already ordered the quick charger, even though I already had other chargers.When it was pretty quickly charged, I got down to some serious playing. I have to admit that I am totally blown away by the beauty of the picture. I don't own any other HD devices, so I was not prepared for just how gorgeous the images would be. I was easily able to explore the Fire, as the quick tutorial explained what was needed to get started. I loaded a number of books, lots of music and apps, and some pictures. I am thrilled that this device can be loaded with my personal pictures. It was extremely easy to do through the cloud. And they look fantastic!I checked out the sound. Dang, Green Day and Pink sounded absolutely awesome coming through the Dolby speakers! No, it doesn't sound like a Bose sound system, but come on....this is a tablet. I think it sounds fabulous. Haven't tried it with headphones yet, but I will.I then played on the reading app. Love it! Though I do most of my reading on my Kindle Keyboard and Paperwhite, it will be very easy to read on this device. Everything was crisp and clear...I especially like the sepia background; it's very easy on the eyes.Now we come to the apps. No, not all of the apps I had on the original Fire would load onto the Fire HD. Nor did I expect them too. And I frankly don't care. If I want to play them, I'll play on the original Fire. Rooting? Side loading? Huh? Nope, don't even want to attempt that. I'm very pleased with the content I can get for my device from Amazon. I bought this tablet for entertainment purposes. And I know as time goes by, more apps will be adapted to work for the Fire HD. The 8.9\" screen makes such a huge difference when playing apps. I no longer worry about going blind playing Mahjong on my smaller screen!I then decided to check out some TV episodes I bought. Copper looks fantastic on the HD screen! I also checked a Prime movie - X-ray is such an awesome idea. No more going crazy trying to figure out who is playing a particular role; I just look it up without having to go to the web. Watching movies is truly a beautiful experience on the Fire HD. I haven't used HDMI (did I type that correctly?). I don't have an HD TV. Besides, I like to watch on my 8.9\" screen.My Yahoo and Hotmail e-mail accounts were easily set up. I like the e-mail app on the Fire HD better than the one on the original Fire. I went to the browser and put my favorite websites on and bookmarked them. This device is much faster than the Fire. I will admit that the browser locked up and reset a few times. I'm using a stylus, and sometimes I tap more than I should (which I did on the original Fire because I had to). I'm getting used to the screen, though, and it's happening less as time goes by. And I have had tabs not respond; but they recover so quickly, it's a total non-issue for me.I believe Amazon Prime is a MUST if you own this device. Besides the free shipping on millions of items, you WILL want the free Prime TV shows and movies to get the most out of your Fire HD.I highly recommend the Fire HD 8.9\" 32GB with no hesitation whatsoever. I mentioned some of the asinine reviews I read and would like to touch on a few points. If you read the product description, you will know what this device can and cannot do. Unless you live under a rock, I don't know how anyone doesn't know that Adobe no longer supports flash and is no longer used on new android devices. And I can't say I know absolutely for sure what flash is, but I know I don't miss it! Same goes for the device not coming with a charger; it's not listed in what comes in the box, and it has been discussed here more than once.. Someone said his Fire HD had sharp edges. Eh? Still trying to figure that one out! The edges of mine are very nicely rounded, thank you very much. There's no forward facing camera! Call me crazy, but if I want to take pictures, I use a camera (or my cell phone if it's a \"photo emergency\"). Reviews have downgraded the device because of packaging or delivery times. Sorry, but what does that have to do with the performance of the device? There were also the reviews that were not reviews of the Fire HD, but were plugs for their favored Nook or Apple devices. Then there are the defectivebydesign mindless Zombie reviews. No comment. But my favorite bad review was the guy who couldn't stand touchscreen devices.

I ordered the 8.9\" after my original Kindle messed up in a major way. Before I go into the details about this product, I must give a shout-out to Amazon's customer service team for the excellent way they treated me when my first Kindle messed up. It was almost out of warranty, but they still sent me this particular item at a deep discount. They were very polite about everything, and I got it 2 days later. I am now a loyal Amazon customer.This particular Kindle's screen is bigger and clearer, it has dual speakers on the back, and comes with the option of turning on Dolby Digital Stereo from the Kindle screen's menu. It has volume controls on the side which enable you to change the volume in a hurry if need be or if you don't want to mess up your viewing experience with the drop-down volume screen. By the way, it appears to sound better when laid on a table than when it is being held up. It has dual plug-in ports: an hdmi port and a charger port. The problem I have with this is that they are very similar looking in size. One is just slightly bigger than the other. So please be careful when plugging it into the charger and make sure you use the right one. Overall I am really satisfied with this product.As to small details having to do with customization, the only drawbacks are that this particular model does not support Go Launcher or allow wallpaper apps to work. ADW launcher works just fine however, if you don't care for the carousel-style screen and want something even more tablet-like. It is a bit more delicate than the original first generation so I would be careful about letting a child play around with it. If you have a child and want to get them their first real tablet, I would go with the original 7\" Kindle 1st generation.

I did not like the fact that being only roughly 4 yrs old Apple has decided not to support it anymore with ios updates. This will eventually make my apps worthless as some already were becoming because they required the newer ios.With that said, I decided to look into the Kindle Fire HD 32gb. What I discovered was that it did everything that I previously used my Ipad for. Sure the App store is more limited but the trade off for me anyway was getting a Prime membership so I could use the instant movies/TV shows, borrow a free book a month and upgraded shipping. I really like being able to stream shows while I ride my exercise bike and the Kindle does a fantastic job of that.The other consideration was the Kindle Fire HD has a way better price point. I just could not see spending so much money again for an Ipad that might one day in the near future not be supported again and become nothing but a paper weight.I'm impressed with the picture quality. Streaming works flawlessly. Apps work great. Speakers sound good and produce enough volume. Syncing your Kindle with new Apps or updates is easy and learning how to use it was simple and straight forward.Cons: Battery life seems short. I've improved it some by reducing the screen brightness. Charging is really slow. I am using a 5w charger. Maybe I'll give the 9w Amazon charger a try to see if that speeds it up a bit. 19.99 seems overpriced though.I do miss being able to customize my lock screen and other screens. Oh well, not really a big deal. I did not pay the 15.00 to remove the Ads. They really are not intrusive so I will save the money.Again, the App store being limited is a con. So you need to consider that and look over Amazon's App store to decide if you can live with that. I also think the App store needs more Apps that are made for Kindle Fire HD and not just Android phones. Hopefully it will continue to grow!Suggestion: If you are looking for a cover for your Kindle try the one Amazon makes. I just got mine and it is well made, slim and works well doing the auto on/off. You can also easily fold the cover back and it is still slim in your hands.

My experience with the updated Silk is much better.  It hasn't crashed once and it seems considerably faster.  Since I purchased the Kindle a few months ago, I have gotten more familiar with the web interface, but it still isn't as intuitive to use as those on my Android phone  or iPod browser. I changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars based on the updated Silk software. I would probably give it 3 1/2 stars as I really enjoy the tablet, but I only use it for a few things.  I don't use it for emails or web browsing as much as I would like since it's not completely user friendly, but at least it doesn't crash anymore.My original review follows:I bought a certified Kindle HD 8.9 with expectations that I would be using it primarily for watching movies and TV shows.  I should preface my critique by admitting that I'm a huge Amazon fan (and stockholder), and take a neutral stance when it comes to product reviews.  With that, I feel the Kindle HD 8.9 is a very flawed product, especially with respect to its software and interface.I have pretty much given up using the Silk web browser, as it freezes continually. My ipod touch and android phone work more reliably than the Kindle for browsing.  Further, it seems  Silk is much more invasive when it comes to tracking activities, e.g., \"Individual Website Data\" settings are difficult to view and clear.  I certainly would avoid doing any financial transactions with Silk (note: I'm not a tech head, so perhaps others may find an easy work-around, but Silk just \"feels\" less secure than surfing on Chrome or Safari).The screen and sound are top-notch, and while Amazon over-hypes the quality of sound, it is clear and amplifies more than other tablets. Hi-fidelity it is not, but that's appropriate given the size of the device.  The screen isn't as vibrant as an Apple screen, but it is ample for viewing almost everything.  For photographers viewing pictures, note that the Kindle screen doesn't have a neutral white balance.  Pics are sharp and vibrant, but color accuracy is off a bit- biased slightly to a green hue (on min, at least).Books looks great, but the device is a bit heavy (especially with a cover) for hand holding for any length of time.I requested a return on the item after experiencing stunningly bad web surfing, but begrudgingly decided to keep it due to the relative positive book and movie viewing experience.  Early May, Amazon said their web developers were working on fixing the issues with their Silk browser in the \"next few weeks,\" but I haven't noticed any improvement as of 6/20/13.If I had a do-over, I think I would have chosen a Nexus, Samsung or Apple Mini, but given the reasonable refurbished price for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and its capable book and movie delivery, I'm semi-content for now.Last, the \"Ad\" version seems very user friendly - I don't find it annoying at all; in fact I hardly notice it, so I would delay spending an additional $15 to remove the ads when purchasing, and remove it later if you find it obtrusive.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my Refurbished Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"  with data package", "Author": "SCRN soccer mom \"soccer mom\"", "ReviewID": "R39IJIGL6VJ0HA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally ordered a refurbished Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" wifi only and it was great but decided I really wanted to be able to use it anytime, anywhere.

I bought a case to use with my Kindle which makes it much easier to use as it turns on/off when I open and close the case plus the buttons are much easier to see on the case as it's a lighter color.I don't like the charge port being on the bottom of the unit as when I'm watching movies I like to keep it charging and the cord at the bottom gets in the way.

I really liked what I saw. From the day it arrived, I have gone nowhere without it. It has become such an integral part of how I do things. It has been the tool I did not know I was looking for. It's like carrying a personal office manager, research library, on-the-go resource environs, all your leisure time beneficial stuff, an audio & visual entertainment center, and more.

It is easy on the eyes and displays even color text and photos flawlessly.  However, beyond that, it is a disaster.The means of navigating through a given book is slow and inexact, causing significant delays and frustration in finding any particular location in a publication.  Further, the only options for listing the books on the Fire 8.9 are full color mini-covers of each book or a somewhat smaller 'list' format that displays the books in small horizontal bars with an image of the front cover and a text description of title and author.  In either case, it is necessary to physically scroll through the titles (which are arranged alphabetically) to find any specific book.Once a book has been located, navigating within the book is equally slow and frustrating.  One must basically use a tedious scrolling through each individual page by pulling a finger across the screen either from right to left or left to right dependent on which direction in the book one is moving.Further, there is no reasonable means of grouping books, as was available on the DX, either by category or author.

I was okay with that, the main reason that I bought it was for reading technical software books that lose a lot if the code samples are not shown in color and on a larger screen. I still planned on reading my normal books (Physics and Sci-Fi/Fantasy - Yes I am a geek) on my Kindle Touch.The Kindle Fire works great for the purpose and my software books are wonderful to read in full color.The second reason that I purchased it was for the Amazon prime integration. I have prime and the lure of having the tablet play the free movies helped me go this route instead of a regular Android tablet with the Kindle App. Actually I was at first impressed with the quality of this and so were my coworkers. The trivia app is actually cool, but then I began to realize the only time I sit down and watch movies is when I am flying and have really never played with it again. I also found that there is an Android Prime application for the PS3 and so this feature became unimportant real quick. Still a beautiful feature if you are going to use it.So finally, why did I rate it as a mediocre product? Simple, as noted in the previous comments, I am a tech geek and a software developer. I don't think that the interface is bad for the basic user who is not someone like me where I take every device I have and make a workflow that works for me. However this device has no way to do this.An example: My Android Phone. On my phone I lay out my pages by how I use them such as a section for the calendar and a section for games. This is actually similar to the way the Kindle lays out its own pages. The difference is the \"home\" page. On the Kindle it is a non-useful scrolling of the applications in the order of last use. On my phone, the first thing that greats me is the weather for the day (as I am also a runner/biker/dog walker) and then my work email, personal email. On the Fire, I cannot display the weather but I can get an App for it, go to the apps page, and then load it and then it will be added to the list on the front page in front of my work email. Basically there is no way for the Kindle Fire to greet me with the information I require on first use. So I cannot use it for my daily needs, it becomes a reader.Even the pages that are like my normal workflow have no customization that I can easily find. In the apps, the order on the page is whatever the device decides so finding the weather app is not as easy as if I could put it at the top of the list.The final lack of customization is that you can view photos but you cannot change the screensavers. Okay I am being very picky but customization of the screen saver makes me feel like I own the product and makes the product easy to identify from others. Lay my Fire down with 10 others and I would not be able to identify it quickly at all without buying add ons.In the end I use this as an E-reader for texts that require color for more understanding. I use it maybe once a week since I busy with other work right now. Compare that to my phone which is almost hourly and my Kindle touch which I use to read at home to unwind daily, and this purchase may have not been the best for me. Perhaps a different customizable tablet with the E-Reader app would have been better.However for the general user that doesn't want to bother with the advanced features, I would probably have rated it at a four or a little higher but it just does not meet my life's workflow.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyers Remorse", "Author": "dave", "ReviewID": "R19J1EU68PE987", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall it's good product, but I should have completed a little more research on the availability of certain apps I expected to be available on the Kindle.

I don't know the details of why Amazon does this (probably to tether all customers to Amazon), but they have an Amazon special Economist program that cost about $10 a month.  Not a bad price for the magazine, but you have to pay for it even if you have a hard copy subscription.  For the extra cost you would be better off buying an iPad.

I enjoy rising early on weekends and reading the paper (which I now do on the Kindle Fire HD) with jazz playing in the background.  One morning, my wife heard me from another room, and she thought the music was coming from a different source--an outstanding, and expensive, high tech name brand stereo itself--and was just as blown away as I was that first time I heard how nice it sounds.

Amazon designed the Fire HD to confine you to their system and limited storage to encourage subscribing to Amazon Prime for the cloud . You learn quickly any content there is lost if your subscription to prime lapses  . If your not open to that you more then likely should just buy a smart phone from Google ,  Microsoft's  Shadow RT , or at least a non modified Android entry .To say the makers of devices do not get along is a understatement . Google and Apple does not recognize the existence of the Kindle so you can't purchase from their ap store as a kindle owner nor are their conversion programs to convert them to useable . You can get around many of the shortcomings of the Kindle fire except for the lack of applications for which their is little motivation to write . Myself I believe the 7 inch model is the best deal as it is 1/3rd or less the price and you can use text to speech on books or increase the font size of print to solve the smaller screen size . Being able to just carry it on your belt or in a purse is priceless the 8.9 inch tablet really needs a 10.2 laptop case . I bought the one from case logic for $13 roughly and it fits the keyboard from Amazon basics perfectly  .You cannot upgrade the devices memory so buy as much as you can afford . I am so upset at myself for buying the 16gb model . It didn't take long to fill the memory up once you put on antivirus , some pictures , and video is a real resource hog . So far I have not learned how to add a flash drive . If I find a workaround for that I would be much more satisfied as I could free myself from the cloud . It was a nice find to use the Dolphin Browser for flash and Calibre on a desktop to download and rewrite books in the kindle format AZW3 .I hadn't read a book in years having bad eyes and suffering from severe chronic pain yet I took to it right away with the kindle . I wanted to use this while traveling but I now find my banks do not have applications that work with the kindle so it is merely a reader and video player limited to wifi though with Dolphin I can use the internet and purchase at most stores. I passed on the 4g since I saw how restrictive ATT was with a throttled data plan as well as expensive . Nothing short of the Sprint unlimited  plan would be acceptable for use . Someday someone will have satellite service you can plug in through the USB and I can't wait . Would be a great space for Hughs , Dish or even Garmin to enter . Would be nice if you could use a remote tuner just to access news and weather when off grid but so far I have not found a hint anything exists for that .So this is a nice machine but very limited and more for those who want to watch video where wifi exists and read lots of content of which not all is available for the machine  . Plan on using a small laptop bag or purse and not hanging this from your neck , or belt . Get ready to come up with endless work around's to become independent and if you use your device daily you will more then likely need to charge it nitely .That brings up another concern which is having to dock it to the micro usb port which are prone to wear out and or break contacts . I have had trouble since laptops were developed with charging connections on daily use machines . Paying cash to have them fixed is often 50% of the cost of the device . If the tech has changed you just scrap them .Well these are my thoughts outside what others have written or reinforcing issues previously discussed . Get ES Explorer , Dolphin ,Antivirus , Flash , plus Overdrive for library books with EPUB TO EWZ3 converter for kindle to read them with  Calibre for your desktop to download via usb and find free content . Take care will update after I have owned this for a while and learn more about work around's that are necessary and beneficial . I believe my next device will be a advanced smart phone with text to speech and banking abilities that works with Sprints unlimited data and access plans  . Very sad my institutions found designing apps for Amazons modified Kindle  OS not worthwhile but Google or Apple are covered . I wonder how the shadow rt devices will fair ? Though for those that use Fidelity Bank / Brokerage they do have a application that many speak very pleasantly about . That's a huge benefit for many who wish to use the tablet for day to day business when on the road and can control their fears over security at coffee shops , airports and other wifi hot spots away from home . Enjoy .Update : I think after trying the video content I can no longer complain about feeling like I am forced to join Amazon Prime . The truth is it is a great deal with the cloud . This device is sold very inexpensively and their is enough free content and applications available to keep one busy forever . This truly is a wonderful deal and is reintroducing me to reading on my terms . While wifi is not everywhere you can download content to view wherever you may be . My next mission to find a application that can download my newspapers while I sleep as it is docked charging . The possibilities are as endless as the kindle communities imagination . Oh and after trying Amazon Primes free video content I think I will cancel my Netflix . That will actually save me money and it is nice if you must stay at a hotel if they have wifi you can watch free amazon content . I opted to renew the prime though I do comparison shop before blindly committing to amazon for a purchase . It is hard to do but you have to be honest and figure in the cost of driving too and time for purchases elsewhere . The main problem is it is so easy to purchase items you do not organize your purchases as well as before since prime has no incentives to do so built in . I do like the add on items but wish it was easier to add something in as long as it hasn't shipped yet then delete then reorder taking a chance your previous item won't be sold to someone else or out of stock if you do . Still trying to learn how to print a document as well as write them on the Kindle .

I have a wifi router that is located in a large building, quite a distance from my office, and on a different floor. This device gets far better wifi reception than any other device that I own, including my laptop, smart phone, and Nook. At even this distance from the router, Netflix streaming is seamless, with no buffering at all. Web surfing, downloading apps etc. are also relatively quick. When I am closer to the router, speed is lightning fast. Graphics are very nice as well. I'm very happy with this purchase. About the only thing that I don't like is that every app that I use is automatically added to an onscreen carousel. I really like to keep an uncluttered screen, and manually removing these apps from the carousel is somewhat of a pain. There may be a way in settings to disable this feature, but if so, I haven't found it yet. I do like the favorites feature which is easy to use. Having this feature is a better way of accessing what I want quickly and the carousel of recently used apps seems redundant. To me, it would be far better to only add things such as most recently read books to the carousel.

It's not a 5 because my other two Kindles (an original and a recent model) display books just as well but they weigh a lot less and they don't rotate the image if I roll over in bed (yes, I know that the rotation can be locked.)As an Amazon movie viewer this is a 4.5 star.  The only weakness, as a personal movie viewer, is that the sound, although amazing for its size, is still a little weak in some cases. Maybe it deserves a 5 star but I may be feeling a little negative due to the other weaknesses.Then there is \"Everything Else This Thing Is Supposed To Do.\"  Mostly 1 star.E-MAIL:  The built in capability for email handling is terrible.  I found an app which is workable for sending/receiving and since I'm fortunate enough to have a provider whose services include good sorting, folders, archiving, etc., that part is fixed.  However, wait until you try to \"type\" an email.  SWYPE is cool but gets really old, really fast.KEYBOARD:  Nah. The screen keyboard is for Twitter posts and IM -- not for anything remotely like notes, data entry, or anything that you might want to not have vanish when your finger accidentally brushes some spot on the screen.  Plus there is not workable copy/paste or search or any of the other rudimentary text handling features that have been around since the Apple II and DOS 1.1  And, the prompted-word/auto-correct feature is good for several years of Facebook jokes: \"Look what he typed!\"By adding a Belkin Blue Tooth keyboard there is a bit more utility (I'm using it to type this) but that still doesn't give you CTRL feature capability that you're used to with any real computer and the select/copy/paste type functions are still pretty kludgy.BROWSER:  Oh, my blessed Flying Spaghetti Monster!

(which quite often tells you that \"Your device is not compatible.\")  First, everything that I've looked at is (to be polite) \"snoopware,\" which might not quite qualify as malicious spyware but you have no way of knowing.  Almost everything I've looked at wants you to permit the app's creator to have full access to all of your data, contact lists, history, etc.  Everything on your machine.  That'll happen ... not.Word processor?  Nope.  Spread sheet?  Nope.  All the app review areas are full of people commenting on them being snoopware AND, THIS IS IMPORTANT, almost all of them require that you be in a spot with WIFI access while using them.  Other reviewers complain that trying to create or manipulate files for use on office machines either does not happen easily or at all.Come on Amazon.  I don't give a dip about free or $14.99 apps.  I've paid hundreds of dollars for real software and would pay that much for an \"office suite\" of software to make this book reader into a really useful part of my life.For the Facebook users out there, don't bother trying to use the app that comes with the brain damaged browser.  You'll put a bullet through your new Kindle.  There are apps available which make the experience a little better but, compared to any regular computer, it is still hard to live with.TOUCHSCREEN:  My touchscreen experience is fairly limited but this one seems to work as advertised.  The problem is ... to what end?  Selecting bits of screens or highlighting text is stupid with a touch screen. Gimme a mouse.  Zooming with finger tips?  Cute.  Not much better than with a mouse wheel.  Spinning the carousel?  Where's the utility vs., a desktop of icons?  Drilling through menus and lists?  I have to tap more than once, frequently.  I never ever had to click a mouse more than once to execute a selection.  Gimme a mouse, unless I'm standing up or on the go.  For my uses, that rarely happens.  Maybe I'm not part of the HD's target consumer base.OTHER STUFF:  Well, I didn't look at the specs well enough and had no idea that there is no provision for any type of direct data transfer, like an SD card slot.  Cripes, the little junk video cams from China have micro-SD slots.  They can't be that expensive. So, for us old fossils without blue tooth cameras and the latest of the latest phones, what are we supposed to use?  The USB slot?  Ssssslow.For something without a fan or a hard drive motor, the battery life sure isn't very impressive.  I get about 5-6 hours of simple online time -- NOT using intensive processor features.  My guess is that a streaming movie or heavy graphics game will eat it much faster.I guess I won't go on because there are so many other reviews that this may never be read by anyone.  Just close this out by saying that it's a nice Kindle but as a former netbook user, I wish I had my netbook back.Update September 2013:Well, I've given it well over 6 months now and none of my opinions above have changed.  If anything, I'm way more negative about touch screens than before.  I've become much more swype proficient and now use it for short twitter-length stuff but really think that swiping or thumb stabbing is stupid compared to keyboard use unless you're keyboard challenged and can't touch type.  Insofar as selections, edits, copy/paste and accurately moving around a computer environment, touchscreens are a cute novelty which has no place in serious work.  I guess if you've never worked a keyboard, keyboard shortcuts and a full featured cordless mouse then you might think a touch screen is pretty slick.

I have referred quite a few people to prime and convinced a few people that the kindle was the way to go for an awesome e-reader (I read outside a lot and the kindle can't be beat for that). So of course when I saw the student prime deal for $70 off the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD, I knew it was too good to pass up! I should point out that I have an iPhone 4 but I am in no way one of those people who thinks everything Apple is better just because it's Apple. Anyway, I setup my Kindle Fire and let it charge for a bit. Then I downloaded one app. I was hanging out with a couple of friends after work and during our discussion, I decided to search for something on the web...this was when I learned my \"great deal\" so great after all. I did one search using the laughable web app, silk. The app crashed multiple times, froze, and then I even got an auto reboot. I don't have anything on my Kindle yet and I can't even do a web search? Don't worry, I had my 3 year old iPhone to use. So there I was telling a group of people how excited I was about  my new Kindle Fire and they get to watch me put my frozen Kindle down to use my old iPhone to do a web search.

So, you're telling me that in order to get a brand new item to work properly, I should have cleared all of the app data and done a device restart when I received it (you know, brand new)?  Wow.  As far as the device goes, it's alright.  I have had some videos crash and it's not exactly the most user friendly (Sorry Amazon, you wanted to design something anti-Apple, and you did, but you neglected one of the most important things that people love about Apple (being really user-friendly)).

Of course, I researched this tablet when it was announced as well as read reviews after its release. This is my 4th Kindle.  I have had my new Kindle Fire for about a month now, and it is definitely a keeper.  I will touch on a few issues below that have been mentioned in other reviews.THE CHARGER (or lack thereof):  I knew from research that it would come only with a USB cord for charging.  I have other chargers (one for the original Kindle Fire) but opted to purchase the PowerFast Charger for the \u00bd off price of $9.99 which is an option for everyone who purchases this tablet through Amazon.  The location of the charging port on the device does not bother me because I can just turn it upside down while charging and watch a movie easily without it being in the way.FLASH PLAYER:  I\u2019m not going to say much about this except that there is a work-around for this by downloading an older version of Flash.  Read the comments on other reviews for details.DESIGN:  Fabulous is all I can say.  It is just the right size, not too small, not too big.  Thin and lightweight.  I purchased the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 case for $54.99.  It has a low profile and I like that.  I also have one of those AmazonBasics Netbook Bag for 7 to 10 inch tablets with a handle.  It carries my Kindle 8.9 (in the case I mentioned above), USB charger, and PowerFast Charger, whenever I am traveling.PICTURE QUALITY:  Fantastic, sharp, crystal clear movies and shows.  The high definition is really obvious when compared to my original Kindle Fire.  A++ in this area, Amazon!!WiFi:  I had no problems setting up WiFi.  After inputting my router security code, it recognized it and connected immediately.  I tested streaming a movie in the opposite side of the house where the signal is the lowest.  When streaming a movie on Netflix on my ORIGINAL Kindle Fire, it would sometimes lag and show a \u201cbuffering\u201d message, but on the NEW Kindle Fire HD 8.9, there was NO lag or slowdown of streaming the same movie.  Movies and shows stream seamlessly and I have no connection issues, even low signal areas.SOUND QUALITY:  Dolby sound is very nice as well, however, 90% of the time, I use headphones.CAMERA:  For my use, the camera is a nice add-on, but I don\u2019t intend to take pictures with this camera, anyway.  I have an iPhone for that and with this Kindle HD 8.9, it has the ability to import your photos from other mobile devices (iPhone?) and Facebook or Twitter directly to your tablet.  Love that feature!  I would primarily use this camera for Skype, probably.4G LTE WIRELESS:  This seems to be a bit issue with a lot of folks.  I\u2019ll admit that I was attracted to the $49 one-time fee for a year\u2019s worth of 250MB/month 4G LTE Wireless coverage.  But I knew that 250MB would not be enough for me.  We have 3 iPhones in our family through AT&T.;  So I went to the AT&T; store with my Kindle.  I dropped my current family plan and changed to a Mobile Share Plan which gave me 10 gigs of data per month for 3 iPhones and 1 Kindle Fire Tablet.  My hubby and son don\u2019t use much data at all, and I use maybe 3 gigs per month.  So, in my world, this is a win-win and I\u2019m spending only about $30.00 more every month for 10 gigs of data.  As you may recall, the other options given on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 during 4G setup were 3 gigs for $30 a month and 5 gigs for $50 a month.  I\u2019m getting 10 gigs for $30 a month.  Thank you AT&T;!!!PRICE DIFFERENCE:  OK, stay with me on this......I compared the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 gig for $369 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G LTE Wireless for $499.  This is a difference of $130.  So you pay $130 more for the same high end, 32 gig model just to include the 4G LTE capability.  THEN, the average person signs up for the $49.99 for the first year 4G LTE Wireless for 250MB of data per month.  So you are paying $179.99 MORE for this Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G LTE Wireless just to get this feature.Now, when you look on AT&T;\u2019s site, to get a data plan for a tablet equal to 250MG per month, it normally cost the average person $14.99 a month for this data plan.  This amount times 12 months equals $179.88.  So, really, AT&T;, is getting their money in the long run because Amazon is probably forking over most, if not all, of the profit they receive selling the 4G LTE version of the tablet to AT&T.;  Amazon probably views this as an acceptable loss because they know that they will recoup this amount plus more when people purchase media from their website.  Of course, this is only speculation on my part, but, it does sound feasible, doesn\u2019t it?So, in my opinion, this tablet exceeds my expectations.  NO disappointments, NO frustrations, and NOT a waste of money, as many would claim in the 1 star reviews.  You just have to know what YOU need in a tablet, and know WHAT you are buying.  This is a media consumption device, pure and simple.

This is written for people like me: your first tablet was the original Kindle Fire, and you are trying to decide if you should upgrade to the HD and, if so, whether you should go for the 7\" or 8.9\"  model.  I assume that you are familiar with the technical specifications (from Amazon, Amazon customers, or other review sites).This is a long review so here's the get-to-the chase summation:1. One cannot comfortably hold a tablet this size in one hand.  This will be obvious to anybody who has a large tablet but for newbies, or those used to a 7\" model, the difference is much greater than one might have expected.2. If you decided to get a second Fire rather than one of the alternatives because you figure all your content will be there and you won't have to learn anything new, you will be disappointed.  Anything with a userid/password must be set up again (which would be true if you switched to a different vendor).  Only Amazon content is saved to its cloud.  So if you have books you downloaded from other sites, or applications you have side-loaded, you will have to do that by hand (also true if you change vendors, except you will have to recreate everything). And applications that ran fine on the original Fire may not run at all on the HD.  Also, there are enough differences between the interface on the HD and the original Fire that I think the learning curve is probably just as great as if, say, you switched to a Nexus.3. UPDATED:I thought the original Fire was the deal to end all deals.  It has its limitations but, for the price, I don't think there is a better bargain on the market.  The new HD models are another matter.  These cost \"real\" money, and I can't unequivocally recommend this tablet. But, I want to be clear here, this is not to say that the HD is a bad device.  It is, simply, that while I could excuse Amazon's pitiful App Store, and UI issues, for a device that cost me $200, I am not willing to excuse those deficiencies for a device that cost me $450 (plus tax).Background:The original Kindle Fire was my first tablet, and I was satisfied with it, in spite of some shortcomings, from Day 1.  I have rarely, if ever gotten so much bang for the buck with a tech purchase.  During election season, I and the Fire rarely parted company.So, why did I buy the HD 8.9 WiFi tablet?  Three reasons: First, although I've been very happy with the Fire, I've run out of application space (something that truly surprised me) and have been shuffling apps in and off the device.  And tablet technology generally has improved in the past year.So, why didn't I just get the 7\" HD?  Because, second, after listening to iPad users assert for months (until the mini came out of course) that 7\" tablets weren't \"real\" tablets, I wanted to try out a larger tablet.Third, I wanted to see if magazines, like The New Yorker, and web pages, would look better on a larger tablet. And it seemed to me to make sense to stick with Amazon on the theory that the learning curve would be short.Initial Reactions:After adding in the $15 to get rid of the ads and the $20 for the AC adapter, we're talking $400. Add in $55 for the Amazon cover, and we're up to $450. (See my review for the cover; I am not happy with it.)Is it fair to include these extra costs?  Yes.  According to Amazon, if you charge this tablet via your computer's USB, it will take 14 hours.  Right, 14 hrs.  The \"fast\" charger does the job in 5 hrs. (about half the battery life, 10 hrs., cited by Amazon.) But Amazon considers the \"fast\" charger to be an optional accessory?  It was excluded from the base price for the same reason that Amazon charges extra to get rid of the ads: to hit the price point it wanted to hit.  The AC adapter should have been part of the price.  As for the ads, I think Amazon should have offered the ads as a way to reduce the price rather than the other way round.UPDATE:I have had the 8.9\" for 7 days now and I may update these remarks, but, in general, although I am not as disappointed as I was at the end of the first day, I am still not thrilled.  As I said before, my threshold for satisfaction re a $450+ device is higher than for a $199 device and perhaps it was too much to expect that I would love the 2nd generation product as much as the 1st generation product.Size:iPad owners are nuts.  A tablet this size is no doubt better for watching videos than a 7\" tablet.  But it is only marginally better at displaying web pages. (I'll get to magazines in a moment.).  It feels heavier than the original Fire, but the main problem is simply the size, at least for somebody my size.  It is, quite simply, too big to hold comfortably with one hand, and if one needs two hands, well, then one has to make some kind of adjustment.  NOTE: I am not blaming Amazon.  I obviously knew I was getting a large tablet and bought a large tablet on purpose.  If you have a 7\" tablet and are thinking of getting a larger size, I can't emphasize enough that the experience of holding a large tablet is very different from that of holding a smaller tablet. So think about how you use your tablet.  To read books, surf the web, watch videos?UPDATE:  With both Fires next to me (the original 7 inch and the new 8.9 inch) which one do I automatically reach for?  The 7 inch. It is simply way more comfortable to hold in one hand.  And I can throw it in a backpack or messenger bag to take with me.  If I keep the 8.9 inch, it will be for home use only.User Interface:Amazon does not make good use of the added real estate.  When you turn on the HD, you get the carousel, absent the physical representation (the icons sort of  \"float\" on the screen), on top of \"suggestions\" which change with the items on the carousel.  I found that annoying, so I turned off the \"suggestions\" in the Settings.I had assumed, naively, that with a larger screen, I would be able to see more items.  But Amazon chose to increase the size of the icons rather than use smaller ones to fit more on a screen.  This design decision exists throughout the software: books, videos, web, everything.  Amazon has simply increased the size of the icons so one doesn't get any more items per screen than on the 7\".  The ones on the carousel, on the opening screen, are HUGE. If you have vision problems, you may appreciate this decision, but I wish Amazon would offer a resize option. UPDATE:  Under Bookmarks (Web section), you get 3 screens of 3 broad icons showing the top of your web pages.  On the original Fire,  you get 12 thumbnails showing about \u00be of the web page (bottom row shows about \u00bd of the web page).Amazon has also introduced a number of changes in the UI, from how to get to the settings, to the way you get to the home button, to the options in Silk - well, I could go on, but if your primary reason for buying a new model Fire is because you assume it will be easier than learning the interface for a different vendor's product - you are in for an unpleasant surprise.  Yes, vendors are always changing the UI, but I have yet to find a change that makes using the HD easier than using the original. So for me, so far, the changes come under the \"why on earth did the vendor do this?\" category.The most annoying change for me is the list of options at the top of the first screen.  They are, in order, Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, Audiobooks, Web, Photos, Docs.  Notice what the first is? Shop. And if you want to get to the Web, you have to swipe left because the first page display ends at Newsstand.  Yes, you can use the carousel or favorites to get where you want faster, but Amazon, please, pretty please, let us organize the sequence to match how we use the HD.UPDATE: The touch screen on the original Fire has always seemed to me to be way too sensitive.  Stuff launches, scrolls, etc. when I've barely breathed on an item.  The touch screen on the HD seems much less sensitive.  Sometimes I have to press quite hard for an action to occur.  No happy middle, I guess.Externalities:Others have mentioned that it is hard find and distinguish between the external volume and on/off button.  They are different sizes, however, so I think most people will get \"trained\" to recognize which is which.  Still I suspect we will always find ourselves running our fingers from the edge in because there is no way to \"see\" either button.  And since it is awfully easy to accidentally turn off the HD while you are feeling along the edge for the volume button, if you are right-handed and go in from that edge, it is probably wise to teach yourself to move in from the left edge for volume, right edge to turn off.  UPDATE: I am no longer accidentally turning the HD off, but I do still need to \"search\" carefully with my fingers to find the right button.There is no charging light (red/green), so the only way you know for sure that it is charging, or to see if it has finished charging, is to turn the Fire on, pull down to get the options, select more, choose device, get battery usage. Or get a battery monitor and make it a favorite.  This is just foolish beyond words.The USB and HDMI connectors are now in the middle of the long edge.  UPDATE: This was not a good idea.  First: you cannot reorient some games (this includes Angry Birds) in landscape mode.  And the position they like is the one with the USB connector on the bottom.  So you cannot play one of these games and recharge the HD at the same time.  I tried a video and it did re-orient itself properly but in Amazon's cover, the HD still can't be used while charging because of the way Amazon designed the \"stand\" part of the cover.  Also, I find it disconcerting to have the USB cable right where my hand is (vertical orientation, either side) when I am using the HD while it is charging.  With the original, which I always use \"upside down\", the cable is at the top so it doesn't matter whether the electrical outlet is to my left or right.  With the HD, it does matter.BooksThere is STILL no way to organize your books into genres.  You can only sort by name, title or most recent.  No doubt Amazon wants people who read a lot to spend $250 for the latest Paperwhite Kindle.  That's the only excuse I can think of for treating reading on the Fires differently than reading on the non-Fires.UPDATE: With Amazon's cover/stand, there is no way that I can find for charging the HD while reading if you want the book propped horizontally so you ccn read while lying on your side. (The cable gets squished.) And reading is also just far more comfortable with the 7 inch, which is pretty much the size of a largish paperback.Applications - UPDATED Nov. 25.A couple of the applications I depend on, like Dropbox and GoToApp (which I think is essential for anybody who has more than a dozen or so applications), did not work on the day I got the HD.  I was able to sideload Dropbox and SugarSync, which I prefer, is in the App Store. The paid version of GoToApp now works on the HD and I have bought it.  There are still other applications that don't work, but they matter much less to me.  Your experience may be better or worse.None of the Angry Birds games I bought (the original, Rio or Seasons) will run on the HD.  They do not even show up in the \"cloud' when viewed from the HD.  In a way, this is irrelevant since Amazon doesn't save your games to the cloud.  So, even if you could downlad them, you'd have to start all over.  But it is still irritating to find out that games I paid for, and bought from Amazon, will not run on the HD.  (I have applications designed for Windows 95 that run under Windows 7 without change.)I haven't yet tried all my apps. To get them to your new device, you must download each and every one which, given the number of apps, and the speed of your WiFi/ISP connection, may take a while. And all of those downloads turn up on the carousel so then you will waste time deleting them from the carousel. This is a minor annoyance and one for which there is no good solution, so file it under \"need to know/plan for\".I sideloaded Firefox 14 but it simply crashes.  I have been able to install Dolphin and Opera but not Maxthon.  Why another browser?  Because Silk not only has its old flaws (like the lack of folders) but has a somewhat different interface.  And those bookmarks and history you've got?  Forget them.  There is no way to transfer either to a new Fire or to keep two Fires in sync.  Silk has also hung badly several times on the HD, something that rarely happened on the original.Amazon has created 3 sections for its Web access: Starter, Bookmarks and History.  You cannot set it so that, for example, Bookmarks or History is the first section.  Starter is the new screen that always pops up first if you're not going direct to a web page from the carousel.  And what does Starter consist of? 3 \"shelves\":  Most Visited, Trending Now, Selected Sites.  Because the icons on the shelves are HUGE, you can see only 2 \u00bd.  Yes, that's right, in vertical mode you get to see 2 1/2 items (5 \u00bd in landscape mode).  There appears to be no way to set, for example, Bookmarks as your entry point, nor does there appear to be any way to get rid of the Trending and Selected Sites under Starter. These extra shelves may not bother you.  You may find them useful.  For me, they are a waste of screen real estate.  (And another example of Amazon's well-publicized policy of using the hardware to entice buying.)NOTE: I really, really, really do not like icons, especially very large icons,  I would much rather see just text whether I'm looking for a web site or a book or an application.  Just a simple text list that I can order the way I want. Nothing is worse than the way Amazon displays, in all versions of the Fire, videos which is, as far as I can tell, purely random.  It, quite frankly, hurts my eyes so much to keep scrolling dozens upon dozens of unorganized title icons that I usually give up after a couple of screens.  If you are looking for something specific, the search box works fine.  If you are just browsing, it's a pain.The New Yorker UPDATE Nov. 25: This was the most unpleasant surprise.  It works fine on my original Fire, contrary to the experience, I know, of many.  But I could not access it on the HD.  I suspected the problem was with the HD's autocorrect. Somebody should tell Amazon that userids and passwords often do not resemble real words.  My id and password for The New Yorker certainly do not, but Amazon's spellchecker kept \"correcting\" my entry and I wasn't even able to delete the incorrect characters.  I had to close the Sign In box and start over.  I finally got the spellchecker trained to accept my user name, but I suspect the reason that the app couldn't authorize me is that the spellchecker was somehow changing my password which consists of letters and numbers.  Finally, I went into More/Settings/Keyboard and turned off Auto-correction, Auto-capitalization, and Next word prediction.  Voila!  I was able to sign into the app.(UPDATE NOV. 26: The first New Yorker edition I downloaded, Dec. 3, was 255MB. More than twice as large as the largest edition I downloaded on the original Fire. The download for the original Fire was 165MB. I'm assuming/hoping the large size is due to the inclusion of an opera video clip.)NEW & UPDATED Nov. 26: KeyboardIf you are having any kind of trouble typing, I recommend that you try the same thing. \"Next word prediction\" seems to be particularly perverse.  For example, I wanted to type \"A link\" in Plume (Twitter client) and could not type the \"l\".  Literally, could. not. type. the \"l\". I turned off \"next word prediction\" and the problem disappeared.I don't know what kind of dictionary Amazon uses, but even with the original Fire, I have found that the words it knows are occasionally more obscure than the words it doesn't know, and that it seems deficient with respect to internet and other acronyms.The keyboard on the 8.9 HD is, of course, larger.  But there have ALSO been changes in the format.  The <-X (backspace) key now reads \"Delete\".  If you press and hold down the \",kb icon\" key, the keyboard will split in two, which may be useful in landscape mode.  Press and hold again and the full keyboard will appear.  There are a number of other differences which, for the most part, I like but it does make typing a bit confusing since I use both tables (original and HD).Conclusion: UPDATED Nov. 25, 2012.Will I keep the 8.9\" HD?  Yes, but I am still extremely ambivalent about it.  (In contrast, I liked the original Fire from the first day; within a week, it had become part of my life.) I have asked myself what I would do if I returned the HD.  Would I try the 7\" HD? Or, say, the Nexus 7\". I have part of the answer to that: I would not look for another large tablet.  The larger size is definitely better for watching videos, but I don't watch enough videos to make it worth the price. If I did, the larger size in addition to the improved video and sound quality would probably count more for me.Bezos emphasized the importance he placed on pricing a full-sized tablet right: the best features for the right amount of money.  It is time that he paid attention to the App Store which continues to be in a very, very distant 3rd place to Apple and Google, the need for synchronization (on demand) of bookmarks and browser history for people with multiple Fires, and ways for users to personalize/change the way the UI works.Musings which may not interest you:In short, I recommended the original Fire without hesitation to anybody who had never before used a tablet.  I stand by that recommendation.  But we are now into Generation 2 Amazon.  Our standards should be higher because the price is.  Assuming the only difference between the 7\" HD and 8.5\" HD is the size, would I recommend the 7\"?  Probably, if it is somebody's first tablet and that person is an Amazon customer.  But otherwise, well, the playing field is more level now.  I'm not an Apple fan, to say the least, and don't want to be part of its ecosphere. But I'm beginning to think that, at these higher prices, Amazon's ecosphere imposes too many limits on the user so the tradeoff between price and functionality is much more complex. Especially for a second tablet.My original Fire works fine.  It's only real problem is the lack of application space, but I can get around that by keeping only the most important apps on the 7 inch, and running the others (the ones that work) on the HD.Finally, I've decided to postpone until next year any decision about getting a second 7 inch.  But I will not automatically choose a Fire.  This time I will take a good hard look at the 32 GB Nexus 7 inch.Bottom Line:If you take one thing away from this review, it should probably be the fact that the 8.9 HD has not convinced me to get a 7 inch Fire HD should I want upgraded features in a smaller package.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Open it to more Android Apps", "Author": "Douglas D Snyder", "ReviewID": "R3TRIMR2OL1D0K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "great for video and music, good for reading, disappointing for web browsing and email.Biggest problem is the unavailability of so many popular, useful Android apps.Silk is a big let down.

I originally used the first gen for quite a while before \"upgrading\" to the HD 8.9. I am a working professional, but I primarily use this tablet for college textbooks.II was excited when I received this kindle as a gift in Nov. 2013. I spend hours each week reading through textbooks, highlighting, and taking notes. The larger screen was greatly appealing to me b/c I do not exactly have the best eye sight. Also, I would frequently take my old kindle to work to read whenever I had a break. Right off the bat I noticed some unfortunate drawbacks to this tablet:1. The battery life is abhorrent. My original kindle fire could last for days without requiring a charge. However with this tablet, I need to keep it on the charger whenever I am doing homework. I can still take my kindle to work to read, but there have been a number of occasions where I sat down to catch up on a chapter only to find my kindle at 3% battery life because I didn't leave it on the charger the night before. In other words, with this kindle you have to really remember to always leave it on the charger.2. The touch screen makes my life miserable. I can't tell you how many times I have sat here touching a word, zooming in, zooming out, having the screen freeze, restarting the kindle, and then beginning the process anew just in an attempt to highlight a sentence. I often feel like I would have been better off spending the extra money to purchase the actual textbooks rather than the kindle editions so I wouldn't spend 10 minutes trying to highlight two sentences. I also have trouble trying to get the home button to pop up. Rather than having the little home screen show up, I usually end up turning the page multiple times before actually getting the home icon to show up. For reference, I did purchase the amazon tablet stylus, so I am not trying to do all of this with my finger. I am using a stylus and still having issues.3. Advertisements. My original kindle fire did not force me to look at ads. This one does. I don't feel this is necessary. I'm not using my kindle to shop. I'm using it to study, so I do not need these kinds of distractions.The only pro that I have for this kindle is the screen size and resolution. It is nice in comparison to the original kindle fire. However screen response and battery life are complete poop. If you are looking to purchase this kindle for the sole purpose of just reading books from home, you are probably fine.If you are a student or professional who frequently reads on the go and/or utilizes the highlighting function, look into another kindle b/c this one is not the one for you.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed!", "Author": "Lucinda", "ReviewID": "R2887KPQIA84YQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my first Kindle 8.9 HD because I had read by its description, that it was much faster than the Kindle Fire.

I've had my first generation Kindle Fire and have been happy with it but I wanted more space for more apps and a larger screen.  The 8.9 HD 32 GB had that and it is proving to be a great investment for our family.  It is faster, clearer (HD) and just operates better overall.  I have had a few glitches but they are because of apps, not the Kindle itself.  The apps on this thing are awesome, much better quality-viewing than the smaller, older Kindle Fire we own.  I'm enjoying that we can stock up on apps and aren't in danger of running out of space.I still prefer to read books on the smaller, first generation Kindle Fire because it is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time and laying down.  I use the 8.9 HD Kindle Fire for email, calendar, web and the apps and occasionally a video (which is pretty much flawless in playback on the 8.9 HD).  It has made my life simpler and more productive to just check my email or the web for something and then put it back down instead of having to sit down at my computer to check email, which usually ends up leading to mindless surfing.One thing I didn't anticipate that would be a real winner was FreeTime, which is a service you can pay monthly for to turn the Kindle into a child's device.  We are finding that it is a winner with our daughter.

Amazon Prime lets you read one new book a month.  My only complaint is the way the charge port is made.  According to the Geek squad at Best Buy, the charge port isn't braced like those in a tablet or laptop so it cannot move, and the contact points are easily broken just by plugging it into the charger.  They said the charge port is the main reason people bring them kindles, and it's not something they can fix..  I would advise getting an extended warranty if you buy one.  If yours is one with an easily broken charge port, and you have an extended warranty, Amazon will replace it.  Right now I'm on my 3rd Kindle Fire, because of that charge port.  And if the charger goes out, you can't get any personal information, like credit card numbers and passwords, etc,. off the Kindle before it is sent off to somewhere to be repaired and sold again.  If the maker put something around that charge port so it couldn't wiggle and break, I would have no complaint at all but they would probably charge more for it then.  Also, the last charge cord sent with my Kindle is impossible to get in the Kindle without maybe breaking that fragile charge port inside the Kindle, so I don't use it.

It's not worth it.  Wait for a sale or a refurbished unit under $150.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a decent piece of hardware that is diminished by its user interface.  People who have never used a tablet may not be bothered by the interface, but those familiar with real Android smartphones and tablets are likely to be annoyed by a design that so clearly promotes shopping and consumption of Amazon's digital content.  Yes, I know, the primary purpose of the Kindle is to encourage more purchases from Amazon, but the sales focus is excessive.When you install a free app from Amazon's app store, you receive an e-mail confirmation of your $0.00 purchase.  Overkill.The special offers on the start-up screen are no problem.  They go almost unnoticed among all the other sales pitches.Other observations: -  The 8.9\" size is easier to hold in the hand than a 10.1\" tablet, and it is lighter. -  The display is sharp, making it easy to see detail on Google maps, for example. -  The dual-band radio is great if you have a dual-band \"n\" or an \"ac\" wireless router. -  Works well with Bluetooth Android keyboard. -  No option to use an SD card, because Amazon wants you to use its cloud for storage. -  Short battery life when in active use; keep a charger handy. -  The real Android OS provides many more configuration options than does the simplified Kindle OS.Fortunately, the Kindle Fire's operating system can be replaced.  So, within 48 hours of starting to use the Kindle, I had converted mine to run as a real tablet with Android 4.2.2.  It's a nice Android tablet.

I was looking for a tablet that is larger than 7\" so I more easily  read and watch a bit of Netflix. In my old age, my eyes aren't what they used to be so a larger screen helps.  The 8.9\" kindle fits that bill perfectly.  Not too big and not too small. Being refurbished didn't bother me since it still came with the same warranty and Amazon is very good about standing behind their products.I got the package from Amazon before it was promised. It included a USB cable and nothing else. If you want to charge the tablet in wall outlet, you'd have to use your own standard USB charger or purchase another one. It doesn't come with any manual, but the Kindle OS is very intuitive and easy to use.If you use the kindle for reading, Netflix or other light duty apps, the kindle will serve you well. I also have a Nexus 7 (1st gen) and the Nexus is a bit peppier than the Kindle, but not by much. Plus the Kindle's screen is far superior to my Nexus 7. The Kindle OS is very easy to navigate although a bit cluttered IMHO.  The \"Special Offers\" are basically advertisements on the lock screen. They are not intrusive at all and sometimes the offers are quite compelling.I wanted to install apps that are only available in Google Play and not available in the Amazon apps store. I therefore rooted the Kindle and modded it to a generic Android KitKat tablet.  It is working just great and I can now install and run apps from Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. I installed the Kindle app from Google play, so I didn't lose any functionality by rooting.Overall, I am very happy with the Kindle purchase, especially at the price I got it at.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "just like brand new", "Author": "sharlene", "ReviewID": "RH6BOQ0TI4GU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my refurbished kindle.

Unfortunately I am terribly disappointed in Amazon. First time EVER! I love Amazon normally. When I received my Kindle for Christmas I was thrilled but almost immediately discovered it would not hold a charge. In about an hour and a half it would be totally depleted of energy. The Amazon employee I spoke to on the phone was great. He told me to send it back and they would immediately send out a new one. (And he offered to email me a shipping label. I explained that my printer was broken, so he said to pay the shipping myself, and Amazon would quickly reimburse me.) Sounded like a plan. I took my defective Kindle to Fed Ex. had them professionally pad and pack it for me, and shipped it to reach it's destination within four days. That was on February 25th. This is March 31. I still have not heard back from Amazon. The four day shipping, with packaging and insurance cost me $75.04.(I was shocked myself, but fortunately I have the receipt.) The final blow is that my new Kindle does not stay charged any better than the first one. BUMMER! Hate to complain, but you asked- so I have to be honest.Now, I would give the features, and the Kindle's ease of use, 5 stars. (Also love the leather case that allows it to stand on it's own, and having Prime.) Even the customer service dept. that answers questions regarding setup, wi-fi, etc. is excellent. So I have to say, I would absolutely love my Kindle, if I had one that would hold a charge.

With less than 1gb of ram available total, there often is less than ~200 mb of memory for apps like silk (the web browser) to use. This makes browsing websites with graphics very painful, and in my case, it often freezes the tablet where I'll have to do a hard reboot (holding the power button down until the tablet turns off).Games that fully utilize the resolution of the tablet will also often play at unpleasing speeds. That being said, games like angry birds, cut the rope, or candy crush will do just fine.Ultimately the tablet suffers because of how beautiful the screen is.

Here are my impressions.Pros:~The screen is beautiful; easily one of the best looking HD Displays i've seen on a tablet so far.  Kicks the pants off the Galaxy Tab and Surface Screens.~Watching a video without headphones?  Or wanting to play some music in a room without having to lug the device around?  The sound system built into the thing is really high quality.~The integration with Amazon's Video, Music, and Book Library is seamless.  No need to run a bunch of separate apps.  It's all right there.Cons:~App selection is poor.  A lot of apps that I was attempting to use on the tablet were out of date compared to those found on the regular Android marketplace, which caused some issues during use.~Even when the apps work, this device is not exactly the best at multitasking.  I had several instances where Silk would crash Skype or Facebook, or the tablet would decide to close certain apps randomly.~Swapping between applications was not very easy off the bat.  Unless I was missing something, you had to go back to the home screen carousel, and then open an app that you already had launched from there.~You cannot... repeat... CANNOT disable Swype, and if you're a screen typer like I am, you'll often find yourself adding unnecessary spaces and screwing up the swype's autocorrect quite a bit.  User error maybe, but not even an option?Conclusion:It's a good tablet.  A MUST if you are tied at the hip to Amazon's content and services.  Want something that's a little more diverse?

I purchased my first Kindle Fire HD after trying out a friend's Kindle. I checked the local stores' prices, but I got a much better price by calling the Amazon Kindle-Sales Representative. He was able to get me a better Kindle model for less than the local stores' prices. He also found the magnetic RooCase cover which I wanted; you can turn on your Kindle just by flipping the cover open! He found me a basic-priced stylus, a protective film-cover for the screen, and he told me to try out my Kindle for 2 weeks before buying the separate Damage Warrenty. He gave me the Damage Co's. phone number, and I later did have them start the Damage Warrenty after I decided to keep my new Kindle. I had a good friend come over to help me connect my new WiFi device and get my new Kindle registered. Now, I thought I had purchased the same size Kindle as she had, but it turned out that I had gotten the larger 8.9 model. I had gotten the sizes mixed-up after handling store models without covers. My friend was impressed that I got my larger Kindle 8.9 model and all its items for just $50.00 more than her 7\" Kindle HD alone had cost her at a local store. She was impressed.  I will add that having the Kindle Support phone number is great!  Any time I had a question, a quick phone call to a service rep solved the issue.  I am also glad to say that Amazon stands behind its own Manufacturer's Warrenty, too! We live in a rural area and when my Kindle 8.9 was having issues in January-February of 2013 receiving emails, one of the service supervisors reviewed my Kindle's history. She learned that I used my Kindle every day for several hours due to personal disability issues that make traveling difficult. So my Kindle was one of my main methods of entertainment and of emailing friends & family.  She saw the Kindle's email delivery problem reoccured over and over after several service reps had tried to restore that app on my Kindle. She said she felt my Kindle needed to be returnef to Amazon. However, she said not to worry at all as they were sending me a new Kindle to replace my original one as mine was still under full warranty for one more month. So, within two days, my new replacement Kindle arrived. A great service rep walked me through the steps of 'moving' all my items from my first Kindle into my second Kindle. We had put my RooCase cover onto the new Kindle at her suggestion so that I could tell the two Kindles apart as we had to have both devices sitting side by side to complete the transfers of my apps, past book & movie purchases, etc. Finally, we had the new Kindle registered and running well...my older Kindle was completely back to \"factory settings\". It had nothing of mine left on it at all, which is how she said a Kindle needs to be when it's returned. She actually thanked me for being so patient and following all her instructions! I felt She was the one who had done a wonderful job in walking an older lady through all those steps! My new Kindle works very well with no problems at all. So, I  would recommend getting your Kindle and any parts from the Amazon Store.

My first Kindle lasted several months, everything was fine. I could play games, read all sorts of books and use the web browser. Then suddenly my Kindle started locking up and freezing or just restarting itself. After resetting it to factory default (and having to start over on everything that wasn't on the Cloud, which is quite a bit) It continued to lock up and freeze. Amazon customer service was great and quickly replaced the Kindle. The next Kindle that came was dirty and had obviously signs of pre-use. The battery would only last a couple hours and all apps and books would lock the Kindle up constantly. As long as I restarted the Kindle 4 to 5 times a day and cleared the cache on all apps and web browser several times a day it was somewhat useable.  Back to customer service, restore defaults, hard reset the Kindle, turn the screen brightness down, turn the volume down and the battery still only lasted a couple hours and I still wasn't able to read books on the device. Insert Kindle number 3... Again Kindle number 3 had some sort of grease marks on the back and finger prints on the screen when it came out of the box. The power button only worked half the time and something wasn't working properly with the WIFI..... Kindle number 4 locked up upon the initial setup and got stuck in reboot mode until the battery died. Now Kindle number 4 cannot do anything with Silk without it restarting the device. Some apps work, most do not and reading books is very laggy (it could take several seconds after you turn a book page for the device to catch up).Meanwhile customer service tells me they just don't understand, that these are fantastic devices and should be able to run anything I want to do with them. I just want to read a book or play Tetris without the device freezing and restarting on me.

What it doesn't offer is protection against those kids finding the button that un-registers your device.  My daughter found that button and all she had to do was tap it, effectively wiping my Kindle out of all apps, books, movies, etc. I had to download everything again and basically lost all of the saved data for all of my games. When you are on level 70 of Candy Crush, this can hurt. I did indeed put parental controls on the device.

The reasons I say this is first off the 8.9\" has a front facing camera for Skype and if you download a certain editing app you can access the camera itself and the newer 2013 doesn't even have a camera. The screen is actually a huge difference from the 7\" if you compare them side to side, the 8.9 is such a bigger screen. My sister even wants to return hers 7\", She said, (\"It Looks like a toy next to yours\"). lol :) Also the screen resolution for the 7\"  is only 1280x800 vs the 2012 8.9\" is 1920x1200, so the screen is so much more beautiful and clear than the \"newer improved\" version.

However, ive you've ever used another android device, this thing is going to make you really mad. Its impossible to access the google play store without rooting it, which can eaisly brick the device, rendering it completely useless untill you send it in. There is just way too much available on google play for Amazon to just block it on a device that would be perfect for it. There are a couple other apps that do work for searching/installing new apps without using Amazons app store, which is the only reason I didnt return it. So far about 90% of the apps that Amazon charges for are legaly available for free elsewhere.... The default \"carousel\" home screen is awkward and clunky. There are some other options out there, but you can never completely get rid of the horrid home screen. You also have to pay Amazon if you want the advertisements to be taken off your lock screen.... Yes, even after you BUY it, you are still forced to view ads unless you give them even more money.In hindsight, I really wish I would have bought a different, un-crippled android tablet.

Also, this doesn't come with a charger, just a USB cable. Don't be fooled by all of the charger reviews claiming you need massive power to charge this device. It will easily charge with any little standard cell phone charger with the correct mini USB connector. I bought one with more power after reading the reviews, so I do have a hotter charger, ($10 on Amazon) but I also found that it wasn't necessary. Just use your cell phone charger. So it takes an extra hour or two, so what? The charging icon is not automatically displayed. Go to settings and turn it on, or you can't tell its charging. (its also a very tiny icon, put on your reading glasses to verify that its charging!!)The unique part I mention is that it does not have the standard desk top format we are used to looking at. It does not display a desk top which you put icons or short cuts on in the traditional sense. It has a completely different way of showing them which for me and my wife took a while to get accustomed to. I guess someone is always trying to invent a better mouse trap, but its really not an improvement over the normal desktop scenario everyone is used to. But other than that its a great product.

It made it only $80 more than the most expensive reader. I had previously owned a Kindle reader with a navigation button. When the button quit working I was unable to use the reader anymore. I began looking for a new Kindle and was unsure which one to purchase. My 10 yr old has a Samsung tablet which I have used on occasion and I find it easy to navigate. I have a Kindle app on my laptop which I used regularly but some books I wanted to check out of the library would only download to a Kindle and not a Kindle app per the publishers guidelines. So when Amazon put the Kindle Fire on sale I decided to get the HD so I could read and also use the internet and play games. I bought the 16 GB with Wi-Fi because I didn't want to pay for a wireless plan and we have Wi-Fi at home. When it arrived I opened it and put it in the case I had purchased and immediately began to use it. It is so easy. The screen is very responsive to finger taps and swipes, maybe even more so than the Samsung. I never have any trouble with my internet connection and pages load very quickly. At 39 I am in what I guess you would call the in between generation. Computers became a household item when I was a teenager and has progressed from there. I didn't cut my teeth on technology but I find it easy to comprehend and this Kindle is very easy for me. My 5, 3, & 2 year old all love to play games on it and read books.

That is AWESOME!  This is my second one, since after almost a year, my first Kindle (same model) began to freeze quite often.  Several times a day, It would just stop working.  After I tried all the fixes available on the Amazon website, I contacted their technical support.  After a few tries to fix it, the technician volunteered to send me another at no charge and gave me a label to send back the old unit free of charge.  I LOVE AMAZON!  When I got the new one, it was already loaded with all my old contents and I used it without trouble, up until the last few day.  It now freezes, but only occasionally.  That's just enough to make me uneasy about this units future.However, I have two other concerns.  First and foremost, it is not capable of playing Flash Player videos, which constitutes about half of the videos available on line.  This is very frustrating because there are lots that I want to play, but the Kindle is not compatible and Amazon told me that there are no plans to change that.  Since they are otherwise, so accommodating to the consumer's needs, that seems odd.  Secondly,I am a subscriber to Acorn TV.  While it works on my apple computer, it does not work on my Kindle.

The second one was a free replacement because it was under warranty (Thank you Amazon) and it lasted about a month and the screen permanently froze and would not unfreeze.

So don't bother trying.I wanted an inexpensive, large-screen tablet that would allow me to watch anything on You Tube, a live-stream of one of my local news stations, and view the magazines to which I subscribe in digital form...all without paying any monthly fees, or even one-time fees.  I thought this tablet was for me.Well, there is no real app for You Tube, so that's out. If you go to You Tube's website, you can't watch anything because, like I wrote, Flash is not supported on this device.

Most of the other magazines were viewable IF I paid for a year's digital subscription. No thanks. I'm not paying twice.Since this Kindle device doesn't support all Android apps, there is a chance may apps you may have on your Droid or IOS phone will NOT be available on the Kindle...so make SURE that this will do what you want it to do before you buy it.

I have seen reviews about how the battery life is not great on the Kindle fire HD 8.9\" but thought I would take my chances as I wanted the bigger screen to watch movies. Like other reviewers, the battery did hold a good charge for the first couple of months, but the last few months I have been disappointed how quickly the battery depletes with minimal internet use.  With a fully charged battery I can get thru a 2 hour movie, but it will be close to empty.  When reading books, the battery seems to do better but  after reading a few hours, it will still go down 15-20%.  If you don't mind charging this model daily, then this is a great deal and the overall features and Prime benefits are well worth this inconvenience.

Plus you can even take pictures. No, it is not perfectly perfect but whenever you have a problem, chat is the best option and it is available 24/7... So get your kindle now!!! Yes, it does have a few flaws. For example, the camera isn't the best but you don't need to walk around Paris holding up a big tablet taking pictures,,, buy a camera!!! And yes it does take a while to charge. But just buy a power charger for $20 or less or what I do is let it just sit overnight and let it charge. Because your not going to use it 24/7 so just let it charge overnight and it will last the whole day I promise you (just turn off wifi when you don't use it and turn your brightness down)!!! Also there isn't a crazy selection for apps, but what is cool is the fact that you can get apps to enhance your kindle and you don't even have to spend money!!! Just use your 500 coins... that is what I do!!! So get GSam Battery pack that is really cool to add a neat icon and get a volume control app to add a volume bar to your kindle so you don't even have to swipe down to turn down your volume, just turn it down or up from the icon button. The volume control app is free... so buy it no to enhance your kindle. Plus, you can get an app that lets you add a background... YES IT'S HERE!!!

There are some great apps sure, and most of the time you can get what you need, but even when there is a Kindle version of an app from a company, it often has less features than the equivalent Android market app. Don't expect these apps to \"catch-up\" and start appearing either. It will always be an investment for developers to support another platform so the apps will ALWAYS be behind the main Android market. A couple of favorite news apps that I use on my phone (and was really looking forward to enjoying full screen) lack features and the \"magic\" of the tablet just feels gone to me. The most important move for Amazon right now is to open up the rest of the Android app store, even if native Kindle apps are given preferential listing. Not even an official YouTube app? Cmon. (You can, however use YouTube through the browser)When it comes to web browsing and communication, voice search on my Android phone is amazing. I can send Skype messages to friends or quickly get browsing results just by talking. Not so with the Kindle, and its a huge usability difference. The native browser also has a lack of settings that will be missed by geeks such as myself.The Kindle is not without it's pluses. It has good battery life, and the native user interface is good and so are some of the native Amazon apps. Books are great to read on it, and browsing is generally good.Amazon is really trying to create it's own world here with the Kindle, and they've bit off way more than they can chew. I understand limiting access to certain apps like the music store, since Amazon is pricing these devices lower and hoping to make up the money in store, but they've gone too far and the customers are really negatively impacted by it. Amazon gets to have its apps in the iPhone and Android markets, but not vice versa.

It was a gift and I liked that one a lot but I couldn't justify getting another one just because I wanted a bigger size - but with this deal I finally got it - I love that I can use it anywhere (although bummed that the great deal for connectivity was gone - now I am paying $30 a  month for this) and I can't tell it was refurbished - have had it for 2 months now and use it all the time!

The Kindle has a few things going for it when compared to the iPad.1) PRICE! - The kindle is so much cheaper than the iPad and this is probably what leads so many people to it initially.2) Android! - I've never been a fan of IOS, and the Android operating system has always been more user friendly in my eyes.3) Free books - When you have a Kindle & you're a member of Amazon Prime you get access to a huge library of free books.-Now that we've gone over the pros, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cons and how to avoid them.1) Amazon tries to lock down their products. - Yes the iPad is similar, but Amazon does it more and if you don't root it's extremely annoying.2) Again, unrooted, you're forced to use the Amazon appstore instead of the google play store. This is a problem if you've previously purchased apps on the Play store and expect to use them on your kindle. - Again - Root your Kindle!3) No GPS!? - The iPads all have GPS for use with sky maps, maps, and apps that need a location to be used.. To save money Amazon left this out... It gets annoying on sideloaded or rooted apps sometimes.-Most of the problems you'll experience on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 can be avoided/gotten around by rooting.

We bought our four kids ages 7, 5.5, 5.5, and 3.5 iPods for Christmas because they were constantly wanting our iPhones and the iPad. The problem is, though, that the kids became even more annoying - constantly asking for new apps. With Kindle Fire, parents can pay monthly (it's like 6 or 7 dollars per household per month) and each kid gets their own profile, fully stocked with Kindle's library of books, videos and apps. When you click on the profile, you are automatically locked in, and it looks just like any other profile, you can click on books, or apps, or videos. Amazon stocks the profile with age appropriate content, based on birthday. Parents have the option of adding to the content if they want, or removing content, if they want. And, the kindle gives them time warnings and locks them out after the designated time.  Last night before dinner, my 7 year old was reading his library book about the sabertooth tiger. He then had a lot of questions about the La Brea tar pits. We found a documentary on the internet and he, our 5.5 year old and our 3.5 year old were able to watch it while we cooked. It was awesome.

I also found other uses for my tablet, such as watching Netflix, HBO Go, Surfing the Web and playing the occasional game/app. I went on to switch to the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because I wanted to try something with a larger screen.Pros: Awesome for reading and searching for new books (cannot get any other tablet that will match it in this category); Great for streaming videos from Netflix, Hulu, HBO or any other video app (never experienced any issues); the brightness, volume, WIFI functionality are all pretty good as well.

I use the Fire a lot to play games which are addictive, and I like to check my e-mails on it instead of going to the computer.  My gripe about Kindle products is that they have minimum instructions!  What happened to an old fashioned instruction book that tells you everything and how to do it?  It's hard to read some instructional tid bit on the device and try to implement it at the same time and then try to find that item again in the instructions.  It doesn't tell me a lot of the things I'd like to know.  When you push the ON button and \"Kindle Fire\" lights up on the screen, do you just wait till the screen saver shows up, or do you push it again?  Why is it sometimes so hard to close the book you're reading and get the Home icon to show up?  Is it slow, or am I just impatient?  Should you always go to Home before touching the OFF button?  Is it better to plug in in each night and let it charge all night, or is that too long to leave it plugged in?  Is it better to charge it frequently or to wait till it is very low?  Some things can be frustrating to non-techies who are not as familiar with all the new devices and would really like to be walked through some of the options and techniques.

My mother had surgery and she and my father live in another state.  They live in a retirement community and the TV in the house is right by their bedroom.  I spend my day taking care of her and the house and was looking forward to seeing a movie when I went to bed on my new HD Kindle, a little down time for myself to recharge.  I attempted to download two movies before leaving my house and was unable.  I called the help line and was still unable.  I waited till I got to my parents house and attempted the download again.  Still no luck even with calling the support line.  They are sending me a new Kindle to arrive on Monday.  I leave on Wednesday.  So, I am a little disappointed in the problem with the download because this was a perfect moment for me to use the movie portion of the device.  I choose to take the kindle vs my laptop to save space, which did its job there, however, I have not been able to use it since Thursday or Friday when we reset the Kindle.

It's kind of a complete joke. The battery drains within an hour or two, even when it's plugged in as you're using it. I've had several instances of plugging it in to charge via USB while I'm at work (read: not using it) only to find that it has not only not charged at all, but drained to the point of shutting off. I've also plugged it in to charge overnight in a wall outlet and woke up to find that, again, it hasn't charged but has drained and shut off. I plugged it in to a different outlet, checked it after 30 minutes or so to make sure something was happening, and then left it plugged in for another ten hours. When I checked it before bed, it was charged to 86%. That is nothing short of ridiculous, I'm sorry.I am aware of a special \"quick charge\" device that you can purchase separately to charge in under 5 hours (Wow, you're kidding! Strap in and put your helmets on kids, this is ludicrous speed! /sarcasm #Spaceballs), but I think it's absurd that you have to buy a \"special charger\" to make the thing function normally.The picture is fine, the sound is fine, the app availability is marginal, the interface is acceptable. It's hard to care about much else when you can't even use it for any reasonable length of time.In this case you get what you pay for. It was cheap, and it functions accordingly.

The 7\" tablets and 6\" eReaders that are out there have too small a screen for me for extended use.  At the price a refurb of the 8.9 HD was offered on sale, I thought it would be worth trying out.  It's a pretty good reader for pdfs, although there isn't any ability to change font size unless you try to convert pdfs into Kindle format via email, which is a hit and miss process.  The screen is fantastic for reading MS docs, very sharp and the 8.9 size makes reading long docs a breeze.I also looked at the ability to watch video (TV and movies) through my Prime account.  The screen is great for that as well, but apparently you can only stream free content.  You can't download unless you pay, which makes this device less desirable for airplane viewing.  Google Play on my 7\" Android tablet seems to have a more interesting selection of movies for rental.So the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD is a very good to fantastic device as an e-reader and a pretty good device for watching TV shows and movies.  But as a tablet for apps it isn't good.  Basically, Amazon has defanged the Android OS to make this device work best as an Amazon product delivery system.  Standard apps for Android, like Google Navigation, aren't available.  There are many key apps I use on my Android 7\" tablet and Apple iPhone that aren't available.  Everything seems to be oriented toward buying books, movies, TV shows, and apps through Amazon.  It's more than a bit annoying, and the OS used isn't nearly as slick as you'd find with a pure Android or Apple tablet.I'll be happy to use this as a reader for book-length manuscripts.  The quality and size of the screen hold a lot of appeal to me.  But I'll keep using my iPhone and Android 7\" tablet for apps.

I just splurged another fifteen bucks to get rid of the \"special offers\" so maybe the interface will be less annoying now.However, the display is fine, operations are quick, sound is good (through headphones or small external speakers), and I'm enjoying streaming Amazon Prime video on the FIre HD. I've been able to load (by USB) some instructional video files and some photos onto the tablet, which I like being able to view without needing to be online.I knew it would be an upgrade from my old Kindle Fire, but have been delighted by the improved performance.I was able to snag the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Saddle Tan during a Lightning Deal on the same day I bought my discounted refurb HD, which was a lucky buy.

Great size - not too big and not too small.  The HD picture is awesome for movies\\videos\\games\\etc.  The sound is an improvement from the 1st Gen I had but could still sue some tweaking - love to see the speakers make it to the front somehow.  They are currently on the back side which means the case can cause some interruption in the quality of the sound.  If you use it without a case you have to be careful where you set it to not block the speakers.  The only other change would be the camera - it is currently located on the front (for use with Skype)which makes it very difficult to take pictures and videos are out....  They need to enable to camera to flip like the iPhone so you can use skype or take pics\\video.  If those changes were made this table would be a 5 star piece of equipment.

I wanted to give myself time for any problems to show themselves. I can honestly say I haven't found any. I've got to say that at first I was not happy to know it came with ads, but they are really tailored to you personally and I've found several with great deals! I got a $3 coupon off on MP3's and so have purchased a couple of single songs to start off my music collection and with the new Dolby stereo they sound wonderful! I also own an older KF and the sound is a HUGE improvement in HD units. You can actually listen to books, movies, games, without any headphones/earbuds if you want. I also love the bigger screen and the quality and crispness is fantastic! I had spent time reading reviews on different devices before I threw my hint out for the KFHD and alot of them said that the quality was excellent and I must say it is!!! The HD also has Bluetooth as well for those who want to listen in private and the little unit I purchased here on Amazon was easy to pair with KFHD. I am also looking into a Bluetooth keyboard to add for ease of use as well. I absolutely love the immersion reading experience! It does actually immerse you into the story more so that just reading and is so nice whenever you need to be up moving around to listen to the story and have it pick up sound wise where you left off read wise, and vice versa. I've seen people complaining about the apps or should I say, the lack thereof, but there is a way to side load many apps. I've enjoyed the free month of prime that came with the KFHD and at $79 a year doesn't seem like a bad deal at all. There were so many movies, shows, games, and books that were free for prime members to use and enjoy that I was never bored. The KFHD may not be as high tech as other android devices on the market, but for many people this is a plus! I can see where older people and younger children would find this an easy unit to use. I enjoy mine and use it everyday. I actually don't know what I would do without it now! As I said before, the KFHD may not as high tech as some android devices, but if you are looking for a cost effective little pad with basic web, excellent sound and screen, access to Amazon with all it's books, games, and apps, wrapped up in a simple, easy to use interface, then the KFHD 8.9 is for you.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Paul Eznack", "ReviewID": "R3BQIJ9NS78LA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really liked my wife's 7\" Kindle Fire HD, but for me, I wanted a larger screen, so I went with the 8.9\".
