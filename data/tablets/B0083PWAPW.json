{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Rocky start, but MUCH better now", "Author": "Brad McClintock", "ReviewID": "R16CUXV9PO91I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE BAD NEWSI bought my Kindle Fire HD 16gb on Sept. 22nd and today is Sept. 24th.My first Kindle Fire HD 16gb came out of the box full of issues.  The speakers were real crackly at first and for some reason after about 10 minutes of using them they cleared up \"a bit\".  They was still a little crackling, but not as bad.The 2nd issue (still to be determined if it was an issue or just something is the norm) was the battery life.  I charged it fully and within 10 minutes of playing FlowFree, the Kindle was showing it had only 3/4ths battery life.  This could be the norm, but if it dies so fast with a simple game then it would never have kept a charge for a full length movie.The 3rd issue was the biggest for me.  I was playing a different game today and the Kindle completely shut down EVERY 5 minutes or so of playing.  I had to reboot and restart the game.  I let this happen for 5 times within a half hour time frame and decided I had enough.  I took that Kindle back to Bestbuy and exchanged it for a new one.******************************************************************************************************************THE GOOD NEWSMy NEWEST Kindle Fire HD 16gb is as far as I can tell, perfectly fine.The sound is AMAZING!!  No crackling at all and the surround sound while watching the Super 8 trailer blew me away!I still don't know about battery life.  I am assuming it is better, but I haven't hooked it to a charger yet.  I did play 30 minutes of my game that was giving me issues this morning and the battery life did not dwindle!  That is a good sign.And yes!  I played 30 minutes of that same game straight through.  The replacement Kindle did NOT shut down one time.I am SO happy that all of my issues appear to be isolated incidents!!******************************************************************************************************************THE FINAL WORDSound - AMAZING!!Picture - Outstanding!  There is still a bit of glare, but NOTHING like my other devices have.  (and no, I do not own an IPAD or Iphone.  I know those rank best in this department.Camera - This is an annoyance of mine and one reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5.  There is no back camera and besides Skype, I have yet to locate anything to let me use the front camera!  Yet, there are a ton of photo editing apps on the market.  This is a major downside in my opinion.  If you have a Front facing camera, at least have a tab or icon to let us use it!Market - Not the biggest at all.  For what I do though, it works.  For others.. it might be a flaw.Other annoying bits to keep in mind - It would have been REALLY helpful if they made the Power and Volume buttons silver or any other color than black!  I'm sure I will get use to it, but I don't know how many times I have turned the Kindle all around trying to find the dang buttons.  They are flush with the base and blend in.. not a smart call on Amazons part.Only other complaint is the keyboard.  I wish it would turn sideways when you are typing.  It might for some programs, but haven't seen it personally.  Also would be nice to be able to read the books horizontal instead of being made to read them just vertical.  Petty complaint, but figured I'd put it in the review.  :)", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD vs Nexus 7 vs iPad", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1WVSUDU6ZG60H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update (9.21.12)After a week with the Kindle Fire HD, I am still very impressed.  There are several features that I uncovered in that time that add to the already sweet hardware:1. Flash works!  If you don't mind a couple of extra steps, you can easily get flash to work on this device.  In the interest of full disclosure, I could never get flash to work properly on the Nexus 7 although some people apparently can.  Check out the comments for this review for instructions!2. Text to speech has been added to Kindle Books.  This is a great feature that I really enjoyed with the e-ink Kindle, and it's a wonderful addition to the fire.  It's great for reading while doing other tasks!3. Micro HDMI works as advertised.  You get exact mirroring of what is being displayed on the device, unlike many phones with HDMI that only allow certain video apps.  It's like having Apple's Air Play without buying Apple TV (if you don't mind running a cable across the floor).To sum up, the Fire is probably the most enjoyable tablet I've owned.  The video and audio quality is just outstanding and makes me want to use the device.  Everything about amazon's content works beautifully, and just inspires you to seek out more media.  If you're someone who wants complete control over your experience and likes to tinker, the Nexus 7 is certainly the best choice.  If you want to try replacing your laptop, the iPad or a full size android tablet (such as the Asus Transformer line) are your best choices.  However, if you'd rather spend your time enjoying movies, games, books, and music, the Kindle is far superior (in my opinion).  It's a nearly ideal combination of a convenient form factor, quality hardware and software, an extremely rich content libraries, and overall value!Original Review (9.14.12)I currently own all three of these devices, so I thought it might helpful to do a short comparison.  First, however, I want to address the ill-informed one star reviews: there is no more Flash on any new mobile devices.  It's not Amazon's or Google's fault, as Adobe decided to completely block it, so stop whining! Also, you can remove the lock screen and home screen ads at any time for a $15 one time charge.Moving on, the Kindle Fire HD is a superb product and outclasses the Nexus 7  in several ways:1. Double the storage for the same price: I ran out of space almost immediately on my Nexus 7 8GB!2. Vastly superior sound from the dual stereo speakers: the Kindle has easily the best sounding speakers on any tablet, while the Nexus is barely audible.3. Much better screen even though the resolution is the same: the Nexus 7 screen is washed out and too dim in almost every situation.  The Kindle screen has gorgeous colors and contrast, plus the anti-glare filter works quite well.4. HDMI out vs. Nothing: There is no way to get video out of the Nexus 7.5. Reduced access to Amazon content: Although you can get Kindle books, apps, and mp3's on the Nexus, there's no way to get Amazon Video or use the Kindle Lending Library on the Nexus 7.6. Build quality: the Nexus 7 feels a bit cheap compared to the Kindle and lacks the Fire's super strong Gorilla Glass.However, the Nexus has some strong advantages as well:1. Many more apps and games: the Google Play store has around 600,000 apps compared to about 60,000 on the Amazon App Store.  No malware on the Kindle though!2. Excellent processor for gaming and general performance: the Nexus is extremely snappy and high end games look amazing.  Maybe the 8.9\" model will be different, but for now, the Nexus 7 is just a bit faster than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD.3. Stock android software: the latest version of Android (Jelly Bean) is superb and probably the best mobile operating system currently available.When compared to my wife's iPad, it's hard to not think about price.  Besides that, I would still buy a Kindle even if they cost the same.  The 7\" form factor is just more useful and comfortable than the larger tablets.  Amazon has addressed pretty much all of the hardware complaints about the original Fire including the power and volume controls, blocky/brick-like design, and poor off-angle viewing.  Basically, you're getting the premium experience of the iPad without the cost, and also in a more convenient package.I do have a few complaints about the device, as it's not quite perfect:1. Why can't I change the keyboard? I love SwiftKey on my Android phone, but I can't use it on the Kindle Fire.2. The Silk browser still needs work.  I sideloaded the Dolphin Browser, which is much faster and smoother.3. A few basic Google apps would be nice like YouTube and Maps.  Of course, you can sideload these if you want, but native support would be nice.4. We Need More Apps!  Amazon has to improve the App Store if they want to remain relevant.All in all, though, it's a fantastic device and an improvement in every way on the original.  I'll probably be selling my Nexus 7, but want to live with the Kindle for a few days to be sure.  Hopefully, we'll be able to install stock Jelly Bean soon, and have the best of both worlds.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing product, great price!", "Author": "Amanda A. Thompson \"A thompson\"", "ReviewID": "RAYQP3JF7FUV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I loved my 2nd Edition Kindle, I was torn between purchasing an iPad, Android tablet and Kindle Fire. I somehow thought the Kindle Fire would just be for reading like my old Kindle. Well, I was wrong.My husband bought me the Kindle Fire and I use it for EVERYTHING! I not only love reading my books on my Kindle Fire, but I am addicted to the apps (in particlar Pandora and TuneIn Radio for listening to music, Pinterest, Ultimate Checklist, Travel Planner, iSpy Cameras,Facebook and Flipboard), the games (solitaire, sudoku, mahjong, wordsearch, Scrabble, movies, videos, newspapers, magazines and storing documents and photos.Unlike my old Kindle, the graphics are AMAZING! The sound is clear, even without headphones and there are hundreds of apps for anything and everything you could ever think of. At half the price of an iPad, with everything I could every want or need? I would highly recommend this product.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great upgrade to an already-great consumer tablet!", "Author": "Brian Hartman", "ReviewID": "R3U2JWR87ZGLJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my Kindle Fire HD yesterday, so I may update this review if I discover anything else.First of all, the screen is beautiful.  I was completely blown away.  If you compare the old Kindle Fire's screen to this one, it's no contest.  It's gorgeous.  I actually find myself using my reading glasses less on this Kindle Fire than the old model.  Second, Amazon did a great job on the audio.  Professional reviews have called this the best audio on a tablet, and I have to agree.  You won't need to use headphones just to hear the tablet, that's for sure.  If you're considering upgrading from a Kindle Fire, those two improvements alone would be worth it.Physically, the Kindle Fire HD is much thinner than the original Kindle Fire. With the rounded edges, it's got a much less boxy feel than the original.  The bezel around the screen is larger than the original Kindle Fire, so the overall device is a little bit larger.  I don't find it too large to hold with one hand, but if you have a case or cover for your old Kindle Fire, it won't work on this one.As you would expect, when I opened my Kindle Fire HD and turned it on, all of my content from my old Kindle Fire was there waiting for me.  The carousel is very fluid on this version, and the overall speed of the device is much improved.  There's a camera for use with Skype (which is included on the tablet), and of course, a microphone.The camera is positioned on one of the long sides of the device, rather than the short side, so it's meant to be held in landscape mode when you're videoconferencing.  I find this an odd design decision, since every other tablet with a webcam that I've seen has it positioned in portrait mode, but it's not that big a deal.  Amazon doesn't include a camera app with the tablet, but you can easily download an app like Gallery+ that will serve that purpose fine.  The camera is most certainly *not* HD, so don't expect too much out of it, but for videoconferencing, Facebook, and such, it works fine.Movies, as you'd expect, play very well on the Kindle Fire HD.  I was impressed by both the sound and how fluid the playback was.  The device seemed to do a lot less buffering than the old Kindle Fire.  X-Ray for movies also performed admirably, showing information on actors in the movies (when supported).  It's not a feature I think I'd use very much, but it's nice to have.Books are much the same story. Everything is very fluid.  There are still no page turn animations in books, but I don't like that kind of thing, anyway.  The crisp display makes reading a pleasure.  You certainly won't mistake it for e-Ink, but it's  a nice screen to read off of. X-Ray for Books was a little disappointing, though.  I'm reading \"Lord of the Flies\", and X-Ray only had information on one character.  I hope authors and publishers take better advantage of the technology in the future.Happily, Bluetooth is included in the Kindle Fire HD.  To test it, I paired it with my printer, and it worked fine.  I look forward to getting a Bluetooth keyboard for it.So with all of that going for it, why didn't I give it five stars?  Well, there are some baffling design decisions.  They're not enough to really drag the Kindle Fire HD down, but they're big enough to leave me scratching my head.First, there's no charging indicator.  You have to go to the Device screen under Settings to find out if the device is charging, and how far along it is.  (I say \"if\" it's charging, because there are some situations, like when it's turned on and plugged into your computer, rather than an outlet, where it won't charge.)Then, there are the buttons.  Amazon seems to have trouble getting the ergonomics of their buttons right on the Kindle Fire.  In the last version, people complained because the power button stuck out too much, and could be depressed when the tablet was put on a lap, table, etc.  In this version, the buttons are all flush with the device.  Unfortunately, this makes it harder to operate the buttons by feel.  It's not hard to get used to, but it's a little disconcerting at first.And although I don't consider it a big deal, I do have to ding Amazon a little for not including a camera app.  A tablet with a camera should always include one.Overall, I would enthusiastically recommend this device to anyone thinking of upgrading from the older version of the Kindle Fire.  If you have an iPad 3, you probably won't be jealous.  And if you're a devotee of Android, you might want to go with the Nexus 7 (just because it's \"pure\" Android, rather than Amazon's forked version).  But I can definitely recommend this tablet without reservation to anyone looking for a great tablet experience without spending a lot of money. :)10/7/2012:Because the battery indicator problem has an easy fix (the free Battery HD app) I've decided to give the tablet 5 stars.  The buttons aren't a big deal to get used to, and the camera problem also has an app fix.  I might give the device 4 1/2 stars if I could, but since I have to use whole numbers, it's 5. :)", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "KFHD: Original Fire's Fumbles Fixed! (US-centric features)", "Author": "Mers", "ReviewID": "R3BO9VRVDWZ4I6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "tl;dr - The Kindle Fire HD is exactly what I was looking for: a thin-&-light Android tablet that lets me access digital content and surf the web/check email/entertain myself while NOT sitting at my desk. I had some initial  concerns based on some of the reviews, but between a little googling, software patches, using the right apps, and some creativity, all of them were resolved. (Scroll to **** for my list of fumbles fixed.)Overall, I think the KFHD is a brilliant little device. I like how it looks and feels. I like what you get for the price you pay. It does what I want it to do. Is it perfect? Of course not. I fully expect the one next year to make this one look like last year's Fire. OH WAIT. =DWhat I like:1. OMG the speakers are a million times better than the original Fire's. For the size and distance between speaker grilles, you can actually hear the stereo-ness of it.2. The screen! so clear and bright and pretty!3. Video out port. I cannot tell you how much I LOVE THAT HDMI OUT.4. The WiFi really is able to pick up signals from a wider area. Side-by-side compare with my OF shows me about 8 more networks in my area, and two that are 1-bar on the OF are full bar on the KFHD.5. Integration with my Amazon content is seamless.6. If you have Prime and use Prime Video (some only use it for shipping, go figure ;) you'd be crazy not to pair it with a KFHD. If you do NOT have Prime and expect to get a free month of Prime, be aware that you are not eligible for the trial month if you signed up for the free trial in the last 12-13 months (dates approximate).7. The larger size is a bit of a stretch (hah! literally for smaller hands!) but it turns out I like the wider border because it gives my hands/fingers something to hold on to and lessen the need to stretch at all.NEW! 8. Gamecircle - normally, I hate 'socializing' my games, leaderboards, achievements, all that nonsense, BUT! Gamecircle makes a Steam-like experience for game progress between OF and KFHD. If, for example, you have tri-ducked a lot of Where's My Water, and don't want to do it over again on your new tablet, Gamecircle is for you! If you can't (or won't) root/copy game files/transfer manually, Gamecircle allowed me to continue playing on the KFHD where I was last on the OF with no effort (other than enabling Gamecircle to begin with).What I DISlike (but not a dealbreaker):1. Orientation - flips at the slightest shift. Thankfully, I can lock the screen to my preferred landscape.FIXED IN 7.2.2! - Keyboard - WHY is there no CAPSLOCK? And give us more longpress options; it seems stupid to have to switch to SYM or +> \"keyboards\" when a longpress on the alpha keys should have the basic special characters. I'm not even asking for Swype, so what gives? And why so much space between keys? When typing on webforms, autocapitalize and autocomplete suggestions do not appear, even when I made sure the settings were correct. Very weird.3. Silk Reading View - if it is supposed to feel like a book, why are we scrolling like it is a website instead of getting tap/swipe to next page/screen?NEW!! 4. Silk crashing - on long websurfing sessions, Silk will occasionally freeze and crash, no idea why. Thankfully, it manages to restore the tabs with no problems, but it is irksome that it crashes at all.FIXED IN 7.2.2 (at least for me) - \"Zombie\" carousel (where stuff removed from carousel keep coming back) - I actually have not experienced this yet, but I remember how irritating it was when we weren't able to remove anything from the original Fire's carousel. Amazon patched it then, so hopefully I won't get hit before it gets patched now.Special note:Considering the events of hurricane Sandy, I was SHOCKED that my KFHD arrived exactly on time. It sat in delivery depot starting Oct 27, and I was resigned to getting it late due to flooding in NJ--then Nov 2 it turns up in my mailbox, exactly as estimated on the order page. Color me impressed, Amazon/FedEx!**** **** ****Reminder: I have the Original Fire (OF) and the Fire HD (KFHD), so any comparisons I make will be to the OF. I'm going to list the problems I've been hearing about in user reviews while waiting for my KFHD and giving my 5 cents now that I have my own for testing.**** **** ****Major Complaints (**items are my own):1. Prime Video only works in USA - unfortunately (though understandably) a vast majority of the video offerings of Amazon are only available if you are located in the USA. Due to the mess that is international intellectual property protections, Amazon actually DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION to sell or stream a lot of media outside the US. Blame the studios/countries. It sucks for non-US buyers, honestly, but until international law is settled, we are going to have to live with regional/locality barriers. WORKAROUND: get yourself a VPN with a US IP address.2. KFHD does not ship with a charger, just a USB cord - Considering that:(a) most users *already have* USB chargers - the OF charger works on the KFHD, as does my cellphone's, and heck, if you have an iDevice, the plug head for those should work with your USB cord! How much e-waste do you really want anyway?(b) if you read the complete product description (which you should ALWAYS do when spending money!) it was clear in the 'what's in the box' section near the bottom that it was only a USB cord, no charger.(c) on the order page, under the 'add to cart' button, Amazon recommends a powerfast charger for $10 and spells out that this is not included with the KFHD--I'm shocked that people were shocked that there was no charger in the box. NON-ISSUE (but YMMV if you didn't notice, don't have any other USB-powered devices, and can't spare the cash)3. Special Offers - this sucks, but it is also easily ignored. How long do you stare at the lockscreen anyway? And they didn't spring it on buyers as a surprise... it's on the product description, and based on the trend with the e-ink Kindles, it was inevitable. I actually consider it to be typical corporate money-gouging behavior to charge to get rid of them. ALL businesses will find a way to get more money out of you, I promise; its kind of the whole point of being a business. Do I like being charged for it? No, but at least it is a nominal $15, which is certainly affordable to most buyers. The $30 for e-ink Kindles is a lot harder to swallow, IMHO. NON-ISSUE (but YMMV)**4. Customers Also Bought - I nearly cancelled my preorder because of this. I really didn't want to concede the screen space for that crap, but then Amazon promised a software update so I decided to wait, and return the KFHD if it wasn't fixed. Lo and behold! Version 7.2.1 is out, and the CAB is now user-controlled. NON-ISSUE (after update)5. My kid can see XYZ! - um, if you didn't install Kids Place or lock WiFi or password your Fire (or create *and control* one Amazon account specifically for the kid with their own Fire), you're not even TRYING to manage things. You can't hold a corporation responsible for what your kid does when the tools exist for YOU to take control. And hey, look! FreeTime has rolled out on KFHD so: NON-ISSUE, particularly after update.6. Flash not supported - OK, this one is seriously not Amazon's fault. When the owner of Flash (Adobe) announces end-of-life for mobile OS with Flash as of 08/15/2012, it is actually recommended business best practice to NOT offer technology that is on the way out. As for not seeing the content you are used to, Amazon has no control over non-Amazon sites! YES it is inconvenient, but you should be giving the dinosaur websites you are visiting the stinkeye for not having mobile-friendly versions... Or maybe they do--have you tried using \"m.whatever\" instead of \"[...]\"? You might be surprised. Besides, there are several googleable workarounds (sideloading browsers, apps) so: NON-ISSUEMinor Griping (based on reviews (**items are my own):1. Power button is invisible/impossible to find - I *really* don't get this one. I bought one of the wake/sleep covers  to make it easier, but I didn't actually need it for that. If you run your finger along the side of the KFHD you can feel a gap/edge with 2 short extrusions in a row (volume rocker) then a smooth section, another gap/edge (power), another smooth section and then the speaker grille. You don't need to see the buttons to press them, and no matter how difficult you personally find it, there is a trivial amount of time needed to make it feel normal. Beyond all that, it is approximately in the middle of the short edge of the KFHD, so just feeling in the area you will find the invisible button. NON-ISSUE**2. Battery indicator gone - I get that a LED on the button (OF) just won't work anymore for engineering/aesthetic reasons, but it was a really convenient way to see if the OF was in fact charging. WORKAROUND: install Battery HD.3. No official access to GooglePlay - Of *course* a content provider will make it easier for you to buy the competition's content. After all, they are only selling products out of the goodness of their hearts right? There's no profit motive at all! YEAH NO. And note that there is no *official* access--the KFHD (and the OF) is completely able to access 3rd party sites and allow sideloading if you feel very strongly about the app you need being not available in the Amazon appstore. NON-ISSUE3a. which leads to: Fewer apps in Amazon Appstore than GooglePlay - really? this is a thing now? How many cut-the-rope clones do you really need? The major apps are available on both stores. If you can't find your app, and sideloading doesn't work, and no decent alternative can be found, and you *absolutely MUST* have it, why not ask the developers to create a KFHD version? Surprisingly, Amazon does not control which apps have KFHD versions. Shocking, I know. NON-ISSUE3b. which leads to: WhateverApp looks ugly/does not work right on the Fire - yes, OF COURSE Amazon is responsible for how a developer designs their apps. ::eye-rolling:: NON-ISSUE (unless it is an Amazon app because that ain't right ;)4. Amazon cases overpriced - I sort of agree with this one. The official cases aren't THAT much higher on the quality scale than others available, but then again, I'm sure this is all part of their marketing/brand position. Whatever the reason, there ARE other brands available that are just as functional, so NON-ISSUE5. No SD memory slot - until the Nook Tablet HD (or whatever they're calling it) came out, there was NO major brand 7\" Android tablet with a memory slot. To be honest, everyone is trying to get you married to their cloud so I doubt the major producers (Amazon, Google, Samsung, Apple) will ever offer an SD slot. Considering I haven't actually filled up my 8GB OF yet, I suspect my 32GB KFHD is going to last a while. NON-ISSUE (and if you care for rooting purposes, you're more techie than the target audience for this device anyway. The Nexus 7 seems more your speed ;)6. \"only\" front-facing camera - I'm betting most users would rather have their cellphone or actual cameras for pictures as they are easier to hold, are always on hand AND have decent cameras. The one on the KFHD is meant for use with Skype, and it does that job very well. Besides, you'd look pretty nutso holding up a (relatively) gigantic tablet in a sea of cellphones. The ability to switch Skype video calling from front to rear view is a nice to have but not mission critical. NON-ISSUE **plus Amazon added a camera app in 7.2.2 so no more complaints, yeah?7. No 3G/4G/LTE on the KFHD7 - I don't get this one. I suppose it is nice to have connectivity wherever you go, but to be honest the only time I am out of a WiFi zone is if I am driving around. When I'm sitting down with my tablet at home, in a cafe, in a park, in a friend's house, I will either use the available WiFi or tether to my phone. I don't want to pay for a second data plan, after all. Furthermore, I believe the price of the data plan for the KFHD8.9 is more than $50 in your second year. NON-ISSUE (but YMMV if WiFi not available in areas you frequent)8. No turn-by-turn navigation/GPS - I don't get this one at all. The car/cellphone GPS is better for that purpose. I'm not paying for a second data plan, when all I get out of it is a super-sized GPS I have to leave in my lap or the seat beside because mounting a 7-inch tablet on the dash would kill visibility.

Carroll", "ReviewID": "R2MQ8VKZ2F8SXL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before I purchased this item, and I decided that I would give it a shot. It came out of the box decently charged, and once I got everything set up I was eager to look around and discover some goodies. I downloaded the Twitter and Facebook apps, which look AMAZING on the display, but my favorite social networking app (Tumblr) was nowhere to be found. I decided to just log on using Silk and found that I couldn't type anything into the login fields. After some quick Googling, I found out that I simply needed to restart the Kindle. That took care of THAT problem easily enough...Apps: Before I bought this, I was well aware that the app store was lacking, but I didn't really realize by how much. It was virtually impossible for me to find anything useful, and in some cases I would try to download something only to find it was incompatible with the HD. This became incredibly frustrating after about an hour of use.Carousel: This is a neat feature, but constantly removing icons from it was bothersome. It frequently added icons back after I removed them even if I hadn't used the app or read the book.Browser: I found that the browser didn't work very well for me unless I loaded everything in mobile view. This wasn't terrible, but it wasn't my favorite either.I had a problem with the page orientation changing and the slightest movement, but that was fixed by locking the orientation. I also had an issue with the physical glass screen pressing inward when I used a stylus. It just made the product seem poorly made and kind of fragile. I'm accustomed to using touchscreen devices, so I wasn't pressing particularly hard. The screen just appears to have some give.I found that the touchscreen was sometimes really sensitive, while at other times it barely registered a tap or swipe. This made playing games iffy, and sometimes I'd accidentally press links in the browser that I didn't intend to press.Oh, and the ads... There were some good offers, but I found the constant advertising a bit annoying. It wasn't intrusive, but it wasn't exactly subtle either.Overall, I was disappointed with the Kindle Fire HD. It isn't a bad device, but it isn't the device for me.

It's a tool so be patient and allow some serious playtime to unleash all your KFHD can do for you.A couple of basic tips:* Download the software update 7.2.1 as soon as you get connected to wi-fi - the update solves a lot of problems people complain about on this board. Press Sync and the update will download in the background while you play with your new KFHD and install when it next goes to sleep.* Facebook app works fine for me after the above update.* TubeMate (in the App store) is great so don't start about not being able to view YouTube.* Dolphin HD browser is really fast and it accommodates FLASH (may open a separate player window). I sideloaded that from GetJar (easy-peasey). Lots of 'sideloading' tips in the comments section of the reviews here or look in the forum or search YouTube from your new TubeMate app. I like SILK but I think Dolphin is faster.* Imho, INOMAIL Lite is better than the pre installed Amazon e-mail app (INOMAIL LITE is free in the App store)* MapQuest is a good map app* TweetCaster for Twitter is a fab Twitter app.* Movies from Amazon look magnificent, from Netflix (using the app) slightly less but still really good quality. Hulu Plus looks great.* You'll need a case - this is cheap & good (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098F5WJC/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00). It stand the KFHD upright for watching movies at a table, etc.* Order your power supply with the KFHD and you'll get an immediate discount. Amazon sell the KFHD almost at cost so don't whine about the power supply.Issues:I've noticed the yellow hue on SILK and I can see it on HULU PLUS too. I don't mind but some might not like it.On/off button & volume - watch the camera; the buttons are to the right of the camera when the camera is upright so the buttons are easy to find if you locate where the camera is when feeling for them. Fiddly but better than protruding buttons methinks.Disclaimer: I would like to get a Nexus 7 one day (it has great reviews and I like Google products). I have no problem with Apple devices - they're excellent. Having said that, I'm thrilled with my KFHD. Enjoy yours :)", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "March 31 2013 update  (old title: Better value / different experience than iPad Mini)", "Author": "M. Zolikoff", "ReviewID": "R13LOXXM37MW7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "March 31 2013 update -A few days ago my son accidentally dropped and shattered the glass on our iPad 2, but it still worked normally otherwise.  My wife and I debated the various options:  get it fixed by a 3rd party or by Apple, buy a new iPad 2/3/Mini or a Kindle or other Android tablet, or do nothing.  I asked what apps she and my son used the most on the iPad and then loaded them on my Kindle Fire HD so they could \"test\" the experience.  In short, it was a slightly \"painful\"/stressful experience for all of us, as I couldn't just drop the Kindle in their laps and let them run free.  \"See this hidden button on the side?  Wait, where is that bugger?  Ah, here it is. This is how you wake it up.  Ok, this is the carousel, and you have to swipe through this thing until you find the app you want, or you can touch the App link at the top.  Oh, wait, it's a bit laggy today, sorry.  Hmmm, that app froze.  Hmmm, super laggy today.  Oh, how do you adjust the volume?  Well, there are these hidden buttons on the side, or you can tap on the screen and wait for the onscreen controls to come up.  What, you want to get to the Internet?  Um, let me remember how to do that; oh, the Favorites star.  Or you can (again) swipe through the carousel\" etc etc etc.  5 minutes later the experiment was concluded and the results were, um, not positive.So we went to the Apple store to see what it would cost to fix the iPad, and while we waited we played with the iPad Mini.  O.M.G. that thing was fast and light (308g vs 395g - trust me, there's a difference).  Granted, you don't get the full Amazon ecosystem experience in terms of content (but you can load the Amazon Video app), but wow.  Did I mention it was fast?  And easy to find the wake up/home button?  And a familiar experience.  After we found out how much it would cost to get it fixed/replaced by Apple, I did a quick Google search to find a local ok-Yelp-rated iPad repair shop, and then we compared our options.Options:$249 - New replacement via Apple with 90 day warranty$330 - New iPad Mini$175 - New Kindle Fire HD from Best Buy with a $25 Rewards certificate (normally $200)$110 - get the iPad fixed by a 3rd partyNot only was getting the iPad fixed our best option monetarily, but in terms of the OS/interface experience and speed and reliability, it made more sense (for us) to stick with the iPad for now.Now, if the Kindle experience would have been on par with the Apple experience I would have pushed for a new Kindle Fire HD for another $65.  But I couldn't make that argument, I simply couldn't.  Since he was 2, my son has been able to use iOS with almost no guidance from me, but with the Kindle it's \"Daddy, how do I?\" and \"Daddy, how do I?\" every 3 minutes.  And the speed difference between the two is just night and day.So, there you go.  Personally, I'm \"ok\" with my Kindle and the way it works as compared to iOS.  But when it comes to \"just working\" for my wife and son, I have to go with the iPad every day and twice on Sundays.================Previous ReviewPrior to my purchase, I had been thinking about a 7\" tablet for about six months, as my iPad 2 had become the family's central digital device and my digital reading appetite had been increasing at a logarithmic rate.  The next logical step was a device for myself, right?Once the iPad Mini's pricing became available (and immediately priced me out of the market - tsk tsk, Apple, as my family has two iPhones, an iPod Touch, an iPad 2 and a Macbook Pro), I spent about two weeks making extensive pro/con lists and reading every reputable review I could find about the Kindle Fire HD and the Nexus 7.  In the end it really boiled down to one thing:  Amazon Prime.Sure, a faster tablet with a better screen, a more-extensive app store, a flat/open operating system, and a more-aggressive operating system upgrade schedule is nice, but in the end I had to ask myself one simple question:  \"what am I going to use this tablet for?\"  And the answers were:  browsing, email, Facebook, reading, and *maybe* the occasional video.  It was the last two answers that really helped me make my decision.See, we have Amazon Prime.  And while we stream quite a bit from Amazon using our Prime account and our LG TV, having a Kindle would give me access to an additional (and significant) chunk of content.  Plus there's the (albeit limited on a monthly basis) Kindle Lending Library.So, I tromped on down to Best Buy with a few Reward Zone certificates in hand and woke up a week later having consumed a massive amount of Star Trek, Star Wars and Fringe episodes and a plethora of cheesy B sci-fi movies.  Seriously, that additional chunk of content I was talking about?  Um, it's a LOT, and there's a LOT of good stuff there.  And, I've been ripping DVDs and whatnot to MP4s and sideloading them like crazy (hint: do a search for the Personal Videos app on the Kindle and make it a favorite - this is the cleanest and easiest way to find your sideloaded videos).  Not to mention downloading a bunch of free classics from the Gutenberg Project (hint: and dropping them in the Documents folder using ES Explorer).  Have you ever read beyond the first sentence of Moby Dick?  It's a HOOT!  The narrator is a sarcastic, slap-you-in-the-face, very Louis C.K. kind of guy.  I actually think that Moby Dick is a comedy.In the short week I've had my Kindle, I can't even begin to calculate what it would take to get the content I've consumed on Google Play or the iTunes Store.  This tablet may not be the fastest, sleekest device or have the wicked-easy OS of an Apple iOS device, but man it has content.My main gripes thus far center around physical design.  Frankly, the volume and on/off buttons are useless JUNK and every port is in the wrong place.  When I pick up my iPad and need to wake it up, it's one big button on the face that I can find in the dark while half inebriated; easy easy easy, so easy in fact that my 3 year old son can do it.  With the Kindle Fire HD it's a \"which way am I holding this damn thing and where is that button again?!?!?\" experience.  Hey Jeff B, here's a design hint:  give your prototypes to a 3 year old and tell them to turn it on.  If they can't, YOU HAVE THE WRONG DESIGN.  Regarding the ports... normally, I wouldn't care where the ports are, but you will when you try to find a case for your Kindle that ISN'T the $40 version from Amazon.  Read the reviews and the 2/3/4-star reviews all sound the same: \"the designer didn't get this right\"/\"it opens the wrong way\"/\"opposite\"/etc, but what this really means is that the *Kindle* is improperly designed and the designers put the buttons and ports on adjacent sides of the device, not opposing sides.Other than the physical issues, everything else is amazing... sure, the carousel interface is a bit limiting and dumbed down, but this is a content consumption device, not an end-all/be-all device (although the Amazon Appstore has everything you need and more to make it a be-all device; don't buy into the hype that you need 300K+ apps at your disposal, because you don't, and whatever you do need is in the Amazon Appstore).Thus far, I'm a VERY happy and proud owner of a Kindle Fire HD, and I look forward to future iterations.PS - Unless you plan on sideloading a bunch of movies or have purchased a bunch of MP3s from Amazon that you absolutely NEED to have on your Kindle that you don't have on your phone, you don't need the 32GB version.  Rip, sideload, watch, delete, repeat = 16GB.  (Sure, 32GB is only $50 more, but that's 50 MP3s or 12 rentals)", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "First eReader", "Author": "Kitch", "ReviewID": "R2VDGCODFRJH86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the title suggests, this is my first eReader. I've had some time to play around with the original Kindle Fire and the Samsung Galaxy 7\" Tab, and so far I'm loving the Kindle Fire HD. For a while I did a side by side comparison with the Samsung tablet that I bought earlier this year. They both have their strong points, but I'm reviewing the Fire HD so that's where the focus will be, even if I use the Samsung as a reference point. So lets get started with what an eReader is all about! Reading books...Books - The Kindle Fire HD gives you three different backdrop colors to choose from when reading books. White, black, and sepia. I started off using white but then moved to sepia because it's just more comfortable. One of the biggest reasons I waited so long to jump on the eReader train was because I like paper books. I still do. However, I'm shocked at how quickly I've 'adjusted', if you can even call it that. Switching to the Fire HD was seamless because of the screen clarity and ease of use. The sepia choice makes it seem more like a book I suppose. You can also change font styles and sizes, but I haven't touched much of that. One thing I would like to mention here is that reading on this vs the Samsung only differs really in the margins. The Kindle gives you a larger area for text where as the Samsung cuts off a sentence or two. Minor difference, not much of a setback. Changing pages is easy, you tap the screen. Adding bookmarks to save your place is easy as well and I've only used it a few times when the book would close on it's own and start from the beginning. Not sure why it's done that, but it has happened. One fantastic feature that comes in handy is being able to highlight and then search keywords throughout the entire book. I'm currently reading a detective novel and it's extremely convenient to be able to highlight a name and see every time it's been used previously so I can refresh on a character's background from earlier in the story.Movies - The HD screen really shines here. Of course everything I use as far as movies is streamed through Amazon, so internet connection is a big player here as far as clarity. Whenever I have a good connection though, it's fantastic to see these movies and TV shows with such clarity. The color quality on the Fire is amazing as well. No complaints here. It's worth noting that the Fire HD has fantastic speakers as well. I was able to hear everything without having to blast the volume and it even has surround sound.Magazines - One of the main reasons I gave this item 5 stars was the convenience factor. I can't explain how great it is to carry a magazine, book, and movie with me all in one device. I honestly didn't think this would matter, since carrying a book or magazine with me or throwing it in the car isn't necessarily hard, it's just beyond convenient to have it on one device. I've seen reviews on magazines saying they prefer the paper to take in certain pictures and read the articles in larger print, but I can honestly say I prefer the Fire HD. I read Bike Magazine and they put out some phenomenal pictures and the HD screen does them justice. I'd even argue it's a better look than the paper version. It also gives you the option to read the articles in full page view, just like you're reading the magazine, or by double-clicking an article to read it in eReader mode where you can adjust font size, etc, etc.Apps - you're locked into Amazons app store, but they give you the majority of any app you'd need. This wasn't a big selling point for me. I've only really put Sudoku on mine. I have a smart phone for apps. Amazon does have a great selection and a majority of the top games and applications can be found on their market.Browser - It's nice that it comes with a browser, and can handle the desktop sized websites, but it seems like the Samsung I was using loaded websites faster than the HD. However -- the general interface of the Fire HD itself (scrolling through material & shopping in the market) went faster than the Samsung did because of how Amazon has kept everything very simple and you don't have the option to have a main screen to put apps and links on. I realize these are two different devices entirely, but just figured I'd mention it. Another thing I'll add to this small section is the added wifi system they put in the HD. I'm not the most technical person, but I can pick up on wifi networks from much farther distances than most other wireless devices I own. It's great for range, but speed stays the same.Screen Quality - As I've stated before, it's stunning! I've been able to watch tv and movies and enjoy the fantastic pictures in my magazines. It's also a perk to not strain your eyes as much as other back-lit eReaders caused me to do while testing them out in the store. I'd also like to mention that when they say they've added anti-glare technology to it, that's true to a certain extent. The black siding to the screen definitely shows a reflection, but it doesn't matter so much. The screen itself with your media on it has a slight glare that I had to look for to see. I haven't used it outside, and really have never seen the need to yet, but inside with lamps around it doesn't pick up any extra light to create a glare, which is another plus. I also like that this is a little wider. The original Fire's screen sort of bugged me for it's shape.Weight - Super light & thin. I hardly notice any weight at all when carrying it. It's also comfortable to hold when reading.Accessories - I bought the leather case that Amazon sells for it and it's very nice. I like the stand when watching movies and it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling to have something cover it, even if it doesn't protect from drops.Ports / Storage - So far I haven't filled up really any of the space on it. For what this device is used for, you really don't need a lot of space unless you're downloading movies to it, in which case you need to upgrade to the larger size as there are no SD card slots or any of that jazz. As far as I know it's still the same principal of only using the usb to charge and not transfer data as well, but I could be wrong on that so don't take my word for it. That's just something I heard about the older Fire.Battery - So far I've gotten a solid days use out of it no matter what I'm doing. Whether I'm watching video or just reading it usually gives me the same charge of roughly a day.All in all I'm really enjoying this product. I've had it for about two weeks now and am really getting into it. Amazon Prime is a nice perk at first, they give you a free 30 day trial with your purchase. I've taken advantage of the free 2 day shipping already, but I'm not sure I'll renew this service. I feel like buying the product should give you more time to use it or at least a discount on purchasing it. Streaming videos and movies has been great though. Compared with the Samsung, I'd say go with whatever fits your needs more. I would have chosen the Samsung if I wasn't JUST looking for an eReader. At first the HD screen and added speaker quality of the Fire were just a plus but now I can see how they'd be a definite selling point. The Samsung is great too because of it's expandable storage and access to anything and everything android. The biggest downside to the Fire is being locked into Amazon's market, which isn't a big enough issue to cause me to down-rate it at all. After all, it is Amazon's product. I hope this helps and if there are any questions please feel free to ask them and I'll try to respond quickly.EDIT : I forgot to mention it doesn't come with a wall charger, they've only included a usb cord. Pretty cheap, but not enough to make me hate the product seeing as I already had a wall to usb port on hand from my smart phone. So don't be surprised when you open the box and it's not there.

As promised it was delivered on October 25!  I was thrilled to get this shiny new toy on the day of release!  I had the previous Kindle Fire and was looking for the extra storage space for content.  The timing was perfect because I am going out of the country at the end of October for a month and looked forward to hours of entertainment from my 32 gigs of storage.  THEN things went bad.  I set it up and things seemed okay.  I downloaded all of my travel docs, many movies, and hours of Amazon prime purchased television.  IT WOULDN'T WORK!  I got continuous error messages that the screen was not responding and it needed to close. About half of my purchased books would not show up.  The internet was dreadfully slow.  It was a mess!  At 7am EST October 26 I called customer service for help.  After 3 phone calls and no real tech-support I said, \"Send me a new one tomorrow.  I'm leaving to go out of the country and this purchase was specifically for my trip\".  She ask me to try re-registering my device (as a last ditch effort).  I did, and as soon as it turned back on the screen froze up - again!Historically Amazon has kick-a*$ customer service so I didn't think this would be a problem.  Boy, was I wrong!  First, they had NO RECORD of my order - which was in my order history (per-ordered September 24).  Despite this, the lady on the phone assured me things would be okay and told me she would request overnight shipping so I would have a new unit on October 27 - given my circumstances of leaving the country.* Let me also add that I'm a prime member that spends WAY TO MUCH on Amazon.com weekly *I will also - in fairness - add that I was frustrated and not the nicest on the phone - I did just spend $250 on a device that wouldn't work!!!So, she said I would receive an email in a few hours about my new device shipment.  At 4:30pm EST, I received an email stating \"We're sorry about your device, we will be shipping out your replacement, estimated delivery is October 30th\"  SERIOUSLY?? 3-day shipping to a prime customer who can't get a BRAND NEW device to work the FIRST DAY it is released AND who is leaving to go out the country for a month?  UNACCEPTABLE!I obviously called and cancelled the new device.  I told customer service I would try one more time to \"de-register\" and re-register the device and hoped that worked but I was more disappointed in the customer service than ever! Let me say, I know this is a strongly negative review; you can check my history as a reviewer and see that normally this is not the case.  This review is intended about 40% for the quality of the new Kindle Fire HD 32G and about 60% for the pitiful customer service!  I am SHOCKED and deeply saddened by this customer service.  I have returned products in the past from Amazon and had outstanding customer service.I plan to work with the device tonight and hope that it works.  If not, I'm sad to say I'm done!  I'm the owner of an Ipad 3 and if my final efforts can't get the new HD Fire to work, it will be returned and I will be the owner of a new Ipad mini.To the Amazon CEO and BOD - you are potentially losing a very loyal customer that spends thousands on your website every year!  Shame on you!!

Here's my e-reader experience so far:1.  Why did I purchase Kindle Fire HD in the first place?There are numerous e-readers out there to choose from. The ipad is supposed to be the best of the lot.  It sells for $600/$700/$800 or more, and is basically a mini personal computer that you can carry around with you.  Way too expensive for me, especially when all I really want to do is read books.The rest of the e-readers sell for anywhere from $50-$400.  The ones sold by Amazon (Kindle) and Barnes and Noble (Nook) are touted to be the best tablets for reading books because they are designed around the huge libraries of e-books that are available for download from those companies.  I suspect that Nook and all the others are very good products (judging from all the good reviews that I have read on them), but I chose Kindle because I'm already an Amazon.com customer, having ordered numerous items from them in the past.  Their prices are about as cheap as anyone around and they seem to stand behind what they sell....and they also deliver relatively fast.My first choice was Kindle Paperwhite.  Fairly inexpensive and it seemed to have all the features that I was looking for in good e-book reader.  When I told my wife about it, she asked if we'd be able to use it to listen to audio books during our drive to Florida this winter. Audiobooks are available for e-readers, but Paperwhite is not set up for them. So, from there I went looking for an e-reader with speakers.I settled on Kindle Fire HD because it's still relatively cheap (but more expensive than Paperwhite) and it's supposed to have the best tablet speakers around.  I ended up with Kindle Fire HD 7\" (16GB).  I bought it from Amazon.com and paid $214 for it (without special offers).2.  With Special Offers or Without Special Offers:\"Special Offers\" is a way to get your Kindle product a little cheaper, but there are advertisements that are imbedded in the software when you purchase it.  Evidently, you can't get rid of these ads and they show-up on your reader somewhere.  There are a lot of complaints about them in some of the other reviews. Personally, I paid the extra $20 and had mine configured \"Without Special Offers\", so I don't get the ads and really can't say anything about them, one way or another.3.  Kindle Fire Leather Case:I ordered the leather case that is designed for Kindle Fire HD 7\" ($45).  I figured that, sooner or later I am going to drop this thing...so I need a case.It fits like a glove, looks good and seems like it would absorb the shock if I dropped the device.  It does not interfere with the speaker sound or any of the Kindle's control buttons.There's a couple of other benefits to the leather case:The on/off button for this device is a little indent switch that is located on one edge of the Kindle.  It's one of those switches that you need to use your fingernail to operate.  It's not that easy to find and it's close to the speaker volume controls, so it's easy to get the buttons mixed up.  The leather case solves that problem.  It automatically turns the kindle on whenever you open the case (and the Kindle goes right back to the last book and page that you had been previously reading).  This is a great feature.  When you're done reading, just close the case and the Kindle automatically turns off.When I was checking out e-readers, in all the photos and videos of people using these devices, they all looked awkward.....like they weren't comfortable to hold...like your thumb and finger would get tired holding them by the edge.  The leather case solves that problem too.  When you open the flap, it's just like opening a book...so you hold the device just like you would a book.  It's very `comfortable'.3.  The PowerFast charging device:This is another accessory that I ordered with my Kindle.  The Kindle itself comes with a charging cord.  One end connects to the Kindle and the other end connects to a usb port on your computer.  This is supposed to give you a `slow' charge.  I've never charged my device that way, so I don't know the charge time.The PowerFast charger ($10) is a little `electric plug looking' device.  Plug your Kindle charging cord into your Kindle, plug the usb end of the cord into the PowerFast and then plug the PowerFast into an electrical outlet.  It charges the Kindle very fast.  I used my Kindle all day, plugged it into the charger and it recharged in less than an hour.4.  Setting-up the Kindle Fire HD:This device is very easy to set-up after delivery.First of all, you need to have access to wifi, which is some sort of wireless internet.  Don't ask me how it works....it's FM to me (f-ing magic).  I recently had high speed internet installed by my phone company and (going out the door) the tech told me that my new high speed modem was wifi enabled.  If the modem is turned on, wifi service is available throughout the house.  OK, if you say so......Out of the box, the easy to follow Kindle instructions tell you to fully charge your device (mine already was) and then go through a short series of steps to get you operational.  Things like naming your device and so on.  One of the steps has you check for wifi availability, and when I did, my phone company wifi came right up for me to select.  From there it sent me (via the wifi) to Amazon.com to sync my Kindle Fire HD to my Amazon.com page.  Once that was done, the set up was complete and I was ready to go.5.  Ordering and downloading books from Amazon.com:When you turn on a Kindle Fire HD, a series of icons appear across the face of the device.  The first icon is \"shop\".  Tap on it and you go directly to your Amazon.com page.  From there you can search for books through the Amazon search engine or select your wish lists and download books that you've previously placed there using your computer.Once you find a book you want to download, select it and the Kindle version (and price) will be displayed on your Kindle Fire HD.  Tap on \"buy now\" and you get the option to purchase the book right away or just download a free sample (a chapter or two) of the book to make sure you're going to like it before buying it.  This is a great feature of Amazon e-books.  I suspect that Barnes and Noble has the same feature. Anyway, once you decide that you want to buy the book, tap \"purchase\" and your book will be downloaded to your kindle in less than a minute and your credit card will be charged for the purchase.  If you make a mistake during the purchase procedure, you have the option to cancel your purchase if you desire.One final thing on downloading books:  you don't have to purchase books exclusively from Amazon.  You can get your e-books from a host of different on-line venders.  But, like I said, Amazon is very easy to deal with and they have a huge selection of books.  I doubt if I'll ever need to go somewhere else.6.  Setting up Kindle for reading a book:All of the e-readers that I reviewed stated that their product's reading parameters were easy to adjust (letter size, font and backlighting).  Kindle Fire HD's adjustments are definitely easy. They are available from a drop-down menu on the Kindle's `desktop'.  Just tap on the menu, then tap on the function that you want to adjust...and adjust it.  Very simple.7.  The Kindle Fire HD reading experience:Man, I really like this thing.  It has renewed my love of reading books.Once you get your reading parameters adjusted, tap on a downloaded book from the Kindle's desktop and the book comes right up.  You can turn pages by tapping or by swiping your finger.  There are functions available for bookmarking and for highlighting specific parts of a page.Don't be concerned about eye fatigue.  I have 65 year old eyes and have to use reading glasses.  I have read for hours and hours and have never had headaches or any kind of eye strain.I enjoy reading at night in bed most of all.  Turn off all the lights and it's pitch black (except for you and the Kindle).  I usually fall asleep reading, holding the Kindle on my chest.  The Kindle saves the page and turns itself off during inactivity, so it's not a problem.8.  Memory storage space:I asked a clerk at an electronics store (who actually owned a Kindle Paperwhite) how many books you could store on one of these devices.  He said over 1000 with his 2 GB Paperwhite.  The Kindle Fire HD come with 16 GB or 32 GB, so there's plenty of storage.The clerk said that books don't take up much memory at all.  What eats the memory is music and video downloads.9.  Cloud storage:Cloud storage is another one of those FM things.  You're allotted a certain amount of free storage space (outside your Kindle in cyberspace somewhere).  I believe that if you store a lot of high memory stuff there, you will reach your limit and get charged a fee.Every time you purchase a download from Amazon, a copy goes to the Kindle and a duplicate copy goes to Cloud.  If you delete your Kindle copy after you're done with it, the copy in Cloud storage remains.  This is a good feature, especially if you lose or damage your Kindle.  Just purchase a new Kindle and download your stuff from Cloud.  Nothing gets lost.They say that Cloud is good for storing high memory stuff (like music and videos) to free-up space on your Kindle.  There's even supposed to be an app that you can buy that makes it possible to copy your itunes music library to your Kindle (via Cloud).  Haven't tried any of these things (yet).10.  The Kindle Fire HD \"desktop\" icons:There is a row of icons across the desktop of the Kindle (books, apps, music, videos, audiobooks, games) that you can select by tapping.  Select one of them and you get a list of everything (in that category) that you have stored on your Kindle. You can also select Cloud for that category and see what's stored there.11.  APPSThere are numerous downloadable apps that are compatible with Kindle Fire HD. I bought an e-book that listed the most popular 150 of them.  They deal with a host of interesting topics.  So far, the only ones that I have purchased (cheap) are a battery meter and a volume controller.  Both of them downloaded seamlessly and work as advertised.12.  Problem Areas:I couldn't get the audiobook page to come up on the Kindle.  I tapped and tapped on the icon, but all I could get was a grey blank page.  Finally I called the Kindle help number from the Amazon web page and got a live technician in about a minute.  He walked me through the problem and it was fixed in about 30 seconds (had to reset something in the Kindle's settings).Another time I ordered an audiobook from Amazon using my computer.  The book was supposed to be sent directly to the Kindle, but it never showed up.  Again I called the tech and the problem was quickly fixed.  You have to tap on the Kindle's sync icon in order to download stuff ordered from your computer.  I tapped on sync and the audiobook immediately started downloading.Bottom line:  if you run into trouble with anything, you can quickly contact a live technician to resolve your problem.13.  Audiobooks:My wife and I tried to listen to an audiobook in our car but it wasn't the  good experience that we had hoped for.  Kindle Fire HD's speakers are excellent in the quiet of your home,  but there's not enough to them....to overcome road noise when driving (unless you have a super quiet car).  So, for road trips we're going back to audio cds.Like I said, the speakers are great for audiobooks at home or on the patio (or whatever).  Amazon offers an audiobook feature (at additional expense) that allows you to read your e-book while it's being read to you.  You kinda follow along with the audiobook.  My wife said `that's stupid .... either you read the book or you listen to it'.  I tried it anyway, and it turned out to be a pretty neat feature after all.  Really enhances the reading experience.  It's something you have to try for yourself to understand.14.  Bottom Line:If I lost (or broke) my Kindle Fire HD, would I replace it?  Answer: YES (immediately).  Like I said earlier, I really love this device.  I used to read a book every now and then.  Now, I'm reading every chance I get.  And I'm taking the Kindle with me, everyplace I go (so I probably WILL lose it...lol).I give 5 \u00bd  stars to the e-reading experience (in general) and 5 \u00bd stars to Kindle Fire HD for taking me there.Hope this long winded review helps some other `e-novice' make up their mind about  Kindle Fire HD.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Plug?", "Author": "Peter Bradley", "ReviewID": "RA76VSIQ03QIJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I like this product and using it with Amazon Prime.However there are a few fatal flaws that should be shared upfront:1.

With a smartphone, a laptop, a desktop, and big-screen TV that can stream YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, I questioned whether the gap between iPhone and laptop really needed to be filled. That was until a tabletop miniature game I play (Warmachine & Hordes) announced an app that would make the game mechanics more efficient, so that piqued my interest a bit. I started researching the Kindle and, unexpectedly, I found myself really wanting the 7-inch tablet.I am the luckiest guy around -- my wife got this for me for my birthday. And I am so glad she did, as this is an absolutely awesome entertainment device. After using it for a long weekend, I've come to one conclusion: the Kindle HD isn't perfect for everyone, but it's absolutely perfect for me.SCREEN: The HD display is incredible. The screen is sharp, bright, saturated and beautiful. Glare is definitely at a minimum, and I've been able to enjoy it in reasonably bright rooms. The touch-screen is fairly responsive, and it's made gaming (Temple Run, Angry Birds, etc) even more fun than on a smartphone.INTERFACE: At first glance, the OS will seem minimalist at best and completely lacking at worst. There's no desktop to speak of. No folders, no menus, no icons (aside from the \"carousel,\" which is basically a list of recently opened media). There's a toolbar at the top that will point you toward your books, music, movies, etc. But that's it. This was a little jarring to me at first. I'm used to a traditional operating system. But I soon realized that this interface makes sense. The Kindle is all about delivering and consuming media content. And, as such, the Kindle's OS is designed to do one thing and one thing only -- direct the user to the Amazon marketplace. And I'm OK with that.I know some people have complained that the Kindle is constantly trying to sell you something. But I don't get the problem. This was never designed to be an all-comers workhorse device. You're not going to use the Fire HD to tap out a report or prepare a PowerPoint. You're not going to do intensive video editing or debug a website. That's why, after all, we have our laptops and desktops, right? The Kindle HD is designed for entertainment. And Amazon has the best selection of movies, TV, books, magazines, music, games, etc. If I was using an iPad, I'd probably always point it toward the Amazon store, anyway, so this just cuts out the middleman. I haven't found myself lamenting the lack of X or Y or Z. I love what the Kindle comes with, and, more importantly, I love with what the Kindle DOESN'T come with. Again, this is an entertainment device. I have no plans to sync my work contacts with my Kindle. I will never set up my work e-mail on my Kindle. I will never create a presentation on my Kindle. This tablet is for fun, and that's it.SPEAKERS: I did not expect this. The speakers are way better than they have any right to be on a $200 tablet. They drive well through my nice headphones, too. The screen is awesome, so watching content is great. But these speakers make listening to content great, too. It's too big to replace an iPod, but it's really not meant to.STORAGE: I got the 16GB version, and that will be plenty for me. I don't plan to store HD movies on my device, as the Amazon Cloud, iTunes Cloud, Netflix Cloud, Whatever Cloud is all I need. If you do a lot of traveling (and perhaps would like to store a movie on the device for plane rides and stuff like that), a bigger hard drive might make sense. But, in 2012, we're all very rarely outside of WiFi access. Whether it's at home or Starbucks or work or wherever, you're going to be able to stream things most of the time. And, if not, you can still fit a few HD movies on here, or tons and tons and tons of books that will certainly tide you over until you're back to a WiFi area.BATTERY: Much better battery life than I expected. Amazon said, I believe, 11 hours of video, web, reading, etc. I was initially skeptical, but I think they're pretty much right on the money with that. When my Kindle arrived, it was maybe 1/3 charged. I still managed to get about 3-4 hours of use in before I had to charge it. That's amazing.Please note, the Kindle doesn't come with an outlet adapter (just the USB cable). However, there are a million adapters out there that will turn a USB cable into a wall charger. You can use the outlet portion of an old Kindle charger, or perhaps your cell phone charger will fit. My Samsung Galaxy SIII wall charger works great. If you don't have an outlet adapter, you can still charge it through a computer. It's a little slower, but it still works.SPEED: Here's my first qualm. Some apps are a little sluggish. I've found Netflix isn't as responsive as my phone, for example. Sometimes it takes 3-5 seconds for an app to open. It's annoying, but it's truly a 2012/ADD/impatient/technogluttony annoyance. I have to remind myself that waiting, literally, 5 seconds for Netflix to load -- where I have access to thousands upon thousands of movies and TV shows that will stream immediately -- is really petty, and any frustration is a bit narcissistic. Honestly, my time isn't so valuable that I can't wait a couple seconds for an app to load. I can be patient, sit back and wait a few seconds for a world of media to be delivered to my fingertips.PRIME: I believe Jeff Bezos described Amazon Prime as the greatest deal in the history of shopping. I have to say, he's right. My free month of Prime will soon turn into a full year of Prime, and it'll be the best $79 I spend in the next 12 months. In addition to free 2-day shipping, access to Amazon Prime's streaming videos is a steal at that price. However, I don't think it's as comprehensive or broad as Netflix's library, though it's still decent (and growing). In all honesty, neither Prime nor Netflix have nearly enough content to satisfy the vast majority of customers, but I trust it's only going to get better from here. But that free 2-day shipping ... now that's awesome.WIRELESS: It's fast. Really fast. I streamed HD movies and TV shows all weekend and didn't need any buffering. I know there are two antennae on the Fire, and I don't know all the technology behind it. But, whatever they did worked. I was streaming better on my Kindle than I usually do on my laptop. So I'm happy.READING: I have my first-gen Kindle for reading, and I love it. The e-ink cannot hold a candle to the LCD screen in (and on) my eyes. I like to read for long stretches, and the e-ink is just so much gentler. I'll keep my e-ink for books, but magazines and (finally!!) graphic novels/comic books are where the Fire HD wins out. I am extremely excited for the graphic novel selection to grow, though it does have a fair share of favorites (Watchmen, Batman: Year One, The Dark Knight Returns, etc). As an added bonus, I'll be doing the environment a favor by switching magazine subscriptions to a digital delivery. It seems some magazines (though not all) will be a good deal cheaper on the Fire than through the mail. Again, an added bonus.A FEW OTHER THINGS: My last few notes are really minor quibbles. The volume and power buttons are kind of hard to find just by touch --  raised buttons that aren't so flush with the body might make things easier. The Fire is a little bit heavier than I expected, though it's not uncomfortably heavy. The app store is limited compared to the Android and Apple marketplaces, but I know everything on there will work properly on the Fire. I guess Amazon doesn't support Flash anymore, so add this to the list of basically every major portable device (iPhone, iPad, Android 4.1 and later phones) that can't utilize Flash.In the end, I love my Fire. If you're looking for a media-delivery device, I have to recommend this tablet. I didn't realize it, but there is a gap that needs filling between the phone and the laptop. And a 7-inch Amazon tablet fills that void perfectly.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Take if from an Apple fan, the KINDLE FIRE HD ROCKS!", "Author": "MM \"Multimedia Minded\"", "ReviewID": "R3J5SUN8TZHRZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a long-time Apple fan and former employee, I must tell you that I was pleasantly surprised by how sophisticated the KINDLE Fire HD is in terms of intuitive features and SUPERIOR WEB BROWSING AND VIDEO LOADING!  -- SILK is definitely SMOOTH, my friends.Since I purchased the KINDLE to keep up with constantly evolving multimedia techniques, I was initially disappointed to learn that Silk does not support FLASH (in these newer units at least). - But not to worry, there's an app for that!Being a creative writer and researcher as well, I have to say how impressed I am with Silk's user interface and organizational system. Frankly it blows Safari away. Now it may take a minute to get used to, since it is so unique, but once you do you will be amazed by the efficiency of its set up.  And you'll wonder why no one thought of it sooner.  Of course, the fact that TubeMate can download YouTube clips at a blazing speed helps tremendously for someone like moi, because it allows me to save videos for future viewing, even when there's no WiFi connection in sight.Oh, and while on the topic of WiFi - OMG!  Take it from someone who doesn't say OMG, it is awesome.By that I mean video streaming is consistently much quicker and much MUCH more stable than any Apple smart product I've every owned. - Including the newly released ones that I've played with.So KUDOS to Amazon, they knocked it out of the park with the KINDLE Fire HD, particularly when you consider the price and crystal clear no glare HD screen resolution.

B.", "ReviewID": "R19J8XPU9MUA1X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I apologize for any typos in this review. My new kindle fire HD does not have a functioning autocorrect feature in the silk browser.  It works in other parts of the device, but not with silk.  I am hoping that this will be fixed with an update.One of the main reasons I upgraded from the regular kindle fire (which I love, love, love) is that this came with a camera.  Does it have any apps to use the camera? Nope. Just Skype. I thought I could use it like a webcam and take some still shots or video, but apparently not.Amazon decided to can the favorites shelf at the bottom of the screen (in portrait mode, even though it is shown in the above product photos) and replace it with ads and other recommended items.  I can call up my favorites by pressing an icon, but what's the point? I might as well search through the carousel.Maybe this isn't a big deal, but I'm very disapointed that the facebook app is gone.  I know I can open it in my browser, but I liked having it accessible at the touch of a button.  They also did away with youtube.The email app is a disappointment, too. On the original fire, my emails were optimized to be viewed on one screen.  Now I have to zoom out and scroll around to read an email.  They also move the delete button and you can't finger swipe to move to the next message. When I use my fire primarily for reading, facebook, and email and Amazon has only nailed one of these features; what am I supposed to think?Another thing: I like to touch the power button to check the time on the lock screen.  Now, it only shows advertisements.  Whatever. I hate the ads. But could they at least put something helpful on that screen like a clock??Also, there is no indicator light to tell me when this is finished charging.  I don't want to leave it plugged in longer than necessary, but I now have to power it on, open the device settings and see if it is done charging.  Fail!My husband was gracious enough to let me take the upgraded kindle fire HD and he has my original fire.  I really,truly hope that Amazon can fix some of the glaring problems with this new model, or I will have to return this and downgrade.Update 9/15:I just spent 45 minutes on the phone with Amazon.  While their customer service representative was very kind and helpful, only one of my problems was resolved.  There is a facebook app in the app store, you just have to scroll WAY down to find it.Autocorrect has been disabled in the silk browser.  This is absolutely ludicrous! The autocorrect feature actually works very well: everywhere except THE INTERNET!If you pay $15 to disable the ads, then you get to see time on your home/locked screen.  Would it be too much trouble to add that on there?  Even for those of us stuck looking at ads?As of right now, they will not be giving us the option to fix the favorites at the bottom of the screen.The customer service rep did say that he would forward my feedback to Amazon.  I hope they take note of these things.  I really want to love this thing as much as/more than my original fire.Update 9/18:The camera actually works with the facebook app. This is a nice bonus but I'm disappointed that Amazon isn't promoting.I am still annoyed to the point of being angry that autocorrect won't work in Silk. I have contacted Amazon for assistance with this matter, but they haven't received enough feedback that this is a problem for others.  Please let them know if this bothers you.I purchased the Poetic hardback case for the Fire HD and the cover powers my device on when I open it and off when I close it.  This makes the button placement less of a problem.Come on, already, Amazon! Start making some changes so I can like this thing!Update 12/7:This week's update finally fixed autocorrect in Silk!I have been given the option to turn off recommendations at the bottom of the screen, but this doesn't bring my favorites up. I still wish I could have them fixed at the bottom.There's.still no clock on the home screen, but I have taken advantage of at least $15 worth of special offers since I bought this, so I consider that a win.Many of my gripes have not been resolved, but I have  gotten used to the way this fire works and I'm less bothered  by it .", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good choice IF you are a part of Amazon's ecosystem", "Author": "Alexi Rain", "ReviewID": "RUEE0DEF16MRY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "About me:I have a Macbook pro running Mac os and win 7A first gen  Xoom tablet which I still sorta love due to the internal and sd card storage space.An Iphone 4.First Gen. NookWhy I chose the Kindle Fire HD:1.  Storage, storage! I wanted a small tablet I could travel with that would keep a big chunk of my movies and books stored, so I wouldn't need to worry about wifi.  This shouldn't be as big of a problem as it is, but between flights and family without wifi, it's turned into an issue for me.2.  Amazon ecosystem.  I buy lots of video from Amazon that I stream on a rokyu.  I love that I can download those to keep on my FireHD for offline viewing when I travel.  I love how easy it is to access my wishlist and to buy books and videos.  I love that I can easily stream Prime videos. The automatic cloud storage and streaming of Amazon content is a nice extra, too.3.  Books.  I have a Prime Membership, and all those free books listed with Prime were taunting me.  There's no getting them unless they're downloaded with an actual Kindle.  There is also a lending program which is a nice bonus.4.  The new whispersync.  I'm an Audible addict, and I thought that was a pretty cool concept.  I haven't tried it out yet, but hey, it's there and waiting for me.5.  It has all the necessary video apps/abilities:  Hulu, Netflix, HBOgo, and of course, Amazon.So far I'm glad I got the FireHD.  It turns out that Amazon Instant Videos take up less space than I'd anticipated.  So far, I've been able to fit 57 episodes of various TV shows, one movie, and 8 books onto 14 gigs of storage.  Not bad at all.What IS bad is that the video portion of my downloads can't be backed up.  There doesn't seem to be a way to access where they're stored on the Kindle so that I can move them onto my storage drive. This means that I'll have to delete, download other videos, delete, and redownload if I want to switch my stored videos around. This is wasting my bandwidth and time and was almost a deal breaker.There is a bit of lag online, but nothing too annoying.  Websites come up quickly, and the wifi is quick and stable during downloads.I'm  sick to bloody death of the Ad.  Not ads, *AD*.  I honestly wouldn't mind seeing deals and bargains when I come out of sleep mode,  but for the love of commerce, show me something besides that bleepin' Discover ad!The screen is very nice, but not as beautiful as people are saying.  Or maybe I was just expecting too much.  Detail in dark scenes can be difficult to see, and the glare is pretty awful, though better than on my Xoom.The battery life is horrifically bad.  Seriously.  In the last 20 minutes, 5% has been sucked away just sitting and having the device storage space checked.  One hour of video uses about 30%. Using pretty much any function will kill it fast.  However, the battery doesn't drain if left alone over night.So, to sum it up, if you are part of Amazon's ecosystem, I see the FireHD as the best choice available. It's a nice little tablet with decent storage and good video capability.  However, if I wasn't a Prime member and if I didn't purchase Amazon's instant videos, I would choose something else.**Update 11-6-12**After using the Kindle Fire HD for awhile, I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. The things I love about it have remained great, but some problems have come up.1.  Odor.  When the device heats up, there is a strong outgassing odor.  This is a separate issue from Amazon's \"leather\" case, which I had to remove due to fumes. The device is much, much worse than my Xoom and its case ever were.  I'm wondering if it's a byproduct of the antiglare lamination on the screen?  Granted, I'm sensitive to odors, but many people are, and this is something to consider.  13 days of use, and the smell is still very bad.2.  Silk browser.  I finally see what people are complaining about on the lag.  Some websites are fine, but some aren't.  It seems to depend on the types of ads used on the site.  For instance, the Dead Island wiki is completely unbrowsable on Silk.  I went over to XDA Developers and got Dolphin and Flash links that work wonderfully on the Kindle Fire HD. There is still a bit of lag on heavily monetized sites, but they can definitely be browsed without too much trouble.  However, I shouldn't have to waste my time hunting down a link to make my device work online. Amazon should give us a browser that works and/or provide Dolphin for download in their app store.  They have chosen to do neither.3. Device lag. Occasionally the device will freeze up for a second or two when browsing libraries, favorites, apps, etc.4.  The sound stops working after being disconnected from HDMI output to T.V.  Turning it off and on again gets the sound working.  This is a minor annoyance, but it's adding to a growing list.5. Extreme heat.  The Kindle Fire HD gets very hot during video applications.  Since 70% of the reason I bought it was so I could conveniently take my Amazon video library with me, this is a concern.At this point, I'm still glad I purchased the Fire HD, but just barely.  I buy so many instant videos through Amazon that it really is the best option for me.  I just wish the odor, heating, and lag hadn't become such an issue.****Update 12-5-12...Downgraded my review to 3 stars. It should probably be more like 2.5.****I seem to be in a cycle of returns on my Kindle Fire HD.  Mine has the backlight bleed issue which somehow only became obvious when I downloaded the Dark Knight app. The issue was camouflaged partly because Amazon highlights the top edge of the screen and put our kindle info across where the problem usually is.The bleed became glaring when I got my first game app, and it had lots of full screen black.Amazon CS was great as usual, and they sent me a new Kindle.  The new one also has a backlight bleed issue and additionally drops wifi. In testing the new Fire HD, it dropped a streaming movie constantly.  So, I put both units on my lap, and streamed with my old Fire HD with no issues.  I watched the wifi icon on my new device (not streaming it, just watching the wifi connection), and it dropped wifi about 6xs within 5 mins or so. I'll be contacting Amazon for yet another return, but I'm feeling dubious.On another note, Dolphin has proven unstable over time.  I've switched to Opera mobile which is generally more stable but not perfect or my first choice for a browser, if all were working equally well.  The quest to find a reliable browser has become hugely annoying.So.  I hate the glitches. I hate not having a stable browser. I hate the light bleed. I hate the heat.  I hate the odor issue which by now is much better, but still slightly present when the unit heats up.I also hate that I've become so attached to this darn thing. The size, weight, and storage space are awesome.  Still, if I didn't have such an extensive Amazon video library, I would have returned it and good riddance.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Device 5 OS 1", "Author": "Sus", "ReviewID": "R1FKUGVINHTQSE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I couldnt wait to upgrade to the fire HD.

Content: People talk about the App Store not having enough applications - but 99% of the apps you use on your iPad or any other device are actually available in the App store. And I don't think Google (and even Apple) can match the digital content (videos, tv shows) that Amazon has for the price.3. Prime content and Amazon Instant Video: This is a killer feature. Amazon's ecosystem is brillianty supported by this device, and if you are a prime member, there is absolutely no other place you want to look at. The Kindle Fire HD is exactly what you want.4. Speakers: I almost forgot about probably the best feature in this device. The speakers are GREAT. I have a friend with a Nexus 7 and I have also owned an iPad, and trust me, its ridiculous how good these speakers are. I was watching a TV show in HD lying down, and the surround sound was so great, I felt like the sound was coming from different areas in the room.

I was sold from the start.  Since then I have bought several of the first generation as gifts because once you can carry all of your books with you in one small device, a heavy book is a nuisance.

I didn't want to spend the money on an iPad, and really, thought the iPad would be more than I needed. The Kindle Fire HD 7\" seemed the perfect choice for me and I haven't been disappointed.The graphics are beautiful, more than I thought they'd be, and I can't wait to upload photos to it. I've yet to explore all the things my Kindle Fire can do, so I'm excited to see what else I'll discover.The sound quality is also better than I would have imagined, nice and clear and enough volume.It's way faster than I imagined, and in fact, I haven't had any delays or dragging at all. Maybe as I upload things it'll slow up, but for now, it's quite fast.I uploaded my first and only game (I'm not a gamer), Solitaire, and of course it was lighting fast to order and upload -- and the game worked perfectly.As with my former \"regular kindle\" I am able to comfortably read books - I didn't think I'd like the \"glossy\" screen when reading as much as I LOVE the \"regular screen on the regular kindle\" but I still am able to get into the novels/short story collections I read, though, in some ways I still like the \"book look\" of the \"regular kindle;\" yet, still, an enjoyable read.Also with the Kindle Fire HD, I am able to upload my draft novels and read them for edits, but! even better, I was able to listen to my book! The computer voice was obviously a computer voice; however, I was quite surprised at how \"normal\" she sounded, enough that I could listen to my entire novel while taking notes on rough patches and mistakes -- just one more layer of editing for my drafts. I even came to be fond of that voice, laughing! As well, I am going to record myself reading and upload that to my kindle (or maybe I can record right on the Kindle - I'll explore that capability).I like how the KF alerts me when I have a notification.This device will be perfect for traveling, which I do fairly often. I can use Kindle Fire to check email, social networking, play some solitaire, I could watch a movie, read books, and, I can listen or read my novel drafts--so there is no reason to take a computer when I travel, especially by airplane, as I can easily slip my Kindle Fire into my purse or bag and away I go!It was super easy to set up.As an author and a reader, the idea of ebooks was scary at first, but now I can't imagine my reading or my \"author world\" without them! I can upload books in mere seconds onto my Kindle and Kindle Fire, and my own books can be enjoyed by people from just about anywhere! How cool is that? Amazon has saved many an author from oblivion as we try to be noticed in a big ole sea of authors wanting space in bookstores. When I do upload a book, I can retrieve it on either Kindle I own, which is a plus, as well.For the price, I am very pleased and would recommend this product to anyone, and I have.There is one wrinkle I am having and that is with Facebook -- I can't figure out if it's something I'm doing or something with the Kindle Fire, but Facebook doesn't always work properly -- I'll click on an update and it takes me to a completely different screen--the same incorrect screen over and over. The screen will jump to somewhere completely different from where I clicked. So my Facebook experience is a little frustrating - though the graphics are so beautiful, I love looking at photos there. If I figure out it is something I'm doing, I'll report back (I will look at reviews and see if anyone else is having this problem).This is a wonderful little device and a great alternative to someone who does not want to own an iPad, for whatever reason, but still wants the experience of a tablet.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small but awesome", "Author": "Alexander the Weak", "ReviewID": "R35LY4EEB9WCJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this product, it is kind of small but still it is a great tablet that is very versatile.

I won't write a novel because I'm sure you've read enough of those on here already, and to leave you time to read real novels on your Kindle!I bought the 1st generation iPad a few months after it came out, and just sold it in September. It was collecting dust after I got a new laptop. I enjoyed it moderately while we had it, but my husband enjoyed it a lot more. It was really about consumption, which is great, but it came at a heavy price tag of $499.I bought my Kindle Fire HD at my local Best Buy. I've been a long time Amazon user, and would've ordered it online, but I have a problem with \"I want something and I want it now\". So even with Amazon's lightening fast shipping, I couldn't wait.APPS: I was impressed by he amount of apps available, which was one of the things I was afraid of. But all the apps I used on my iPad are available on my Kindle. The apps I use are Kindle (of course), Amazon (duh), Evernote, Spotify, Songza, Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook, HBO Go. So the fact that all of these were available: score!SCREEN: So clear, so crisp, and just the right size! Watching movies on the iPad is great...if you have a stand. Watching movies or TV shows on the Kindle is even better.SOUND: Dolby? Yes! Beautiful, crisp, no distortion, the right amount of volume.AMAZON IN MY HAND: I love the fact that Amazon is right there in my hands. I read a lot so having the store right there is perfect, especially when I can buy with 1 click, and borrow books. Getting the Kindle Fire HD also encouraged me to get an Audible account. I use WhisperSync and read along while listening to the audio book. Love it! (Forgot to mention I had the Kindle Keyboard, but my mom loved it so much, she sort of, took it, which is why I was looking at the Fire HD in the first place).BATTERY LIFE: :( Disappointed! Coming from the iPad and the Kindle Keyboard, I'm disappointed that I have to charge my Kindle basically every night. Standby = dead battery at work when you want to listen to an audio book. Amazon says it lasts 11 hours. No way no how. I read somewhere else between 7-9 hours. That's a better average. Wish it lasted longer, ESPECIALLY since you can't simultaneously charge and do things on your Kindle. That's where I docked the star.I also hate that it just came with a USB cord, and needs it's own \"special charger\" if you want to plug it in to the wall. Plugging it in to your computer = charging for half a day. Seriously. Hate that. So I grabbed one of my old Android charger bases and plug the USB cord in there to charge. It gets the job done, but again, hate that you can't simultaneously charge & read.WEB: The web experience rocks for a tablet, and is pretty similar to iPad browsing (at least to me).GAMES: Don't play them so I'm no help in the arena.MOVIES/TV SHOWS: See SCREEN.PRICE: Lots of bang for your buck. iPad mini for $329? Yeah right. Treat yourself to this baby and you'll love it and won't want to put it down. But you'll have to in order to charge it.Hopefully this was a Cliff Notes version, or at least a novella as opposed to a novel. Treat yourself, or someone else, to it for Christmas!

(I am, by all accounts, a voracious reader, averaging nearly 20,000 pages a year for the past five years.)  In addition to reading, however, I spend a great deal of time watching movies, browsing the web, and playing computer games. Unfortunately,I can't take my ancient and venerable laptop everywhere, and my Kindle Keyboard isn't capable of playing the latest games or fully browsing the web.I discovered that I needed a new electronic companion that would completely meet my growing needs.The solution to my dilemma: my brand new Kindle Fire HD 7\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB (Fire HD7)  tablet/ebook reader. It's about as perfect an electronic companion as I could ask for.  It's an ebook reader, a hi-definition video player, superb web browser, and game player. All with stunningly brilliant 1200-by-800 video resolution, superb Dolby Surround audio, the quickest Wi-fi I have ever seen in any device, and a list of features so long it's impossible to name `em all here...In this review, I'll focus on the three qualities of the Fire HD7 that I find most important: ease of use, ability to meet my high expectations,  and versatility and convenience.EASE OF USE:  Like all devices in the Kindle family, the Fire HD7 of a very convenient size (7.6\" tall x 5.4\" wide x 0.4\" thick) and weight (13.9 ounces). This makes it easy for me to take along nearly everywhere. Also like the Fire HD7's older cousins, this device's design is simple and sleek. The front has a 7\" display screen made with Gorilla glass and a bezel wide enough to allow me to hold the device comfortably without getting my fingers on the display area. The back is made of a black, fingerprint resistant, high-impact plastic that feels good in my the hands. On the back are located a pair of stereo speakers that bring the Fire HD7's Dolby Surround audio to life. Along the top edge are the on/off switch and volume rocker, which do feel a bit too small for comfort.Amazon prides itself on providing its customers with devices that are ready to go right out of the box. My Fire HD7  was no exception. After charging the internal lithium-ion battery for an hour or so, I turned the device on. I was immediately stunned by what I saw: the clearest, sharpest, most vibrant video display I've ever seen in a computer device. (More about that later...)My first test of the Fire HD7 was, of course, reading my ebooks. All 104 of my Kindle ebooks came pre-loaded.  I found reading on my Fire HD7 to be even more simple and straightforward  than reading on my Kindle Keyboard. The Fire HD7 uses touch-screen controls instead of buttons. Touch the right side of the screen to advance a page, and the left side to go back. You can also \"swipe\" left or right with your finger to achieve the same result. You can add a bookmark by touching the upper right corner; bring up the menu of options by touching the center of the screen. It's all designed to make reading as comfortable as... well, reading a book. And it succeeds admirably.Like its older cousins, the Fire HD7 as e-reader isn't limited to just books. You can subscribe to a panoply of magazines and newspapers through the Amazon Appstore and read to your heart's content. Of course, all photos, pictures, and other graphics are displayed in high definition brilliance.MEETING MY HIGH EXPECTATIONS:  Once my Fire HD7 passed that first test (literally, with flying colors!) it was time to see how it would meet my other expectations.Here's how it did:As a Movie player: Through Amazon Prime, I have access to thousands of free streaming movies and TV shows, most of which are streamed to my Fire HD7 in high definition video. I have watched several movies now and have not seen even a single instance of hesitation, stutter, or break in signal. This is due to the Fire HD7's  advanced wi-fi system that uses two antennas and two frequency bands to ensure perfect, glitch-free video and audio streaming.Video Display: The Fire HD7 comes with a true high definition display with a resolution of 1200 x 800 pixels and a pixel density of 216 pixels per inch. This renders all screen graphics clear, crisp, and brilliant. All six fonts of the Kindle ebook reader are as sharp as you'll find in the best \"hard copy\" books. High definition movies and TV shows come alive on screen. And game graphics are vibrant and smooth.Audio: The Fire HD7 uses Dolby Surround audio that's crisp, clear, and provides a nice balance between high, middle, and low frequencies. I was actually surprised by the high quality of the sound emanating from those tiny stereo speakers on the back of my device. I think the audio is one of the Fire HD7's strongest features.VERSATILITY, AND CONVENIENCE: One of my key expectations for my Kindle Fire HD7 is: how capable is it in a wide variety of settings? Can I take it anywhere and do everything I want with it?  So far, my answer is a qualified \"yes.\"Connectivity:  Unlike its older Kindle Keyboard cousin, the Fire HD7 does not come equipped with 3G/4G cellular capability, but relies instead on its dual-band, dual-antenna wi-fi system for connectivity. This means I only have access to the Internet where wi-fi is available. (Fortunately, I have a smartphone that provides my Fire HD7 with a wi-fi \"hot spot,\" which solves this problem.)  As long as I am in a place where I'm able to connect through wi-fi, I can take full advantage of every feature, including live video streaming, browsing the web, and synchronizing books, newspapers, and magazines through Amazon Whispernet/Whispersynch.Kindle Accessories, battery life: My Fire HD7 shipped in a pretty \"bare-bones\" configuration : only a mini-USB cable is provided with the device. All other accessories - cases, chargers, screen protectors, and the like - must be purchased separately. These are all available from Amazon, as well as a large number of independent merchants. Cases and covers come in a variety of colors and sizes; with or without built-in lights; and can be reasonably inexpensive or downright costly. I purchased a good solid leather cover that provides plenty of protection for my Fire HD7.Battery life for the Fire HD7 is nearly as good as advertised. With wi-fi turned on, and with me reading an average of 2 - 3 hours per day, I can make a full battery charge last for about 2 - 3 days.MY VERDICT: Over the past few weeks, I have become a constant and enthusiastic user of my new Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablet/ebook reader. So far, this excellent device has met or surpassed all my high expectations. Because my Kindle Fire HD is so versatile and easy to use, I find that I can not only read more often and faster, I can aso watch movies, play games, and browse the web nearly anywhere I want. In short: my Kindle Fire HD 7 is my nearly perfect companion, anytime and anywhere!", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Such an amazing 7\" tablet, no complaints at all...", "Author": "John Murphy", "ReviewID": "R1W5YNFJRNH1K0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got my KFHD a few days ago and have not been able to put it down.  I knew going in that Google apps were not available, and honestly I don't think it is big deal to me at all. Being a wi-fi device, I dont need turn by turn direction...and already having an Android phone...i have google apps where it is actually relevant to myself and my needs.  As a Amazon Prime member since its beginning, I am a huge fan of Amazon as a whole and I again think they have delivered a great piece of hardware for the cost.  I still have not paid to remove the ads on my KFHD, because they don't bother me 1 bit, only see them on at the lock screen, so I see them for maybe 2 seconds..if this bothers you, pay $15.00 and be done with them.  Anyone who has complained about this...I either feel you do not have a KFHD and just go off what others like to complain about...or you just like to complain..period.I got this tablet to basically be something i can carry easily around the house or to a friends house and check FB, Twitter, Fantasy football, shop Amazon, browse the web...play a few games, maybe read a book or two, and I just love everything this device delivers.  Alot of people complain bout not being able to get certain apps, or have to pay for them...do a google search for how to add certain apps (w/o rooting) and you will be amazed at what you can find, and accomplish with a little effort...which by the way..once you get it to work, you feel like you accomplished something.(At least i did/do)  With minimal effort, I have side-loaded Instagram (not the Instafire HD from appstore, the actual Instagram), Dropbox, Angry birds Star Wars (w/o paying for the 2.99 HD version)..an app to access the front camera (if that is something you want)..added Dolphin as my main web browser..etc...minus Google Apps, there really isn't any app i am upset I cant get on my KFHD, or expected I could and now am disappointed when i couldnt.  There are many apps/sites where you can download .APK's and install them, just do a bit or searching and you will be happy you did.  Before I actually bought my KFHD, i had thought i would root it right away as I did with my phone..but i really don't see the need to do so, and probably wont do it.I knew what i wanted in a tablet going in...I basically looked at the Nexus 7, the Nook and the KFHD...besides being a Prime member already, and loving what people have said about the KFHD..Amazon being a great company is probably what was the final thing to really not even make me go with anything else.  In 7+years of shopping almost entirely from Amazon...I have had 1 shipping issue (which was the carriers fault) and even then Amazon sent me a replacement that same night, no questions asked.  It is great to still have a company that appreciates their customers and provide great products, prices and service.Again, couldn't be happier with my KFHD..and for all the comparisons about how its not an iPad...I consider this...how many people own an iPad and use it to go on Facebook, pintrest, Twitter and play angry birds? In that case, it can do what most people use an iPad for, but for a 3rd the cost...tablets are not laptop/PC replacements IMO and should not be looked at being so...with the exception of some people doing \"serious\" gaming on an iPad (GTA 3, a few other graphically intense games), i feel most people don't ever fully utilize all a tablet can offer..same with laptops...people do email, browse social sites..do some online shopping, play some games to pass the time...the KFHD does all this, and more for less cost.  Thanks Amazon for a great product!", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice . . . Couple of Minor Complaints", "Author": "bantcher", "ReviewID": "RU5XBDOP0SMMM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first and only Kindle Fire HD I've purchased so far, after having bought 4 Kindle Fires before (one for me, one for my wife, one for a daughter, and one for my mother.  I've now given my Kindle Fire to another daughter.)  I've had the KFHD now for 2 weeks and love the device.  I use it mostly for reading, and some for buying products through Amazon, surfing the web and using some apps and games.  Overall, this is a great product for the price.  Looks great and handles great.  I like the external volume button and the camera.  The ads on the lock screen don't bother me at all.  The \"others bought\" carousel bothered me at first, but now I mostly ignore it, and I've actually used it a couple of times.  My complaints are fairly minor and are, in part, based on my experience with the regular Kindle Fire, which I never reviewed but I would have given 5 stars.  Before I go on to the minor complaints about the KFHD, one other feature of the KFHD I really like is the micro HDMI out port.  We use it to put things up on our big TV for the whole family to enjoy, including pictures, blogs and the Bible (through an app) that is then read to us by a distinguished sounding British reader.  Very fun and cool way to \"read\" scriptures together as a family.  (Btw, I bought a 15 ft. micro HDMI to HDMI cable through Amazon that I use to get stuff on the screen -- wanted it long so I could do this from my easy chair.)Minor complaints:  there was (and is) a college football scoreboard app that I used and really liked on my Kindle Fire that is not available for the KFHD.  I know there are other similar apps -- I'm using one but I don't like it as much.  It is frustrating because when I pull up on Amazon.com the app I used and liked on my Kindle Fire it shows that it is available for the KFs on my account but not the KFHD.  Same is true of an accuweather app I used on the KF but can't get on the KFHD. I'm using the weatherchannel app now on the KFHD, which is fine, but I was used to and liked accuweather better.  I assume these things will work themselves out over time as apps are modified or new ones created to run on the KFHD.  But I wonder why what I assume is a somewhat more advanced device can't be made to run the older apps that run on the \"less advanced\" device -- retro compatibility.Not having flash was a real disappointment, but I understand Adobe is not supporting it now for these androids.  I'm using the Dolphin browser as the solution for this problem, as others in their comments have said they are doing, but it was a bit of a hassle to get that loaded and I wonder why Amazon doesn't maybe ship the KFHDs with instructions -- or somehow more clearly provide instructions -- on how to download the Dolphin browser (and maybe other workaround browsers?) to be able to use flash.  Probably a legal restriction of some kind or a desire not to promote some other company with which Amazon doesn't have a relationship. Understandable, but doesn't help the customer experience much.Amazon's \"acting\" like the camera is only usable for Skype is also a little disappointing.  By that I don't mean they're doing anything to keep people from realizing there are apps that permit the camera to be used as a regular camera -- that would be impossible -- but, again, I wish they'd more actively let people know the camera can be used for more than just Skype-ing.  Again, I'm sure there are good reasons for that.  I haven't even used the camera to Skype yet, but have used it to take pictures and post pics on Instagram.Overall, very pleased with the KFHD and looking forward to more apps, including updates of older apps, to run on this very nice, enjoyable and affordable device.  If you haven't owned a Kindle Fire before and are thinking of getting the KFHD, do not hesitate -- it is well worth the $200.  If you have a KF already and are wondering about getting the KFHD, I'd say do it, but be aware that you may need to adjust expectations a little and do some workarounds to get some of the same features/apps you enjoy on the KF -- flash being the single biggest one in my opinion.9/29 Update:  there's now an accuweather app for the HD, and the yahoo sportacular app has the same type of college football score board I was missing from the regular fire. Other thing I still miss from the regular fire is the charging/charged light in the power button. I'm using a battery app, and I know the light wasn't exact, but I still miss it.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste your money", "Author": "Craig", "ReviewID": "R29TXDEJ3YQHF6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you want a tabet that let's you look at ads and shop Amazon then this might be for you.

At $700 new (less than three years ago), it was the top of the line 64 GB 3G when it came out.  Over the few years I've had it, it's become frustratingly unresponsive and excruciatingly slow.  Apps crashed constantly and it lacked flash, which made surfing the web a hit or miss ordeal.  I wanted to replace it, but I couldn't see shelling out $700 for a new iPad, and a repeat performance of significant performance degradation over time.  Plus I wanted something smaller, lighter, and leaner.  I'd found I mostly use my tablet for browsing the internet and for reading, with occasional other media use.  It's primarily an entertainment device.I researched numerous tablets, and it came down to the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fire HD as the most suitable options.  I went to the local Best Buy to get some hands on.  They had the Kindle Fire HD, but not the Nexus 7, and I was seriously impressed with the Kindle's features and performance.  The value is incredible and I came away with a product to beat.The reviews I'd read actually favored the Nexus 7, which was supposed to have a more powerful processor and a better app store, among other things.  However, on Amazon, the user reviews were not as glowing.  To test drive the Nexus 7, I had to go to Sam's Club where they had one on display.  I had high expectations, but found the Nexus 7 less impressive than the Kindle.  The Nexus 7 was actually a bit jerky and less responsive, despite the better processor, especially when browsing the web.  After a few minutes of lackluster interaction, I'd made my decision.  I ordered the 32 GB Kindle HD from Amazon that night.Two days later, I received my new Kindle Fire HD.  Man, am I happy with this decision!  This device is fantastic, and a HUGE improvement over my POS iPad.  And I spent one-third the money I would have paid for a replacement iPad and half the amount I would have paid for the new iPad mini, which I also checked out at the local Apple store prior to purchasing the Kindle.  Love the features and performance.  Love the browser; demolishes Safari.  Love the app store; I was able to find and replace nearly every app I had on my iPad that I cared about.  Love the cloud and superb integration with Amazon's ecosystem.  Love the vibrant HD screen.  Love the reader.

I have Cox cable internet and pay extra for faster service.  My wife's Kindle clocked in at around 10-15 mb/sec, depending on the location in the house.  My Kindle HD was around 20-25 mb/sec.

So Flixster needs to update their app so it will stream HD video to the Kindle Fire HD.Update 10/2/2012:The whispersync for voice works great! You can be reading an ebook, leave off on a new page, pick it up on the audiobook where you left off, then go back into the ebook and pick up where you left off on the audiobook. You can even listen to the audiobook and read along with the ebook, as the audiobook reads, it will highlight the words in the ebook! (This is great for children by the way.) FYI, not all ebook and audiobooks are whispersync voice ready yet.Also the new KindleFire HD has text to speech.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Pros and Cons ... but definitely a keeper", "Author": "eBookreader", "ReviewID": "R202PEBXQ15AVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first Kindle Fire was among the first shipped, and I ordered the KF HD the day it was released. My initial reaction when the HD arrived was disappointment. But after spending several days complaining to my wife about all that was wrong with the new KF HD, I began to discover things about it that made me very happy I hadn't sent it back. So here is my essential list of the Pros and Cons:Cons:1. No external indicator of when the unit is fully charged (so I downloaded a free app to monitor the status of the battery).2. The on/off switch is hard to locate by touch (so I ordered the $44 case that is seen in all the ads -- it turns the unit on when I open the cover and turns it off when I close it...very well designed and highly recommended).3. I didn't like the fact that my favorites were removed from the home page (but I came to appreciate the fact that I can now access my favorites from any location without returning to the home page).4. I didn't like the ads for suggested purchases (keyed to the first item in my carousel on the home page--the item most recently accessed), but I have found several suggestions to be of interest (although some have been inappropriate).5. It takes much longer to charge than the old KF.6. Times Roman, one of my favorite fonts, is no longer available in the book reader.7. The camera only faces the user so its only practical use is with Skype (but, at least it has one--and it has a mic, which has other uses).8. Finally, they took what I considered to be a very elegant virtual keyboard and dumbed it down to something reminiscent of one of my earlier cell phones (but this is only an esthetical flaw, as I see it, and I may be all alone in my opinion).Pros:1. All my books (including the Oxford Dictionary and my foreign language dictionaries) can now be indexed the first time I do a search, so future searches are almost instant. This means I can now search my reference books -- which I COULD NOT DO on the old KF (well, I could, but it would take forever and was simply not practical). This is of particular use for me since I use my Kindle largely for academic work.2. It appears that the logic for the search engine on the new KF HD has greatly improved: For the first time, of which I am aware, Kindle e-Books can be searched using the \"*\" wildcard character. For example \"revi*\" will find \"revisit\" or \"revitalize\" or \"review\" or any other word in the book that starts with those four letters. But the letters \"revi\" will not find anything, unless such a four-letter combination exists as a separate word or acronym. This provides a greater level of precision when searching a reference book, for example.3. I can use an inexpensive HDMI cable to connect my KF HD to my HD TV and read my books, surf the Net, or watch Amazon Prime movies for free while I am on my treadmill! This was the feature that convinced me to order the KF HD (since I spend an hour per day on the treadmill) and it works as advertised.4. Games are now separated from other apps by a Games tab and an Apps tab (this would be of more value to me if I hadn't given my old KF to my 9 year-old daughter who liked to download free games to play whenever I wasn't using the KF).5. It is lighter weight than the original KF.6. I can now have my Kindle e-books read to me (something my Kindle DX would also do). Since this feature turns the page for me (and I can set the rate at which the text is read), I can also turn the volume down and have the pages turned for me at the rate I normally read.Although I see fewer Pros than Cons (there are other Pros but not thing of particular interest or use to me), the Pros make this one clearly a keeper.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A step down from the original", "Author": "Mark F. Fisher \"Gatortrapper\"", "ReviewID": "R2PXMYTZCS6Z7N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The new Kindle Fire HD is a step down from the original so I don't recommend it.BACKGROUND: I have two original Fires and have about 1000 hours plus of use on them. I bought the HD and have run it about 60 hours and had a conversation with Amazon about their new system.First, the HD doesn't run Flash based media so a large % of content is not available. The original did support it and I loved it. Electing the \"mobile\" option helps but is not a full solution as the non-functional level went from about 40-50% to 20-25%...Second, the HD has made browsing and moving from one tab to another more difficult in that getting to \"Bookmarks\" has an extra step and you can't go from the existing tab to a bookmark but have to open another tab first.Third, a lot of apps that ran on the original won't run on the HD. Bummer.Fourth, although the keyboard is better on the HD the loss of the spelling correction/suggestion function is a severe downgrade. Yes, I know, it's supposed to have it and it is \"enabled\" as a choice on mine, it just doesn't work.Fifth, the Silk browser doesn't interface with websites as well as the older version. Why? I haven't a clue but I can tell you that the interface with the original was superior. For example, it doesn't let you navigate within the website as swiftly or precisely as the older version so much time is expended on trying to coax it to go where you want and then wait longer for it to load. Indeed I am getting \"timing out\" type problems and situations where the site \"hangs\", something I rarely experienced with the original.A final negative is the loss of the easy, intuitive access to functions. The HD has more icons and buttons and like TV controls and phones more is often not better. When I had a problem and needed to talk to Amazon before I knew with a few key strokes I would hear the phone ring. Now I have to navigate through the whole Amazon website to get to the same spot that was previously on the device. A real downgrade in my view because if it's a gift and you don't have an Amazon account you may have trouble.On the plus side the email app is much better: easier to access and better presentation and setup is easy.So...I'm giving this to my son and retrieving my older Fire.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Improvements at the Cost of Functionality", "Author": "Fanny's Daddy", "ReviewID": "R1LN5RAJI848M5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "On the plus side: the screen is gorgeous; the browser fast; the sound a 100% improvement on the original Fire.The negatives: the ads are horribly intrusive (I own three Kindles with the special offers and haven't unsubscribed from any of them); on the Fire they take over half the screen. And when I unsubscribed from them for the $15 charge, I still found ads on the bottom of the carousel that I was informed I was not able to remove (they are ads disguised as Recommendations Features); the touch screen is very erratic and unresponsive; and the interface has become very clunky and way too 'busy'.As much as I am a fan of Amazon and love the products, I can't help but think this is a big step backwards for them. This is a 'rushed' project if I ever saw one. I hope the 'lit' kindle isn't as disappointing.

I have a Motorola Xoom, the original Fire and an iPad (work related) as tablets. Out of everything I was surprised that for the past year I used the original Fire more than any device I had. I admit that I installed goLauncher on the original as I wasn't a fan of the carousel. This basically made it more of regular android tablet. So I basically fell in love with a 7\" device. More portable and easier to handle. The thing the original Fire lacked that I wanted was a front-camera, microphone and hdmi out. So I was extremely pleased the new HD version had those things.I've had the new HD in my hands for a few hours and here are my initial reactions (some based purely on prior Kindle Fire experience)1) The screen is beautiful.2) Without a doubt the BEST speakers in any phone or tablet I have experienced. Extremely clear and loud sound.3) Finally finally a facebook app (though it may be in the app store for all now). I just stumbled across it in reading the description on amazon's site about facebook integration and it says in addition to the facebook app in the appstore. There are no reviews for it yet, so I can only assume it is new.4) Love the magazine double-click to text view. So clear and easy to read with color pics.5) The new favorites star is awesome.. To be able to access the star on any screen and get your favorites is wonderful.6) The app store is nicely laid out and much better to deal with than the prior version.7) The calendar app is fantastic. Finally we have a calendar and email with exchange.8) The ads - well they don't really bother me as most of it is catered to what I would like I suppose, but here is the thing that is aggravating. One of the ads was for free $5 mp3 credit, which I've accepted and added to my account, but it stays on my offers. I wish it would delete itself for something like that. **EDIT - well today the mp3 offer is no longer there. Not sure if the new day did that or they read my review and remove it ha ha.9) A lot more menu items at the top now including audiobooks, shop, games (not apps as that is different), photos and offers.10) Unfortunately the device is wider than the original fire so I can't use the cover I had for it and have to buy a new one.11) No wall charger, but you can use your old one or purchase one from amazon, or use your android phone charger.**EDIT 9/1512) One thing I do not like is the power button being next to the volume controls as I keep hitting the volume instead of the power. I did get the Marware case though that turns the screen on and off when open/closed and now I'm glad I chose that kind of case as I don't have to worry about the power button mostly. *EDIT 9/19 - returning the marware case and got a must cheaper Moko case. It has speaker cut outs, better viewing angles and can charge while closed. Only mentioning here, because the power button being flush with the device is a minus, but the moko case clamp is between the volume and power so its easier to find it. But again, the case closing will power it off automatically as well.**EDIT 9/1913) My email app has 3 accounts.. gmail, exchange and my personal. All 3 are set to check every hour, but my personal one checks every 10 to 20 minutes regardless of what I set. They put the notifications under \"settings/applications\" and the email is off by default, so that's how I know as I turned my on.I will update if I find anything else.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet and the price is right", "Author": "G. Berger", "ReviewID": "R9B4EN8EB3X0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my first generation iPad and second generation Kindle. It was a tough choice between the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, but in the end I felt that the areas where the Kindle out-performed the Nexus were the ones that mattered to me - better display, better speakers, twice the memory, better wireless. But it could have gone either way, the Nexus has its points.At any rate, this device is perfect for me. It's just the right size, small but not too small and nice and light.Likes: - Display is terrific - Sound is EXCELLENT - The speakers especially are much better than expected for a device this size. Sound through good headphones is amazing - VERY easy to transfer files to and from my PC. It shows up like any other drive. - Hooked into Amazon, I consider this a plus. - Size - Browser is pretty fast - Movies look great - Overall look and feel is excellent - Wireless is fast, much faster than my iPad. At least it seems that way, I have no hard numbers to back that up.Dislikes:- The volume and power buttons are too well integrated into the side of the tablet - they should have been raised a bit to make them easier to find and operate.- Charging port should have been on the short side, not the long side. I guess it had to be somewhere and they had to make a choice, but I don't agree with their choice.- Does not include a wall charger. It should, but on the other hand my X2 phone chargers work so this is not an issue for me. I have chargers all over the place.- Battery life is good but nothing like my iPad or kindle. The kindle of course has longer life - it's  a very simple and limited device. And the iPad has room for a larger battery I suppose. I can live with it, no problem, but it does require charging fairly often.- No GPS (Nexus has it). Not an issue for me, but something to note if you are looking at these two tablets.I'm totally neutral about the ads. They only appear on the lock screen so what's the big deal?

Other reviewers have expressed concern that the camera is of limited use beyond Skype, but it meets our needs completely. The picture and sound are outstanding. We had absolutely no trouble with the wireless connection. It works like a charm, easy and fast. The new Kindle is more email friendly, particularly for Outlook users. We had to purchase an app to access Outlook with the original Fire. That was not necessary with the new model. It is surprising that a charger is not included, but as many others have noted, chargers for previous versions work fine. The ads that annoy some reviewers don't bother us. We don't care what's on the lock screen. Like some other reviewers, we struggle to find the power button at times, but that is a minor issue to us. We love to travel. The original Fire was a great machine for road trips. We could easily access movies and music. The new Fire's upgrades in sound and video make this experience even better.

I have an iPad (2nd Gen) as well, and one of the reason I got a Kindle Fire HD is for school. I didn't want to take my expensive iPad with me, so I got a Kindle Fire HD for basic tablet needs (email, movies, music, etc) and not for heavy android customization. I did research and purchased the Kindle Fire HD and have been overall pretty happy.Couple things to mention before we begin:1. THIS DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE FLASH NOT BECAUSE AMAZON CHOSE NOT TO INCLUDE FLASH, but because Adobe, maker of flash, discontinued flash support on ALL android devices. This is also the case with Nexus 7 - it does NOT include flash.2. The device does NOT include a charger head (Why?), though I'm not bugged by it, I do feel its a cheap shot. Why do I want to purchase something separate for something that SHOULD be included. I'm lucky to have charger heads that support USB, including my last Kindle, but still. Most computers also include a USB port for charging, but overall, I think this is a bit lazy.3. ADVERTISEMENT!!! I actually don't mind them. When I pre-ordered it, I knew it would come with \"Ads\" and I thought it was only on the lock screen, but upon using the device, i found \"Customers Also Bought\" section below the carousel, which is bit of an annoyance, but overall, I don't mind it. I actually got really good stuff with it. I got $5 free MP3 credit AND $5 free credit for the video store as an offer from Amazon. So it's not all so bad. Of course, like others, I can opt out by paying $15, but for now, I'm comfortable.4. Kindle Fire HD vs. Nexus 7 - I'm really sick of this. First, the Fire HD, should not be compared to the Nexus 7, that's like comparing tablets to the iPad. Each have their pros and cons, and have different clientele. I got a Kindle over a Nexus 7 because I made a lot of investments with Amazon (music, books, music, etc) and their overall customer service (read below). Nexus 7 is an impressive tablet, but so is the Kindle Fire HD is many ways.5. NO BACK CAMERA - which I don't mind. I rarely use my own iPad for pictures or video. Most people have a camera phone or an actual photo camera, so really, I don't see the big gripe about not including a back camera. It does have a front camera for skype. Nexus 7 also does NOT include a back camera. However, what's weird, is that both devices have camera/picture apps.Now here are some highlights:***Display / Screen***Not the OS, but the overall display is extremely impressive. It has really nice vibrant colors and watching videos have never looked so good for a 7\" tablet. Reading books are also a joy, it doesn't strain the eyes so much like the last Kindle Fire or any of the electronic tablets. Reading books, though not ink, is smoother and comparable to the Kindle ebook readers (touchscreen, etc). Looking at pictures are also really nice and clear. I've played around with the iPad 2 and 3 and I can say, even though iPad's Retina Display is unbeatable, the Kindle Fire HD display is pretty darn close to comparable.***Sound***The Dolby Audio, to my surprise, is really impressive. I thought the \"Dolby\" thing was a business gimmick, but I was wrong. Without headphones, the audio is loud and clear. I had a couple \"hisses\" and \"crackling\" noises for a bit when the Fire HD first arrived, but has gone away since. The audio on movies and TVs is really clear. Watching Hunger Games, it really brings out the detail in in the sound. With music, it emphasizes crisp clear sound. it doesn't have much of a bass, but it has enough of a kick. With Headphones, it really comes out clear, however, I have nice headphones, so depending on other headphones, it may be different. With Apple earbuds, it sounds the same as if listening from a iPhone or iPad. Overall, the sound really is a high quality to this device. 5/5***Customer Service & Prime Membership benefits***Overall, I've been really impressed with Amazon's customer service. Whenever I've had a problem, they've been able to step up and solve the issue. Is it perfect? No. I love Apple's customer service, but they're not perfect either. They have great deals and lots to offer in their store. I buy a lot of MP3's because of the low price (Albums from $.99 to $3.99) Even P!nk's new album is $5! Great deals. Plus, with the Prime membership, it's an added bonus that neither Google or Apple have. With Prime, I have access to streaming free TV and Movies as well as two day shipping. Also, the lending library is great. I've read books I've always wanted to read certain books, and since they're free to read, I have no excuse.Here's the BAD PART.The OS is terrible. The carousel, no matter what, is the worst thing in the world. The favorites' folder, the Apps, Movie, Music, etc Folder (or menu) is like any regular android or apple tablet setup and really great, but the carousel? No. Silk is great, but using Safari on my iPad, iPhone and using Firefox / Browser on Android, Silk doesn't come par. It's faster and smoother since Fire 1, but it's still not quite their yet (hopefully an update will improve this).Like others, I've had trouble with sensitivity with the touch screen, as well as \"phantom\" lag. The keyboard is actually fine, but for example, when I'm on screen and I push the \"web\" section, it takes a bit to load up, so it feels like I didn't push it at all. It goes with purchasing apps or clicking on web links. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm pushing it right or if I'm pushing it at all.On the other hand, the processor is really fast and extremely smooth.Also from an iPad user, and being aware of Google Play, the app section is pretty limited. Sure, it has your basic apps, like Temple Run, Netflix, HBO GO, Skype, news apps, etc, but it doesn't come close to offer the multitude of apps for android. Actually, Amazon has a \"bootloader\" code in the new Kindle Fires (all devices) that prevents you from installing boot apps like Firefox browser or GO Launcher Ex (that transforms your layout all together). Amazon wants their devices to be stricly Amazon based (using silk instead of firefox, example). I think this is kind of sad, especially when Apple and Android offer 3rd party browser apps like Google Chrome (for iPad) or Dolphin. I was able to install Dropbox APK with no problems. So some 3rd party APK apps will work, but other won't (trial and error).Overall, for $199, the Fire HD is solid and impressive. A major step up from the last Kindle Fire, which seemed almost a prototype \"dip your toes into the water\" version. The Kindle Fire HD is officially a tablet and tons of media selections. But there is room for improvement. Using it, I have no regrets and actually LOVE using the Fire HD.

I am in a professional business with lots of turnover of computers, cell phones, digital cameras, etc.  The Kindle by far is the most confusing and ridiculous interface I have ever seen.  It is completely setup to sell you something from the get go.  It is an amazon purchase interface and that is all it is.  At every step of the way it tries to sell you apps, movies, or get you onto amazon.com.  I have 3 of these for my kids and my wife and I have been through all the setup, all the kindle help pages on Amazon and we find ourselves not even able to find apps we just purchased for our kids.  Get yourself an Ipad, which we have, or an Ipod, which we have.  Get yourself a Mac laptop (or device), get yourself a PC(or tablet PC), both of which we have, but stay away from the Kindle OS until you have a chance to try one or borrow one.  This is a complete investment in frustration and the confusing library / apps / store interface will drive you away from this device.We, seriously, are minutes away from boxing up all three of these and sending them back.  The wife and kids will be fine with the wife's Mac Laptop, my PC laptop, or the Ipad or Ipods.  We were much less frustrated before the Kindle Fire HD's and we will be a happier family once these are out of here.  I think the only thing is the kids will miss the constant Amazon credit card ads or Ford ads on startup.This is not even a 1 star device.  It is an Amazon.com sales gimmick that only works if you enter in all your amazon user names and passwords.  It also wants to take you further by forcing you to setup amazon 1 click.  It has no ability to discern who is using it - as it will show ads not meant for your kids and not care or be able to tell who it is catering ads for - adult or child.  It has no ability to restrict ads, you will get them in just picking it up to unlock it.  You will get them and there is no turning them off.

Browsing in clean and seamless on the internet.I enrolled in Prime with this and have found all kinds of cute Christmas cartoons I haven't seen in years and watched them right from my tablet.  The 7 inch fits in my purse and it goes everywhere with me.This is a very high quality tablet for the money.  It does everything iPad does.  You can use it as a day planner and load in your Google calender which makes it easy of you want to schedule your life on your computer/Google calender and have it transmit into the e-reader.Rent or buy movies in seconds and hook up to the TV and enjoy!I am going to cancel digital cable because I can get more choice with Prime and it works out to cost a little less each year.Some people don't like the adds and 'people who bought this book bought this one, too.'  I like this feature because I want to see what other cool stuff is out there.  I love online shopping and I don't mind adds.This e-reader/tablet comes with a nice UBS cord but no charger.  If you have other Kindles you can use their charger (I use the one from my DX) or you can by the 'fast' charger.  You will want to get a little booklet to protect it, and it is a good idea to get the screen protector--I wish I would have bought these items too.You will not be able to get many of the apps that Apple offers, like TMC, and some other favorites, but you can enjoy your Face Book and Angry Birds!This reader has a bright screen just like a computer.  It does not have the glare that iPad has, though, and you can also get a little screen for it if reading hurts your eyes.No free 3G?  If you have one of the other Kindle versions and you are traveling, just take it along and use the free 3G for book and article purchases.  When you are in the airport or a hot spot you can always download the book from the cloud into the Fire version.I have been delighted and I am extremely happy I bought this Fire instead of iPad mini.

I agree with all of the good things everyone else has said, so I won't go on and on.  I see by other reviews that there are a lot more things for me to expore in addition to e-mail and Angry Birds!  I am basically an anti-electronic device person, and my cell phone is an antique.  The Kindle does everything I want to do, and I can understand how to do it!  There have been a few hiccups along the way but easily fixed.  Any time I have had a problem, Amazon support has been more than helpful.  In fact, I think that is one of the things I like best.My most recent problem was that my hotmail pages weren't all loading onto the Kindle, although they were still appearing on my PC.  I was accessing the e-mail through msn.com on the web and not using the Amazon e-mail app.  Everything was working fine until about two days ago, when I couldn't hit the arrow at the bottom of the page and access the next page of e-mail, nor could I delete anything by checking the delete box.  I will probably never know why.I called Amazon Kindle Support and got Alex, who was the most incredible support person I have ever spoken to.  He actually listened to and understood what I was saying and used his brain in conjunction with whatever he was finding on his solution screens.  We couldn't solve the problem, even with me opening an account through the e-mail app (pages look much better using this app).  So, we parted company for a while while he checked with the higher-ups.  He called me the next morning with a solution given to him by the tech gurus.  While working our way to the solution, we stumbled onto another solution which worked and found that the guru's solution probably wouldn't have worked.  I am so amazed by the quality of Amazon's support people and apologize for not saying more about the Kindle.

I got it primarily because I wanted a means of connecting to the web while traveling without lugging along a laptop.  Games and reading help round it out.  If you are primarily interested in reading books, however, and do not care so much about the web connectivity features, the $100 Kindle Touch is actually BETTER for this purpose.  The reflective color screen of the Fire is NOT as good as the black and white non-reflective screen of the Touch, and the FIre is NOT NEARLY as good to read in bright light.  Both Kindles are well worth the money and each excels at what it does, but I thought it important to note this issue with readabilty so you do not order the more expensive Fire if all you want is a good e-reader.  The Touch is also smaller and lighter, making it hands down the better to travel with or hold when you are in bed.

At first I was disappointed because it seemed overly ad based and the area where I was used to having my Favorites was a carousal of items that were ads - trying to sell similar items to what is highlighted on your regular carousal area.I also did not like having to use a USB to charge it but in actuality I just use my regular kindle fire charger on the HD one and it works fine.  I also was disappointed in having no charge light while charging. In other words- my kindle fire had an orange light on it that turned green when it was fully charged and this HD fire has no indication whatsoever of when it is charged up fully unless you go over and look at it constantly to find out on the actual battery icon on the screen. It does not say on it that is is charged you just have to look up at the icon and find out for yourself.  <-- these things are not that big of deal to me anymore. I am used to the Kindle HD and the differences it has from the regular kindle fire now and I would always find myself reaching over to pick one up and always choosing the HD. I like the screen size, and it is not as heavy as my other one. I do not know if that is because of the kindle case I have on the other one being rather bulky leather and the new Kindle HD having a thin sleek case. (I bought my case at the same time and have a separate review on it).The sound and speakers are fantastic, I had to get used to the volume and the on/off buttons being at the top of the unit and the charging and hdmi port being on the side rather than how they are on the regular kindle. And also this one is good with audible books and if you already have both the audio book and the kindle edition they integrate well but if you don't already have both you can also still listen to it read to you but only in a computer voice and not much feeling, etc.The absolute main reason for me wanting the HD in the first place was because it had a camera but the truth is, that the camera is not even very good. I mean it is fine for Skype which is the only purpose I can find on having it on there and it MUST be used in landscape mode. I had wanted it to take pics with and there is not a built in app for it and I can't get it to do that. I don't even use the camera at all, I tried it about two times via skype and it was so/so- okay but I don't use my Kindle for skype that much so I probably won't even use it again.I gave it a good star review and would recommend it to others because it has the best amazing great graphics, the speakers are superb, the size is great, the price is phenomenal, and for reading books and using amazon's apps, it works fantastic.  If you want google play apps don't get this and if you want to use the camera to take pics, don't get it unless you can find an app somewhere that will help you with it or something.  I also want to add that I LOVE amazon customer service and the availability of the products they have, etc. so I went with amazon's product rather than any other similar items I could find because of my experience with them in the past. So, from my original Kindle fire to the Kindle HD- I would def. tell others it is a good item and they should get one.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "third times a charm!!!!", "Author": "B.

I used it some, but found it quite inferior to my 3 ipads (gen 1,2&3).  The motion of swiping and scrolling jittered quite a bit, the internet was laggy, just not as smooth of an experience overall.  I was impressed with the screen and would say it was about as good as the ipad 2's with slightly higher pixel density I believe.Due to my lackluster experience with the first fire I hesitated in getting the kindle fire HD, but after reading the advertising for it to include the upgrades in screen and the added Bluetooth capability, I went ahead and purchased it.  I'm glad I did.  I actually use this right along with my ipad 3.  I like the smaller more portable form factor.  The screen is incredible, a significant upgrade to the original and almost as stunning as the ipad 3.  It is definitively the 2nd best screen I have ever seen (next to the ipad 3).  It truly is a work of art and amazing for only a couple hundred dollars.  In one way, it is even better than the ipad 3, the polarizing filter gets rid of a lot of the annoying glare you see on ipads, which is very nice and surprisingly it works very well.I like that it has Bluetooth.  I love the increase in sound output.  I play movie/scripture stories for my kids at night time and the original kindle fire's speakers were way too quiet so much so that my kids couldn't really hear what was going on.  The speakers on the HD are quite the opposite, I have to turn down the volume a little even. I much welcome change.  The details in the music/audio is kind of fun as well as the surround effect.The device is much more polished all around.  It is easier to hold, more ergonomic.  I like the placement of the buttons and plugs better.  I like the tapered edges.  I even like the larger bezel that makes it easier to hold.  The interface is better and scrolls smoother, and everything is snappier and more fluid all around.  The wi-fi radios are definitely better too and have a much better range. The 5ghz band for 802.11n is a welcome addition too.Great job Amazon, this is what I call an upgrade!

I was given a couple hundred dollars as an unexpected bday present, and I planned to save a couple more to get the IPad4 for $399.Then while looking for something on Amazon, I saw this New Kindle HD about to Launch. After some research, I decided that I wanted to try it, as for the most part I wanted it in order to reduce the time I'm on my Laptop, and also to give me something Portable to access the Web with when I'm watching T.V., or a Movie... And didn't want to get on my laptop every time I wanted to check what other movies an actor I was watching was in.My Opinion so far;The Screen - Beautiful, and VibrantThe Speed - I've never had another Tablet before, but I'm very happy with its responsiveness.The Battery Charger - Because they advertise it as a Charge Booster I think? I just figured it was a Quicker Charger, and figured I'd just use the Standard one it came with. But it didn't come with a Charger, Lol It does come with a USB Cord to plug into your Computer, but that's supposedly takes 13.5 Hours to Charge, Lol This was too long, so I ordered the Charger. I haven't used the Charger yet, but will soon.Apps - Because all of this App stuff is new to me, I can't say how it compares, only that I'm happy that there are some Free ones. The only App that doesn't work, is the Pandora one. It says it should be in my Library, but it's not. I will be checking into this, as I really like Pandora.Games - I've only put the Free Missle Command Game on it, but it looks and sounds just like the Arcade Version, Love it.Sound - The Speakers are GreatBattery Life - This one I'm still determining... By the percentage drop, it seems that it's only lasting for 5 or 6 hours when charged, but I can't be sure yet, as I haven't gone through a hole charge. It's supposed to last around 11 hours when charged, so hopefully it's not only lasting 5 or 6 hours, or I will contact them and either get a replacement unit, or battery. Though I'm not sure that this will fix it, I will have to continue to read more Reviews. So far I haven't read any about this issue, so either mine needs to be replaced, or it will last longer than I think. We shall see.The Body - It's a beautiful machine, and the weight of it feels substantial, which is very nice.E-mails - I was able to enter 5 different E-mail Accounts, and the app keeps track of them all, which is just awesome. Definitely one of the uses I wanted for it was to check E-mails, without logging onto my Laptop.Twitter - Twitter is a blast to use on this, and switching from one Twitter Account to another is a Breeze.Videos - So far I have only tried a few YouTube Videos, and they Look and Sound Great.HD Movies/Streaming - I have yet to try this, as I thought it came with an HD Cable for some reason, but it didn't. I will be ordering one and connecting it to my HD T.V.Ads - I kinda sorta don't mind the Ads... Might pay the $15 later to get rid of them, but I'm not sure.Final Opinion - Like many of these Reviews indicate, it is definitely a good device when you are an Amazon Customer. But I also find it as an Excellent Device for Managing E-mails, doing Twitter, Researching things on the Internet, Playing Video Games, Listening to Music, Checking The Weather, and all the other things that I do on My Laptop, other than Writing.I have the 7\" Screen, so Writing might be kind of tough, but I imagine there's good Apps for it if I decide to.Hope this helps some Beginners out there, which I basically am in regards to Tablets.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Refurbished Kindle", "Author": "Summerface", "ReviewID": "R1PV9ZN9J4MDHB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When you purchase a new Kindle, and it is under warranty it should  be replaced with a new Kindle.

I also played with the Nook HD and Plain Kindle fire some prior to purchasing the Kindle HD.  I have not used the new Ipad Mini.Overall I should say I am very happy with the device as I still have it to use along w/ the Ipad2 whereas the Nexus has found another home.  I will focus on some of the bigger issues I found.First the kindle HD was easy to setup, navigation is easy and intuitive.The kindle is much smaller than the Ipad, and while not as large for viewing video while sitting on the couch it is nice for holding the device while trying to read a book in bed and can be managed with one hand. I also like the smaller size for travel better personally.  I personally prefer how the Kindle HD feels in my hands vs the Nexus, but that is personal preference.The screen was very nice in my opinion.Compared to either the Ipad or the Nexus, the Kindle HD does seem slightly slower and when the web browser is first opened it takes a little longer to load than on an Ipad or Nexus.  It is more notable if multiple tabs are opened. I also noted there are a few web pages that didn't play some embeded video that worked fine on the Ipad and Nexus (so were not flash).  Overall performance was very good, just not as quick as the other devices for web browsing regardless of WIFI connection.Regarding WIFI connectivity, I would consider it excellent and easy to setup.Cons:The Kindle Free time app is a huge disappointment.  I had the Free time app installed and my 5yo was still able to purchase a couple of games, luckily I was right there, he just clicked on them really fast.  Problem is that the Kindle does not auto-wake to Free time, it goes to the last app opened.  So each time you use it you need to open Free time before setting it down.  I am not going to remember to open Free Time (and didn't know I needed to) for it to be a very effect security tool.Therefore you still need to create a lock screen password or your child can still just grab the device and freely go through everything, if you have a lock screen password then they can not just logon on their own either.  You must logon for them, then open the Free Time app.  Granted,once in the Free time app they can not browse elsewhere or play games that aren't authorized without a password being entered.Personally, I trashed the Free time app and now just use a separate Parental Control Password and separate Lock Screen password.  The Free time app offers nothing in addition IMO besides a Time Limit.You should also disable In-App purchases and probably eliminate 1 click purchasing if you have kids just to be on the safe side.Compared to the Nook HD that allows multiple separate logons to be created so your child can log themselves on, Free time disappointed.No charging Brick!  Granted many users probably already have one, but considering the Kindle HD also has an Ad screen and is the same price as the Nexus or the Nook HD that come w/ charging bricks one needs to consider this in their purchaseRegarding the ads, I don't really mind personally.  It is only on the lock screen so pretty unobtrusive IMO.  If it is that big of an issue to somebody, consider one of the other devices or know your going to spend some extra $ to get rid of them.  Again, figure it into your expense if you think it will be an issue.Nuances/knit-picksSilk browser had issues w/ a few non-flash video and lags on load a little.  It also does not play youtube video very well so you need to find a separate youtube app.  Most websites will go to their main page, but some still go to a mobile site still.  This is an issue w/ tablets in general though.  Although Silk is not perfect, it is very functional for most browsing.The rotation screen does not work appropriately for about 1/2 the games I have.  With many of the Kindle Cases, the Camera is placed on the right in Portrait mode (so hinge of case is on Left).  When the Kindle is held w/ Camera on Right, upon opening the game (ie Where's My Perry) the game will be upside down, to correct you need to hold the Kindle opposite of the Case hinge and it doesn't feel as nice in your hands.  There could be a software update that corrects this in the future, but as of this review it is an issue to me.In comparison to the Nook HD, I can notice the Kindle HD is a little heavier, but not enough to make me go with the Nook HD.Although it is nice that the Power and Volume buttons are recessed and not accidentally bumped, they are hard to find quickly to change the volume.  So a little bit of a give and take. Also, the volume button does not adjust to orientation when going from landscape to portrait mode.  So when in portrait mode w/ buttons on top, left clicking on the volume actually increases the volume while on most devices this would decrease the volume.  That could easily be fixed w/ an update though.When held single handed w/o a case, pressure is sensed where your thumb is placed on the glass screen and can cause page turns etc.  This is not an issue with just then kindle but pretty much all touch readers including the Nexus and Nook I have tried to read with one-handed.  So more of a note for others to be aware of.Typical for android, playlists for music are not always seen on the device and managed as easily as Ipads w/ Itunes, but that will also affect the Nexus, Nook and other tablets using android.  If you download Winamp player at least you can see the Playlist on the Kindle.  Getting the entire playlist deleted from the Kindle can sometimes be mixed results.  You may need to try various MP3 players to best suite your needs.You can not just use windows media player to sync video's that should play on the device that were made for Ipod's/Pad's.  But you can just drop them into the Kindle Video folder, although you get a warning file may not play.  To get to play you must use the Personal Player app on the Kindle (preloaded), not the Video tab that goes to amazon content.Overall I feel the Kindle HD is a very nice device if your main use will be web surfing, checking some email and watching video content from Amazon, checking facebook status or playing Words w/ Friends.  Don't expect to be able to use Google Play or some other services readily and not the entire app store is available, but I found the app selection acceptable.  In regards to considering an Ipad vs a Nexus 7 or Nook HD, I think usability is similar enough for most users.  If you have the money, Ipads are great.  If you don't use Amazon much, you should consider another device than the Kindle.  If you want to be able to have more flexibility, another device like the Nexus or IPad may be better.  If you have kids and want a better logon system and maybe some more interactive children's books, the Nook HD is worth looking at.  Each device has its pro's and cons regarding performance vs content available vs cost. I think you will find it hard to go wrong with this device at this price, esp for those that have kids and don't want them breaking a high $$ Ipad.Don't waste your time getting a standard Kindle Fire, IMO the HD is worth it.None of the tablets are a complete laptop replacement if you actually need to get something creative done IMO.12/12/12I am finding Youtube to be eratic in silk.  When going to Youtube directly from Silk browser and selecting play an alternate App can be selected to play the Youtube video.  However, when using something like Friendcaster to go to a linked Youtube video it wants to play directly in Silk Browser.  I find this often just locks and does not play.  This should be fixable by Amazon and luckily I am not a major youtube user, but do find this to be a hassle.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the college student with down time.", "Author": "MrCrobos", "ReviewID": "R34NAJ71TUW6QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because I wanted to avoid paying for the data plan of a smart phone.  I have a cheap little cell with just phone and text, and everywhere I go I have great wifi connectivity, so a tablet seemed Ideal.  At school I get to see all sorts of other people's tablets so I could compare them really well, and the Fire HD was the one missin, because it had just come out.  So I took the risk because the price was so much better.The picture was amazingly good, even when using the HDMI output on a 55\" 720p it's still a beautiful crisp image.The battery while watching streaming movies from Amazon Prime or Netflix is about 6-7 hours.  If you aren't streaming it gets closer to the 10 hour mark, but I only watch the streaming ones at school.  If you're listening to streaming radio or MP3's the battery life is closer to like 25 hours, but I'd never leave it unplugged and doing something that long.The page suggests you buy their special charger adapter, but any wall plugged charger of that size will work, so if you have the same for your phones and other devices, just use that one.  Plugged into the wall it charges while you use it, plugged into a USB port, it only charges when off or in standby mode, but will maintain your charge while using it.The power and hdmi ports aren't in the best spot, I have the case that amazone made, which stand up great, but the power is along the bottom side, so makes it difficult to watch and charge while standing.  I solved this by saving the box it came in, and cutting a little notch out of it for the power cable to point down from.The speakers are great, but they're specifically designed to give optimal sound when you're hands are cupped around them and poiting them at your ears.  If you're using the reccommended case stand, you'll lose a lot of volume to the room behind it.  I'm going to make a special stand for mine that properly directs the sound and allows the power in as the same time.Apps from Andriod via amazone does limit the amount of apps you can use, but there's still a ton of them out there.  All the big names are there, and lots of free knock offs.  You can't use software from other things on it it seems, but maybe that'll be solved in the future, however that hasn't been an issue so far, aside from programs that violate copywrite laws, such as emulators/roms, I haven't found anything anyone else had that wasn't available through the app store.Free app everyday between $0.49-$3.99, it's randomly chosen by amazone, and often theme based around the holidays, most are lame, but a few were really good.Amazone prime for students is half priced, so all that streaming prime content this device is perfect for is cheaper then a net flix account, but comes with the free book a month, and prime shipping rates.I've got friends who have Ipads and galaxy tabs, they paid more, have bigger screens, and yet they're still envious of this perfectly sized tablet.  It's not that it's better in every direction, it's that it's perfect for what we need and want it to do.12/21/2012I'm still loving this thing, friends are loving it as well.  Tried out the HDMI out on a 55 in screen TV, thought it would be a bit grainy, but the picture held a true 720p picture.  Was really impressed, not I can put my amazon prime and netflix on any TV and not have to lug around my Xbox everywhere.

It is very easy to figure out, usable right out of the box and then, with apps, highly configurable if you are into that sort of thing which I am. The color is brilliantly crisp and clear and the audio is great although I have only listened to books on it so far, no music.

It does just about all the same things. And I personally like the slightly smaller size. I got the 7\" Fire.The internet access interface gets me onto the internet immediately. It's not sluggish or lacking in any way. If you use amazon.com as your primary e-store you'll love it.

( have owned it as well) the build quality is damn near perfect..and far superior to any 7 inch tablet out...this includes the nexus 7 which is good in its own right but is cheaply built to keep cost down, and has less the memory for storage.

I started with the set up. Fine, except it doesn't respond to gentle tapping. I don't know if this is typical or if I have a bad one but I have to keep tapping all over the screen to get it to register. I had no problem setting up my Amazon pay account, that was made supremely easy, of course. I bought one book for my daughter and despite trying, you cannot alter the size of the font. It looks like microfiche. Like a scanned picture of a page from a real book. Ridiculous, I paid $5.99 for something less than a real book.

Below are the reasons why I give it 5 stars.PROS* Screen is vastly improved.  Truly a WOW when I saw it the first time.* Touch is much more responsive and consistent.  This was very evident while reading the Wall Street Journal on the tablet.* Easier access to cloud stored photos.  I setup some folders on my storage and that created the photo album.* Reading experience improved.  Very much linked to the new improved screen and touch response from the device.* Better sound out of the device.  No tablet has been stellar on the sound but this is probably as good as it gets acknowledging that speakers are not a strong suit for any tablet.* Still at an incredibly affordable price.* Addition of buttons for the volume control.  It is easier to work with those buttons via the Kindle cover offered by Amazon that has the magnetic closure.* Favorites are now accessible at any point and don't require you to go back to the home screen.  I have used that feature many times.  While I am browsing if an email arrives, I touch the star and pop into my email and when I leave, I am right where I was before.  That was a very good addition.* Silk browser has been more responsive and stable.* Wifi has been much more stable and strong.* Much improved mail client.  I love the fact that it now syncs with my calendar and contacts.I am ambivalent about the ads on the lock screen.  I know I can opt out at anytime in the Manage Kindles page.  I am also ambivalent about the display of what others purchased based on what I am viewing on the main screen.  Most of the time I do look at that.  It is the purchases that you guys make that have led me to find things I was looking for or things that turned out to be fun and I didn't know they were there.I have only 1 gripe.  That is the relocation of the port for the power.  When I watch movies with it turned horizontal, I used to be able to connect the charger while watching the movie.  Now I cannot do that because what happens when I start a movie is that it rotates to where that port is on the bottom.  Additionally the Amazon cover has been designed with that in mind and so it drives home that design as being intentional but maybe not totally well thought out.  If I could I would deduct a quarter star to a half star for that.  I am not willing to deduct a full star since overall I have been extremely pleased with the purchase.I have had several tablets since they started coming to market including the beloved iPad.  I can never do my job on a tablet due to the necessary tools and environment I must have so tablets are for enjoyment whether that involves feeding the news junkie in me, checking the weather, checking email, or playing games.  I would bet there are people who won't believe that I am sincere that I prefer my Fire over my iPad but I do.

I will leave that up to the people who know more about that then me. I will say it is easy to use and the perfect size for kids and adults. The reason I got the KINDLE FIRE HD is my son loves to watch his videos and look at his books every where we go. He also loves to go on youtube and netflix and play some games. I have been using an Ipad 3 I got him a few months ago but with all the other items he needs to bring with him every time we go somewhere the Ipad is just to big to carry around. My son is non verbal and has to bring his talking device with him everywhere, and it is about the size of a large book and very heavy. The KINDLE FIRE HD fits right in the bag with his talker and is always with him. Don't get me wrong the Ipad is great but he is 5 and it is a little large for him to lug around. Also do to the cost of it I am more then a little worried every time he uses it without me. The KINDLE FIRE HD on the other hand does everything he want's it to and much more and it is perfect for his little hands. I just put on a screen protector and a good protective case and I feel much more comfortable about allowing him to use it on his own. He is very good about not breaking his stuff but accidents happen so I always get the insurance. Of course I got the KINDLE FIRE HD because I Will be using it when he's not looking. I'm sure the standard KINDLE FIRE would have worked just fine also but as my wife says I tend to use his toys just as much as he does. Now if I can just talk her into letting me get another one for myself we won't have to fight over it ha ha. I have tried many of the other less expensive (not much less) tablets out there and they all have been just that  \"LESS\". If you are thinking of getting a cheaper tablet to save a few dollars think very carefully about it. Believe me it is not worth the 40 or 50 dollars you will save just to have it not work when you need it most. I thought a couple of the tablets I tried were good, Then I gave them to my son and every time they failed to load or froze or just took to long to load he was very upset. And Don't get me started on the battery life. A slow tablet or a dead battery is like the end of the world to an Autistic Child and I'm sure not much better for a Child without special needs. So Thank you Amazon for a great product The KINDLE FIRE HD has made my son a very happy boy and you can not put a price on that. We can't wait to see what you will come up with next. My wife and I look foreword to helping are son learn and master all the wonderful things the KINDLE FIRE HD has to offer him. Sorry got off topic this is a review we are just very pleased with this purchase and would recommend the KINDLE FIRE HD for everyone of all age's Thank you.

At first when he asked if I wanted it I said \"yeah sure why not\", not really super excited about it. I wanted it but wasn't wild about it. It finally came in and I gotta say I can't stop using it! I do LOVE IT! My first thoughts of it were \"what am I going to use it for\"?, \"how often will I use it?\" , etc. I've had it now for only 3 days or so and I love it! The games are fun to blow away some time, its light enough for me to carry anywhere , so where ever there is wi-fi (wireless internet to those who are not computer savvy), I can get online with it. It holds a ton of books. I like to have cookbooks on hand when I am cooking so it is awesome for that and of coarse just to have so I can enjoy a book. I love the borrow feature I get with my Amazon Prime and the sample features to give me an idea what the books are like without having to make bad purchases to find out. I have a laptop that I absolutely love but I don't always want or need to pull it out wehn I have/want to look something up real fast online. It's also easier for me to keep and access the apps you can get like \"out of milk\" for shopping and pantry lists. I also live in \"bush Alaska\" where we are constantly flying to go into town and this will definately pass the time away because it holds lots of movies and you can rent/borrow from Amazon Prime as well.

I have had it for a month now, I waited to make a review to be sure I had used all of the features and had time to think through if I was going to keep it or not.

The ability to see covers is awesome!Now other than that, the internet works well on it.  I like that it doesn't take me to the mobile site for everything which makes things a lot easier.

It took a google search to figure out how to lock the screen in landscape or portrait, but I now have that down, it was easy I was looking in the wrong place.I have watched movies on it, the case I got allows it to be propped up and my kids have watched a movie on it too.

When I redeemed my digital copy, it was through Ultra-Violet or Itunes...only. I can not watch my digital copy on my Kindle Fire HD. I contacted customer service about the issue and they told me that at this time, there is no solution to have the ability to use the Digital Copy feature from any DVD sets on the Kindle. They DID however offer a full refund for the DVD set that I purchased, and they even sent me the pre-paid return lable. You will be happy with the Fire HD....just don't expect to use it on your next flight to watch a digital copy.

I was worried that I would not be able to download and use all the apps and games I wanted to (since there is NO Google Play available without rooting).  Despite these \"limitations\", I found nearly everything I wanted in the Amazon App Store, and for those that are not there, you have several \"options\" for getting them anyway.  I would like to have ALL Google Apps working out of the box, and Jellybean with all its enhancements, but having twice the storage and an HDMI port, along with the better screen and speakers, it is just hard to beat the KFHD (in my opinion).Overall the higher quality screen, sound and just solid feel of the Kindle Fire HD has won me over.  IMHO these features make up for the small software issues that I personally encountered.  Also with the Dev community already rooting and making mods for all the google apps, I feel that the software issues are easily resolved if you are willing to wait and tinker.

When I saw the new screen resolution, a smile broke out on my face. The new \"HD\" feature is absolutely amazing. The Dolby Sound is so worth it as well -- music is crisp and clear, and LOUD. I have nothing bad to say about the new speakers. They are amazing.Another feature I particularly enjoy is the new 10-touch screen. The old Kindle Fire only allowed a two point touch capability, while on this new Kindle all my fingers can be used AT ONCE to play games (i.e., works well with Fruit Ninja).The CAMERA! I absolutely love having Skype so readily available.  For those of us who have relatives who live far distances away, this is nice to keep in touch.I also like how the bottom menu bar always stays to one side of the Kindle HD, no matter how you turn it or rotate it or whatever. Also, your Favorites are always available to click on by finding the Star icon.The price of the Kindle Fire HD is awesome. The original Kindle Fire was the same price when it first came out, and this one (being an improvement) is the same price?? That is great. $200 is a reasonable price for such a great high-quality product.Longer battery life! Up to 11 hours (supposedly) for longer use.

Plus, no charging light. But oh well.>No virtual shelf background. The original Kindle Fire had the Shelf look, but this one does not. It's no big deal, I just kinda miss the \"good-old-fashioned\" bookshelf.>Ads and Amazon promos. It doesn't bother me at all, but it seems to be a big issue for some. The one thing I DO like about this is the \"Customers also bought...\" feature below books you've already purchased. It' nice for seeing new, suggested books that I'd like to read.Overall, and despite the occcasional flaw, I LOVE THIS NEW PRODUCT. Kudos, Amazon. This new Kindle is comparable to the iPad.

I had the first Fire to use as an e-reader that could also watch movies/serve as a couch or bed toy, and I really liked it for those purposes. It was a little clumsy and kinda slow, but hey, it did everything it was supposed to do. The HD takes everything up several notches: the screen is so much better, the sound is improved, it's faster, feels more solidly built, and has a slew of completely new software and hardware features like text-to-speech (which I use for driving, and works great) and bluetooth. I don't mind reading extensively on LCD screens so paying the extra money for a device that can do so much more than just display text is just fine by me, and thankfully, the Kindle Fire reading software has been upgraded with the X-Ray features, the aforementioned text-to-speech, real page numbers, and audiobook integration. The interface is a pleasure to use. The device is everything the first Fire should have been, and I'm very happy with the purchase.People have ragged on this thing for multiple reasons, all of which are moot for me. Ads? I barely see them, one of them has actually given me an offer I could use, and you can pay $15 to get rid of them if you hate them that much. The device can't do much more than consume media? I'm curious as to what other people are doing with their tablets, because I've never seen them do anything but, guess what, consume media. Maybe people have found productive ways to use them, but for me, I don't care about that, and this device is not aimed at that, so holding it accountable for something it tells you upfront is misguided. The one gripe I do have is that you can't get rid of the \"Customers Also Bought\" bar at the bottom of the screen. It's unattractive and I would rather have that space used for a taskbar or something, but hey, they want you to buy things, and that's how they're giving you this fine peice of hardware for 200 bucks.

Add on the charger for $15....total outlay of $230 for the 7\" Kindle Fire HD loaded up nicely. Out of the box it was a little heavier than I expected, and definitely got pretty warm/hot as it ran. Turned it on, it was.....nice. I have to say I found the overall look and display a little gloomy, so dark with the black background. I guess it's there for dramatic contrast; personal preference, it was a little heavy/dark to me. But overall it was.....nice.I think I would have been just fine if I hadn't also received a Nook HD+.  Whoa.  Top to bottom, it's a wow.  Now, that's an 8.9 inch screen, true, but I could have also gotten the 7\" screen (16 GB is $149, for 7\" or 9\").  However, for $179 I got the 8.9\" Nook HD+ with 32GB.  The display is incredible.  Better specs than either Kindle Fire HD, and it shows. I didn't notice an appreciable sound difference between the two, but I am NOT an audiophile.  What I am is a serious reader, and the Nook HD+ gave me the absolute best reading experience of any ereader or tablet I found. That page curl/turn animation....feels like you're flipping a page, not clicking a page.B&N; is getting out of the color tablet business, true, but they are keeping their other readers and will continue to sell ebooks.  And with the Nook HD+ being open to Google Play, I can get the Kindle app and read Kindle books on the nook as well. I had them open side by side and the Kindle reading experience was identical on both machines (though again, reading a B&N; book from the nook store....totally different, more organic, natural reading experience, in my opinion).My Kindle Fire HD 7\" was costing me $230 (32GB, no ads, and the wall charger); had I decided to do for it and get a comparable Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" the total would have been $330 (32GB, no ads, and the wall charger).  For $179 I got everything I was looking for on the Kindle Fire 8.9\", plus I have access to Google play and am not so fenced in in terms of apps.  For that price, I'll add on the $50 extended warranty.....and maybe even go ahead and get myself a 7\" Nook HD as well, so I've got something smaller to carry when that would be more convenient.I thought I would hands down prefer the Kindle Fire HD, turns out, it was a really great thing to experience them side by side, and think about what I really needed in an ereader/tablet, and what I didn't.I wish you all luck in deciding, and encourage you to consider all the options.

I was strongly considering the Nexus 7 but after reading the many posted horror stories claiming quality issues and poor customer service I went with Amazon's product. I know from experience that Amazon can be trusted to back their products and will offer a full array of products and services to support them.I've have been enjoying my Kindle daily for the past three weeks, and it's gotten a real workout.  So far it is one of the best products that I have purchased.  It delivers all that is advertised and much more. I opted for the 32 gig model as it allows for a lot of HD video and music storage. It was well worth the $30 price difference.  My Kindle is used primarily as a reader but it is also used to play music, watch videos (on my HDTV), and web surfing. It performs extremely well in all of these areas. It is not used for game play so I cannot comments on its' performance regarding them.Pros: Clear and crisp display, Incredible sound for a small device, light weight and extremely portable.  Best of all it quickly and easily transfers e-books borrowed from libraries and friends.Every good quality that \"TL\" mentioned in his extensive product review of 9/17/12 still holds true.Recent software updates and new free apps address many of the concerns that were mentioned in older reviews such as;  \"customer also bought\" pop-up ads, software issues, and app problems.Some reviews refer to \"side loading\" apps; I don't think that's necessary.  Amazon now offers over 57,000 apps with about 28,000 being free. I checked out their list and was able to find every app I needed for free.Cons: Only one very minor complaint, I wish that the screen adjustments that are made available on a book's page as it is being read included a \"brightness\" control.  As it is configured now you must leave the book, and take six steps in order to adjust the brightness and get back to the book.  If the printed page's brightness is still not to your liking you must redo the entire procedure. I realize that the Kindle has an \"automatic brightness\" setting, but its' adjustments do not suit my needs.I purchased the \" Digitals On Demand 14-Item Accessory Bundle for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" \" for $40. A great price for all of the accessories that one will need. I am very pleased with the products supplied.  The case fits well and it automatically puts the Kindle into sleep mode when closed and awakens it when opened. All of the cables and chargers provided are of good quality and work properly. I have used the micro HDMI cable many times without any problems.  I consulted a few YouTube videos before applying the screen protector to learn the proper techniques. It was time well spent and allowed me to accomplish a perfect bubble-free application. There is A LOT of good information about Kindles on YouTube.  The included earphones were unusable, very \"tinny\" sound with no bass response at all. They went directly into the trash.Some have complained about the confusing placement of the micro ports. Put a small dab of \"White Out\" on the case where the USB port is located and a dab on the top of the USB cable when it's connected, problem solved.The Kindle Fire 7 HD is indeed a great product at a good price, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far I love it", "Author": "Chris R.

By the time I realized it I went back, and it had been run over several times.  Held up pretty well actually...except for the part that it was dead.  I was going to buy a paperwhite, but decided on the Kindle Fire HD.  I love it so far, but it's only been a few days.  We have an iPad II as well, so I'm comparing the Kindle fire to the industry standard.Couple early observations:-The WiFi on the Kindle is faster.  Our iPad gets really slow from time to time.  I've heard it's an issue and have tried everything I find on the forums, but nothing works.-Kindle let me set up MS Exchange Mail in about 30 seconds.  iPad not as easy.-I get books from the Kindle lending library free, you can ONLY do that on a Kindle-Home page is a little over-engineered on the Kindle, but now that I'm used to it, I can get to stuff really quickly, and it's very intuitive.-Screen is very clear.  Amazingly clear.-The quality of the item is much higher than I expected; it's got some mass to it, and feels good in the handBottom line:  For the price difference, the Kindle wins HANDS DOWN.

Probably time to wake up.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Love My Tablet", "Author": "Ming", "ReviewID": "R3ZLQ7UNAOMTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Kindle Fire HD at Best Buy three months ago, and at first I was a little hesitant. I've always considered tablets to be this hype thing, but now that I own one I can see why it's so good. I've heard a lot of negative things about the Kindle Fire/Kindle Fire HD but my experience with it has been positive. To me it seems that people either really like it, or really hate. I'll tell you why I really like it.Device Build 9/10:The device is really solidly built and it doesn't feel cheap. It's quite heavy so if you're looking to hold it with one hand be warned that it can be tiring. The rubber in the back really gives the Kindle Fire HD a good grip and to this day I have never dropped it before. I'm taking one point off because the power button and the exterior volume controls are a bit too close for my liking. Several times I ended up locking the device when I wanted to change the volume.Screen 10/10:I have no problems with the screen. Of course it can't compare with high end devices like the iPad, but for the price I think it's very good. And yes it is sunlight resistant, I can read it outside on a sunny day with no problems. As far as graphics are concerned, all my apps seems fine. The pocket edition of Minecraft on this device is beautiful. Video viewing is also good, but I'll get to that later.Battery Life 10/10:I know this is important to a lot of people. I've heard the battery life is horrible on the Fire but this is not true. I watched two two-hour long movies back to back and the battery only went down half. There is an amazing Battery app you download for free that you tell me how long you can watch videos or read with the battery you have. For me, the battery life is amazing.Wi-Fi 10/10:The dual band, dual antenna wi-fi of the Kindle Fire HD is excellent. Even at my college campus, where hundreds of others are using the network, I can stream movies from Amazon with no pauses. It's very fast and I don't see how you can go wrong with it.Reading 10/10:I think the Kindle Fire HD's reading features are perfect. I especially like the highlight function. If you're reading fiction then it might not be all that useful, but for a history major like me who reads nonfiction, the highlighting function saves me a lot of time when I need to take notes and stuff. The interface is smooth, and there is a dictionary integrated into the software. All you have to do is to highlight the word and the definitions will appear.Video 9/10:For some reason, HD video doesn't always work for me. I think that's because it's probably better to view it in standard with my internet connection. But when HD is activated, it's simply beautiful. I love watching videos on my Fire. My only real problem with the video interface is that there is no fast forward button. There is a 10 second rewind, but I don't know why there is no fast forward. Of course you can just drag the progress bar forward but if you're looking for a specific spot in the movie, then dragging it is a bit difficult.Audio 10/10:The audio for me is perfect. The Dolby Audio really makes the device shine. I really have nothing else to say about this.Shopping 10/10:It is so easy to shop with the Kindle Fire HD. The store layout is very neat with a lot of good offers. Who doesn't like cheap or free books?Web Browsing 8/10:Here is where the Kindle Fire HD lacks a little. Most of the times the Silk browser is fast, but it can be a bit sluggish and laggy at times. You can especially see this when you try to type something. The keyboard comes out a second or two later. There is also no built in Flash with the Silk browser. You need to download Dolphin browser and manually get Flash in there. Just pick up any Kindle Fire HD guide and it will tell you how. Watching videos on Youtube is also a bit disappointing. A lot of the videos can't be viewed because it's not supported, and you need to download a Youtube for it (see below). Overall, I would say the browser performs well and it adequately suits my needs. You just have to put up with some minor lag here and there, which is bearable.Apps 8/10:There are a lot of apps missing from the Amazon App Store. Also, I found out that a lot of free apps on iPhone or Android phones aren't available on the Fire, forcing you to go with the paid version. That said, I don't really use the Fire HD to play games so I don't have a lot of game apps on here. You can find most of the big name apps here, but don't expect a lot.Tips:Amazon Prime:If you don't have it already, get it. The lending library system is really, really good. You can borrow a free book every month. I've also compared Prime Instant Video with Netflix. Instant Video has just about all the movies and television series Netflix has. If you're into Korean dramas and Anime, you might be a bit disappointed with Instant Video's offerings compared to Netflix's. That said, there is a large number of popular Korean movies you can watch for free.Advertisements:I just want to put this in here because I see a lot of people complaining about the lock screen ads and the what other people bought ads. I honestly don't get what the big fuss is about. As another reviewer pointed out, how many people really stare at a lock screen? Also, I got some pretty good deals out of it. Opened up my lock screen one morning and saw an offer of $10 gift card with purchase made by Discover Card. Since I use Discover to make all my Amazon purchases, buying a book for $0.99 then getting a gift card is not a bad deal at all.ES File Explorer:This is a must have for the Kindle Fire HD. I see some people complaining that you can't take pictures with the front-facing camera. Not true. The ability to activate the camera is inside ES File Explorer. Also, if you downloaded videos and/or pdfs online and you can't find it, they're also inside ES File Explorer.TubeMate:I'm a bit hesitant to recommend this app because I have bad experiences with it. The Fire has no native Youtube app, and some Youtube videos can't be watched through the browser. A lot of guides recommend TubeMate, which not only allows you to watch videos but also download them. For me the app is extremely slow and it freezes a lot - to the point where I have to restart my device. Use with caution.The Negatives:Battery Percentage:I feel like Amazon should add the battery percentage to the battery bar. To view the percentage, you either have to download the Battery app from the store or go deep into the Settings menu where it's buried.Back Button Doesn't Work:When I'm in the store too long, the back button stops working. When I press back to go back to the main list, nothing happens. I can try fifty times and it still won't go back. The only way to fix this is to go back to the Home Screen and reenter the store.Can't Manually Change Time:I don't understand why the Fire doesn't allow me to manually change the time. For some reason, the clock is occasionally NINE MINUTES SLOW. Twice I was almost late to the work because the clock was wrong.Final Score: 94/100", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!,", "Author": "David Jones", "ReviewID": "R34H61P15FNJ4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I would like to say I am a huge apple fan and both my daughters wanted iPad minis for Christmas after waiting around on them forever to come out I started looking at other options.

Kindle DX owner 3 years.OK, here goes:After opening the box, I played with the Fire for a few minutes.  Very intuitive.  The battery level on the pull down \"More\":\"Device\" screen was around 35% so I decided to charge it using my 3-year old Kindle DX charger/cord.  That is when I discovered the old cord was defective because when I wiggled it, the \"charging\" indicator would go off and on - mostly off.  And my DX, after being plugged into that same cord for 4 days prior, was nearly dead.  So I plugged the USB cable that came with the HD into the charger and viola! - charging nirvana.During the first few minutes after turning on the Fire it took a minute or two to download updated software automatically.First, wifi setup.  It found my router immediately.  I punched my 7 digit code into the very responsive keyboard and within roughly 4 seconds I was connected.It took me less than 2 minutes to link both my gmail and yahoo mail accounts to the email program that came with the Fire.  Access to both sets of emails on one device is more than I discovered to do with my desktop - and it set itself up automatically and instantly.  All contacts that I had on yahoo also were visible and revisable on the Fire.Next was my calendar.  I already had my Outlook calender on my desktop linked to a Google calendar.  That combination worked flawlessly.  Connecting the Fire calendar app with my Google calendar took most of 15 seconds.All of my previously downloaded books and cloud music were immediately available on the Fire once I intuitively followed a simple step.The real fun part was downloading and experimenting with several \"free\", several $0.99, and a couple of $1.99 programs.  The ones I've downloaded so far and really appreciate are:*The Free Dictionary*Calculator Plus*Scanner Radio Pro (listen to public safety and public service radios around the nation/world)*Photo Editor Plus (I quickly learned it is possible to use the Fire as a decent low res camera.  This program isn't necessary, but helps clean up images you take with the Fire or download from other sources.*WiFi Analyzer (very cool real time graphs and wifi data)*Zillow (show details of real estate around the nation)*MapQuest (I wasn't sure Fire did maps and satellite images.  But this program works great.)*eWeatherHD - An excellent, impressive weather program for anywhere in the world.  Very detailed information.*Weather Live - Scroll to any selected City; beautiful interactive background indicating conditions; more basic data than eWeatherHD*TrackIt Deluxe (a hurricane/topical storm tracking program with great satellite images any time of year)*CIA World Factbook*Pandora*TuneIn Radio Pro (select from hundreds/thousands of worldwide radio stations from a variety of categories of programming.)*A variety of other specific, single purpose radio programming apps....and finally, so far, (I sprung for the 13 bucks) PrinterShare Premium to print web pages and notes I create (easy set up and reliable use).The Kindle Fire HD32 exceeded my expectations.

And I own a Nook ereader (just the black and white kind - so my kids wouldn't borrow it!)For Christmas, my oldest asked for a laptop. After doing some serious thinking and some serious research - I actually bought both of my children (5 and 10 years old) the Kindle Fire HDs. While they have not had the chance to play with them since they are for Christmas - I have played with them extensively (I had to get them all set up for Christmas!) However, I took my kids by a store and walked them by the Kindle Fire HD display. They both immediately went to it and had it figured out within minutes. I love that the learning curve is short and sweet on it!Here are some of my thoughts:The screen quality is amazing! Really, it's the best that I have seen out there. It's just \"wow!\"The sound is great. My first thought was that I wish it had a plug so my kids could plug in headphones. Then I thought, who am I kidding? They don't use headphones for their DS or any other media device, so why would they start now? So, no headphone ability isn't a big deal for me.Speaking about Nintendo DS, I have had a couple of friends who are parents ask me about getting their kids one. I have since started recommending the Kindle Fire over a Nintendo Ds for a variety of reasons. 1. Games for DS run $20-50 EACH. Apps for Kindle Fire are $0.99 - 2.99 each- a BIG difference! 2. DS games are little and easily lost (and they do lose them frequently!) apps stay where they are suppose to! 3. The obvious... DS plays games. Kindle Fire can do sooo much more.So back to my thoughts: I was nervous being an iPhone user that Amazon wouldn't have the selection of apps that my kids like to play. There was no need for me to worry. Every app that my children play on my phone was available for download to the KF HD.Even more impressive was the amount of books (free or reduced) available for download. Being an avid reader with a nook, I could never find a lot of free books for my nook. I'm sure they are out there, but I didn't have a lot of luck finding them. While downloading tons of free books to my kids kindles, I also downloaded the kindle app to my phone and have started myself quite a collection of books. All of them (for myself and kids) free or under $3.Parental controls: since my children will not be sharing their kindles, I chose not to use the Kindle Free Time that has lots of controls, time limits, and the ability to create profiles. Even without using it, I was able to restrict buying ability from each child's kindle. For my oldest, I left Web browser but was able to block it for the youngest.I love that both kindles are synced to my amazon account. I love that I can buy one app and they both can have it in their kindle. I also love that I can buy an app or book and not have it on the other one if I don't want it there.Next, we love family movie night. While we use Netflix (available for download on the KF HD) there are times that the movie we want to watch isn't on Netflix. We have, in the past, rented a movie from Amazon and used Playon to push it from our home computer to the tv. This isn't ideal as it often freezes or crashes. I LOVE that with the KF HD, you can download the movie to the kindle from Amazon, plug it into the TV, and watch it. While we haven't done this yet, it is a feature that I am very happy about. I look forward to our first family movie night using it!Another great feature: my kids can use it to Skype with their dad in Afghanistan! Awesome!Price: $200 for a kindle and $350 for a mini iPad. Now, keep in mind that after I bought \"no ads\", covers, screen protectors, and the protection plan for each KF HD, I spent over $300 each. But I would have done the same with the iPad mini and wouldn't have been able to get but one. Then the kids would have had to share which would have been a lot of bickering that I would have had to listen to.My end thought for parents: buy it! Forgo the Nintendo Ds, laptops, and iPod touches. The Kindle Fire Hd has advantages over them all.

I watched a movie last night, with ear buds in, and I felt like I had been to the movies. Clear, rich stereo sound with absolutely no `popping` or distortion of any kind. The picture was clear and crisp from any angle-I kept moving it around to see if what Amazon stated about the screen was true and, it is. Even at 16G I have plenty of room for enough books, videos and apps to keep me busy for a good long time. My Kindle FireHD is now glued to my side. I can't stay away from it.

I saw no reason to get rid of the ads as they're not intrusive.The on/off button was about the only problem I had, as it's flat to the surface, so I just put a dab of soft glue on it.So for me, after doing a lot of research and knowing what my requirements were, this is a nice little tablet.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the finest tablets", "Author": "Agent 029", "ReviewID": "RDQ4K29D1CSOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is indeed fine! it is fine because it is in HD. if you love to watch movies, go for tgis tablet, becauae this one features HD, and dolby digital sound.

Koester \"dwk\"", "ReviewID": "RMG31026QFOB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had several Kindles, and have now had the Fire HD for several weeks. My main use for a Kindle is reading eBooks, both Mobibooks (Amazon delivered Kindle books and others) and text (.txt) files.  There are some great reviews out there already, so this is just a few more things you may need to know to decide if the new Fires are for you.  I'm kind of a medium duty techno-nerd and can get carried away at times, so skip anything thats greek to you, here goes;As a book reader:You will find that the screen is great to read on. Being illuminated really makes reading in dim lighting much easier on the eyes. The screen is sharp and clear,  and the glare is minimal (don't think you can have sharp + clear + zero glare in the same device). Any glare you do experience can be removed by a small adjustment of your wrist as you hold it,  you won't even have to think about it after awhile,  you'll do it automatically.The reader app itself is pretty good and has, of course, several fonts + background colors + sizes.  One advantage to eBooks is that *all* books are large print if you want them to be <chuckle>. Larger font sizes determine how easy the words are to read, but at the cost of having fewer words per page. I know that's obvious, but I pointed that out just so I could say this; I'm mildly miffed that there is a big jump in the displayed font size between size 7 and size 8, not sure why they did that. I think I would be happiest with a size of 7.5, but its not possible with this reader.  Mebbe future software releases will change this size selection process to something a little more adjustable.  I know, I know,  it's a tiny thing,  but I am used to a certain look from previous Kindles and just want what I'm used to, I'll get over it. It likely won't bother you at all.The dictionary app built into the Reader is stellar.  The old Kindles made you cursor all over the screen to look up a word. The fire HD has you touch and hold the word until a small window pops into existance,  then release it and up jumps a window with the brief lookup for you, including a link to the full definition if you want it. Wonderful. However, unless you are an alien with pinpoint fingers or something,  you will likely need a stylus to select the word you want, especially on the smaller font sizes.  See the accessories section below for more info about that.Another thought abut the reader:  It seems that this reader only wants to read Mobi/Kindle style ebooks,  the older Kindles read text (.txt) style files as well.  This Kindle considers text files + Word files + PDFs as documents and wants to keep them in the Documents folder and open them with the included office clone software. You can convert text + Word files to Mobi books but it will take software to accomplish, I am considering writing a short ebook on how-to for those of you who write stuff you would like to read or share for eReaders, mebbe a 99 cent special if Amazon will carry it,  depends on the response in the comments section, as I'm pretty lazy <grin>.  I should also mention that there is a 3rd party reader for android devices called Cool Reader that reads text and a few other filetypes,  but it is not on the Amazon Apps store and must be side loaded. If I write anything I'll talk about that too,  but google it now and you will be rewarded right away,  side loading is easy.  The main reason to sideload Cool Reader is to avoid having to convert your creations to Mobibooks,  but on the other hand, Mobibooks will let you use that great dictionary function that the Kindle reader has built in. It's always something isn't it?Getting books:Here is where Amazon really shines.  Goto the Amazon ebook store and select your favorite category (fantasy, non-fiction, science fiction, mysteries, childrens, whatever) and sort the results for \"price low to high\".  You will be able to get at least 10 to 20 free ebooks in each category each and every day,  not counting the short stories, I'm talking full length novels that normally cost money.  BE CAREFUL,  prices can change at any time and the sort isn't perfect,  there will be a few in the list of free books that cost a few dollars and you can accidently buy them if you are not careful about what you are clicking on. Still,  I have gotten over 150 free novels and accidently spent mebbe eight dollars in the past few weeks.  Keep them on Amazons cloud and download them when you are ready to read them to preserve memory.  Life is good, and cheap.Other Issues:The power switch issue:  this hasn't bothered me at all because I have a cover with a magnet in it that tells the Kindle when you have the cover closed and when you open it (see below in accessories).  I turned off the auto sleep function and use closing the cover to put it to sleep and opening it to wake it up.  The only reason I ever use the power switch is to shut the device down (you press and hold the power switch until a shutdown/cancel menu appears).  As a computer geek of long standing,  I think it's a good idea to do a complete shutdown now and then,  nothing like a cold iron restart to eliminate the small errors that creep into any computer that runs constantly, and yes, that includes sleep time.What Kindle still needs;  There is no speech-to-text function available for Kindle,  not that I could find or download,  and that limits the use of personal assistants like Speaktoit in the Amazon Appstore.  Note that I am meaning using the Kindle microphone to accept voice input and convert this audio into typing for an app. Think Siri for cellphones. That's kind of too bad, as it would be alot of fun and very useful,  and it's just a software addition,  not a costly hardware change.What not to worry about;  One thing I worried about before buying was whether to buy the 7\" device or wait 2 months for the larger device to be released.  For reading books it's entirely a matter of personal taste,  but there is the technical issue of screen resolution for feeding all that free Amazon Prime stuff to your TV via the mini HDMI port.  The 7\" fire is lower resolution. I decided to go with the 7 inch device as it is probably the best size for a portable eReader.  BUT, as it turns out, I found that a better solution for feeding my TV with Amazon Prime material is the Roku 2,  which is 1080p capable and eliminates tethering your Kindle to a TV set with an HDMI cable.  Think of Roku 2 as a really long bluetooth HDMI cable. I'm glad I didn't wait.Accessories:Not everyone needs a cover for their kindle,  and if you are giving one as a gift you might want to hold off on buying one as there are many styles of covers, with different advantages depending on what you want to do with it. I opted for the standard black Amazon cover Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" Standing Leather Case, Onyx Black (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\") and have been happy with it even tho it seems a bit pricey when you look at the web page picture.  BUT, it is an absolutely great fit,  the Kindle snaps into it and looks like a million bucks. The leather seems durable, and will protect the edges and corners from reasonable wear and tear. If I was still doing the road warrior thing I would buy one with more padding,  or add a memory foam sleeve to this cover.  If it never left the table by my favorite chair I wouldn't have a cover at all EXCEPT for the wakeup function some covers provide (eliminates the hard-to-find power switch issue, see above).For some things (like using the dictionary, see above) you will absolutely need a stylus (a touch screen pen).  The really cheap ones have a soft rubber bulb on the tip and work fine,  excepting that they are not very long and also tend to drag across the screen with a small amount of resistance.  Better ones have a smooth woven cover (over what I assume is the same rubber bulb) that allows them to glide very smoothly across the screen.  I got HHI Dual Purpose Capacitive Stylus Pen with Soft Nano Fabric Micro-Knit high sensitivity Technology Tip and Fine Ink Ballpoint Pen - Black (For Touch Screen tablet, Cellular Phone, The new iPad, iPad 2, iPhone 4/4s, iPod Touch, Kindle Fire and more) here at Amazon with a nice pen in it that I will never use but like having <grin>. One reviewer says the Pilot G2 Gel refills will fit,  and searching Amazon will yield a bunch of color choices.This pen and cover do well together,  I clip the pen on the outside of the cover spine and have yet to have it try and fall off.Hope all of the above helps,  I'm sure I will realize what I forgot as soon as I punch the Publish button,  but I did the best I could.

(technical support is important to me) Downloading books, games or movies is easy. The colors are crisp and vibrant. Some people said that \"ads\" bothered them, but to be honest with you, I don't get any ads while I'm reading or playing a game. There's ads when you first turn on the Kindle, but just unlock it and go to a game you were playing or to the page you left when you were reading a book. It's not a problem at all. I easily downloaded my i-tunes from my computer, and if you want some of your photos switched to your kindle, that's easy too. For me, it's the perfect size and I'm enjoying this new fangled gadget! I take it with me to appointments and it always make time fly while you're waiting. There are a lot of free books you can download as well as games. I'm glad that I invested in this HD 7\" Kindle.

Books.\"", "ReviewID": "RNS93AU7ENSRY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not sure writing a review for an item with over 2,100 current reviews will be beneficial, but why not, eh? I know that I read reviews and do my research prior to purchasing an item, so here goes...A DISCLAIMER: The review below, albeit brief, is written under the assumption that the Kindle Fire HD 7\" is _not_ a true \"tablet\" computer. It's a media consumption device and, as such, will not be compared to the Nexus or iPad. That's like comparing Apples to Oranges. To me, that makes little sense.I'm an Amazon fan. I buy books from Amazon. I buy music from Amazon. Heck, I'm even starting to view videos from Amazon -- especially as their interface is constantly improving. I've even been a Prime member for years. That being said, the Kindle Fire HD was the perfect purchase for me, and I have yet to be disappointed.Figure out exactly what you WANT the Kindle Fire FOR before making a decision. Again, it's _not_ meant to be a workhorse for doing your spreadsheets and documents. It _is_ meant to be an insanely easy way to consume your media. Especially if it's from Amazon.PROS:(1) Resolution. Screen resolution is amazing.(2) Sound. Wow. While I typically use my Fire for reading and web surfing, the few videos/movies I've watched sound great -- even without headphones. Amazon did this right.(3) Interface. While I also listed this below, kind of, under #1, the interface is easy to use and figure out. Amazon did this on purpose, surely, as they want the Fire to be as intuituve as possible for a large range of users. From those who have never used a computer to those who are geeks like me.(4) Amazon content. As I mentioned above, the Kindle Fire is meant to be a content delivery and media consumption device. Amazon wants you to spend your money with them and, honestly, why not? Most people buying a Kindle in the first place are already Amazon customers. If not, they soon will be. Again, Amazon has an extremely large library in terms of books and movies.(5) Many see this as a CON, but I disagree: The Amazon App Store. While not as big as the Google Play store, apps on the Amazon store are guaranteed safe and all go through a \"process\" to be approved. I see this as a good thing, honestly. If you want other apps, you are free to \"sideload\" them (I've done that for many; it's easy and most work as intended. You just need to know where to go what to do).(6) Silk Browser. Again, listed in both categories. Why? The stock Silk browser works well. Honestly, it's not bad. But if you're use to a more robust feature set, you will want another option.(7) Family stuff/security. I don't have kids, and I don't share my Kindle with other people. If you do, though, the parental controls on the HD look to be rather neat.(8) Fast WiFi. Enough said. You won't be disappointed.(9) Other services supported. Like Netflix. Hulu+. Etc. While Amazon wants to be your main content provider, they aren't so stingly as to shut out other services.(10) Customer Service. Amazon is known for their amazing customer service. And when it comes to the Kindle, responses are still quick and reliable.CONS:(1) Amazon is becoming proprietary much like Apple. While this isn't strictly a con -- especailly from a business sense -- it's frustrating for those of us who know the Android platform can do so much more and do not want to \"root\" our Kindle.(2) Stock touchscreen keyboard is of the ancient \"hunt/peck\" variety. Amazon really does need to get on the \"Swype-style\" bandwagon here. Imagine how much more I'd use my Kindle if I didn't have to tap out reviews, e-mails, etc.(3) No 3G availablity with 7\". Again, from a business standpoint, this makes sense. Should be an option, though. (WiFi, fortunately, is available at more places now than ever. Shouldn't be an issue for many. And you can always download movies/books prior to a trip. Especially if you get the 32GB memory.)(4) Ability to \"organize\" your books into collections. Wow. This is a basic need and is offered on the e-Ink Kindles. Somebody dropped the ball on this one!(5) Silk browser. No. Not so good. Not so bad, either. If you use the Internet a lot, you'll want something else.(6) No \"wall charger.\" The Kindle comes with a USB charger. Period. If you want the wall charger, you pay $10 extra IF you get it when you buy your Kindle. I did NOT, so I'd have to shell out $20. (I did ask Amazon customer service if I could get it for the $10 price but never received a resopnse. This is the ONLY time I've never received an immediate reply from their customer service department. Probably because it was a silly question and wasn't worth answering. It was my fault, after all!).", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Helpful info - Why I bought the KFHD", "Author": "J Coops", "ReviewID": "R2QUU2195UWCPM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those of you considering buying the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, here is some important information that I think will be helpful.  There are enough reviews talking about the hardware specs, so I won't cover that here.PRIME - the KFHD comes with one free month of prime membership.  If you aren't planning on using Amazon Prime after that one month, I would get a different tablet.  The direct link to streaming so many instant videos is one of the main reasons I got this tablet. (Price = $79/year + tax)ADS - the drama around the \"Special Offers\" was way overdone.  I ONLY see ads on my lock screen, which only shows when I first turn it on. In the first few weeks of owning my KFHD, I specifically remember receiving a free $5 credit for the amazon mp3 store, a free $5 credit for the amazon instant video store, and a deal to buy any album from the amazon mp3 store under $10 for $3.  Point being - I could have spent that money to remove the ads, but instead I now own 2 cd's and rented a movie I'd wanted to watch for a while.CHARGER - IF (big IF - you can use almost any wall-usb plug to charge the KFHD) you need a wall-USB charger, one option is to ORDER the following charger WITH the KFHD to get a $10 credit on the charger (full price $20) Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging (not included with device, for use with the new Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD models).  Additional price to KFHD purchase = $10 (comes with a $3 Amazon mp3 credit).Personally, I bought an accessories bundle for $30 that came with all I will need - cases/chargers/screen protector/cables, etc.  DigitalsOnDemand \u00ae 14-Item Accessory Bundle for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB 32 GB (Does not fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and older model Kindle Fire)LAGGINESS - there is often a sense I have of the tablet moving slowly, whether it's when I'm selecting something from the carousel or browsing around the different stores (video, mp3, libraries, etc.), it tends to just hang.  Sometimes this makes me hit buttons I didn't want to because I can't tell if my first tap registered or not. The wifi works fast and content isn't affected, but the device itself does tend to just \"hang\" for a couple seconds.  Having previously owned a Droid and currently an iPhone, I'm not used to having to wait for things to open! How big of a problem is this - minimal, but minor frustrations affect different types of people in different ways! This is my basis for 4-stars vs. 5-stars.CONCLUSION - WHY I BOUGHT ITI decided to buy the KFHD for the video streaming, e-book reading, and overall experience that Amazon is known for.  The tech specs are more than up-to-par and the screen looks fantastic.  Sure, there are better tablets out there, but in my opinion this tablet is not meant to be compared directly with the iPad, its purpose is to provide a direct link to everything Amazon offers.  Since I bought the KFHD, I have definitely become more active in using Amazon for purchases than before, and have made my way through 2 seasons of a tv show I'd been wanting to watch (included with Prime membership).  Amazon's plan to offer the entire Amazon experience through a well-priced, well-made, user-friendly tablet worked for me.

I REALLY want Google Play on my Kindle Fire....So far the device has not \"crashed\" with all my activity - just makes the experience even better!(My only gripe with my Cloud - (this has nothing to do with the Kindle Fire) When I uploaded \"explicit\" content the upgrade replaced my \"explicit\" files with \"edited\" files - not good! (Xzibit and Ice Cube and DJ Quik do not sound good \"bleeped\") Also I am very ANAL about album covers - so when the wrong covers are added to an album that drives me BATTY!

My main reason for buying the Kindle Fire HD was for an entertainment device. I have two trips to Europe coming up in the next six months and from my home in California those are 10-12 hour flights. And I don't sleep on a plane. And many times, too many times, the airline \"entertainment\" center built into the seat backs don't work or work poorly.My requirements for the Kindle Fire were pretty basic, I wanted to be able to watch movies and listen to music on a plane where Wi-fi is not available. I also wanted to be able to do some basic web-surfing and check my e-mail when Wi-fi is available. And, being a Kindle, I wanted to use it as a book reader. I'm happy to say it does everything I wanted it to. The graphics and the sound are both outstanding. The screen is a little small but not really that bad. I've watched one long movie on the device already and the screen size was not a problem for me.Anyway, I've had the device for about a week now. I've been able to load some of my own movies from DVD onto the Kindle, I've loaded some music, and I've purchased a few books. I've used it to check my web-based e-mail, and even bid on an eBay item (which I didn't win). I leave tomorrow for the east coast to visit some relatives and I've even been able to load some videos and photographs from last year's trip to Germany onto the Kindle Fire so I can show them to my relatives.The downsides? I guess the biggest one is the lack of any documentation on how to use the tablet. There is some built in documentation but I've found it lacking so there has been a lot of trial and error. However if you have any computer skills at all it should be easy for you to figure out. And I'm sure that people who have had Android phones or other tablets will pick it up immediately. So, all in all, I'm happy with my purchase and I'd recommend the Kindle Fire HD.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is Great!", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R1XG30JA6GEKZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HD, it's quite the tablet, you know, for being made \"not\" as a competitor to the iPad 3. I'll just start off by saying that there are four types of Kindle Fires now; The Original fire, The Kindle Fire HD with a 7\" screen, The Kindle Fire HD with a 8.9\" Screen, and The Kindle Fire HD with a 8.9\" screen and 4g LTE Wireless. I have the Fire HD with a 7\" screen. It has exceeded any expectation for everything except apps. Now I did get my kindle for school and for my textbooks, and books in general, but having some fun at home is not bad thing. The Fire is on the Android App store (also known as Google Play) but it requires specially made apps because most apps are made for smaller screened Android Phones.  So you have to do some digging to find some good apps. Also, a lot of the good apps cost money, and well most of the apps cost money, but if you don't mind spending a few dollars here and there, you should be fine. Now apps like Skype, or Facebook, and most other social apps are made for the Kindle, so that was a sigh of relief. Besides the apps that can't be removed and are already on the kindle when you open it up, Skype is on there. So I was already messaging my friends within the first five minutes of booting it up. The Carousel, or the \"Home Page\" is decent, some people think that it's too sleek and does not work well, but I don't mind it. If you have Amazon prime and you want a tablet, Kindle is the way to go. I say this because with Prime, you can get free movies and free books. Not all movies and books are for free, but they have a pretty good selection of Movies and Books.  The book borrowing is basically a library, but you can only get one book per 2 weeks or so. This is good if you're not the fastest reader, but you enjoy reading. Now with the Fire HD, Amazon added better sound quality, a microphone, and a camera. In the Original Fire, the sound was just awful, or so I've read, so Amazon upgraded and added Dolby sound, which is amazing. The microphone is pretty good, I haven't used it all that much, but it's good from when I've used it. The camera, with the kindle, there is no camera app, you have to get one, usually free on the app store. Another down side is it only has one camera, and that's right next to the screen so it faces you, which prevents things like bar code scanning, forgetting your camera pictures, and it's probably my least favorite part. But all in all, if you don't mind less apps, or  some camera annoyances, the Kindle Fire HD is a great product.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Must Have for Amazon Junkies", "Author": "strangerwithcandy", "ReviewID": "R3CB2EK5H8YWEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ability to stream movies and music as well as play games, check your email, surf the web, or read a book is an absolutely great thing to have in the palm of your hands.As an original Kindle Fire owner, I was most excited about the HD display in this model and it doesn't disappoint!  Movie images, as well as the carousel icons and e-book reading app are crisp and the colors vibrant.  The sound is also great on this model, much better than the original or any other tablet I've heard for that matter.  It is loud and clear.  There is not much bass feedback, but what they were able to do with such small speakers is pretty incredible.  I usually use a decent pair of ear buds when I want to hear all of the bass so that pretty much negates that concern.I love that there is now volume buttons on the device itself which saves you from having to open the settings menu to adjust it.  However, the buttons themselves, along with the power button, sit pretty flush with the outside and are hard to find with touch alone.  I often find myself pushing on the speaker grooves along the perimeter, mistaking them for the buttons.The touch screen on the Fire HD is MUCH more responsive than the original and typing on the keyboard is not such a pain anymore.  I have not noticed much of a reduction on glare in high light sources which is mentioned in the descriptions.  If there is any, it is minimal.  Still not something you're going to reach for when heading to the beach.The model is significantly less bulky and lighter than the original but I still found it awkward to hold in one hand.  And if you are going to watch a lot of video then some kind of stand is a must.  And again, consider a decent pair of ear buds if bass is important to you or just so you don't annoy the person sitting next to you on the plane.All in all I think everything runs a lot smoother on the new Fire, but there are a few annoying force closes, mostly while using the e-book reader.  If you lock the screen while reading a book, when you go back the screen will quit responding until the reader force closes.  This is a bit absurd as this was the Kindle's original purpose and hopefully it is sorted on it in a future update.As far as apps go, I have noticed that some of the apps that ran on the original Fire won't run on the Fire HD.  I'm not sure if it's a resolution thing or what, but it was a little annoying to find out when I went to re-download them on my new device.  We do finally have a dedicated Facebook app, but still inexplicably, no YouTube app.  Netflix and Hulu Plus are both available as is Pandora.  But the Amazon app store is still lacking while compared to the Google Play store.  I really wish they would just open it up so we could shop the Play store.  I really can't imagine it eating away that much of Amazon's business.Also, for some unknown reason, the Kindle Fire does not ship with a charger.  It comes with an USB cord and can only be charged while connected to a computer.  This is not really mentioned in the product description.  You can use the original's charger if that's all you have but be prepared to let it charge for about 10 hours as the battery life of the HD model is considerably larger.  Otherwise, you can buy a rapid charger from Amazon for 10 dollars at the time of purchasing the Fire HD.  If you don't purchase it while purchasing the Kindle, the price goes up to 20.  I think this is kind of a cheap tactic on Amazon's part and they should just include the charger with the product.There have been concerns about he inclusion of offers on the lock screen and recommendations on the carousel.  I did not find these in the least bit intrusive.  In fact some of the offers on the lock screen are quite good.  Chances are, if you buy a Kindle, you are already a frequent Amazon shopper anyway.  And if they really bother you that much, there is a way to opt out of them for 15 dollars.  But I can't imagine wanting to.The Kindle Fire is a great buy if you are already a frequent Amazon buyer, Prime member, or just looking for a cheap tablet with a lot of bang of your buck.

I had delayed purchasing an ipad because I felt that spending $500 on a tablet that I would primarily use for reading the news, books, magazines, and browsing the internet, seemed like too much to spend. I'm already a huge Amazon shopper, used to have the original Kindle, and am a heavy user of the Kindle app on my iphone.  So purchasing the Kindle HD seemed like a no brainer and I am extremely happy with my choice. I ordered the power charger, case and screen protector when I placed my original order, so I didn't have any big issue with the lack of a charger being included with the unit. I had planned on paying the $15 to get rid of the ads, but once I got the unit, I realized they were not bothersome at all, and in fact, I have already taken advantage of a couple of the deals for discounts on books, music and videos, all things I currently buy regularly anyway. I love everything about my Kindle! The size is perfect! I originally was going to purchase the larger Kindle HD, but didn't want to wait. I'm glad I bought the 7\". I like the size much better than my daughter's ipad. It fits easily into my fairly small purse to take with me on shopping trips or appointments, yet it's big enough to enjoy watching movies. The HD screen is amazing! I am a Prime Member and watch TV shows and movies from Amazon and Netflix and the sound/picture/size is perfect for me!  It's my favorite way to read the news.....and I love reading books, and especially magazines on the Kindle. The pictures and graphics look gorgeous! Apps are much more limited on the Kindle HD which I'm sure will improve with time, which might be a deal breaker for my teenagers, but not for me. They have every app I would be interested in, including my favorite basic games, cooking apps (Big Oven and AllRecipes), a notes app, news channels, SKYPE and Netflix.In any case, the unit has the perfect functionality at the perfect price point for me. $199 plus $10 for the power charger, given how much use I get out of this Kindle, is a great value! I have no need or desire to purchase an ipad now. I do not need the additional functionality, so the additional cost would be wasted money that I can spend on purchasing the books, music, magazines and videos I would use on either tablet. Admittedly, I was already a faithful Amazon marketplace customer, which makes this tablet even more attractive to me, but anyone purchasing a tablet needs to really decide what functionality they will truly need/use. If they are like me, and will use it primarily for entertainment and browsing the internet, the Kindle HD is an amazing value!", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD worth it", "Author": "William L. Lipton Jr. \"Bill Lipton\"", "ReviewID": "R34OJTKSY4KJA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, to see if a Tablet was worth it, I bought a discounted Pandigital (out of box, it handles PDF but not Mobi book formats).  Liked it enough to take advantage of the pre-order opportunity for Kindle fire HD.  I write, and currently have three books on Kindle (plus global outlets), so getting a Kindle made sense.First thing you'll notice is the packaging.  I also ordered the wall-charger and the custom case; everything came in one box.  Individually, the packaging is rugged and well designed -- with everything protected, but easily removed.  The kindle dropped into the custom leather case as snug as you could want.  Only problem -- no place for pens (if you don't use a pen, get the screen protector).  At every initial power on, First Screen shows \"LOCKED\" and padlock image ... just touchscreen slide it to left and you're good to go.What really sold me was the idea of being able to watch HULU & NetFlix while laying in bed, like I would read a book.  Like any computer, took some getting used to, and set-up of the type which reconfigured my nearly 70-year-old brain more than the Kindle Fire.  But, once I located the correct Mobile apps, I was blow-away.  As for the sound quality ... beats my BOSE Radio.I haven't gotten in to the Cloud Storage app yet, that will be played with later today; it will also be a while before I really play with the free month of PRIME access.  Obviously, there are a few more customizing issues, but I generally budget three of four days for setting up a new computer, so no big deal there.  The HELP screens are -- takes a bit of getting used to for pull-down windows to access Bluetooth, etc.  But the wireless connecting was virtually automatic.  Still trying to determine the value of being able to Bluetooth connect to laptop ... would be nice is I could data-transfer that way.  OH, you might want to get a HDMI adapter (though not sure what mini size Fire takes, I assumed a D).  Depending on amount of typing you do, a Bluetooth keyboard and headset might be a good addition.The image quality is fantastic: crisp, sharp, vibrant ... add your favorite superlative and it applies. I've only had it two days, so there is a lot more to learn.  Transferring data/files between laptop and Kindle is on the agenda.  The charger is \"cute\" and works with the supplied USB cable that also allows charging from computer/laptop USB port.Setting up Skype was initially a problem -- never try to do it on an unplanned incoming call -- but once I got it going I know the Kindle will free-up my computer.  I haven't figured out if I can take pictures with front camera; nor have figured out how to locate download locations (sorry, out time hands on & inside type from the breadboard days of computing, so need that 'look inside' bit).FIVE STAR ... no question about it. I'm sure there are 'negatives' and somebody will post them, but, so far, the only negative is my learning curve.  Once I find something the first time, I am discovering just how intuitive the layout really is.  As of now, the biggest problem is that the case has no place to store for a touch-pen ... they could have added a holder between Fire and lid -- something a standard touch-pen would clip in to and be locked in when lid is closed.  When lid closes, the Fire goes to sleep. For those who are concerned with unauthorized access, there are passwords & security & \"parental control\" settings available, but I don't use them.

(as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'll be answering questions in the comments all weekend. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.============The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE. The cover from my wife's Gen 1 Kindle will fit the Gen 2 kindle (sorta) but NOT THE HD.THE SCREEN:- FIRE HD SUMMED UP IN TWO WORDS Oh. My. The Le Pan, the iPads and the Gen 2 Fire all have great screens. The Fire HD takes them all out. I read somewhere there was polarizing a filter over the Fire HD screen. Polarizers reduce glare by only letting 'straight' light though not off angle bounced light. This makes an enormous difference to this display. The off angle viewing is probably the best I have seen in any flat screen. 6 stars.- FIRE GEN 2 Still a high quality screen. I'd same the same or better than any other high end tablet on the market.- NOTE A few people in the comments asked about the touch response. I don't have a problem with either. Both worked very well.THE WIFI.- FIRE HD I admit only the geeky probably care but the wifi rocks. I have this mimo router and one quick copy from my server and I was getting almost 30MB/s. To put that into perspective, that's about as fast and an external USB Hard drive can push data to your computer. (USB 3.0 will be faster but they are rare today) -- The other thing is that I have a long skinny house and when I'm in the back bath, the Le Pan drops off. (ahem not that I surf on the potty or anything, just when I test it, you know.) With the Fire HD I can surf in the back yard.- FIRE GEN 2 still got 20MB/sec. But consider this. At that speed you can fill the entire memory in 5 minutes. Seems good enough to me.THE SOUND:- FIRE HD ok I'm a bit of an audio snob. The sound is fantastic for being a tablet. Which is to say it's still only marginally acceptable. You can still buy a $15 pair of Koss KSC75 headphones and blow the speakers away BUT I will say this is the first device I would actually listen to music on. The rest I simply don't even bother. I suspect most people would call the sound excellent.- FIRE GEN 2 still have a very good sound. For the spoken word it would be very fine. For music it is lacking in my book.SPEED: Both are quick with the HD being quicker. The Le Pan II is no slouch but I think the HD edges it out. Since the Le Pan apparent died this morning it's hard to compare. :-(NOTE: IT DOES NOT COME WITH A WALL WORT CHARGER It comes with a micro USB cable that can be used with your existing USB wall worts. (ie your cell phone charger) You can buy a rapid charger for it or even plug it into your computer to charge. This is an odd choice from Amazon IMO.NEW FEATURES (as promised)EXCHANGE CALENDAR SYNC:BOTH - Exchange on the Fire (both) just rocks. I really like the calendar app. The contact manager can't keep up with the one on the iPad but it is sufficient. Ditto the email. But the setup was easy and it seemed fast. Love it.SKYPE:- FIRE HD Spent way too long video skyping today. It worked as well as skype ever works. (long time skype users will understand that) yes it was glitchy but less than other platforms so no complaints. The sound really made a difference here.- Fire GEN 2 I don't think Skype came in it. I'll update with a definitive later.HDMI- FIRE HD ONLY I promised someone in the comments to test this soon but I misplaced my HDMI cable. (drat) will find it this weekend and test. Watch this space.BLUETOOTH- FIRE HD ONLY worked very smoothly pairing with LG tone. (great product btw) I'll be using that for Skype in the future.FREETIME: BOTH This is a widely requested feature that allows multiple users (i.e. kids) to log in and have their own customized tablet experience. It also allows parents to limit the time kids spend on certain tasks, like watching movies, while giving them unlimited time to read. Parents have been asking for this forever. (Are you listening Apple?) Early reports on this are good but I'll have more on this in a few hours too.CLOSING THOUGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:If you're new to Kindle make sure you understand what you are buying here. Kindles are made -and sold at a highly discounted price- to allow you to purchase media from Amazon. Don't think of this as an android tablet, because it really isn't. Yes Amazon uses the Android operating system but you'd never know they hide it so well. This device is made (basically) exclusively to read/watch/listen to media you buy from Amazon. In that regard this device is about as fantastic as they could make it. HOWEVER. The Kindle Fire (first generation) was notorious for not playing well with many Android apps. If you're a app monster or looking for something to replace your laptop to allow you do work on the road and occasionally consume media, you need to look at an Android tablet or an iPad. But don't let that discourage you:Via Amazon Prime, you get 25,000 streaming movies and T.V. shows you can watch 24/7 unlimited. We dropped Netflix because Prime Instant Video was so good. Amazon gives you a free month with the either Fire so you'll get to see the value before you buy. (it's a no brainer btw) There are also over a million free books available for the Kindle. I try to limit how many I buy/download but I have over 100 books on my previous Kindle that are waiting to be read, all but like 4 of them were free. Also if you own a Kindle and subscribe to Prime, you can borrow one book per month from the Paid section. And big name books too... all 7 Harry Potter books are up there. If you figure that is worth at least 10 bucks a month, you're getting $120 of content per year and Prime only costs (I think) $79. Or looked at another way, that's $240 in content in two years and the Fire HD is only $199.If you're new to e-readers, owning one might just change your life. I had probably read 8 book length books in the last decade. (I'm a periodical junkie.) I now read at least one book per week. I was a big reader before but I'm reading more than I ever have in my life. Many studies show that people are reading as much as 3X more when they get an e-reader. If you're a parent looking to inspire a love of reading in a child, STOP. DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200. Buy them an e-reader.SO THE BIG QUESTION, WHICH ONE DO I BUY?- If you're on a VERY tight budget the Fire Gen 2 is a great product at a great price point. Coupled with Prime, you have access to mountains of cheap content.HOWEVER. When you look at what you get for the small difference in cost, the Fire HD blows it away... You get a better screen, better sound, bluetooth, it's faster, thinner and lighter than the Fire. You also get double the memory, better wifi and over 2 hours more battery life. All for $40. I guess Amazon wants to make color Kindles as affordable as possible but I don't even know why they made the small one. I'm not sorry I bought it but all things considered, I would buy two big ones if I had it to do over.As I said above, I'll be updating this and taking questions in the comments all weekend.Hope this was helpful.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great media device", "Author": "K. Moulder \"Bobmo5\"", "ReviewID": "R2D1OUKARC7YQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Fire HD 7 July 2013 for $159. That is the current special price that is available from Amazon and many other sources. If you think of this device as a media source then it exceeds expectations. Other reviewers have done a great job of extolling the great features of the Fire HD, my goal is to deal with negative issues raised by others. I own both a laptop and a desktop computers. I wasn't trying to acquire another full feature computer when I bought the Fire HD. Those people who complain about this device having computing limitations have unrealistic expectations. You don't get a full feature computer for $159. This device delivers great movies and eBooks. I bought a Fintie package for less then $13.00 (it included a magnetic cover, stylus, 12 volt charger, screen protector, and a cable). My cover turns on and off my Kindle (I don't use the built in switch). I control my volume level by using the on screen control (I never use the built in control). This eliminates two of complaints that others have voiced about the Kindle design. I downloaded about six apps to my Kindle (I am not trying to make it into an Ipad). I downloaded a free copy of Edward Jones Kindle manual. It is a great resource to read.I utilize my local library's \"Borrow Kindle Books Program\" which is tied to Amazon. This an amazing free source for eBooks. This program is available from over 11,000 public libraries. I own a Kindle 3, a Fire HD 7, and my wife a Kindle Fire. Each is a great device in it's class. Those who complain about the weight of this device have to realize that glass and the batteries make up most of this weight. If you reduce the battery weight you give up battery time.About the Amazon pricing of this device: I don't care about the wallpaper ads when I turn it on (I saved $15), I didn't need another USB charger (I have five including a 15 watt device), if you were buying your charger from Amazon why do you expect them to include another cable?, I like having control over how I bundle my purchases. Having redundant items included in my purchases forces me to waste my money. I think reviewers need to focus on a device's capabilities and not their expectations. Did the device deliver on the items promoted in the ad?Since I was not an early purchaser of my Fire HD hence the firmware updates may have contributed to the current status of an exceptional media device. Those who think the Nook is an alternative need to realize that Nook support is being discontinued.I have watched 10 free movies and read 15 books since I acquired my Kindle. I have satisfactorily used the Email, weather apps, sports updates, and borrowed books through my library program. I am not pleased that I cannot return eBooks through the Kindle (feature does not exist per Amazon support). I have to use my computer to return my eBooks.

Kindle Fire HD vs Kindle Touch", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "R3OKBW29JNCCGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With nearly 14,000 reviews, I'm pretty sure everyone knows the Kindle family is great to use, and great value for money. What I'd like to do is write a little comparing the 2 devices I have used- the Kindle Touch, and Kindle Fire HD.Around July last year, I bought a Kindle touch and my life was changed. I read a lot, and had literally boxes and boxes of books. Suddenly, finding storage space was not an issue, nor was waiting time for delivery. I saved time and money. Kindle touch became my new best friendBut with all good things come bad things. At the beginning of this year, the Touch developed vertical lines on the screen. Started with just one, but after 3 months, they became 1.5cm wide and I couldn't see the words. At the same time, I realised I needed something bigger than my mobile for doing some things like surfing the web and reading documents. In the end I decided to buy the Fire HD, despite the huge drop in battery time- one of the Touch's big pluses.So what have I noticed? I'm mostly happier with the Fire than Touch, but it's not all roses. - Weight: The Fire HD is really quite heavy compared to the touch, which meakes more cumbersome to carry and to put in your pocket. - Features: The Fire blows the Touch out of the water. Bright colour screen with great audio. Books can be listed by full colour covers, instead of just lists, as can all your videos, documents, music. - Connectivity: Related to Features, Fire HD loses to the version of Touch I had. Fire has only Wifi, while my Touch had Wifi and 3 G. This matters, because I don't have Wifi everywhere in my region, and when I travel I can only access Wifi from my hotel, if my hotel has Wifi. This means I can't surf the web, check emails or use many apps on the Fire except at home, where I have a wireless router set up. In contrast, I could use my Touch anywhere, and I mean anywhere. One time I was in the hills of Hong Kong and despite a very weak mobile phone signal, still managed to download a book via 3G. Now that's fantastic! - Useability: Once you have the stuff you want on the Fire, it is far and away better than the Touch. It is faster, more attractive, swishier. You can see the files when you plug it to your computer, flipping through pages in ebooks is instant, rather than 1-2 second pause with the Touch, and you can read ebooks in less than ideal light because it's a backlit screen, unlike the Touch. Of course the Touch doesn't play videos or music, so I won't compare those. - Fire limitations- The Fire HD screen seems to pick up dust more easily than the Touch, and light reflects off the screen much much more than the Touch. The Touch surface seems matt, and I never had to worry about light reflection before. - Battery life: The pure ebook readers have far longer battery life than the colour screen tablets. But even then the Fire is not too bad, especially when you compare to your mobile phones. It's not like I'm on the Fire 24/7. I find in normal use- a few minutes here, half an hour there, a battery might go 2.5 days before I need to charge it again. That's ok with me.So overall I'm really happy with the Fire HD. Glad I decided to buy the Fire, and not try to get an android tablet with the Kindle app, and also glad I didn't by a Touch replacement (white paper etc). If they could shave 100grams off the next version and include 3G(4G, whichever is latest) that would make it near perfect.Thanks for reading.

At the time my budget was limited and all I wanted was a dedicated reader.  I bought it about 2 years ago and have never regretted it.

Reading is a pleasure; no more clicking to turn pages, no more clicking to go to the file where my book is stored, no more clicking to organize my books.  I like the carousel type storage, and the touch screen moves easily.  The sound is amazing.  I listen to music on Pandora, news on the internet, movies, etc. and the sound is SO much bigger than the device.  Picture quality is great when watching movies and videos.  Games are great, lots of inexpensive or free apps.My husband had decided to buy a tablet instead of a KF HD, but after I'd had mine a week he had to have one, too.  He loves his as well.

Although I have not compared it with the other KFs, I read that the sound quality alone was worth the purchase and I believe it.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 Months with My Kindle Fire HD", "Author": "William Verbjar", "ReviewID": "R3L3O5CKBHW1AG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my 7\" Kindle Fire HD 32GB on for Christmas 2012. It is my wife's and my first tablet. We did a lot of research before we made our choice. I personally was interested at the Ipad Mini, but the price ended that. I got to play with Kindle Fire HD at my mother in laws house, and quickly realized that this tablet has eveything I need/want.For my wife and I:  * All the webpages I visit on a regular basis are easily accessed, with a quick touch screen interface. Typing  on the touch keyboard is a breeze, especially swype...which I love.  * We easily uploaded the majority of our music to the cloud, and the  Fire HD's speakers  sound better than any other tablets. We listen to music quite a bit, so if you are doing some chores, its nice to take it with you.  * Movies and pictures look GREAT on the screen. Very bright and crisp.  * The battery life is very good.  * It has all the apps we need, and they all work great. Facebook is user friendly and responsive, as is Twitter. Our games we love to play ( Dice with Buddies, The Dark Knight Rises, ect) are there and play well and look good.  * Books and magazines look great and respond very well.  * The content on Amazon Prime is amazing. Especially for kids and book lovers. The free movie and television show list seems endless. Loved our free trial, and we will be subscribing soon  * Skype works great.For my kids:  * With the proper case, the Fire HD easily mounts to the back of the front seat of our cars. We do this for our long trips we have to take (3 hrs) to visit our family and friends. This is the main reason I went with the 32GB model. My kids enjoy watching a movie or two on the way.  * There are some great learning apps available. My son has gotten quite good at one app that has him identify animals and letters.  * We bought a HDMI cable off of Amazon to connect the Fire HD to our tv at home. I found it on Amazon's store on my Fire HD. Buying it was simple, and it works great. The kids love being able to watch their shows wherever they go.  There are a few things that I have found that I would have liked. The big one is a rear facing camera. This should have been a no brainer. If you have a front facing camera , why wouldn't you have a rear facing one? I understand the need to keep costs down...but this would have been nice. Not a deal breaker, because I have my cell phone's camera, but there are times with my 7 month old daughter that I would love to capture, and sometimes the Fire HD is all that's handy.  Another complaint is when I am exploring the Amazon music store. Whenever you are browsing a list of albums or songs and you click on one to hear a sample or see track listings, when you hit \"back\", it takes you all the way back to the top of the list. Now I have to scroll down again to see where i left off. This becomes annoying after about 3 times, especially when there is an album sale and there are 50+ albums to browse.  The power button is odd. There are no ridges on it. The volume buttons have ridges. I used to turn the tablet on its side and rotate it a time or two in order to find the power button. It blends right in with the side of the tablet. That being said, the case I bought helps identify where it is.  In closing, I would like to say that the Kindle Fire HD is a great tablet for entertainment and web browsing. I believe that is what it is meant for. I can't see myself doing any major business transactions on it. My family and I use it as a device to add a little fun and convenience into our lives. There is nothing better than find a great new recipe and taking the Fire HD over to the counter and using its case to make it stand. It sure beats walking back and forth to the laptop. Plus it takes up such little space. This is just one example of the great ways to use the Kindle Fire HD.

I could not decide which Kindle to purchase, which is what they wanted me to buy with the card. I read reviews on the paperwhite, the 7\" fire, the keyboard Kindle. My main purpose was to read; one reviewer on the fire hd said this had the best screen for reading due to the antiglare screen. That's what finally made up my mind. I did, based on his review, expect the screen to be matt, but it does have some glare & reflection. I have ordered a matt screen protector to further help the antiglare feature. Still, even with some shine, I have absolutely loved this product. Didn't think about it at the time of purchase, but the ability to download files from my pc will be a surprise bonus for me. I make jewelry using art clay silver, and I can access my photos and tutorials on my Kindle! Much easier than setting up the laptop which takes up too much room on my table with all my jewelry tools. Another bonus; you can expand the photos by spreading your fingers and I can see minute detail as I am making my jewelry. EVERY ARTIST WHO USES REFERENCE PHOTOS SHOULD BUY THIS KINDLE! I bought the Belkin cover, $29 over the cheaper leather cover due to the features of being able to stand the Kindle up. This will be perfect.The photos are stunning on the Kindle fire hd! Much more detail & sharpness than my pc. The colors are beautiful, important to an artist. I was a little worried that the screen wouldn't be large enough for me, being a baby boomer and using bifocals, but it is perfect for me. The font is adjustable anyway, but I use the default font comfortably. If the white screen is too white for you, it has a soft cream colored screen, and for those who like a black background and white lettering, that's the 3rd choice. In the settings you can select different times for an auto shut down, I set mine on 45 minutes. Also the tutorial said that the Kindle might not charge while it is on, but with the power charger(separate purchase) and the USB cable, I can use it plugged in, and then when I leave the house, I can leave with a fully charged Kindle. Yes the larger Kindle screen would be nice, but I didn't want the larger device to lug around. My purse is full enough lol! And I want to carry my Kindle with me :) I could replace my teddy bear and sleep with my Kindle I love it so much (just kidding-but I could read in bed with it).  I like being able to surf the web when I have wireless available, bigger screen than the cell phone, even though that was not a factor in choosing this device. I am not sure if you could piggyback on a cell phone to get a roaming connection to the web, but that's not what I bought it for; I have a cell that I can access the web anywhere if I need to. That's what I didn't want to do, duplicate services I already own on another device. The tutorial on the Kindle is great, even for me (a little technically challenged) it is easy to use. I like that you can download to the cloud, and access there instead of filling up the storage on the Kindle. I had no trouble at all following the instructions for using the cloud, downloading files to the Kindle, buying books & apps. The free library is wonderful, and it's easy to dump a book if you don't like it. You can completely remove any book from the device easily. They recommend that you remove unwanted files to keep storage room. I have several books and a couple of apps, all my photo files, and I've only used about 2% of my storage. This is very user friendly, thanks Amazon, seems like you've thought of nearly everything. If you are having a hard time deciding which Kindle, figure out your priority use of it, and go from there. I'm very very happy about my choice, it meets my needs perfectly, is lightweight and very portable. I'm glad I took a month to decide which Kindle to purchase. Thanks kids, one of the best gifts you've ever given me, next to you!", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!  vs. Samsung Galaxy the Kindle Fire HD won!", "Author": "New mom \"N. Jane\"", "ReviewID": "R3MI5P1TF2PW1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not one to typically write reviews but since I spent a long time researching the right tablet for our family I thought I'd give my opinion.  First, the main use for our tablet was for the kids to play apps (fun and educational) and watch movies/shows.  I wanted to be able to download movies/shows so they could watch them on the plane or if we didn't have wifi access  I also plan to use it for books for them and me.  I have other Apple products but didn't want to spend the money on something that the kids would primarily be using.  With that said I narrowed my purchase down to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and the Kindle Fire HD.  I actually bought both and tried both for a few days.  I read many reviews and most said to go with the Galaxy.  BUT, in the end I liked the Kindle Fire HD much better and here were my reasons:1.  I thought the screen quality was better on the Kindle Fire HD (it is amazing!!!).2.  The screen size was a little wider.3.  The interface was much more user friendly.4.  I'm a big Amazon Shopper and it just made more sense to go with the Kindle plus I plan to keep the Prime Membership up after the trial.  Like that you can borrow a book a month, get free streaming of tons of shows and movies, free 2 day shipping), lots of free books.5.  Supposedly there are many less Amazon apps than on Google Play but this has not been an issue with us at all.  All the apps we want are available on the Amazon store.6.  The big seller for me was the 16 gb internal memory versus 8 gb for the Galaxy.  Also, in reality the Galaxy only has 4 gb internal memory because half it taken up already by the operating system and other stuff that is loaded that you can't delete.  I do understand that there is the option to get an external SD card and in fact I have one but, FIRST, you can't store any apps on it only photos and movies, SECOND, it is a royal pain to transfer stuff to the extSD Card (you have to plug the tablet into the computer, transfer the files onto the computer and then put them back onto the tablet into the extSD card section.  Weird!)7.  So, even though the Kindle Fire HD with 16 gb is really only about 13 gb I like the fact that it has almost 3 times more internal memory8.  You can easily put itunes songs onto the Kindle by plugging it into the computer (have to get a free software called Android File Transfer- prompts you to download when you plug tablet into PC/Mac) and you just find your songs on the  harddrive (not through itunes) and drag to the music file on the tablet (the tablet's files come up when you plug it into the computer (and you have the Android File Transfer software downloaded).9.  To me it seemed of higher quality build.10.  I have family members with the Kindle so we can share some books (not as many as we hoped but still a neat feature).So, these are my 2 cents for what it's worth.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "nzmarnz", "ReviewID": "R1BUN7TBYSKEIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this kindle for my mum who's 69 years old.

I love this tablet. It is the first touch device I have ever owned and I must say it is wonderful. The touch screen is responsive in just the right way. The colors are brilliant. Watching HD movies through my Prime account looks awesome. And the sound! Wow is all I can say. When you hold the device in landscape position, it is as if the sound surrounds you. Combine that with the brilliant video quality and it is a truly immersive experience. I have found the storage to be ample thus far. I have downloaded quite a few game apps, along with a few others. I also have about 30 books and an album and still have over 11GB of free space. And speaking of books, reading on this device is a pleasure. In the past I haven't typically enjoyed reading on a screen, but being able to adjust the brightness, and putting the screen in sepia format makes it a pleasant experience. I have also only paid for one book. Amazon has so many free books available. If you have Amazon Prime, this device was made for you. With the Prime HD movies, and the lending library you can't go wrong. The device is a little heavy to hold for a long period of time when reading, but that is easy to remedy. I suggest you get the quick charger. It takes just a couple of hours to charge, versus multiple hours through the USB port on a computer. The battery lasts a long time.

With the new Kindle line, and price structure, I started looking into them. The basic Kindle 2 was my original focus, but the Kindle Fire 2, while twice the price, was color, and so much more than just an e-reader. And then for just a little bit more, there was the HD, that had lots more then just the HD, for the price difference. I'm 'frugal', so neither of these price  steps was taken lightly. I took a lot of time reading the specs and many reviews. The decision was made based on knowledge, not just an urge to own the latest, greatest. It was a rare personal splurge.Once I decided I could justify the expense for something that did all this model could, I then started looking at the competition.  It seems that the Google Nexus 7 was the alternative, and I essentially came to the same conclusion that many reviewers did: They are both great items, with great value. The right one for you depends on your intended use. If it is to be used primarily for work/business, the nod goes to the Google Nexus 7, because Amazon seems to have hobbled some functions to make the Kindle more Amazon-centric. I, on the other hand was looking more for something that had an entertainment focus: the HD screen regularly gets rave reviews from friends, the speaker system is impressive, even when the volume is turned up, and the HDMI output is something that most don't have, and which allows me to show movies on the family HD TV. While I was able to do this with my Motorola Droid 3 phone, it is so much easier with the Fire HD.Video is a big component of such an entertainment device, and after a month's free trial, I have decided to sign up for Amazon's Prime service. In addition to a delivery rate break of future Amazon purchases, this provides access to hundreds of free videos in a variety of categories. The list isn't as extensive as, say, Netflix, but instead of $8-9 per month, the cost is $80 per year.And books, the original motivator for this purchase, are in great supply. With the ease of publishing on the web, in addition to the classics, you'll find many new authors here. Also, unless you must have the current NY Times bestsellers, with very little effort, you should easily be able to find a huge selection of free e-books.As to a couple of the negatives that have been brought up: The lack of a plug end on the USB/mini USB cable was not an issue for me because I just use the one that I use for my Droid phone. I can understand Amazon not including it to save on costs, but the purchase price for one if you do need it, is a bit extreme. And the Ads, that you can make go away for an extra $15 are a bit of an affront, given a device you bought is trying to sell you things, but they are not intrusive. When the unit is shut off, the screen is blank. When you turn it on (instant on), you see an add for a car, or laptop, etc. Swipe your finger to the right and you see more about the product. Swipe your finger to the left, and you an punch in your security code to start using the tablet. Assuming these ads helped keep the cost of the Kindle down, I think the trade is fair.As a 'give' to it's supporters, Amazon might want to consider automatic removal of the ads, a year after the item was purchased. Surely the ads would have paid for themselves after a year, and I'm sure this would address some of the animosity felt toward the ads.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't change it for nothing else", "Author": "DMurphy \"DeeDee\"", "ReviewID": "R237QDFK0SR0N3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love my Kindle Fire HD with offers.

My own experience with these up until now has been to look at them while other people are using them - so frustrating but it just piqued my curiosity all the same while giving me a preview of how they can be used in any public setting...What I figured out is if people can't keep their hands off it must be something really useful. But I digress and so much of the time I spend I found them in the suburbs, urban settings all kind of places usually medical offices and such, and the airports. Major airports. I think the kindle is great, great idea put to work here, and this is what I love about it -* It starts up right away* It is easily connected to the wifi after setting it up.* There is no glare so we can have less strain on the eyes as well as use it in any light source.* It works well with the movies in the Amazon Prime.* My charger works fine.There is nothing I can think of right now as a negative so I just don't think I will add anything with respect to that except - if it could be produced in different colors maybe. I know the mini laptops in general all come in different colors just an idea. If there was a foreign language pack that may be worthwhile but I am experimenting with a whole load of things to do with the android phones and some of them do have apps for that so maybe there are apps that are available. I don't have any experience making apps since I am not an expert when it comes to computers or software by any stretch of the imagination so I can't be of any help there, so sorry. There is always time to check out apps.I never really bothered any one I found using these to ask to try it but I can imagine why they are real popular right now - this is brand new technology and the system of the device is very responsive. I found some slowness in the beginning but quickly sped up when I found out it was registered correctly or fully. I don't have any experience with anything like this other than the ones I have encountered other people using so I got an idea of how they may be addicting - but not overly so. If you can't share and item or don't want to that doesn't mean you don't want to get rid of it I have experienced this with many laptops.I do want to add that the person who is using this primarily won't be me, it is my fianc\u00e9's gift but he wanted it so much I could not ever say no. Really must be exciting. The Ipad's I have tried are really something but this takes the cake. It's so interesting and what's best of all is the sound really booms like no other laptop or other type of computer I have used. I guess it is the Dolby system. Really impressive sound/speakers on this thing. Why didn't any one offer me to use one before, I don't know, I guess I could have tried one out at Best Buy pr whoever... but this device plays youtube fine and all the new apps are running smoothly. The Silk browser is fascinating and brand new. I was so curious looking up on the google how to download a Silk browser to the smartphones but no dice the directions were all too complicated so had to forget all about that idea. But very satisfying to try it out on the device and enjoy it. If you're real curious about new technology it couldn't hurt to give it a shot... I have no idea who would give this a negative review. Unless you're used to Linux or whatever. I remember watching people using these and they really were enjoying them. Got to go but this is not my last chance to use a kindle.

If you don't have a computer I suggest that you purchase the adapter or you can buy one at Walmart for the same price of $19.99 or at a reduced amount of $9.98 when you order the KFHD. If you don't you will have to pay the full price.Also I would suggest getting the case for it. I purchased the \"Fintie\" brand Leopard case after I ordered. Can't wait for it to arrive.

Watch tons of videos weather be thru Amazon Prime (which is awesome to have!)netflix, hulu or even you tube. I enoy the skype feature when talking to my family. I dont' have to fire up by big ol' laptop for it. THe picture quality is great. Amozon has great apps ranging from photo editing to games for all ages. there book selcetion is wonderful as well. I am still learning my new kindle but so far i truely enjoy it. I enjoy being able to read without lights on so my husband can sleep considering he has to get up at 330 am every morning for work. I can watch what ever i want with as well without disturbing him. The built in speakers sound great. This thing is also very quick to go from one web page to another and not having to buffer vidios constantly as well. I have read alot of reviews of people liking the ipad much better. Now from my understanding if you have an ipad you have to have itunes and all the \"i\" product stuff as well. what I like is that fact with the kindle i can up load my music and videos without having to with out having to run them thru itunes and all that nonsense. As far as the carosul on the kindle. you have your main one that shows all your rescent stuff. and the bottom small one is just suggestions of what other customers have either bought or watched or read that was assoucitated with what ever is highlighted on the main carousel. For me it is not an issue and never gets in my way. you also have the option of downloading an app to do documents as well. this is a wonderful product that i so far am enjoying. So no offense but to all those that \"hate\" the kindle and all. appernatly you don't know how to use it. To each there own. Delivery was next day thru my prime account.

This has replaced my IPad 3.  I wanted something and smaller and the IPad mini is just too expensive for something packing hardware so outdated.  I was really nervous when I ordered it.  When I received it, I didn't even want to take out of the wrapper because I knew I was going to return it.  Good thing I did. I put them both right next to each other, testing videos and apps and webpages. It's faster than my IPad for the majority of my test.  The graphics are amazing and the picture quality is up to par next to my IPad. The speakers are a WOW.  It does everything I needed it to do and at just the perfect size. This thing is $500 cheaper than what I paid for my Ipad and does exactly that. I am a little down on app selection...I really didn't like Quick Office on my IPad and doubt I will like it here, but I guess it will have to do. Also, Its a bit \"laggy\" but it doesn't last long. I usually just have to close the app and try it again. I got a free month of Amazon Prime (thank you Amazon for that).One thing though, I know it's possible to bring my Itunes stuff into here, but I don't know how exactly. I need a very specific run through to understand the concept of how to do it.  I've been reading the discussions and the Amazon support page, but I just don't get it.All in all, I really like it.

I decided that the iPad was just too large and expensive to continue carrying around. It also did not fit in most of my purses. That is when I decided to look for a smaller tablet.I buy almost everything from Amazon. I work full time, go to school at night, and drive around 3 hours a day, so I do not have time for shopping. I fell in love with amazon because of their incredible customer service and great \"Prime\" program. That is when I decided to give the kindle touch a shot.... Around 18 months later, I cannot go a day without reading my kindle touch. I could have went with the nexxus or comparable tablets, but I decided to get the Kindle Fire HD because of Amazon. I could not be happier with my decision.pros:-size is perfect (fits in most purses and bags)-less expensive (not nearly as worried carrying it places with me)-HD quality is amazing to watch movies/tv shows on-so easy to download amazon videos onto your tablet in case you are going on a roadtrip without WiFi (then easily deletable if you want more room)-touch response is good-I like the carousel because I like the idea of not having to go through apps > videos > american horror story > episode #2... I just flick the carousel around until i see the episode I want to playcons:-Kindle Dire HD and Kindle Fire have different dimensions. Be aware when ordering accessories. I accidentally ordered the wrong screen protector and didn't realize under I completely unwrapped it (ooopsies)-(not a con for me, but might be for other people) it isn't an iPad and doesn't pretend to be one.

I wasn't using my iPad for productivity in general. My iPad was far too large for me to comfortably use as an eReader and unless I was using headphones, I didn't watch shows or movies on it due to the location of the speaker/quality of sound. After looking at the Kindle Fire HD, I decided to sell my iPad and purchase this device. I bought the 32GB version at my local Staples store. I did pay to have the special offers removed, although I did not find them that intrusive.Overall, I'm happy with my decision. Here are the devices strengths and weaknesses after one week of use:STRENGTHS- Speakers- Portability- Overall reading experience- HDMI port (THANK YOU)- Ease of purchasing media from Amazon- Kindle Free Time (SO terrific for my children)- The ability to add individual books to favorites (FANTASTIC)WEAKNESSES- App selection on Amazon isn't as good as the selection on Apple's App Store (I realize you can sideload)- No charger included (Really, Amazon?)- Carousel is only helpful when switching between apps as you can't add apps to it - I use favorites more often- Silk web browser (pleh! pleh!)- Slow loading some games- I wish I could change the settings so that when I read a book I can tap the left side of the screen and turn the page forward (similar to the turn page buttons on the eInk Kindle devices)For the most part, I can do everything I want to do on this device and it's far less expensive than the iPad Mini. I also have no complaints about transferring pictures or music to the device from my MacBook Air. If the carousel were more useful and the book navigation settings were customizable, I'd give the device 5 stars.

I once again thought I knew what I was doing, (what was I thinking again) and went  back to my account to finish the transaction. However, the money still wasn't showing on my account, so I called back paniced again.

She helped me get the money in the new account, deleted the old account, and offered to enter the rest of my gift cards for me.

I had originally ordered a Paperwhite, and cancelled my order after seeing so many negative and disappointing reviews.  On the Fire, you can adjust the brightness on the display if it's too bright in a dark room (or plane), and I really like being able to visually see the covers of the books in my library.

The same day Apple introduced the overpriced $329 16 GB iPad Mini, I clicked away from the live press event and clicked on Amazon.com to purchase the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD. Interestingly, I'm not a Microsoft or an Android OS fan, I'm actually a Macbook Pro and iPhone owner. However, I wouldn't trade either one of these tools for productivity (read apps), recreation (read iTunes) and ease of use (Apple iOS). The family already owns several iPhones, shares an iPad 3 and we regularly use 2 original Kindles. The gorgeous display of the iPad 3 (the Retina Display is the key selling point for me), is unparalleled, and is phenomenal for watching movies, but if I had to give up either the original Kindle or the iPad 3, it wouldn't be the Kindle. The iPad is too bulky as an e-reader, and not as convenient to schlep around even though its screen size and browser is better for extended websurfing. The iPhone is simply too small to do lengthy reading or websurfing. My daughter just sold her iPod Touch to buy the Kindle Fire HD and after using it, I have to say I'm now jealous that she has a newer and better version of the Kindle Fire. We both especially like the front facing camera to Skype. You don't need a rear-facing camera to take pictures-- a ridiculously stupid effort for people who hold up the iPad to shoot pictures at public events! Honestly, I do like the size and edges of the original Kindle Fire a bit better for comfort and ease of use while reading for extended periods. It's just a personal thing. I do realize I'm buying into the Amazon ecosystem with the Kindle Fire, but I use it mainly for two things, First: reading books (I've noticed that both me and my daughter have increased our reading time--this is crucial for me since she has previously not been a book lover) This includes the one free book per month via the Kindle Lenders library and free ebooks in the public domain. Second, I use it to watch TV & movies using my Amazon Prime account (and HuluPlus and Netflix) when the kids are hogging the iPad 3. Prime is completely worth the money for the growing library of content AND the 2-day shipping which has paid for itself more than 10 times. If you're a book reader, the Kindle Fire HD is the killer machine. Of course, I can also use the Kindle reading app on my iPhone, iPad and Kindle Fire and it syncs every time I open it up to the latest read page. Perhaps the iPad 3 will eventually replace my laptop when it can perform all the applications that the MacBook Pro still does better. However, when I run out the door to attend a school event where I know I'm going to wait for awhile, the first thing I grab--with one hand--is the Kindle Fire.

They do not realize that the iPad is simply a commercial product, not a deity. It is clear that most of these 1 star reviews are by people who have never seen a Fire, much less bought and used one.

I sold my first generation Fire in the marketplace and upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD.  I am so glad that I did because all of the minor problems with the first generation were addressed in this new generation device.

Now, I have both the Amazon launcher and the ADW Launcher, and, no, I am not tech savvy, nor did I have to root my device (I don't even know what that means) or do anything special other than download a couple things.I am thrilled with this purchase!, and could I award the Amazon Kindle Fire HD more than five stars, I definitely would!", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love It!

I will have to ask AMAZON support about this issue.PROS:--Email is now very well streamlined visually, and adding other email accounts was very simple.--Visual screen for video/movie watching is 1000% improved with HD.

My pics from my Italy trip look amazing on the KF HD!--Being able to now hook my KF HD to my television is great, as I am now able to free up my laptop for viewing Prime and Instant Video selections.

It does exactly what it was meant to do, connect me with my Amazon content easily, allow me to use apps, and surf the net. The only problem I have had was that I couldn't stream movies over a mobile phone hotspot. That's not a problem with the device, that's just because the signal and speed of the phone hotspot isn't good enough. I wasn't planning on doing this, I just wanted to test it out and see if it worked.Screen is beautiful, you really can view it from any angle. The touch screen responsiveness is better than any of my other devices (thrive, galaxy s3, droid incredible). When I first wake it up, it seems groggy for about 3 seconds (any device is when you first wake it up).I have downloaded movies and tv shows from the cloud using my home internet, it took only minutes. I also paused a download halfway through and then finished it using my phone as the hotspot, then downloaded a second show. I was driving while these were downloading and it took less than 10 minutes for them to complete. That's both of them combined took 10 minutes, not individually.I am currently downloading about 1000 songs on it using my wifi at home. It's taking about the same about of time as it would to load 1000 songs on an ipod using a cable.I only briefly tested the sound, it seemed fine but I was doing other things and didn't have a chance. I've been using my phone earbuds to listen to movies while I am at work.I've only used bluetooth to connect to my keyboard, no problems there (other than issues that the keyboard is known to have).Setup was easy. Battery life is pretty good. I must say I am impressed with the battery compared to other tablets. I have to charge my thrive daily, even when it's not in use and the wifi is off. I charged the KFHD on Tuesday night (before bedtime, not overnight) and used it throughout the day Wednesday and today. Downloaded 3 tv episodes, a movie, a few hundred songs, and left the wifi on the entire time and my battery is just down to 15% on Thursday afternoon. I would recommend getting the rapid charger if you don't already have a kindle charger. You will want to charge the KFHD overnight if you are using the usb to computer option. My phone chargers do not work with the fire (fire needs more power than the phone's charger puts out).My only valid complaint is the power and volume buttons. As others have stated, they are small and flush with the device. You can't find them by feel. I have the same problem with my thrive and this really is not a big deal. You will just have to look at the buttons to use them or try to memorize exactly where they are (though it's still hard to find them because they are small). This tiny (haha) problem isn't worth crying about though.Also, others have mentioned a problem with Flash....you can sideload browsers to help you with this. And it's not AMAZON that doesn't support flash, it's ADOBE that doesn't support android. Flash is going out with the dinosaurs.As for your apps not being compatible with the HD, if they are on the fire, they should work with HD.

Not perfect, but definitely a solid five stars considering price.NOTE: I traded in my original kindle fire to amazon.com/tradein and got over $80 for it, reducing my upgrade significantly. If you have an original fire you should consider this.Overall: Much like the original fire this device is at its best when used with amazon prime and content. The music store is amazing and mostly very cheap, the video store has everything and prime members get a great selection of FREE videos. The prime library is growing fast, recently adding big movies like Iron Man 2. Obviously its great for books, its a kindle, and reading magazines is much improved over the original fire. The appstore is sometimes a disappointment, but fairly good for big name stuff. In general the home screen is a HUGE improvement over the first fire, though amazon makes it pretty obvious they want you to buy more stuff! Every screen has either small ads or suggestions on what to buy. Sometimes its annoying, sometimes it actually recommends good stuff.Screen: Its fantastic. I never thought the old fire screen was bad... until I got this! No comparison.Buttons!!: the addition of dedicated volume controls is a much needed improvement. Though they can be hard to locate sometimes.Bezel: the bezels are much much bigger. It does leave space to grip the device with your thumb, but it makes it harder to cradle in one hand.Size and feel: the build feels much better, more refined, better then a Samsung tablet but not quite as good as an ipad.Sound: I didn't notice that tablets are VERY quiet  until I cranked up this baby! The sound is still very bright but it is good, doesn't distort, and the stereo actually sounds like stereo. Well done amazon!Case: I bought the amazon case, won't say much here except that its really good.Camera: There is no back camera, which I think is good, people taking pictures with ipads look idiotic. It does have a front facing camera for skype, which works well.Complaints: The native calendar sucks. No sync for subscribed Google calendars. The email sucks too. Third party apps are available but for a cost.The web browser feels slow. Very scientific I know, but it just feels slow.The keyboard can't be changed, so if your a swype User like myself you will have to adjust, though it is better then the original fires keyboard.Hey amazon!

I have never owned a Kindle device before; I own an i-Phone and I have used a family member's i-Pad a fair amount.Based on the initial reviews, I was a little unsure about the decision to buy the Kindle HD Fire. But now that I own it, I cannot believe all of the 1 and 2 star reviews, and wonder if these people actually own the same device I do!What follows are my thoughts on a variety of issues that have been raised by others:(1) The Advertisements: When I first read about this, I thought it was annoying and was sure I would pay the $15 to remove them (which I don't mind paying). But, the ads are not a big deal at all. In fact, one of them was for a free $5 credit to rent videos, and I used it to rent two free videos for my next plane trip. I'm not going to pay the $15 -- the ads are fine and in fact can be a positive.(2) The suggested items/websites: This seems to bother a lot of people. I actually like it. I always have a hard time finding good books or movies, and this is a really helpful feature. I used it to rent a movie today, and the suggestion was a good one.(3) Screen: The quality of the screen is amazing! I watched several movie clips and tv shows, and the quality is second to nothing I have ever seen.(4) Size: The size is just perfect -- very portable, yet big enough to do everything I need. The keyboard works fine with my fingers, and I have pretty big hands.(5) Sound: Really good quality, but not as loud as I would like (but my hearing might just not be that good!)(6) I highly recommend buying the case made by Amazon for this. It is a little pricey at $40-ish, but it fits it perfectly, allows you to charge it with the case on, automatically turns it on and off, and works great as a stand!(7) Download speed with the wi-fi is lightning fast! It took about 1/10 of the time to download a movie as it does on my i-Phone!A few semi-negatives:(1) There do need to be more apps for the device. This will come with time, as app developers see the market growing. So this is really only a short-term issue.(2) I wish flash would work with it. This too is a short-term issue, since flash is on the way out, but in the interim it means there are a few websites where you will not be able to make use of something. But this is also a problem with the Google Nexus 7.All in all, you cannot go wrong with this device!

As you can see below I was very happy with my Kindle not having ads anymore. So happy in fact that I bought an app and was deciding on a few books to buy. To my dismay however my Kindle is now showing ads again. Why? Why do this? Was it to trick me into buying something? Did I not buy something soon enough to satisfy you? You had a satisfied customer willing to spend a lot more than $15. But you decided to pull this crap. Well congratulations. I don't usually buy tech until after the first few generations are out and the bugs are fixed. I took a chance on the Kindle fire for my wife. Great product. Some tried to compare it to the Ipad which it's not supposed to be. Because of the first one My wife got me this new one. We took a chance that the Kindle would be our brand. Not anymore. I'll spend my hard earned cash on a different company. I hope you are happy with the extra $5 because it's the last you will receive from me.Edit- I'm not one for hiding so my original comment is below instead of deleted. I also changed the tittle to \"Satisfied Customer\" from \"Bad Business Practice\"It was pointed out that it is listed in the description. Somehow I didn't see it as many times as I looked over it but it's there so I can't be upset for my mistake. However I still feel that if they need the extra $15 then they should just go ahead and charge for it upfront. I must say I am impressed. Even though it wasn't right away, which I imagine they are still busy as the new customers are bombarding them with questions, they seem to have unlocked to the ad feature. I have not received an email or anything but this shows they are trying to make things good and that they are keeping up with the feedback. Until now I have been simply backing up apps from my phone and books and simply side loading them. With this show of good faith I am willing to spend money on the apps, books, and possibly movies they provide and will change my rating to a 5 star. After using it the only 2 things I like about the old kindle over this one is the power button was easy to fin and the width is slightly awkward for one handed reading. However I've adjusted to it and now that I know where the button is it's easy to turn on and off. Can't wait for the case to arrive. Below is my original post.$15 to remove adds when I spent $200+ on the kindle alone? And you are not going to include a wall plug? That will teach me not to rely on the quality of the first product. My wife's fire came with a wall plug and didn't have adds pop up every single time I try to unlock it. The device is great but if this is the kind of cheap tricks it takes to make it look cheaper than it is this is the last one we get. Not going to pay $15 especially when it wasn't even listed. In other words it's something that the heads of Amazon knew would be an issue so they didn't advertise that they would charge you extra after the fact. Cheap tricks. Take the adds off and I'll give it 5 stars. I can somewhat get past the wall charger but I'm sure not everybody has an extra usb adapter. Bottom line don't do this. You have an awesome product.

My biggest fear was that it would be everything I hate about the iPad.  I like simplistic things, over stimulation is not my forte so it shocked me that I've grown to love it so much.  I've purchased magazines and books that I normally wouldn't buy on the kindle like cook books, and text style books.  I can flip through the pages easily and am able to find recipes in the books with ease.  I've had it for about a solid week now and I can't put it down.  It fits perfectly in my purse (like the kindle 2 did) and the weight difference isn't too big of a deal.  I like being able to surf the web, check email, looking at magazines, and the text-to-speach is freakin amazing!!!  The only problem is that with seeing so many beautiful book covers I've gone a book buying spree!!", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "Lee Bennet", "ReviewID": "R1KQYPCLOHTSJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Kindle ever so I don't have anything to compare it with but I received the Kindle Fire HD for my birthday about two days ago.

I have only been playing with it for a few days so I will hope to add an update later. I gave the Kindle Fire HD five (5) stars for several reasons. First, the 5 star rating is because I \"love it\". That's what the 5 star rating is intended for. It does not implicate that it is perfect but merely suggests that I really like the item. I laugh when reading some of these other 1 or 2 star ratings and what they complain about.  I will admit that it has some minor flaws and could be improved upon in a few areas but overall even with some menial issues it still delivers what it promises.  That's the basic idea of these reviews; give an appropriate review for what the item offers vs. what it actually delivers. This is a reader, web surfer, media player tablet and does all three things very well. I am not going to bash the product because it doesn't have flash.  It's not Amazon or the Kindle's fault.  That was a decision that Adobe made. It would be nice for Amazon to add a YouTube app or a dedicated app for playing flash if they want us to use their Silk browser.  I am also NOT going to compare it to other tablets.  This review is intended for the Kindle Fire HD not a comparison contest between other tablets. I am not going to put it down because of the ads.  If you don't like them, pay the $15 to have them removed.  Simple as that. Nowadays, you can't open a web site without it being plastered with ads. I don't understand what the big deal is. You go through your carousel, pick what you want to do and you leave. It's like your desktop on your computer. You don't spend hours on your desktop, you click on whatever icon you want to open and go. Surf the web, read your email, open a doc whatever.  What are people doing, playing in the carousel all day or something? I think folks are just finding things to complain about. I truly dislike commercials at the movies. Will I stop going to the movies? Of course not, I just deal with it and enjoy the show.Some folks complain about that the carousel looking too \"busy\" or because it has the recommendations on the bottom. Again, not sure why people are hanging around in the carousel all the time for. Pick what you want and move on. The carousel doesn't bother me at all. I actually like it and enjoy the recommended items on the bottom.  But that's my opinion.  Oh, here's a neat trick although it takes some effort...turn it on its side in landscape mode and the recommended items disappear. Wow! Now that was difficult, if you gave the Kindle HD 1 or 2 stars because of the recommended items and need help with going into landscape mode I will be glad to help and give you detailed instructions. I think the carousel is fine just the way it is IMO.  If you don't want an item in your carousel than you can remove it. I haven't had any issues doing so. Another thing people are complaining about is the lack of GPS. Am I missing something?? This is a wifi device not a 3G/4G tablet.  If you open Google maps it can locate you as long as you are in a wifi zone. It's not as accurate, but close enough to give you a general location or directions. It picked me up within a couple blocks where as a true GPS can pinpoint me down to a couple yards. Why would you want GPS in a tablet unless it was 3G/4G capable? It's a nice feature to have but I just don't get why or how that would really benefit a tablet that is purely meant for wifi. It's like saying I'm going to give it 2 stars because it can't make phone calls.  I am not going to knock my rating down for something it does not promise to have.  I'm trying to think of a place where GPS could come in handy when I am not in a wifi hotspot...answer, nowhere! Now if this was a 4G device and GPS was not installed than I would be a little baffled and annoyed.  If you truly need GPS get the Kindle HD 4G 8.9.Here are some of the little things I would like on the next Kindle: A charging indicator. Some sort of exterior light that tells me it is charging, fully charged etc without turning on the device. A print wireless feature would be very useful. It is a little hard distinguishing what is the top or bottom, left or right.  Not that it's a big deal but can get a little confusing remembering where the on/off switch is. A photography feature would have been a nice added extra. Not sure why Amazon would install a camera just for Skype and not for taking pictures. Obviously it's only a front facing camera so your picture taking would be very limited. A rear facing camera would definitely be much more beneficial. When watching movies or TV shows it would be a helpful feature to zoom, widen, stretch or expand the screen.  It displays the black bars along the top/bottom or sides depending on the aspect ratio. Most TV's can adjust the picture size according to what you're watching to eliminate those. It would be a nice feature if the Kindle could as well unless I missed something.  There is not a constructive way to organize Apps, books, magazines etc.  It would be nice to have folders in the carousel containing the individual items instead of every item displayed there. The biggest complaint I have is not specifically related to the Kindle HD. It is the Cloud service's ability to play non-Amazon content wirelessly. It is misleading. I thought from the description that I could play all my non Amazon music and watch all my non Amazon videos that were in my Cloud through the Kindle provided I was in a wifi hotspot. This unfortunately is not entirely true. In order to make this happen you do need a computer and load the Amazon MP3 player on it. Download your music content into the player, and then it will show up in the Cloud and become playable on the Kindle. The Videos however you cannot add them to your device wirelessly. You physically need to hook your Kindle up via the USB to your PC and transfer the videos that way.  But now those non-Amazon videos are on your device and not the Cloud. This really isn't a Kindle issue as so much an Amazon issue so that is why I am not bashing the device over it. Any content you buy through Amazon will be playable from the Cloud in any wifi hotspot and NOT take up your storage space. This has got to be one of the most unrecognized and underrated features out there that iTunes has yet to master.So here is where it does deliver. Pretty much everything it was made for. It says it has a great picture, YES it does. Great sound considering the small device, YES it does. Great wifi speeds especially using the 5 GHz bandwidth, YES it does. This thing is way faster than my iPad which only can access my 2.4 GHz bandwidth. Remember, for those that are complaining about the speed...you need to select the appropriate bandwidth on your network in order to utilize the 5 GHz bandwidth and faster speeds.  Also make sure your router even has the 5 Ghz bandwidth. I surfed all day watching videos (using Prime) and TubeMate, surfing around Facebook and shopping. I had no issues whatsoever. I don't know why some folks are complaining about the speed, swiping, or opening links but I didn't really have any problems. One thing that seems to be left out quite often is the Bluetooth capability. This paired with a couple of my devices quickly and easily. I have read using the device in both total darkness and in direct sunlight and it handles both fairly well.  Considering the color display it does a great job. I played with the Kindle HD almost continuously for 8 hours and it still had about 30% battery left.  It feels more rugged than I expected.  Has a nice finish on the back. Not too hard, not too soft. I was able to use my older Kindle AC charger to charge it rather quickly. I understand how people are upset about not having the AC charger but again, it's not the Kindle's fault!  That's Amazon. It did state that \"included in the box\" was a USB charger not an AC charger so these people who rate this Kindle low need to read their product descriptions before bashing the items they buy.There are a couple features I have yet to try and may change my rating if those features do not deliver what they promise such as the HDMI interface, Skype calling, emailing, side loading etc.  I will update later after I have used the device longer.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Caution,  Think twice before buying Kindle Fire HD  better tablets than this one", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"mastomas\"", "ReviewID": "R10QXETG3TBAVB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am the owner of Kindle products since the Kindle Reader Generation II so I know how to trouble shoot most problems.

This is my 3rd Kindle device, and yes I've kept them all for various reasons. In this review I will focus primarily on the strengths and limitations of the Kindle Fire HD, but will also point out how it compares to the \"regular\" Kindle Fire and the e-Ink Kindle Keyboard device. FYI, I am specifically reviewing the smaller size Kindles (not the larger 8.9\" version). I love the \"book size\" of the smaller Kindles, they are comfortable to hold and very portable (I can just tuck it in my purse or briefcase without a problem).First of all, I must say you can't go wrong with a Kindle (any style), they are tremendous. I received my first Kindle (with the e-Ink display and buttons on the keyboard) as a gift a few Christmases ago, and initially I was actually a little skeptical about whether I'd really like it or use it. Well, in short order I found the answer was a resounding YES to both; and I was instantly hooked by all the bells & whistles offered with the Kindle Fires.Some of the best features for the Kindle Fire HD are the stunningly beautiful screen display -- the colors are rich and the picture is extremely sharp, true HD. There is also slightly less glare on this device than on the \"regular\" Kindle Fire, which comes in handy if you want to use your Kindle outdoors or in certain overhead lighting conditions. We use WiFi for Internet connectivity, and the Kindle Fire HD connects faster and stays connected much more reliably than the regular Kindle Fire thanks to its dual antennas. Battery life also seems slightly improved over the regular Kindle Fire. When using headphones, the audio sound is fantastic on the HD (however, it is truly nothing special without the headphones, no matter what their ads may imply). One thing to note, I checked the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD side by side: the picture quality is \"great\" on the regular Kindle Fire and \"stunning\" on the Kindle Fire HD, but the actual screen display size is in fact slightly smaller on the Kindle Fire HD (the units are the same size overall, but there's more of a \"black border\" on the HD version).A few comments on the ads that Amazon displays on the Kindle Fire HD: You can pay to block them, but honestly they're not that bothersome to me. Full page ads display whenever you \"wake\" the device (if the ad interests you then you can press for more info, but otherwise you simply swipe to unlock the screen and the ad disappears). There's also a row of ads for \"Apps you might enjoy\" on the Home screen. It is very easy to ignore them altogether, but on occasion I have actually been interested in a few of their suggestions and was grateful to learn about some apps I probably wouldn't have discovered otherwise.I do have a few minor critiques for the Kindle Fire HD... Even though there is a \"front facing camera\" included, in the \"out of the box\" configuration it can only be used with Skype. If you want to use it as a true camera, you'll need to purchase an app for that. It puzzles me why Amazon didn't provide true camera functionality. To date I haven't bought a camera app yet, but probably will at some point (so far the apps available are not rated very well, so I'm holding off until there's a clear \"winner\" out there).Another issue that I have is related to bugs with the Email interface. Searching the Kindle forums I've seen similar issues reported by many others... The problem is that I have multiple email accounts (Comcast for my primary email, and GMail for calendar purposes) associated with the device (which it supports), but periodically my Comcast mailbox stops loading. The only workaround is to uninstall/reinstall the Comcast account, which is easy enough to do, but the point is that I should not have to do that... It's a bug, and it's annoying. (Interestingly, I do not have the same issue on my \"regular\" Kindle Fire... I have not had a single email issue on that device ever.)In terms of accessories, I bought the \"fast charger\" and a bright pink Kindle case for my Kindle Fire HD. The charger does work faster than previous Kindle chargers (but you have to buy it separately; if you have an older Kindle charger it will work with the Fire HD as well, just not as quickly as the new charger does). Initially I thought the Kindle brand case was overpriced, but it seems worth it. The device fits perfectly, all of the controls are accessible, and it is designed to automatically put the Fire HD to \"sleep\" when you close the cover, and to \"wake it\" when you open the cover... There's no need to turn the unit off and on, and I enjoy the \"instant on\" aspect. I also love the bright pink color since it makes it easy to spot where my Kindle Fire is around the house :-)The Kindle Fires come with a 1 month trial membership to Amazon Prime. I did not become a subscriber with my original Kindle Fire, but signed up after getting the Kindle Fire HD, if for no better reason than being able to watch Downton Abbey any time I choose (it looks and sounds exquisite on the Fire HD)...  It is worth browsing Amazon Prime's selections of shows and movies to see if they interest you enough to justify the subscription cost. The 1-month trial starts the day you activate the device, so be sure to give it a try. It's worth noting that the \"free 2 day\" shipping benefit (with no minimum purchase) really does help offset the cost. I've used that many times this holiday shopping season!I've gotten many many hours of enjoyment from the Kindles. I must say that for pure \"reading\" purposes, my first e-Ink Kindle Keyboard wins hands down. The e-Ink display is easiest on the eyes and works in any lighting condition other than \"dark\" (there is not backlight provided). This is definitely the model you'd want for reading by a pool or on the beach... Also, its battery life is INCREDIBLE (lasts for weeks at a time). However, its web browser capabilities are extremely limited (the interface with the Amazon store works fine, but that's about it), and the Black & White display doesn't lend itself to reading magazines, photo books etc.If you want a more versatile tablet-like device, the regular Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD are both excellent choices. They offer excellent value for money... I use my Kindle Fires on a daily basis, reading email, checking Facebook, listening to downloaded music, playing Scrabble and other apps... However, what I don't do that much on the Fires is to read books very much (partly because the other features become \"distractions\" and partly because I sense some eye strain when reading on the Fires)... For the most part, when it's time to read a good book I'll still turn to my original Kindle Keyboard for that.One final point: The Kindles are pretty much \"the best thing since sliced bread\" when it comes time to packing for travel. No need to haul a stack of books and games with you: This single lightweight device can hold more books, music, photos, games, etc. than you can ever possibly need. And it fits in my purse.  :-)Kudos to Amazon for an amazing family of products. I am a VERY satisfied customer.Kindle Fire HD 7\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle fire HD vs the Google Nexus 7", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3JQV8811LXAD5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Kindle fire HD vs the Google Nexus 7As many of the reviews seem to compare the kindle fire HD to the iPad, I will share my thoughts comparing the kindle to what I consider to be the actual competition, the google Nexus 7. I will start by saying I am a google/android user with an android phone and a big user of Gmail and Gchat etc to keep in touch with friends and family around the world. So what do I think after owning both the Nexus 7 and the Kindle fire HD?Positive things about the Kindle fire HD1. The screen - I cannot fault the screen at all, video is sharp, runs well without pauses (Netflix and amazon prime) and has great colour definition. I actually think the screen is better on the kindle fire HD than the nexus 7, it really is very pretty. The advertisements on the startup screen are really no issue, think of it like a screen saver, how often do you really look at it before you active the device?2. Sound - the speakers on the Kindle Fire HD are also very good, again better than the Nexus 7 and seem louder too.3. Built quality on both platforms seems very good although both suffer from the same small buttons which are hard to find.Negatives about the Kindle Fire HD1. The real negative about this device is the software or lack of Google software, if you have an android phone do not expect this to be an Android pad, its not. You do not get GChat/video chat (a big minus in my book) and the mail application is not the Gmail interface which while it works, I miss the uniformity across devices that I have gotten used to with Android. Yes I can get a 3rd party app to access gchat (again without video) but do I really want to give my password and login details to another application and company I have never heard of? I never did work out whether it has an alarm to wake my up in the morning like my phone.2. I know the Amazon Silk browser is supposed to fast, and yes it does work well, but I guess it really bugs me I cannot download alternatives.3. The carousel interface - this takes a little getting used too if you're an android user. The navigation around the device is not always as easy as it could be, but again something you can get used too.In summaryIf you want a really nice tablet to watch Netflix and Amazon videos, listen to Pandora or read books then this tablet is probably perfect for you. If however, you are looking for an Android tablet then you are perhaps better served looking at the Nexus 7 which for a little more money can do everything the Kindle HD Fire can do and more besides, you will find yourself reaching for your smart phone to check your email etc not your kindle. I carried my Nexus 7 around with me all the time and used it for a wide range of things but my Kindle Fire tends to sit beside my bed at home which is a real shame for such a nice device. If Amazon just allowed the Google apps to run I would certainly up my rating from a 3 star to a 4 star as the functionality of the device will greatly improve, as it is I will probably give my Kindle to my wife as she uses simple email applications, watches videos, reads and so will probably love this device.Final thoughtsI really want to love the device but I cannot, the device is great but is let down by the lack of functionality of the software.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fire HD for Reading", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R38U8D3M0RMU50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a technical person.

After all, Amazon calls this my 7th kindle.  I do love my electronics!  But I decided I liked my original Fire so much, I needed to see what the HD had.  I am glad I did, and consider my money well spent, as this is very different.It really is better in all the ways they describe, and the price is the same!1.  Sound.  I could barely hear my OF (original Fire).  Had to use headphones.  This one has beautiful sound, and bluetooth to beat!  I am going to research the type of bluetooth, and go out and buy headphones. Although the sound was beautiful out of my cheap earbuds, I suspect I will be watching it in bed a lot.  Some more comfortble headphones will be great.NOTE:  If you are watching a movie, and touch the screen, a bar comes up on the top where you can adjust the sound.  But this runs independently of the main volume control.  I had the volume all the way up on a movie, and wasn't quite able to hear it without my headphones.  I went to sound settings, and sound volume was only set 1/3 of the way up.  I increased it to half way up, and I was able to hear just fine.2.  Wireless.  I was able to stream a movie last night with no interruption.  That did not happen with my OF.  In addition, I couldn't believe how fast the wi-fi was.  It was just about useless with my OF.  I went online and was able to surf with no problems. I just paused writing this review to see if HBO Go worked.  With my OF, I could watch it in the living room, if I was able to put up with a lot of buffering, and not in the bedroom, which is farther from the router.  I just streamed an episode of True Blood in the bedroom, and no buffering.  The wireless is like night and day.  The dual band Wi-Fi was brilliant!3.  Picture quality.  Well, I haven't watched anything HD yet (all the things I had bought for my OF were SD.  After all, the screen was so small, it didn't really make a difference.)  But even SD, the picture quality is noticably better.4.  Form.  This kindle is smoothly beveled.  Buch more comfortable to hold than the original.  The OF was very square, and worked better with a case, as it was not comfortable to hold.  This one is very comfortable to hold.I set my Fire up on a plate stand last night, streamed a movie from Amazon, with no headphones, and was happily kntting away.  Then I decided to go to bed.  All I had to do was pause the movie, plug in my headphones, and I was good to go.  Unfortunately, when that movie ended I went to Amazon Prime and watched another.  But I guess Kindle Fire doesn't improve your self-control as well!Update:  I was able to stream 2 hour long TV shows, with no problem, and then watch a 90 minute movie.

Pictures are crisp, clear & bright. You do get ads but only in the lock screen. I don't understand why some people have an issue with this. I spend about 1 second on the lock screen. Plus, some of the offers are great. For instance, today I got a $5 credit for an Amazon Instant Video.Kindle Reader: I have noticed the screen, when reading, seems to go more smoothly. A few small tweaks here & there but nothing else that changes the experience.Carousel: Instead of your favorites being at the bottom, below the carousel, now you get photos of what other people have bought. I really don't care for this change. I would rather have the favorites down there. Instead, they now have a star to click on to get to your favorites.Design: I do love the new design! It's slimmer & lighter. Easier to handle. The only downfall with this is that you will need all new cases. I am not crazy about the location of the power button. It's up top, right next to the new volume buttons. They do not stick up away but are rather blended in & I usually have to look for it to make sure I don't hit the volume button.Charger: Yes it's a USB charger. You can use your old KF charger or you can also locate cheap adapters for converting your USB charger into an outlet charger. They are easy to find & don't cost much.HDMI: this is the wow factor for me... I bought the HDMI cable required to plug my KF into my tv. I then streamed a movie. It was fantastic! Picture quality was awesome, sound was perfect! Just be sure to change the settings for the KF to never time out. If the screen goes blank, no more movie on the tv either. This new feature was reason enough for me to upgrade & it hasn't disppointed!Sound: Great sound quality! Great upgrade there.EMail: I'm not a big fan of the new email app. I don't get my notifications as quickly and for some reason it's not as loud so if there's alot going on, I don't hear it. Still messing around with it a bit but I really prefer the email app from the original KF.Web Browser: The new default search engine appears to now be Bing. Not really happy about that. It now will also let you see Most Visited, Trending Now & Selected Sites. There's a History tab & Bookmarks as well.Internet & WiFi: No problems connecting WiFi. Speed is definitely improved!Camera: Can't comment because the only thing you can use it for is Skype. Since I never video chat, the camera is of non-importance to me.Overall, I am happy but at times I miss some of the features from the original KF.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Upgrade", "Author": "Robert F Harrison", "ReviewID": "R2KVKOIA8XPLI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an owner of the original Kindle Fire (KF) I debated long and hard about upgrading to the latest version. I really liked the original, though it had a few faults that I came to know over time.First, let me say the reason I bought the original is that I do a lot of bicycling and my iPad was, frankly, just too big to haul around with me everywhere. The KF was just the right size and had decent enough battery life that I could read a book or watch a bit of a movie on a break during an all day ride.The biggest problems with the KF for me were low volume from the speakers forcing me to use a headset and slow syncing of email when around WiFi.The Kindle Fire HD has solved those problems for me and added a few bonuses. The volume is great (or at least compared to the original). I can listen to a movie in a room with a loud air con without breaking out the headset, a big plus for me at a volunteer phone answering service I do once a week. I like not having to use a headset when I do this as then I don't have problems answering the phone - just hit pause on the movie or media.The addition of a good Bluetooth connection makes is even better as I can use the same headset I use for my phone (LG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange) at the same time.The WiFi connection of the KF HD is, as advertised, a lot more solid for me than that of the original KF.I've only had the KF HD for a half a day, but I'm already glad I upgraded. A good friend of mine is glad too as I'm passing my KF on to her. She got my original Kindle as well and later upgraded so passing this on will probably result in her buying whatever the 3rd Gen KF turns out to be. :-)And, though it's only tangentially related, I love the Whispersync bit. I listen to a lot of Audible books and keeping track of where I was on different devices was a pain. This is almost (though not quite - it's been confused) painless.Aloha!", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Hope this was just Teething Problems", "Author": "A.

I think I got a bad one out of the batch:Negatives:1 - Edges of Screen had white bleed through, as if someone pressed the edges really hard and damaged the screen2 - With Netflix jerky video at best with alot of buffering. To test this I used my old Kindle with the same Netflix content and the video was fluid as to be expected with a new dual band wifi set up3 - Either this is a bad processor or damaged screen as there should not be issues rendering Netflix4 - Not all apps are compatible yet; we bought Monopoly and there is not a version for the new Fire Yet. Same with SAS Zombie Attack my current time waster.Nit Picks:1 - Not a big fan of the \"People also Bought\" at the bottom of the screen in portrait mode2 - I think $15 opt out of ads is LAIM/STUPID at best; if you buy a Kindle you'll consume content you don't need intrusive ads to remind you to spend money3 - no Flash support but that is not Amazon's Fault. Adobe does not support Flash on higher versions of AndroidPostives:1 - no issues with dropped wifi2 - BlueTooth connectivity was really nice feature to go with my SoundFreaq3 - from what I can tell the screen image quality is better than previous Kindles, you can really tell when viewing your \"non-HD\" cloud content4 - parental conrols are good/not great but new ones are scheduled for releaseThis unit had to be bad. I boxed up and will exchange for a new one. I am rating 2 stars b/c this Kindle deserved 2 stars. The next one should be OK (I Hope).

The second one I never took out of the wrapper because there was no power cord or paperwork in the box. In a rush to get product out are we?Third unit works really well and is a vast improvement over 1st gen. Kindle. High Definition content looks really good streaming and better when you download content. The Lorax looks awesome in HD. The bluetooth sound to my Soundfreaq makes watching movies and gaming really fun. A very good tablet to unwind to. Don't know how productive I could be but that's what the MS Surface Pro is for.

It's the first tablet I've owned. So far, I've been very impressed with it as a media consumption device that ties all my Amazon digital content together into a cohesive package.Screen:Resolution is pretty good. Not completely crisp, but not distractingly pixelated or anything. Makes for a solid viewing and reading experience.Sound:Those integrated speakers put out surprisingly good sound. A set of decent speakers or headphones still sound better than the integrated speakers, but those built-in speakers are certainly passable in a pinch.Amazon Integration:I've been making MP3, book, and video purchases strictly through Amazon for several years. I know, that's something of a sacrilege for a long-time Apple and iOS user like myself. However, Amazon's cross platform functionality means I can enjoy my purchased music, movies, and books across a number of platforms. Something I find sorely lacking with Apple products. Having said that, I think the Kindle HD is an added value for me as I now have even easier access to much of my digital content.Apps:The Amazon App store is somewhat disappointing. Not only do I have repurchase several iOS apps (that's on me and not a knock on the device), but as as has been said by many other reviewers, Amazon's curated app store just doesn't live up to the offerings found in iOS or Google Play. The big apps are all present and accounted for, but there are plenty of other useful apps that you won't find here. I suspect that's mostly a developer motivation issue, but as a consumer that's disappointing. The free app a day program is a nice perk.Incidentals:I'm not a fan of the placement of the mini-USB charging port. They should really include a wall charging plug with the device. Only the built-in web browser, Silk, is available for the Fire. Silk is fine, but I would like the option of downloading and using another browser. I purchased the OtterBox Defender Series Protective Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\", Black (with built-in screen protection) along with this unit. Nice fit, and a sense of security when handling the Fire.Final Thoughts:I've been surprisingly impressed with the Fire HD. It's become a part of my regular media consumption routine (web browsing, books, videos, games), and I find myself using my iPhone less and less these days. If you can get past the less than fully stocked app store, then I think you'll find a device worth owning.

This is happening to the last one they sent me whitch is supposedly brand new, and i have had many more problems with it and the Kindle will blame it on my internet but when i get onto Amazon on my laptop i have no more problems. Other people have told me they have had similair and other problems with their Kindle Fire HD also, so i am not the only one who has complained.

I mostly use the iPad for checking email, listening to or reading books, watching videos, browsing, and an occasional game. I bought the Kindle for traveling because of its smaller size, and while it may suffice for most of these activities, it is not a replacement for an iPad or Nexus.My first frustration came while setting up my email accounts. While there is a specific selection for Gmail, it does NOT work. In order to link Gmail you have to use the \"other\" option and enter all the server and port information. While this is easy to do and sufficiently brings in your email it does NOT allow you to bring in either your calendar or your contacts, which is annoying and inconvenient (although writing email on the Kindle keyboard is more annoying so maybe it's for the best in the long run). To get access to your Gmail contacts you have to use the Silk browser to access Gmail from the web. Linking Yahoo mail with the preset option seems to work fine. Here you can get email and contacts without issue, but you can't link the calendar again. A few of the things that make the Kindle keyboard so annoying are: the key clicks sound (it grates on your nerves, I finally had to turn it off), the keys are not as responsive (compared to iPad) especially the first keystroke-it always takes several seconds to register, and the key positioning (where return key is on a normal keyboard Kindle puts the delete key).Where the Kindle excels is for audio and ebooks. Obviously all your Amazon content is readily accessible and fairly easy to navigate through. The screen is a little cramped due to the large area taken up by the bezel, but the definition is excellent and the content is easily readable. The screen is bright and the color is vibrant; easily outshining my iPad2, and the sound quality is excellent even at very high volumes, again much better than the iPad. However, I was shocked that there was no way to filter my Audible content. I have well over 200 titles and there is no way to filter for audiobooks, or newspapers, etc. which makes it exceedingly hard to browse your content. If you know exactly what you are looking for you can do search.Another thing that is really annoying is the size and location of the buttons to control on/off and volume. First, they are difficult to find because they are flush to the case and they are very small and difficult to distinguish by touch, so I wind up turning the Kindle off when I want to change the volume and vice versa. You never have this problem on the iPad because the buttons are raised and the volume is around the corner from the standby button. The placement of the micro-USB and mini-HDMI ports is also clumsy. The two connectors are relatively the same size but not a big deal once you memorize that charging is on the right. Having these ports on the bottom is curious. I put the Kindle in its case upside down, which allows me to use it while charging, but this puts the volume buttons upside down and also puts the camera on the bottom so I suspect that it would not work so well for video chat in this orientation. Also it puts more strain on the cable and connector than it would if the connectors were on the side.Navigation on the Kindle is frustrating. Your ability to customize the home screen or organize content is very minimal. You can add or remove items from the carousel and favorites, but that is about it. On the iPad you can organize apps into groups which allows you to quickly navigate to the content you are looking for (I have over 150 apps and by using groups on the home screen, none is more than 2 taps away). On the Kindle you get the fixed menu items (shop, games, apps, books, music, videos, newsstand, audiobooks, web, photos, docs, offers) which you cannot rearrange or delete. In the center of the screen you have a carousel of recently accessed items in chronological order. You can remove items from this section, but you cannot rearrange them. On the bottom right of the home screen you have a favorites link. Here you can add the apps, books, or videos that you access most often and you can arrange them in any order by holding down and dragging to the desired location.  On the Kindle, to access my 150+ apps would be: tap favorites, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, tap desired app. Although, this problem is minimized by the fact that less than half of the apps I have on my iPad are available for the Kindle. This is really disappointing because there are only a few of my iPad apps which do not have a Google Play Store counterpart. However, you cannot access the full Google Play Store from the Kindle - you can only get what is in the Amazon App Store. So like iPad is for iTunes and App Store, Kindle is for Amazon. The difference is that while I can rip the thousands of CDs and DVDs I already own to iTunes and then sync them to my iPad, there is no such option for Kindle. There you can only get what you've purchased at Amazon or uploaded to Amazon Cloud Drive (max 250 songs for free).So, bottom line is while it will work for most of my intended purpose of having a smaller travel device, I'm disappointed in the ability to get and organize content. It is, at its core, an extension of the Amazon store, let's call it what it really is - an \"Amazon Appliance,\" so if that's what you are looking for it's perfect. However, If you are looking for a small full-featured tablet then pay a few more dollars and get an iPad Mini or Google Nexus 7.

So I recently decided to investigate something in a smaller footprint. I purchased a Kindle Fire HD and an Ipad mini for comparison. I love the Kindle Fire's bright vivid HD screen and the Dolby stereo is terrific when watch a TV show or movie. After that though it's all downhill for me. After a few days of use the touchscreen stopped being responsive requiring firm and precise and sometimes multiple attempts to get it to register my touch. Also the wifi connection was very slow in grabbing a connection and not very strong at keeping it. Start up time is painfully slow on the Kindle and the charging time is as well. On the other hand the Ipad while not having nearly as nice a screen and not nearly the volume or sound quality of the Kindle just does everything else so well. Start up time is great. It gets and holds my wireless wifi signal all over my house. Something the Kindle could not manage. Also the On/Off and volume buttons on the Kindle are so flush with the unit they're impossible to find in the dark while watching a video. I know the Ipad is more expensive but in the end for me at least the Ipad is the clear winner and that is not even taking into account all the apps that are available for the Ipad that are not available for the Kindle.

It's basically a jumbo sized Android phone that does not make calls, I already have a Motorola Razr Maxx and didn't feel it was much of an upgrade with the only sole exception, the screen size.The Kindle Fire HD (A huge improvement to the original Kindle Fire) is a breathtaking unbelievably stunning resourceful and overall life improving device that once you are accustomed to, you will use more than any other technology device with the only near competition being your cellular phone. However once you are familiar with it you will even use your phone less often, probably only to make calls.I did an extensive amount of online research and hands on interactivity with all three tablets before deciding on the Kindle Fire HD.One thing that will blow your mind like that Maxell commercial where the guy in the couch gets blown over by a gust of sound, is just that, the onboard speakers. Phenomenal, crisp, LOUD, detailed, rich, deep, and did I mention LOUD! It's shocking how much better the speakers are on the Kindle Fire HD compared to everything else. The iPad Mini is embarassed into shame, the Nexus7 got Manny Paquiaowwed in the 1st round. The difference is that amazing.Compatibility to/with your mixed media collection. I can play every video format upto even 1920x1080p movies, every audio format including Apples AAC and Windows WMA, all eBooks (mobi, azw, azw3, pdf, cbr. cbz, to name a few).With the ability to \"sideload\" Android apps you are not limited to what is offered by the Amazon Store. And there are tricks to get apps on the device that are stubborn to get installed. One w3ay is by downloading ES File Explorer to your Android phone, downloading that app to your phone, backing the app up, then copying the file from your phone to the Kindle Fire HD. A good place to learn a lot about how to maximize the unbound potential of this everyday workhorse device is by watching online video tutorials on YouTube. And by reading the eBooks: Kindle Fire HD The Missing Manual, Kindle Fire HD for Dummies, Taking Your Kindle Fire to the Max. One recommended app to have is  Aneesoft's Kindle Fire Converter Suite. Also Handbrake, to convert your DVD and BLURay movies to high quality Mp4 videos to watch and take with you on the road.I use my Kindle Fire daily to listen to music, Chris Medina's What Are Words is blasting right now. I use both gaming emulators N64oid and Gensoid to play ROMS of classic Nintendo 64 and SEGA Genesis games. I read comics with the Comicat app. I listen to Slacker and Pandora radio, watch movies on Netflix. Gamble on a fake slot machine on Slots by Kabam. Watch my movie collection on VLC and CineXPlayer. Control my desktop PC with Jump Desktop. Make Skype calls. Browse and shop on eBay, FB, Tumblr, Spotify, Craigslist, Zoosk, Hulu, Redbox, and the list could go on all the live long day.Improve the quality of your life and just BUY it! I forgot to mention that I am currently disabled in a wheelchair and this device is a lifesaver for me. It's a media consumption,communication, gaming, reading, listening force that will change your life. It did mine.Best purchase I made in 2013 without question.

I watch tv and play games on it or make my grocery list out on one of the apps I downloaded on it. I keep my diary on it. I put all my notes on it so I don't forget important information. I keep addresses and phone numbers in the app on it. It was easy to download a app to print from my printer.  So I can print from my kindle fire HD. I can't say enough about my kindle. I have told everyone about it. It's easy to take to the Dr office with me and use it to play games or surf the web if they have open Wi-Fi. I take it shopping to shop fir groceries. I can't say enough good things about it. I have no negative thoughts on it. If I would have had more money when I ordered mine, I would have bought the 32 G, so later I will buy that one and give this one to my son. Watching movies on it is great. Sound is fantastic. Picture is crystal clear. There's so many games on it that can be downloaded that you can keep busy playing them. And it's easy to read a book. I hadn't read a book in a long time until I got this and then I read one in 1 day. It makes it so much easier to read. There are so many reasons why you should want to have one of these.

No, there are not as many quality kids educational apps but there are enough. Amazon, by whom I am a loyal customer and biased by its locale, is the hands down winner as a media device. With prime rivaling Netflix, there are plenty of free options. We had been buying all out kid movies via Amazon Instant and watching them on our Internet TV. Now the kids can access them all- no more 30 min download like iTunes. Music, just as easy. In fact, waiting in my cloud were digital versions of albums I bought 10 years ago. Free. Most of those CDs are long since scratched or lost. Bonus!The best feature though is Kindle Free Time. You set up a profile for up to 6 kids. And manage exactly what contact each is allowed to access. Then, when you hand over the device in that mode, the kids can't get out of it, surf the web or buy anything. You can choose app by app, movie by movie. And forget about it.Where amazon's content thwomps Apple's is in children's ebooks. For 1.99 per month, 1 profile can access a kid version of prime. Only totally G rated content. Tons of kids books (traditional not speaking),  tv shows etc are right in Freetime for them to explore.I would happily trade in my iPhone for a Fire version if I could and will when I can.

Its a subscription based service for the bargain rate of just $4.99 a month. It's perfect for my 6 year old. Amazon has done all the work for busy parents. I no longer have to search for suitable apps/books/videos for my six year old. FreeTime offers plenty of variety for him to choose from and no advertisements.

The iPad mini had just launched but I've been a tech user for many, many years and have never been a fan of iTunes and the Apple ecosystem. (No, I'm not an Apple hater, I chose an iPhone over an Android phone.) Although I'm not a big movie buff, in recent years, our local movie rental places have been closing so when I did rent movies, I had been streaming them from amazon. I love having the HDMI output on the Kindle Fire. I can now stream movies on any TV in the house - much more comfortable than using my laptop! (See my review on the 12 ft. HDMI cable I use. It lets me control everything from the couch.) Finally, and not least important, the Kindle Fire won out over the iPad mini based on price.

I was going to get the iPad mini when the Fire HD crept up on me as well. I heard of all the improvements and let me tell you I am happy with my purchase.  I got the Fire HD from Amazon this time.  I like the build improvements that were made.  The high definition screen is a thing of beauty.  I paid a little extra to get the 32 GB model along with the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" Standing Leather Case, the 2 year Square Trade warranty, the Amazon Kindle PowerFast charger, and the Micro HDMI cable (with a free stylus from Handheld items) to connect to your HDTV. I was able to get all these side items with 16 more GBs of memory for MUCH less than the iPad mini.  I was going to buy the 8.9\", but I went with the 7\" so I could get the extra 16 GBs of memory.

I love the instant access of Kindle books, free 2 day shipping, and their instant streaming of movies and TV shows.  I can access Amazon videos from my Fire HD, iPhone 4,  Xbox 360, Wii U, Google Chromebook, or  just about any other computer.  The wifi strength has been excellent.

One can do many things with the Fire (as you know, it's much more than just an e-reader). The fact that this Fire is 7\" is great for me because it's very portable. I really don't want to discuss all the Fire capabilities here because all of this is clearly and truthfully explained in Amazon's comprehensive product description.  I cannot overstate that Amazon's claims regarding the Fire's abilities are true.  I find that the Fire's functions work for me and I enjoy using them very much.  Because the Fire's capabilities are so clearly stated in Amazon's product description, I'm going to be a little different and focus on all of the extra services that can come with the Fire.WITH THE PURCHASE OF A KINDLE FIRE HD, YOU CAN GET THESE SERVICS:PRIME MEMBERSHIP:  My personal experience is that with HD capability, video play is very crisp when you watch an HD video. I did spring for the optional Prime Membership ($79 a year), and there is a huge array of videos that are available for free viewing (both HD and SD). If you shop frequently from Amazon, then the free two day shipping benefit (for Prime eligible items) will pay for Prime in a short time.  With Prime, one can also borrow a different e-book once a month from a large selection of eligible e-books.AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE (PARTICULARLY WITH KINDLE REPLACEMENTS):  One of the great benefits of working with Amazon is the fact that their customer service excellent.  It's been my experience that Amazon customer service representatives go above and beyond to help customers.  If there is a product issue that cannot be resolved, very frequently they will arrange for the product to be returned to Amazon for free and a replacement is promptly shipped. If you have a problem with a device within the warranty period, Amazon backs up that warranty without question.I myself have benefited from Amazon warranty policies several times (INCLUDING A REPLACEMENT KINDLE WHEN MY FIRST KINDLE FIRE BECAME DEFECTIVE).  Additional warranty protection can be purchased from Square Trade and my personal experience with Square Trade is very good.  I have gotten a brand new device replacement from Square Trade with no problems.FREE BOOKS, APPS AND MUSIC:FREE BOOKS:  One extremely attractive benefit of working with Amazon is the huge amount of free perks. With e-books, there is a top 100 list of best selling paid and free downloadable e-books.  This list can be refined by choosing a category (such as cooking, food and wine).  I have gotten so many excellent free cookbooks that I'm sure to become a gourmet cook in no time (grin).  The best selling book lists literally change every hour, so you never know what will come next.FREE MUSIC:  Similar to the to the lists of free books, there is a list of top selling paid and free MP3 music.  Again, you never know what will come next because the list changes hourly.FREE APPS:  There are a ton of free Apps in Amazon's App market.  One benefit I particularly enjoy is the \"Free App of the Day.\"  I have obtained lots of very interesting paid Apps for free. These daily free Apps can normally cost from .99 to as much as 14.99.  The free 14.99 App I obtained was OfficeSuite Professional 6.  Today's (1/24/2013) Free App of the Day is a \"White Noise\" App with more available ambient sounds than the regular free \"lite\" version.  Today's free app normally costs 1.99.FOR ME:I don't know what I would do without my Kindle Fire HD.  It's an excellent product with a lots of \"cool\" capabilities.  It's ideal for me.

The software is far better, the interface is a lot more fluid, page turns in books doesn't hesitate like the first one. Although, sometimes, when accessing the Video and Music Stores, they load slowly.The form factor is great. It's different as you can't hold it in one hand like the first one, the bezel is wider around the screen. But, it's lighter and meant to be held in landscape view for the most part.The audio is the best I've heard from any tablet so far, and I've reviewed many. It's not something you're going to listen to for hours, but the sound is perfect for watching YouTube videos and listening to audiobooks and Text to Speech. I connected it to the receiver on my home theater setup, and this little guy is powerful with audio. It;s like having a pre-amp in front of the receiver. Listening via my Grado SR-80 headphones is a dream too.The screen resolution is wonderful. HD Video looks spectacular on its screen and via HDMI. In all aspects of digital media, this is the best by far.If you're looking for a tablet to be productive on -- this isn't it. For a seven inch tablet that's more customization and geeky, get the Nexus 7 if that's what you're looking for. You can get light productivity done between playing games and watching movies though. The email app is far better than the first one, the web browser is nicer and it has some decent office apps that will get the job done for basic editing.It's meant to be a media consumption device and the doorway to Amazon...so Don't try to compare this to the iPad -- it's an entirely different device.

Definitely have enjoyed it and both my wife and myself have begun to use our Prime memberships quite a bit ( Amazon is starting to get some great movie content recently that makes the Prime membership worth it in my opinion ).For those on the fence if it's worth the upgrade let me mention one thing that I love about the new HD.  As an owner and user of an Apple IPhone 4S I've always noticed that the touch screen on the IPhone is very responsive to your fingers and relatively glitch free.  When I would pick up my 1st generation Fire I would always notice that it wasn't quite as responsive as the Apple touch screen.  I would actually use some apps on my phone rather than the older Fire just for this reason.Well it seems that the new Fire HD has a much more responsive screen and I now find it equal to the responsiveness of Apple touch screen products for what it's worth. Amazon seems to have upgraded their touch screen technology and the glitchiness of the previous Fire seems to be gone.Also, the new HD screen is much brighter, clearer and in general just looks great.  Movies look fantastic. Watched \" The Midnight Cowboy \" last night in bed ( free with Prime membership by the way ) and it looked and sounded great. Streaming is much, much quicker on the Fire HD ( and I already thought it was pretty good on the 1st generation fire ).  The movie started right away, quicker than if I had popped a DVD in my player. The new speakers are a huge improvement.  Also looking forward to getting an HDMI cable and showing Prime movies on my 55\" LG HD TV !

THIS CHOICE WAS A GOOD ONE! i did have the $159 kindle sent first and i was not that excited by it. it was slow and kind of heavy. the hd kindle is a bit lighter, but i think what makes it feel better is the displacement of the weight. i can also see a significantly better picture in the hd version. i was actually pretty annoyed by the poor display on the $159 kindle. you could see the pixalated words, which was annoying and unacceptable in my book. i also find that the text is much more responsive when i type or need to go back and correct something. however, i would recommend to anyone to get the hd version because the upgrades are well worth it and the $159 kind of sucks in my book! you will most definetly see the difference if you did a side by side comparison!with my recommendation for the hd version, please note there are small issues with the kindle in general that are annoying...1) i cant find the facebook or youtube app in the store2) i am writing on the kindle now and it will not auto correct or capitialize the beginning of a sentence because i am on the web (this is stupid amazon, fix it!!!)3)the kindle is warm this was the same on the $159 kindle as well.

Inevitably, the Kindle Fire HD is going to be compared to that tablet, as it's the most similar device available at the same pricepoint and generation. I really liked the Nexus 7, but having used both tablets I'd throw my vote with the Fire HD.Memory:The Fire HD has 16 GB of internal memory on the base model. Nexus 7 has 8 GB for the same cost. Some might argue that you don't need a whole lot of internal memory these days, and they're probably right. Still, it sure can't hurt- especially since neither of these tablets has a SD slot and some space is inevitably eaten up by the OS. Both tablets have 1 GB of RAM which is plenty.Ports:Both have micro-USB. The Fire HD also has mini-HDMI. I like this- it never hurts to be able to hook up to a bigger screen and enables the tablet to be used as a makeshift web-TV.Wireless:The Fire HD has a much-touted dual antenna MIMO setup. The main advantage with this is range- I was able to pick up my home wireless signal from my car parked in the driveway on the opposite side of the house. That is better than ANY wireless device I've used- even my 2012 MacBook Air can't do that. Download speeds are also noticeably higher than other tablets.Form Factor:The Fire HD is actually a bit wider than the 1st gen Kindle Fire, but thinner and marginally lighter. The Nexus 7 is overall smaller and more compact, and lighter as well. Unlike the 1st gen Fire, this one has dedicated volume buttons (thank God!) and a beveled back panel. The camera is located in the center of one long side of the tablet, rather than a narrow end as is more typical.Screen:Both the Nexus 7 and Fire HD have very nice screens. They're both extremely crisp, vibrant, and about as easy to view outdoors as any LCD can be. Both are made of gorilla glass and do a remarkable job of not picking up fingerprints. I'd call this one a tie.Sound:This is my favorite part of the Fire HD and the real selling point in my opinion. The Fire HD's audio is superb- better than many full-up laptops I've used. Volume is outstanding and it has a built-in stereo speaker setup. It blows any other tablet out of the water in the audio department, plain and simple- especially ones with mono sound (the Nexus 7 is essentially the same as a 1st generation Fire in the speaker department). This makes the Fire HD an excellent media tablet without requiring headphones. It also makes it easy to use for Internet calls.Software:I find it silly that many people, including supposedly professional reviewers, nitpick at this. Yes, it's a customized Android and has some restrictions including fewer apps since it's hooked up to the Amazon app store. However, this one is a lot closer to Android 4.0 than the original Fire was to Android 2.3- in fact most of the standard Android functionality is pretty much there as is. If you're like me and are an Amazon junkie anyway, the forked version of Android is more of a blessing than a curse. If you're not... you can get around it (and ironically, Google enables that). Software wise, you can do anything with this that you can with an Android tablet. Personally, I prefer the Silk browser over the standard Android Chrome. It's been slightly improved with better starting screens but is otherwise unchanged.Power:I guess the only thing to say about this is both last 'long enough.' You can play a good 5 hours of video on either the Nexus 7 or Fire HD, read all day, and then charge them back to full in an hour or so. They're nothing like the e-ink readers, but these devices are both as good in the power department as any other tablet out there (and better than most).Other hardware:The Nexus 7 has a more powerful processor, little doubt about that. However, you really can't tell in 99% of the apps out there. Quite frankly, a quad core Tegra 3 is huge overkill for pretty much any Android app. Transitions, browsing, and apps are silk smooth on both tablets- I call it a tie as far as that goes. Both devices have a front-facing camera and microphone for videoconferencing.Other:Both devices have bluetooth. The Fire HD has no built-in GPS, but I've never used a tablet for navigation anyway: my phone does that for me quite well. One pretty irritating thing I noticed is that the Fire HD is by default a 'with promotions' device, and it is definitely not made obvious on the product page. I think this is going to cause Amazon the most grief as far as feedback goes. You can pay $15 to get rid of the advertising, which is quite pervasive, but it is a bit sneaky how they put that in there without noting it in the pricepoint as with the eInk Kindles.In short, I think Amazon has a winner. Unless we see an iPad mini for the same price, the Fire HD is set to be another hit product.Pros:Excellent screenGood ergonomicsGood battery lifeGood performanceSuperb soundHDMI outOutstanding wi-fi range and speed16 GB memory at base modelCons:Bit on the wide side compared to most 7\" tabletsNo SD slotAds enabled by default", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of year warrranty.. it has a purpose", "Author": "Tanner P", "ReviewID": "RZADV61K3IQXC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had my kindle fire for 18 months.

I'm stalking out of the house in a fit of frustration. I tried for the third time to get access to my existing Netflix account to play stuff on the Kindle Fire, with no success. For one thing, in order to run the POSSIBLE fix, that begins with \" you should try this which probably won't work\", I have to have a full battery. I have been charging the KFHD all evening and have gotten to [Where is that cursed \"on\" button, I wonder?] 58 per cent charge.So, I'll see the grandchildren next weekend, and maybe can show them and their parents what Kindle FreeTime has to offer. I set up accounts for each child, and checked today. The oldest has his account filled with a book that indeed I did buy for him, AND two Nancy Drew mystery stories that I needed to compare to the original Nancy Drew mystery stories. He is not really ready for, and his parents and other grandmother may not understand why he has those in his Kindle Fire FreeTime account. BUT there is absolutely no way I could find to delete any content from the Kindle FreeTime app (and there's nothing like it on the IPad, so, Amazon, you've lost a possible sale there. I believe that other grandparents with more than one family of grandchildren might find that what *you*-Amazon think is suitable child content in their Amazon list of purchased content has wound up with a child in a different family for whom it was not intended.I don't really know whether you are losing ME as a customer -- I'm a shut-in and spend 2/3s of my not-so-great income on Amazon.com, your products, and appreciate your terrific customer service (or comparatively terrific, compared to Verizon and ATT).(1) NO WAY I chose those to be in his account, and(2) NO WAY I would have approved them if Amazon had asked, and(3) NO WAY I could find to delete them from his account. I think I may have added them to at one of his siblings instead.So my chance to demonstrate to their parents that the Kindle Fire is neat, and better than their two IPADS is gone. So there, Amazon.I'm glad the chance is gone because my additional gripe is the incredible commercialization of the Kindle Fire HD 7\". I paid $15 more NOT to get Special Offers, because with my Kindle PaperWhite, of which I am still fond, I do get daily deals on ebooks, usually for $1.99 or less, sometimes a little bit more, that I often can't resist. So even if Special Offers are sometimes for good deals, they will cost more than my budget can manage. SO, I don't see Special Offers on the sign-in screen. I do see, however, (1) a carousel of random unwanted titles in whatever genre I've searched, and (2) a lot of additional supposedly similar material related to my interests but generally too expensive for me, or not at all suited, or *really* not interesting to me.I do my own choosing, I don't need to be spoon fed, and I don't want to be spoon fed, and I can't afford to be spoon fed content. Please find a way to let me turn it off. Now I am too aware of the creep that has inhabited your web pages, so that now when I choose items for a shopping cart, I have to go through a page of related items before I can give you the money I know I can afford.AMAZON, my beloved AMAZON, how could you let me down so.I guess twenty words of this has been about a product.S Peterson", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple fixes would be nice.", "Author": "Itburns", "ReviewID": "R2EBIVDCWP99OM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, since I am just a mere common folk, I will not waste my time and yours writing a thesis, or an oratory on this device like some of these reviews. I swear, it's like these guys are either extremely bored and have nothing else to do but spend 3 weeks trying to credit (or discredit) all that the fire has to offer... Or they are writing a thesis for their final exam prior to entering their masters in engineering school... Or they are somehow getting paid by Amazon, or some other reviewers conglomerate.Anyway, my review will be simple and to the point.  I rated it a three stars, not because I think this Kindle Fire HD 7\" is only middle of the road, because I think is much better than that, but it is based off of my own opinion of what that stars really mean.Five stars would mean the product is pretty much close to perfect, in design, functionality, usefulness etc... In other words, without flaw, or it really couldn't be any better.Four stars would mean a step just below perfect.  As in it's almost perfect. As in it would only take a few minor adjustments to get there.  It's very good, just not great etc...Three stars, as I rated this, as in this Fire, means it's pretty good, but they just didn't do enough to hit the very good mark.  I mean, I really think Amazon could have done a lot of things better to make the user interface a much better experience.  Simple fixes would have done the trick for many of the things that I think they could have done much better. I will name a few, but the list could be much more extensive.1. Silk browser.  I'm running it off of my Wi-Fi, but the browser itself is just not that good.  I'm not talking about the speed, because speeds are all different wherever you may be. I am talking about just the functionality of the working ways of the browser. A couple examples... you cannot touch one point on any given page to open up the bookmarks menu.  You have to basically take two to three extra steps to get to the bookmarks. In an open page, you have to hit the menu icon, then the starter icon, then the bookmarks tab, and then it will open up your stored bookmarks.- The fix would be to merely add a bookmark tab in the menu, which once hit would open up a side bar with the bookmarks.2. When in the browser you may be trying to read an article, and like me, many people need to expand the font size to read the words easier.  So when you expand the text to enlarge it, the browser will not re-size the lines to fit within the boundaries of your window. So in order to read, you have to scroll back and forth with your finger, to go from the end of one line, then to the beginning of the next.- The fix would be to allow the browser to re-size the lines to fit in your window, so that all you have to do is school down as you are reading.  Apparently, one of the things Amazon touted was the processor.  Seems to do as I just described in my cell phone which has technology that is nearly four years old, so why not the Fire?3. The browser doesn't remember where you were at in a page, if you hit a sub link, and then hit the back button it kicks you back to the starting point of the previous page you were on. For example, say you are on Facebook, and you have scrolled down through a bunch of posts within your page, then you come to a post that you want to comment on. So you hit the comment tab, make your comment and post it, then hit the back button, and the Fire kicks you back to the top of your Facebook page, not back to where you were, so if you want to keep looking through all the postings you then have to scroll through everything you already scrolled through earlier, just to get back to the point you previously were at.- The fix, make the browser remember where you were at in previous page.  Simple really.  Again, works that way in my four year old technology, smart phone.  Hmmmm.Now away from the browser, the Kindle Fire won't allow Apps from the Google Play Store. Amazon is hand cuffing all of its users to the Amazon App Store.  C'mon, really, they run it off the Google Android platform, but we can't get apps from the Google app store?  I kind of get the fact that Amazon wants the revenue, but being as I purchased the device outright, as in I own it, I should be able to buy from whomever I choose.  It would be like if I buy a Cadillac, I would be required to buy all of my gasoline, parts, etc. From the Cadillac dealer.- The fix... you know the fix.  Let's grow up here.So, those are really just the tip of the iceberg.  There are many other easy fixes that would put it on the next level, and like I said, I'm not here to write an oratory.So yeah, 3 Stars.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shopped around looking for more storage than the 1st gen fire", "Author": "R. Simpson \"Randy\"", "ReviewID": "RWID7O4O8HKZZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first purchased the Fire last year I bought it knowing I would replace it with a larger storage version in a year or two.  Well with the release of the new Fires, Nexus, and I-pad mini I figured now is the time.I only use my classic Fire for playing music while working outside, playing games, and web surfing so those area's are where I focused my research.I read so many reviews (alot clearly biased towards a brand) and played with them all in stores before I made my choice.  The Nexus was the easiest for me to rule out, I just did not care for the layout and the speakers seemed worse than the model I was replacing.  Otherwise it would have been a very hard choice between them.  The Nexus 7 is the real competition for the Fire HD but I just did not like the feel of it so I didn't research it.  So that left me with the I-pad mini and the Fire HD.The general consensus of the reviews I read over and my personnel experience with the devices lead me to a few main points.  The Fire has a much better display (a horrid business move by Apple to not include a Retina Display), and it has better speakers.  The I-pad mini has the option for twice the storage (another bad move by Amazon to not market a 64GB version).  Then you have the processors, again Apple decided to use a slower processor and with this choice the processor's are basically a wash.  The I-pad runs games better while the Fire runs video better.  Either way its not a noticable diffence for the average user.  Then there is the app stores, Apple is the clear winner here by a few thousand miles.  Amazon is losing alot of business by not allowing easier access to Android apps.  As for web surfing the I-pad would be faster over all but the display is not as good as the Fire so its a personal choice there.  I'll wait 1-3s longer per web page if I can read it better.So in the end I just could not justify the costs of an I-pad knowing Apple will release a Retina/A6 version in the future (what this version should have been).  After all my research I did not buy the Kindle Fire HD because it was the best on the market but because it would fit my needs better and Apple messed up including outdated parts in there new product.  We will be buying a 10\" tablet soon and Apple lost that purchase too, I want them both on the same platform.Since I have owned my new Fire I have been mostly pleased with it, I really didn't think the power/volume buttons would be an issue but they are.  Easily 2-5s longer to turn on/off than the classic Fire.  The speakers are louder than the classic and still sound great for a tablet, a huge selling point for me.I have used my classic Fire for a little over a year and would have preferred they kept that design adding the better components along with the on-device volume controls.  The new volume controls are nice to have but were designed badly and are not easy to use like they should be.  I preferred the top mounted speakers over the back mounted ones, but so far the back mounted ones have sounded great in any position so they may have done the right thing here.  As with the classic Fire the placement of the power cord slot is just bad and annoying alot of the time, mounting it either to the left or right would help.  The middle is just in the way if you are actively trying to use the device.I honestly feel I would have been happy with any of these devices as the differences are not as major as the reviews may present them.  The main thing I learned from all this research is that Apple seems to have a business model to encourage there customers to replace there devices frequently (I believe there will be an I-pad mini 2 soon, with the A6 processor and the Retina display, I probably would have purchased an I-pad mini if it had those two upgrades even at a higher price) where I don't feel the same about the other 2 brands.There are alot more people happy with Amazon customer service than Apple customer service.  I have never had ANY problems with an Amazon purchase that Amazon did not resolve in a timely matter to my satifaction.  You will not find that kind of praise about Apple customer service.Update 30 Nov 2012I've used the Fire HD long enough to add a few comments.  First the gryoscope used to orient the display in vertical or landscape mode needs some serious attention, hopefully it can be corrected with software updates.  As it is now I'm opening my case and seeing one orientation and when I try to swipe to unlock it the orientation swaps on me.  I am getting used to it but its an annoying fuction of my HD as of this morning.I also started to experience speaker issues, so I called there help desk and a hard reboot fixed the problem (hold the power button down for 20 seconds).  I must be having an off day that I did not try this without calling them but it happens.  Over the last year I've had to perform maybe 5-6 hard reboots on the classic Fire to corrent software issues.I received my case (rooCASE Origami Dual-View, worth the $8.88 I paid for it but you get what you pay for) a few days ago and was concerned the case would reduce the sound on the speaks.  I was pleasently surprised that it did not seem to change noticable.  Another interesting thing about the speakers, they actually sound better sitting on a hard surface to allow the sound to bounce off.  When put on a carpet like material they sound pretty bad with the carpet absorbing and not reflecting alot of the sound.Once I got the case the power buttons are not as annoying anymore with the Fire HD powering on when you open the case and powering off when you close it.I'm still happy with my purchase but I'd have preferred they kept the classic Fire's design and just added the upgrades.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great ereader", "Author": "William Caldwell", "ReviewID": "R3JARC9710VNT4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If Amazon had given this access to the Google Play store and allowed some customization, I would still own it.

I have been using it daily and overall think it is a very nice item.  I have a 2nd generation kindle that I love for reading books.  I plan to keep it and still use it for that purpose (at least for now) as I like screen display of the original kindle.The Fire HD has an absolutely GORGEOUS display...my wife has an iPad first generation and an iPhone 4s.  The Kindle Fire HD's dislpay is similar or better than the iPhone 4S (better actually because the screen size is larger).The major beef I have with the Kindle Fire HD is that the screen is rather small to my liking, however I basically am going to use it (as other reviewers have cited) as a media device.  I'll surf the internet while watching TV at night (so I won't have to steal my wife's iPad---which is probably why she got me the Kindle Fire HD in the first place), read my books at times, check e-mail and maybe watch some movies.Viewing movies from Amazon Prime is very simple and the audio and display are awesome.  The ability to obtain IMDB information easily while viewing the movie is a real plus as well.  Similarly viewing movies from YouTube is a pleasure with the display and audio.I do not find the interface with the various applications, web, videos, etc as intuitive as on the iPad but I am getting used to it.  Again the Kindle is NO WHERE CLOSE to being a true tablet computer and is NOT an iPad in terms of functionality or availability of apps to download.  Skype is nice and ePocrates drug database is very good.My camera did not function at first on the device but I contacted Amazon customer service and had to do a 'reboot' that seemed to fix the problem, so now my wife and I can skype easily (me with my Kindle Fire HD and she with her iPhone 4S).I would STRONGLY recommend shelling out the bucks to get a case for the device and a stylus.  The keyboard is rather small and if you are going to do any typing (at least with my fat fingers) you will be hitting 2 keys at once even holding it in landscape format.  The stylus (Belkin Professional Capacitive Tip Stylus for Kindle Fire, Black) has made responding to e-mails on the Kindle Fire HD a much more pleasent experience.  The case (Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" Standing Leather Case, Ink Blue) makes the device easier to hold and protects it well.  I LOVE the fact that the case will automatically turn off and turn on the device with closing or opening the cover.  Before I got the case I just could NEVER remember where the on/off button was located on the Kindle Fire HD as all the buttons are flush with the device so I was stroking all over the edges to try to find the buttons...now I don't need to worry.So bottom line:  It is no iPad but it is a very slick and functional device and will work very well for its intended uses...plus it is a wonder to behold its display and very easy to carry due to its size.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "bing", "ReviewID": "R1FNN45LAW1O44", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the third Kindle Fire HD I bought from Amazon. The first two are only 16 GB but they perform very well and so far very happy with both. I bought them for my children. I finally decided to buy one for myself. But this one is a big disappointment for me. I decided to get a 32 GB this time and this piece of crap freezes up with me all the time. I have no problem with it when it comes to watching a movie or listening to music but my biggest problem is reading books. When I open a certain book that I want to read. It freezes up every time. It keeps saying, \"Amazon kindle Fire is not responding. If it happens once in a while which it does with my other kindles, that would be fine but this one it freezes every time I open the book. I have two choices with this one, return it and get a refund or replace it. I haven't decided yet because I am just not happy right now.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Updated Version", "Author": "J. Friedman \"JF\"", "ReviewID": "R48CRDKV7EGID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the chance to check out a friend's advanced copy of the 7\" version, and used it all day long. I really like this device.DESIGN - I really like how the shortcut bar switches to the right side of the screen when you turn it to landscape mode, so you wont have to look for them. Landscape mode already uses up more vertical space so putting these buttons on the bottom in landscape mode would be silly. It's a bit weird that the home button is now on the right instead of left, but hey, that's fine with me as long as you're not using my landscape space.FEEL - the fire HD was designed very well this time around. It has a soft touch back which looks very pleasant. wider bezel, and is extremely light. It is somewhat thick - definitely thicker than the ipad, but the 8.9 version. It is bigger than the original fire and has nice curved edges which makes it much easier to hold than the original fire. It looks very sharp!!! It has volume buttons, a MAJOR improvement on the original fire as well.SOUND - the sound is clear and fantastic and comes out very crisp. The fire uses dolby digital audio which comes out very clearly. Dolby knows what they are doing. The music plays very nicely and can be stored in the cloud which is great. Amazon allows you to import up to 250 songs which is not very much, but what can you do?SOFTWARE - the device has new programs such as x-ray which is great to learn more about books and movies, and FreeTime which is fantastic for kids.The platform is Android 4.0, but this is Amazon's customized version of the platform. It is based solely to sell products so don't think of this device primarily as a iPad replacement - folks, think of it more as a faster way to line amazon's pockets with other purchases that you will almost certainly make through the device. The home screen is not customizable with widgets, live wallpapers, weather apps, etc., the way an android screen is.Immersive reading is a new feature that allows you to play an audiobook while reading the screen - you can read and listen at the same time, or if you're bored with reading, just listen. I love having the option. They do well with the sound here using the new Dolby digital feature - that is just super neat and not expected in a tablet!While x-rays for movies is super cool, I got bored of it quickly. I enjoy learning about interesting features of the movie, but after the first time, I just want to enjoy the movie.The idea of FreeTime is great for my kids. My daughter can play with her games, and I know she is not doing other things because of the bright, vibrant blue background color of the screen which I can easily ascertain with a quick glance. I can lock them down on time so they can share with each other. Most importantly, the new fire HD is built tougher, so we'll see how my kids fare with it once they introduce the new service.The browser runs very nicely. It seems to run faster than the original fire did. I can turn full screen on or their new \"reading view\" which eliminates all the background junk that wastes space.Movie and book titles show up the same way the original fire did, in a library look which seems to work well for Amazon's needs. It displays your titles easily and clearly and allows you to find what you are looking for quickly. The whispersync feature was a great idea - it lets you access your content on any device, so I was able to download a book on the fire HD and see it on my original kindle fire and my iPad's kindle app. Now they have whispersync for movies, games and audiobooks as well!!!!You can use skype which works fine on wifi - it's integrated but is not as full featured as their desktop app. You can also check email - they allow access to aol, gmail, etc. Facebook is set up with the device, and you can easily view photos as well. In short, it's a pretty full featured tablet just as all the others on the market, but at a fantastic price point.HARDWARE - The 7\" kindle HD comes in 16gb (only $200!!!) and 32gb for $50 more. There is also an 8.9\" version in the same specs for $299 and $369 respectively, as well as 32gb and 64gb ($500/$600) with LTE versions, plus you can get a fantastic 250mb data plan for only $50 a year on the LTE version.The 7\" version does not include the data plan. The data plan blows away the competition. Consider any smartphone you own - for instance a Galaxy S 2 - you have to pay at least $10 a month premium for the data plan alone, and this is only $50 a year! Not to mention the data plan includes 20gb cloud storage and a $10 Amazon app store credit!It has dual band wi-fi that makes it much faster than the competition. It also has an amazing screen and dolby digital sound! The processor is 1.2 Ghz (I remember when computers were only megabytes...) which is almost as fast as my desktop PC... time to upgrade... :)It is a capacitative touch screen with fantastic resolution. The video playback is 720p. The device also has bluetooth and HDMI out, as well as text to speech which is great for my blind friend. It comes pre-registered to my account which is a good and a bad thing. I have to be sure not to give it to anyone else without undoing that! It also has a USB 2.0 and 3.5mm stereo jack. It has an accelerometer and gyroscope and front facing HD camera with built in microphone for Skype!I was able to check out the cover which has a nice leather grain. The interior is made of nylon which has a bit of a plasticky feel. I love the iPad 3 magnetic locking feature and they seem to have utilized that here which turns the device off (sleep) when you close it, and turns it on when you open it. Simple. Uncomplicated.SCREEN - They have reduced the screen glare on the device using IPS technology, a polarizing filter and anti-glare, which is pretty nice. I don't have as much trouble seeing it in direct sunlight. Also, the screen is much sharper and crisper than the original fire. I can lay the screen down flat on the table and still see what's being played pretty well. The color is vibrant and the magazines show up fantastic similar to the iPad's retina screen.PERFORMANCE - I noticed sometimes that, while the device ran super smoothly and faster than the original, occasionally it would run a bit more slowly. Sometimes I would touch an app or icon on the screen, and it did not load immediately, something I'm very used to. I also saw that when I was launching a big movie it would take a while.Overall, it runs much faster than my current kindle fire. It has a hardware called MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) which is increased antennas that work together to transfer data and improve data performance without taking up more unnecessary power or even adding any bandwidth to the spectrum! It uses all antennas provided to improve the connection quality as well. Not only that, the processor needed can be the same one without requiring an updated one.Downloads are pretty fast. I have Prime so I am able to run movies and shows for free and they ran fantastic on the device. On Wifi they just scream. Much better than my iPad 3. I was able to get about just over 9 hours of battery life with VERY heavy usage, they say over 11 but that did not happen for me. It charges pretty fast - it took only a few hours using their \"powerfast\" charger.ADVERTISING - The device DOES have advertising, which is displayed on the lock screen only. I found this did not bother me too much, but now Amazon allows you to pay $15 to turn this feature off. If you care so much, then you probably should not be wearing that shirt with the polo logo on it. I'm sure most of you don't and would rather spend that $15 on a new app for the device.OPENING THE BOX - It has a USB 2.0 cable and the quick start guide, as well as the tablet itself. I wish it came with the power adapter up front. I would have to go out and buy one - the iPad comes with one so why not this device?  I would rather pay the extra price up front, although I guess it's better to have the option than the choice made for me. The micro-USB cable is nice for plugging it into the computer. No headphones, although I just plugged mine in from my iPad and was fine.WARRANTY - this comes with Amazon's 1 year limited warranty but you can buy a 2 year warranty as well.ACCESSORIES - You get a $3 mp3 credit with any kindle accessory you buy, so that's a bonus. You can and probably should buy two products with the device. Most importantly, pick up a powerfast charger which allows for superfast charging in only 4 hours and costs $20 which is not unreasonable. Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging (for all Kindle Fire models, not included with device). You can also get the leather case I mentioned. Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" Standing Leather Case, Onyx Black (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\"). It's $45 which is expensive for a case or you could just buy from one of the manufacturers already out there such as Marware Marware EcoVue Genuine Leather Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\", Purple (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\") or Belkin Belkin Quilted Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\", Ruby (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\"), most of which are a tad cheaper and DO have the magnetic auto-open and close feature.CONS - No GPS (makes sense - this is just a wifi version). No charger included. No microSD port. No rear camera (most have dual cams now). You are stuck with Amazon's app store - google play is so much better and has more apps!Price is great but you still need a charger and probably a case. Definitely a worthwhile buy if you are looking for a functional tablet and you want to be at the forefront of the technology line.***UPDATE 11/23/12 - I also compared this device with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" version so feel free to check out my review there: http://www.amazon.com/review/RM0EJRMDXSQ9W/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permThanks for reading!!!***", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "UPDATE:  Thank you for listening to your customers", "Author": "LV415", "ReviewID": "R5F5GOA4HHQ32", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NOTE:  I've totally updated my review to be fair to Amazon based on the current state of the device and its marketing...THANK YOU, Amazon, for being more upfront about the \"special offers\" and for allowing us to shut off the recommendations...I was hoping the favorites would be returned to the bottom of the screen (as with the original Fire) since the homepage now seems barren, but I'll take barren over the barrage of recommendations.Although my speakers sound great, a family member is on their second one and both have the speaker issue.  I question whether this is a software issue because, if there were a bug, wouldn't everyone be experiencing it?Based on Amazon's response to customer feedback allowing us to switch off the recommendations, I'm upping my review to 3 stars.  If the on/off button were easier to find and showed the charging status (like the original Fire), the HD supported Flash (like the original Fire), the navigation were less clunky (like the original Fire), and the device sat more logically within the case for powering on/off and charging (like the original Fire), it would easily garner a 4 or 5.

I thought it would be light and flimsy like the older Kindle but this has a nice feel and is built solidly.  I was expecting a format more in the line of the iPad & iPod that I already own but it is totally different and somewhat convoluted with too many maneuvers to find your way around instead of the one screen as with the iPad.  I found it the Apple products simple to teach my 'senior' friends the iPad but I won't even venture to explain anything with the Kindle.I'm sure in time that there will be updates and improvements in the OS to simplify things.  The side button to wake it up is annoying especially because it goes to sleep too fast.  I have changed the timing on the turn off but it goes from 1 minute then the next is 5+ minutes.  I don't want 5 minutes because when I  forget it's on, it won't turn off until 5 minutes.  You can hit the side button but if you put it down to do something else, you don't want to turn it off in a minute because you will have to start all over.As I said, this is great for the money but by reading other reviews I didn't get much of a heads up on the downside.  The Apps  that I use are hardly as good as anything on the iPad.  Then again how much do you want to pay?  I got a beautiful cover/case with a stylus on Ebay for $10 delivered too.

I debated on purchasing either the iPad mini, or the kindle fire hd.  I ended up with the Fire and am very happy with my purchase. I do however understand some of the frustrations others have stated.  Most important point when trying to decide Fire or Mini is: WHAT ARE YOU PRIMARILY GOING TO USE IT FOR?If you want a tablet that is super smooth and has lots of apps and will primarily use it for surfing the web, then I would say spend the extra $$$ and go for the iPad mini.If, on the other hand, reading content is what you are primarily interested in, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HD.With an Amazon Prime Membership and a Kindle device, you will have access to some great reading and video material at superb pricing.  (Of course  much of this would also be available on an iPad device), but a lot of the really discounted and free material is only available on a kindle device.  Because I already have an iPhone  and iPad and computer that can do everything I want it to do app and web  wise- it made better sense for me to go with the Fire.  I wanted a simpler READING device that would fit in my purse and that I could feed my reading obsession without breaking the bank.  I got a tablet with beautiful graphics and sound and access to all kinds of free/discounted books and videos (with my Amazon Prime account) that I simply would not have been able to get with the iPad mini.  For me it was more about good deals on CONTENT- which I feel like I get with the Kindle Fire HD.I do not prefer to web surf much on the fire- if that is what you want, then it may not be the best choice for you.  However, if reading is your primary use, you will love the fire.  I prefer it over my iPad or iPhone for reading my daily newspapers, magazine, books and singles from amazon. I love that I can \"borrow\" a book each month completely free with my Prime membership.  I love its portability and it is easier to do all my Amazon shopping on.  And- I just could not beat the price- with an American Express special I got mine for 149.99.  Great Deal all around.In short, it's not a \"do it all\" kind of tablet- it is more of an amazon content  reading/shopping/video device that is a really good deal - especially if combined with a Prime membership.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A story of good and bad with Kindle Fire HD 7 inch", "Author": "Kentucky Rob", "ReviewID": "R3DBJKGX6ZFH7I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this a few months ago after my nexus 7 was ahem borrowed by a stranger. I was very pleased with the nexus but it had some glitch issues which were annoying like shutting down out of the blue.Since I had a Prime membership I thought I would give this a try versus buying another nexus 7. What made my decision was the amazon ecosystem and dolby surround speakers as the nexus has mono horrible sound.At first I was very pleased but then bugs and glitches started showing up centered around the Silk browser. When your entire system is built around the internet you can't have a bad browser and silk is really bad. If you like posting on forums forget about it. The keyboard for silk erases words as you type. Meaning you type a word it vanishes and you retype it ten times and the eleventh it stays. You get my drift?Overall it is worth the cheap 200 price but sad to say barely worth 200. Here are pro's and con's.ProDolby speakers sound good and better then Nexus. They are not bose by any means.Screen is high resolution and looks great.Amazon ecosystem so in that area it is highly functional.Screen is gorilla glass so resists scratchingConSlow and sluggish. Go to a web page it takes 7 sec to load. Scroll up or down and you get checkerboard as it thinks and renders the page. Unacceptable in 2013 that is 90's stuff.Silk Browser is broken and the keyboard is unusable.Not free and open like Nexus as amazon locked it to their ecosystem.Doesn't play flash without side loading (not their fault Adobe's fault)Recently glitch where WIFI stops out of blue. Looked online and this is happening everywhere. Where is the fix Amazon?Ads on your start page. It doesn't bother me but I paid for this device I shouldn't have forced ads on the start page.Conclusion. With Nexus 7 and KFHD being the same price and having used both extensively the Nexus 7 is your better purchase. It is FAST and responsive where as the kindle is slow, sluggish and kind of broken. If you have Prime and want it for Amazon stuff it works for the price but Nexus 7 should be 3 or 400 dollars and KFHD seems worth about 150 bucks.If Amazon patches the bugs for SILK and the WIFI I will update and bump up a star. Until then it is frustrating to use which is sad.UPDATE:It has been bit and I have seen no update to fix the lingering problems facing all KFHD users. The wifi now must be reset each day or you cannot use the web. When you type into a dialogue box using the Silk browser it erases your words as you type making it impossible to use forums of any type.Amazon please fix the WIFI glitch and the horrible, horrible Silk browser keyboard glitch!", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Currently an APPLE girl but really LOVE my Kindle Fire HD!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Hankins", "ReviewID": "R2EEKBN1SB85E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my device for over 6 months and STILL love it and am VERY happy with my purchase.

I used my laptop mostly for extreme couponning. I was delighted that I could now combine my love of reading with what I did on my laptop. I absolutely love my KFHD!Let me start with my one major complaint.  There is no way to categorize all of my books! It is my understanding that there is one app available, but it's new and they are still working on getting all the bugs out. This is a huge problem for me as I have over 160 books in my library. I've contacted Amazon about this issue and I'm waiting to hear back from them.Some of the complaints I've seen in the reviews have been issues about the camera. I learned this is a quick,easy & free fix. Download the free app called ES file.  You will find it in the Amazon App store. Once you've got it, open it up look under apps & you will find your camera. Once you open the camera you will be able to take photos. I learned this from a book I borrowed from the lending library. I will edit this review and add the title of the book.The only other complaint was minor & May just be my lack of knowledge.  I miss having a note app available while I am on a website. It came in handy for making my grocery list.I would highly recommend this to my friends & family.The name of the book I learned so much with is called, Kindle Fire HD User's Guide Book: Unleash the power of your tablet.

Obviously, if you do not enjoy reading or watching movies, this is not the product for you.  Originally, I didn't think I wanted one as I enjoy actually physically holding a book...flipping the pages, etc.  But...after seeing a Kindle and physically using one, I was hooked and bought my own.  We will now be a \"Kindle Family\" as I also have two more under the tree for my daughters for Christmas. I was a little disappointed that with Kindle Prime you can only \"borrow\" one book a month as there are some months that I can go through two or three books. I have halted on purchasing this as I find it may be cheaper to just pay to \"rent\" the books I want as often as I want without paying nearly $80 to be limited on the amount I read unless I want to pay more.  I also bought a cover for my Kindle but I did not buy a Kindle brand.  My cover fits perfectly and looks great for $15 compared to the brand name cover for $40. I definitely recommend buying a cover and screen protector though as it is a finger smudge prone product as is any touch screen device.

Its so easy to use, watching movies on it is a dream, and the sound system is amazing. The screen is so clear and the HD is unparalleled. My only complaint is that it takes FOREVER to charge.

It only comes with a USB/Micro USB connector, that can be used to charge it.I already had a charger that plugs into a socket. I have been using that, and even though it is faster to charge with the wall charger, it still takes at minimum 5 hours. that is a ridiculously long time.

I would have rated 5 stars but for this:1. No slot for external memory card2. Sometimes when streaming video (Netflix) the picture freezes momentarily, for a couple of frames, then catches up. Barely noticeable but I notice it. Not a big deal and may be related to my connection speed at home.3. No fast charger included. Not a biggie, the charging cables are the same for my Android phone so I can use the phone charger at home and in my car to charge the Kindle (actually a plus.) My house current phone charger seems to take a long time (about 5 hours) to fully charge the Kindle (I'll update later about that.)4. No support for Flash so the Silk browser won't play YouTube videos. There are apps that convert YouTube videos to a Kindle friendly format but you have to download the videos first before viewing, no streaming. The upside is when you download those videos you can view them off line.5. WiFi only, no cellular option.6. No rear facing camera.What you get for the price is pretty great.Here's the good: Very nice display. I have been watching videos and surfing the web on my Droid Razr (when away from my iMac) but the kindle display is about 3 times larger and more visually friendly. I've been an Amazonophile for many years and appreciate that the Kindle is fully integrated with the Amazonosphere. The free Amazon Prime for a month after purchase (registration) is a plus and I will probably renew my lapsed Amazon Prime account again when the free offer expires. I am hoping that Amazon Prime streaming videos will soon rival Netflix's offerings to sweeten the deal.Registering the Kindle was easy and setting up Twitter, Facebook, Skype, and all my email accounts etc. was a snap; very intuitive and no brainer.All in all, I am very satisfied with my purchase. I considered the Google Nexus but chose the Kindle because of the integration with Amazon. I waited to make this purchase until the new mini iPad came out.

I wanted a travel computer that would double as a reader so that I could simplify the travel accessories. Well my husband has the first ipad. He likes it and I have used it a few times while we were traveling. The problems I saw with it was firstly, the weight. That thing is massive. I am not a little person, but I was not comfortable holding it in my hands for long. Secondly, it is the Apple way of doing things. The navigating on that thing is just not intuitive for me. Thirdly, the price. Woo, that's a lot of money for a travel computer and reader. So enter the Kindle Fire HD.  The reviews on Amazon have been very helpful. I must admit that I usually read the negative ones first. You get a lot of honest information from those. But I found that when I looked at what I needed it for, the Kindle Fire HD had everything I needed, plus a lot more. At a price that was very reasonable. So I bought it.  I like the size. I considered waiting for the new Kindle to come out, but I like the size of the original one for travel. I like that weight. It is heavier than a Kindle keyboard, but that is to be expected. It houses a great little computer. I was able to start my email right away. I was able to access my books. I pulled up a couple of movie trailers to see what that was like. Great. I plan to rent a few movies for a long plane trip soon. I'm excited. Surfing the net is really easy and the Kindle remembers the sights you like to look at.  Did I mention the picture. It is amazing. The sound is great. The book print quality is really nice and easy to use.  A lot of reviewers mentioned the ads from Amazon. Well if you are an Amazon shopper anyway, why worry. If the item is something you are not interested in, ignore it.  I bought the cover for the Kindle fire. It works well. It is sturdy and sleek.  Overall, this is a travel companion that I will enjoy a lot.

My journey started with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 which was ok for a little while but soon began to be riddled with bugs in the software, and Samsung support is not the best, so I returned it. Low and behold, the Nexus 7 which I couldn't wait to get my hands on. I went through four of them in the time span that I had one, each with its own unique manufacturing defect. I thought Samsung support was bad until I dealt with Google (for the first 15 days) and then Asus after that. Complete nightmare, and no solutions to be had, they just kept replacing it with more faulty units.So now my journey is here, the Kindle Fire HD, also my first Amazon Kindle product of any kind.The design is decent, the rubber back is good for grip, and I prefer it over the very easily scratched iPad backing. The screen is quite nice, very vibrant and much brighter; it also has deeper colors than the Nexus 7, which always appeared washed out. It is a smidgen heavier than the competition, but weight is not something that I put a whole lot of stock in myself. The thicker bezel also really doesn't bother me, seems to fit my fingers nicely, so no complaints from me there.The power and volume buttons are a complete pain to find and use. The camera is the only way that you can tell which way is up, and in the dark you just fumble around the device until you feel the slightest hint of a bump and then press to see where you are.Software seems fairly snappy and responsive, with the exception of web browsing. I have to say that I am not at all impressed with the Silk web browser, it just seems slow and makes web surfing cumbersome; also doesn't scroll well at all. Really wish they had a nice third party browser like Dolphin available in the AppStore.I haven't figured out how to get my iTunes based music on it yet, but that isn't a huge deal, can't figure everything out right off the bat.Software is not the most intuitive, I find myself wandering around looking for a specific function quite a bit, also needs \"one touch\" access to the AppStore instead of me having to punch in 3 or 4 different places to get there. Would also like to see a bit more of a customizable home screen vs. the carousel. Many of the \"thumbnails/previews\" on the carousel look grainy and blurry and it just makes the experience feel cheap.Email and QuickOffice work very nicelyVideos look really good on the device and it seems to stream Netflix and Hulu+ rather nicely.The ads don't bother me a bit, in fact some of them are pretty good, will be interesting to see if they are tailored towards me after some time with the device.Also, it should come with a power adaptor, I shouldn't have to split time between devices with my iPhone's power plug. Nexus 7 came with an adaptor, and it is in the exact same price point.Although it may seem like a lot of griping, I actually do like the device, and am finding it enjoyable for the most part. This is a nice HD entertainment device that does a fair job of standing up to the competition. This review was more about genuine areas where I feel the device needs a bit of improvement, but overall I have a decent first impression of the device.UPDATE: I am finding the device to be somewhat jumpy when it comes to games, not sure if it is a processor or RAM issue, but it isn't the smoothest tablet gaming experience I have seen.Also, seems really slow to open apps, averages a 3-5 second delay before opening, long enough delay to make you wonder if your touch even registered.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 7in", "Author": "pinkpanther", "ReviewID": "R3BJRGQT47L6GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Kindle Fire which I love, and just upgraded to a Kindle Fire HD 7in, and love it even more.

It is a little wider than the original more like a shrunken version of an ipad but still light enough to hold with one hand for a little while.

For me it's got good weight and while I liked the  slightly smaller size of the original Kindle Fire, I realize that we've now got a front facing camera as well as a microphone which has to be accommodated. Undoubtedly there are changes inside that required a bit more room.Even so, the KFHD7 still fits into my front pants pocket even with the Amazon case which is really well crafted and is covered in leather. I know some have questioned that but rest assured, that is leather and the craftsmanship is great. The only thing I'd change about the Amazon case would be to have some way to have it held open so as not to put stress on the hinge.This is a minor issue for me.The screen is incredible. I took it to where I work to get the opinion of the technicians I work with. The company I work for produces digital motion picture equipment so when I was told by them that the display was \"incredible\", I take that at face value.The sound also is impressive. In fact, one of the guys in our IT department lamented that it was much better than his Nexus 7. Not slamming the Nexus 7 but I have to agree, my sound is better.I've found that my music loads and plays almost immediately, just like on my original KF.Netflix also works incredibly well.I was a bit disappointed that the Need for Speed app would not run on the new KFHD7 but that's really an  issue with the developer (EA) not Amazon. Besides, over the years, I've had games not play on the new OS's that come out for my PC but again, this is a minor annoyance.I've read some reviews that say there is a problem with the Silk browser. Mine works really well so I'm thinking that perhaps this may just be a matter of tweaking router settings to get the full speed out of it.I'm still not a huge fan of the carousel but this version of it looks and performs a  lot better than the original did.Lock screen ads are not a problem for me. I see them for a second and then the screen is unlocked. It's certainly not a big enough deal to shell out $15 to \"fix\".  Suggestions for what other people purchased also do not bother me. I just ignore them after I scroll through them. \"Problem\" solved.Regarding the KFHD7 shipping without a charger, I have at least three of them around the house. They work just fine and I don't see that they charge the KFHD7 any slower than the original KF. Then again, I usually charge it while I'm sleeping so again this is a non-issue.THANK YOU AMAZON FOR INCLUDING BLUTOOTH SUPPORT!!! I have dusted off my Motorola Rokr's and am pleased with the performance!This may not be the perfect tablet for everyone but it does indeed do what I need it to do and that's what's important to me.Bottom line (for me) is that this is a great tablet for the price and Amazon has done an amazing job with it.Your mileage may vary ;-)", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love the Kindle Fire HD", "Author": "Simone Loren", "ReviewID": "R1Z1ITLM788BND", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've noticed a lot of complaints about the Kindle Fire HD, specifically most people complain about the \"ads\", so I would like to address this first.

The pros first- Very portable, great picture and sound quality, very convenient especially for Amazon prime members to order books, movies and music. The build and  finish of the tablet is pretty good- the screen is made of some kind of gorilla glass which makes it scratch resistant and durable and the back is soft and rubberized for a comfortable grip. It is lightweight and the dimensions are just right in my opinion.The cons are- Battery life is terrible. This is one aspect of the tablet that needs help. I did not see too many complaints about this because I am assuming people are just happy with the price. The battery levels enters the red zone after about 1.5 hours of reading a book and 40 min. to an hour doing anything else which includes videos, music or just browsing. It is plain irritating when you have to worry about battery life when reading a book. The tablet tends to heat up when charging too.End result I have returned the Kindle Fire and bought an Ipad 3.

The advantages of the Samsung is that is has GPS, an operating system that allows both the Amazon App Store and Google Play and what is just great is the ability to use it as an IR remote control for your tv.

Mark", "ReviewID": "R1N7WNNRUZ8PF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use my tablet for work, church, and personal. I am an Orthodox Priest, who also maintains a secular job, and the Kindle Fire HD is a great tool to have around. The 7\" form factor makes it easy to carry around (even in a pocket).First off: WorkThe KFHD allows me to connect to our Exchange server flawlessly. I also connect to our local wireless network, via secure access. I use CalenGoo for calendering software, because it actually displays event text on the screen, not just the time. I have really begun to like WPS Office for document editing, along with Office Suite Pro. Evernote is one of my best friends for meetings, and I round it off with the Citrix Receiver when I need to get to my desktop or servers remotely.Second: ChurchOur liturgical texts are often in PDF format, so I use RepliGo PDF Reader, especially because it has a text re-flow option. I am often typing my homily notes using a portable Bluetooth keyboard. I also have a bunch of liturgical documents that I store locally and in the cloud. I use the web browser for research, and often am playing sacred music from the player. Amazon bookstore has quite a few church books, including the Orthodox Study Bible (of course), but also other books as well, that I love to have for reference and spiritual reading. The other really cool thing about this tablet, is that the Kindle book app (after all this is first and foremost a Kindle), will now do text to speech (which the original Kindle Fire was missing). I often use the special email address that Amazon gives you to email documents to the device (It also converts it to the Kindle format)Third: HomeMy children are often wanting to play games (o.k. me as well), so I have the usual assortment (especially Angry Bird - Star Wars!), I haven't tried out FaceTime, but I'm glad its there. Of course, it also seamlessly connects to my Gmail Accounts and syncs the email, calendar, and contacts (by the way, this is fantastically improved over the original Kindle Fire). I have Pandora going a lot, and TuneIn radio. The social media apps are there as well (I don't do much of these), but I have Skyped, and used Facebook to talk with people.Other thoughts:I have read of other people disliking the Fire interface, but I have found that I like it better (much better) than the stock Android UI. I have had and have used other Android tablets and have a Droid phone, so I am no stranger to Android (I have rooted every device I've owned). The KFHD interface is just easier to use, especially for those that only occasionally use tablets or that are not geeks. The Amazon App Store does have a limited selection compared to the Google Play, but I have yet to not find an app that I have needed. The battery life is good, and the screen is amazing (bright and very clear). The sound is the best I've seen in any tablet. The device feels and looks well made. I have used the HDMI port to display video on our TV, and you will like that it has 16gb of memory.Amazon still has yet to get the power, and volume buttons right, and it would be nice to have GPS. Buy a wall charger right off the bat, or use the one that came with your phone.The KFHD is a great device, and I would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Kindle yet, better than the first Fire -- and could be the best tablet out there, period.", "Author": "Rich Levin \"RBL\"", "ReviewID": "R3IYKT9UBXW6P6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new Kindle Fire HD fixes many of the problems I experienced with the original Fire.

Amazon's take on Android is far more user friendly, simpler, and consistent.Yes, there are fewer apps available. But the apps are higher quality. And more apps are coming online every day. I have been able to find a solution for every app requirement I need.If you're a heavy Amazon, the Fire HD is a no-brainer. It's seamless integration with the Amazon ecosystem is excellent. If you're torn between a Nexus and a Fire HD, try both in a local store. You'll be using the Fire in seconds, while you'll have to configure the daylights out of the Nexus before you can get anything done.

It was between the Kindle and the Nexus 7.  I decided on the Kindle mostly because of Amazon Prime.  About $6 a month for movies, tv, one book rental a month, and two day shipping?  I mean the Nexus has nothing like that.  You want movies, tv, or books on the Nexus you have to buy them all a la carte.The small cons of the Kindle Fire are as follows:Not really the full Android experience, so if you expect the navigation to be the same as your android phone you will be disappointed.  This also means you buy your apps through Amazon not Google Play store.  And from my experience Amazon does not offer the same amount of apps as the Play store.  I would say somewhere between 60%-70%.That really wasn't a big deal for me.

I just wanted something inexpensive that I could check facebook and e-mail. The kindle has so many fun (and many free) games and apps that you can get. When it first came I had to get used to how it differs from lap top (which is what I usually used). You have to go to the Amazon shop (which is built in to the kindle - you just click on 'shop' in the menu on top) and download apps for facebook and magazines that you have subscriptions to. Also it doesn't come with a wall charger it comes with one that you have to plug into a laptop to charge your kindle (it is very slow and inconvenient). You can order the wall charger for around $10.00 but it seems like it should come with it because if you aren't at home you may not be able to charge it with the accompanying charger - that was probably my only disappointment with my purchase. I think most people would be willing to pay the extra $10 and have the charger come with the kindle. I LOVE MY AMAZON KINDLE - it is now my favorite toy. I can play games, read my magazines, do my bible study and every day I learn of more apps that I can download that are fun and/or useful!

I find this absolutely ridiculous and don't feel like shelling out $20 for the stupid plug.-the software seems kinda buggy...mine keeps shutting down for no reason.

Apps also take a little time to get moving and I really wish there could be support for some other browser because theirs seems super slow. I'm going to use it extensively this weekend and if the problem persists I'm going to call them and ask if it's a software thing or a defective product and will take it from there.-The volume rocker is super awkward...I can't press it without having to search for it because it's flush with the device.  I'm sure I'll get used to using it but right now it's pretty annoying.-Certain apps available through the amazon app store on my phone aren't available on here...a vital one for me is dropbox, which I can access off of my android phone through their app store but I can't get it for the kindle.  This really sucks, I'm a college student and me and my friends exchange files through here constantly and I access a lot of important docs through it.

I thought I'd be getting the same Kindle Fire experience with better sound quality, better graphics, faster Wifi, more storage space, etc.  I had hoped to transfer my Kindle Fire aps to the Kindle Fire HD, and deregister my Kindle Fire so I could give it to a friend or sell it for a cheaper price.  What I didn't realize is not all Kindle Fire aps are compatible with the HD system.  I also didn't know I would lose my game scores as well as any virtual items I had purchased -with real cash -when I transferred the aps from one system to the other or attempted to sync the devices.  Hopefully Amazon can and will remedy this matter soon.  Until then I have to keep and use my Kindle Fire to access the aps and games I purchased that aren't compatible with the HD device.Like everyone else I am disappointed that Amazon did not provide a free wall charger with the HD device.  The wall charger costs $9.99 or $19.99 depending on purchase time.  It should be noted the HD device does include a PC USB for charging purposes, but I believe a wall charger is much more convenient for a mobile device.  With this said, I did find out later that my Kindle Fire wall charger can be utilized to charge my Kindle Fire HD.  I now have another reason to keep both devices.Finally, I am hummed that I have to pay $15 times two to remove unwanted advertisements from my daughter's device and my device.  Some people don't mind the \"offers \" but I find them to be intrusive and annoying.  They're like spam that can't be deleted or contained in one folder.  I also wonder what affect the advertisements have on the device and how much of my purchased space will be used before the advertisements are removed from the device.All in all the Kindle Fire HD has some great features.

I've found the physical experience with the tablet to be quite enjoyable: I can use it one handed; It is not overtly heavy; and (perhaps most importantly) it's compact size makes it more portable than other devices I have used. It fits in my purse very easily. One of my major pros as a reader is when the brightness can be adjusted. Kindle's app is great for e-reading since it is a reader. It also helps if you're watching movies late at night and don't want to wake a spouse.On to the cons.  It seems I have a lot of them, don't I? First off I'll conquer the elephant in the room...it's riding a carousel. Kindle's carousel is ridiculous. I have tried cleaning items off of it, adding items to favorites, even investigating alternative launchers (which don't appear to be available for this device yet, without rooting it, which I'm not willing to do at the moment).... I think it looks disastrous.  What would be so wrong with a plain home screen with little icons of your apps and books? I don't need all 15 of my recently synced PDFs to pop up there indefinitely, or until I go and mark them as read and then remove them again.  The favorites option doesn't seem to work - I'm trying to bookmark a few like Pandora, Facebook and the like and I'm disappointed. Amazon really could stand to improve this feature.Here is another beef I have. I paid $15 so I wouldn't have lock screen ads, but I'm stuck with random, boring, un-customizable lock screen images? I call bullshit. I love photography and some of the images are pretty, don't get me wrong, but I want to know I'm picking up MY kindle, not Suzie Sweet Briar's. That's going to happen if there's a lovely picture I put on that lock screen staring back at me. (Yes, this is if I don't happen to have a case on it. I ordered one, it didn't fit. Different review.) The OS is the leader of your user experience. It doesn't matter if I like your e-reader app. If every time I pick up my kindle I cringe at what I'm looking at, I'm not going to use my device. Sigh.In so far as the physical cons, which comprise the rest of my complaints, they consist of the following: there is no hard home button. I dislike 100% touch screen items but because of the PROS I listed before I was willing to overlook this. I like having the feature where I can double tap to hit my home page. It will take some re-training to remember to look for the little home icon. It's annoying.  The slim profile volume buttons are also irritating - you either have to look or guess which ones you are hitting because they are in line with the device. Some could say this is a pro; I consider it a nuisance to either a)always use the menus or b)look at the side to figure out which is which. Either way I'm interrupting my reading/viewing/listening experience to do something with the volume. Final con...what the heck do we need 2 ports for? 1 for syncing and charging is sufficient. It's also on the long side of the device, which is odd, and makes for odd looking cases in some situations.As of right now, I'm going to give it another week or two and see if it grows on me, or see if I can get an alternative launcher to load...but even for the size and price point, I am really hoping all of these Apple Mini reviews are true.

I rooted and then installed the android operating system; it kind of liberated the tablet. It was more responsive, but development of the community was slow because the touchpad was not that popular. Reading on the tablet was really good, but forget about reading in your bed this thing was heavy.  So I decided to sell the HP touchpad. Decided that I was either going to go for the kindle fire HD or nexus 7. I looked at both devices and I was impressed with the performance of both. But the nexus 7 was king in performance.  But what I really disliked was the screen and the storage space of the nexus 7.  So I knew I was going to use the tablet to the maximum so I went with the kindle fire hd because it offered more space. As it is now I only have 6.78 GB left after everything I have done to the tablet. Kindle fire HD \"7\" The reason why I rooted===================================I ended up rooting my kindle fire.  There are tutorials on YouTube and xda developers.  I always like rooting the cell phones and tablets I get my hands on. My hd2 was rooted so many times (rip hd2 best cell phone ever). If could I would root my ti-89 titanium.  So I could not resist myself I had to root my KFHD. Its good feeling that the community is there to help expand the horizons of the product you paid money for. That's the main reason I did not go for the ipad 3. There just so much you can do with the android platform.  There were a lot of apps missing from the kindle store so I had to root the KFHD.Performance=====================The KFHD is pretty snappy, fast I would say.  Sometimes scrolling through the carousel it stutters.  But for the majority of time it's really good. The silk browser is a total lag fest.  So just installed the dolphin browser and wow now that's fast.  Smooth scrolling and pinch to zoom in.It takes a few seconds for the YouTube app to load completely. Also Google maps takes a few seconds to locate your position. When I mean a few seconds like 10 seconds or less. I am not sure why this is happening.  After loading everything is fine.I put some movies files avi and they played fine. They played really nice with dice player.N64oid works really good on the kindle fire hd. Mario kart 64 and ps3 controller work beautifully on kindle fire HD.  Gaming overall is great on the kindle fire hd. I was playing dead trigger and I did not see any frame drop and overall enjoyable game. played mass effect infiltrator, asphalt 7 ($.99), shadowgun, and they were running fine. i will try later FPSE see how that goes.Display=======================I like the display colors pop and I like reading a lot on the screen. There is a lot of reflection with sun light so that kind of spoils the fun.  The movies look great on the display no problems here. Also games look really nice on the kindle fire hd. Overall I like the display.Holding volume down + power button at the same time takes a picture of your display.I kind of like the carousel but If could I would want my apps to just show on the main screen like normal android.  I just don't see the point to carousel.  But whatever the case adw launcher ex  is always there.Battery========================The battery last a long time.  I did not mind that they gave us a mini usb cable for the for the kindle fire hd. I used by hd2 charger for the kindle fire it charges fine and fast enough for me.  Why can't customers have the choice to change their own battery? The hp was like this, also the nexus 7.  Why are they copying apple?Sound=================Wow sound is legit on this device. Really loud. Overall really impressed on the sound. Headphone is really good too. Sound is not a problem. 5 stars.  No much to say other than amazon did it right.Camera================Camera is ok , its just whatever.  It nice that it is there. I downloaded from android market camera ics and you can take pictures and videos from the app.  Can control zoom in functions with the apps, also share via Bluetooth, and email via Gmail.Bluetooth================It limited to what it can connect. I could not connected to my ps3 Bluetooth headset.  I could not make it connect to my computer which had a Bluetooth usb. So I guess I ll need to find some devices and meeting the requirements of the KFHD7.Ads==========Ads don't bother me, but I wish they were maybe related to what I liked. But If I feel like they are in my way, since I am already rooted then I remove them manually. Was actually really funny I was showing off my kindle fire hd to someone, and as soon as I turned the kindle there was big titanic advertisement as my lock screen picture, so it was really awkward, I was like uhhhh  yeah I don't like titanic.  Maybe some gamer advertisements would be nice. Xbox 360 or ps3 gaming advertisements.Apps that work after rooting=============================Youtube  v4.1.23Gmail  v4.1.2Google earth 7.0.0.7386Google maps v6.12.0Google talkGroove ip liteCamera icsAutocad ws (looked really good on the kindle fire hd) for any engineers out thereDead trigger ( can play now with ps3 controller)Graph 89 free (like having a ti 89 titanium  but with color )Mass effect infiltratorShadow gun ( can play now with ps3 controller)N64oid (nintendo 64 emulator ( can play now with ps3 controller))Sixaxis controller now I can use my ps3 controller with kindle fire hdDice player to watch avi movies.Adw launcher ex works but if you hit home button it reverts back to the carouselAny app you can think of from the android storeOverall===========All I can say is that I like my kindle fire hd.  I really like that I put some physics books, math books, engineering books, carry them all and read on that nice display. I can then use an app like graph 89 and upload ti 89 titanium operating system on app, it kind of replaces my actual ti 89 titanium. I load some games and so far I like playing games with my ps3 controller. i watched rango, true grid, iron man 2, defiance, mission impossible, and all can say is I like the display and the sound. The performance is great but not perfect. Bluetooth left something to be desired. Rooting the device opens a lot of doors.  I would recommend the device; I would rate it over all 4 stars.  You get a free month of amazon prime.  I think I ll get the amazon prime membership was using my brother one.other notes============as jsh1120 pointed out rooting the device does void your warranty unless you can revert (in some cases you can). please research before doing anything. the youtube tutorial is fairly simple to follow, but if you have never rooted a device before this might be challenging.****Rooting the device will NOT kill your amazon prime instant video streaming capabilities******* amazon prime video streaming is working fine after rooting, i am watching my free movies just fine.update 10/6/2012=================i bought a mini hdmi to hdmi, the kindle fire hd looks really good on the tv, it amazing, i was able to play some n64 games with the ps3 controller in the big tv. brought some nostalgia memories.search youtube \"kindle fire hd Rooted with google apps\" i uploaded this video showing what kindle can do, please note is laggy because i was recording through vnc, and i had no camera.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "kindlelover83", "ReviewID": "R1XSJQT5CXKMOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved this as an early birthday present from my husband.

I wondered what they could improve, at the $199  price point, that would be significant enough for me to care. WELL. . . . it turns out, quite a lot!  I'm not going to talk about any of the \"tech specs\" because hundreds have spoken of that already and you can read their reviews.The HD, screen size, duel speakers, lovely glass and  beveled sides, give the device a really luxurious feel.It feels almost like a small version of the iPad.I have a pretty extensive library of books (I think over 3,000) and a few apps, so when I turned it on, it took a while to load up everything and I thought something was wrong. Also I think initially the Special Offers took a bit to load, now it's VERY fast, smooth and responsive.  It seems to be more sensitive than the original.  I'm a long time Apple fan and have both iPad1 and iPad3. The touch sensitivity seems the same to me between iPad and the KFHD.  I like to use a stylus and I found that when flipping through the carousel the finger worked better, because using the stylus, it would open books that I wasn't trying to open.  With practice, I don't see that as being a problem, it's just a lighter touch than the original Fire.I like the special offers.  At first I was annoyed with the \"similar to titles you purchased\" items at the bottom of the carousel, but then decided I liked it, I have discovered many new book/authors from this feature in the Amazon store, so I've decided that it's a good thing!Kindle Fire HD, exceeded my expectations and I've very happy with my purchase!", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet if you are a casual user", "Author": "Eric D", "ReviewID": "R1US21UADAWGTK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the kindle fire hd for fun really. I have a new ipad I use for productivity and studying, so I meant this to be a smaller way to read news and books, watch videos, play games, and browse the web. I find that it has performed admirably for everything I wanted to use it for.Pros:The screen is great quality, even next to my retina ipad. I actually feel like the viewing angles might be slightly better on the kindle fire hd.The device is thin and has a very good build quality. Very easy to hold with one hand.It is easy to get and consume content (of course, since this IS what amazon designed it for).Great battery life, great wifi reception/speeds, ease of use and setup.Cons:Side bezels are too wide in portrait mode, makes typing a little awkward.Silk browser is relatively slow compared to other mobile browsers. Apparently this device doesn't support flash, but I couldn't care less since flash is a dying platform and I'm used to it with my apple devices anyway.Number of apps is extremely limited when compared to full android play store and apple app store. However, general quality of apps is good.Overall, I am enjoying this device. Power users who want a great 7 inch tablet would be wise to get a Google nexus 7. But people who want something of good quality that is easy to use and great for reading, browsing, playing games and watching videos will really enjoy the new kindle fire hd.

Rose", "ReviewID": "RWKA8HJEXZWAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, I have never owned a Kindle before.  I don't own a tablet or a smart phone either.  Why?  Because I love, love, love paper and ink books and because a laptop is sufficient enough to supply with everything and more than a tablet or phone can do.  So, why did I buy this?  Free and cheap Kindle books, mostly for testing purposes.  I'm obsessed with indie and self pub authors, but there are so many bad ones that I like to try them out before splurging on the paperbacks.  Now that you know why I bought it, here's what I think of it: it's pretty freaking incredible.Maybe I'm just speaking from lack of experience, but I almost felt like this product brought me into the tech revolution a bit.  Within fifteen minutes of opening it, I started a free Prime movie and the color and sound were great.  It was not nearly as distracting to watch on such a small screen as I had expected.  I then tried out some music and while it's not as good as my Bose, it's pretty great for such a small device.  The Kindle books look beautiful and the touch screen is very responsive and easy to use.  I also managed to get a hold of a free Tetris app and then was informed by Amazon that I now had a dollar credit for an MP3 just for downloading it.  That was pretty amazing, so I decided to try out the shopping experience.  I, personally, do not shop for books, movies, or music anywhere but on Amazon so having a closed system to me is awesome.  They make it so easy to buy stuff.  That might seem like a negative to some, but I love not having to put my credit card in.  I love getting my product in seconds and without hassle.  And the ads ... what ads?  I don't see why so many of the other reviewers are complaining.  They're barely there.  Basically, when you leave it idle or turn it on there's a tiny, brief flash of ad.  That's it.  And if they're referring to the carousel at the bottom that shows books and movies and music, then I'm going to have to thoroughly disagree.  I don't see those as ads, but as suggestions.  They're not invasive and I find them very helpful.  I might sound like I'm gushing or that Amazon paid me to do this review, but I just want to be honest about it.Now, the bad part.  When I got my Kindle, packaged very beautifully in a black box, I saw immediately that I unfortunately received one with a screen defect.  There were some striations of color and what looked like a pressure thumb print that were obscuring the back light.  I called Amazon immediately and was disappointed to get someone from India.  I'm going to write Amazon a letter about having American call centers.  That's a huge problem for me and it really deserves to knock this review down a star.  If I wasn't so pleased with the resolution, then they would've have quite the badger on their hands.  They readied a new Kindle as soon as there was stock and I'm scheduled to get it tomorrow (I received the original on Friday).  I don't have to send back the damaged one until I get the new one which is awesome because I might've had a fit.In short: it's great, it's easy, it's for people who like to shop on Amazon, and the price is good for what it is", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you liked the Original Fire, You're gonna LOVE this.", "Author": "M. guimond", "ReviewID": "R33NO057VCV8L5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my fair share of tablets. Ive had the Hp Touchpad, Ipad 2, Motorola xoom, and the original kindle fire. Oddly enough I always preferred the Kindle fire to all the other tablets I had previously owned. The interface was simple and clean, Amazon's content was spectactular, and of course the $199 price. Well I am pleased to say that fire HD is so much better than the original fire. The design is more modern and attractive, easy to hold in your hands, feels very sturdy(something typical $199 tablets dont feel like). The new Fire HD has the best screen I have seen on any tablet display( minus the \"Retina Display\" on the Ipad3) On the original Fire's display the app icons were fuzzy and small, not anymore. The Icons are sharp, clear, and dare I say attractive? The new screen is BEAUTIFUL! Scrolling thru the main menu is so much faster, I have yet to experiance any lag during playing around. The original Fire was incredibly \"laggy\" but Im pleased to say that appears to be gone. Watching Movies on this thing is actually better than what I was hoping for. Images are clear, the new Dolby Stereo speakers are Excellent! Best sound ive heard come out of a tablet (and yes, better than Ipad). It honestly amazes me how they kept this thing still at $199. Which brings me to my next point, Ads. Alot of people have been complaining that amazon failed to mention that there will be Ads on the lockscreen on the device. While that is bound to irritate some, I find it to be helpful. Theres 2 specific ads that nobody should have a problem with. Theres one for a $5 amazon MP3 credit and one for $5 to spend in the amazon instant video store. What is so bad about that? Who doesnt want to get essentially free credits? I have yet to find the ads to be intrusive. The only place youll notice it is on the lockscreen and the adds can be anything from those free amazon credits to the lorax movie poster, to a new book coming out. I dont have a problem with them at all (like i said, theres options for free amazon credits) BUT for those who are really against ads amazon has given customers the option to opt out of the ads for $15. The only real complaint I have and to me its a pretty big one, THERES NO CHARGER! really amazon? you're gonna send me this lovely new tablet without a charger? Smart. Now there is a USB cord that will charge the device if u plug it into a computer/laptop but they didnt supply the power outlet adaptor. Since I had my old Ipad charger Ive just been putting the Fire HD usb cord into the Ipad power adaptor..seems to be working just fine. So if you do have power adaptors (and most ppl do since they are very common with smartphones) then u will be allset. It just baffles me that they didnt include a charger. Other than that it really is a great device. Its a BIG BIG improvement over the original kindle fire and the fact that its still $199 is amazing. Dont hesitate to upgrade or switch, you will love it.UPDATE: I just wanted to add that I have plugged the old kindle fire charger into the Fire HD and its working. So for anyone looking to upgrade your old charger will work", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Fire...not sure I want to keep it", "Author": "RackOnInNC \"RackInInNC\"", "ReviewID": "RTC3Q2A8N81TK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me begin this by saying that I used to be an \"early adopter\".  I had to have it when it first came out.  I've stopped doing that, but in this case I wish I had bought the first Fire.  From using a friend's I was excited when they finally announced the second gen devices.  The original was simple to use and did most things I wanted it to.  This one is incredibly hard to figure out, even with years of techy experience and is more limited in its use.PROS -Feels solid and well built.Anti-glare screen is nice, and the screen is vibrant.  It's not Retina, but then it didn't cost like one so I'm OK with that.Some have reported it being slow and unresponsive, but I haven't had much of a problem except when in apps I know have problems from them doing the same to my phone.  Videos streamed from Amazon look really good.Book reading is surprisingly good for a backlit screen.  Page turns are quick and although they lack the book like \"charm\" of the Kindle reader page turns it is an acceptable substitute.Screen brightness is good and you can see the screen pretty well outdoors.  I have turned off automatic screen brightness though.  I find the values it chooses too bright in most cases and have mine set slightly less than 50%.CONS -No AC adapter included.  Would that have really been that much of a stretch to include?No flash support.  UPDATE: Well...no official flash support.  Thanks to the comment from TomT below I was able to install both flash and my preferred browser (Dolphin) in a few minutes.  Google Flash 11.1 apk and follow the xda developer links...will walk you right through it.  Now if I can get Google Voice working so I can use sonar I'll be a happy camper.  Have added a star since it was this easy.  That still doesn't negate the fact that it should have been included in the first place with so many sites still using Flash.The charge and HDMI ports are on the long edge rather than the short as is on my other Kindles (and the original Fire I believe).  When you want to do HDMI out to a TV you can only turn it one way if you want to tilt it up which may, depending on the case you buy,  totally defeat the stand in the case.  In the case of the Marware leather rotating case you can't close the case when charging because the ports are to the inside.Volume and On-Off buttons are flush with the case and almost impossible to find by feel.  Since the only visual cue for which way you are holding it is the camera lens this makes it difficult in a darkened room.No GPS.  This isn't a deal breaker, but would have been nice.  I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn't use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone's Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn't really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don't mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It's clear Amazon doesn't want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn't belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don't use like HBO and Showtime aren't there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can't access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle's \"special\" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn't tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a \"purchase\" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don't know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don't want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven't found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I'm not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.  Why include the camera if they aren't going to give you something to help use it?No alarm clock app included.  Now I know there are apps that will do this, but it's pretty much a basic inclusion on most mobile devices these days.Haven't decided if I will return or wait and hope Amazon offers some software updates that make it more acceptable.  It's a brilliant hardware upgrade hogtied by Amazon's watered-down version of Android and the lack of basic apps like camera/alarm that we have all come to expect.

Again, customer service was EXCELLENT!!!  They quickly replaced it with a new one.  The third one has MANY problems.  It would suddenly start downloading apps that were already downloaded.  Sometimes this would happen while I was using the same app, causing it to close down.  Sometimes 2 apps would mysteriously start downloading.  Videos would say they were loading, but then it would just sit there and never play.  Downloaded apps would suddenly disappear and I would have to download them again.  Videos would start playing, then stop and my carousel would appear.  The screen would freeze up.  Just too many problems.  When I called customer service, we went through all the trouble shooting as usual with no success including deregistering and reregistering.  To their credit, they offered to send out a 4th new one, but at this point, I don't have ANY faith in this product.  I would say I use the Kindle less than an hour a day.  They've never been dropped, spilled on, sat in direct sunlight, or anything else that would have caused these things to happen.  I know other people have Kindles that work great, but mine did not.  I'm returning this Kindle Fire HD for a refund and not looking back.  Time to invest in a more reliable tablet.  Sorry Kindle and Amazon, but thanks for the GREAT customer service.9/27/2013 UPDATE - Well it seems like the usual confusion with big companies.  If you've read up above, you know about all the problems I had.  When I contacted Kindle customer service, they ultimately offered me an 80% refund.  When I called back to accept (after giving it some thought), I was told by a different agent that Amazon will not accept returns or offer ANY kind of refund on the Kindle Fire HD after the initial 30 days of the ORIGINAL purchase.  As you can imagine, I was not happy to hear this, so my only option was to have them ship me a 4th Kindle Fire HD.  After hanging up the phone, I was checking my e-mail and was surprised to get an e-mail from Amazon asking me \"Did I solve your problem?\"  I clicked on the \"NO\" link and was asked to provide details.  This is what I sent. - \"I am VERY disappointed with the return policy for the Kindle Fire HD.  There needs to be a REASONABLE exception to the 30 day return policy, especially for instances like mine where I keep having problems with the replacements as well.  I have had 3 new Kindle Fire HDs in 8 months, all with different problems.  On August 27, 2013, I was told by agent Melicia W. that because of all the problems I was experiencing, I would be able to return my latest Kindle Fire HD for a pro-rated return of around 80% of the original purchase price.  When I opted to take this option after thinking about it for a couple weeks, I was told I could only get a refund after the 5th replacement.  I think that's absolutely ABSURD that you would make a paying customer go through a total of SIX defective Kindle Fire HDs before offering to refund their money.  Obviously I want a working tablet, so I'm having a 4th Kindle Fire HD sent out.  I can hardly wait to see what problems I will have with this third replacement.  This product should not have so many problems, and if it does, a simple refund would be appropriate.Unhappy and fairly disgustedWithin minutes, I received another e-mail from customer service asking me to call in to speak with one of their agents so they could issue me a refund.  What???  I was just told they don't issue refunds after 30 days.  Seems like someone else agreed that making a paying customer go through 6 defective Kindles is a bit excessive.  Each Kindle Fire HD I had came with a completely different problem.  To my amazement, I provided a few details and the FULL REFUND was in my bank account the next day.  EXCELLENT customer service and the right thing to do.With my experience, I would never purchase another Kindle Fire HD.  I think they need to revamp the entire tablet, even though I know most people had a positive experience.  With that being said, I just saw the all new Kindle Fire HDX tablets.  I am considering the 8.9\" version.  From what I can tell, they have totally revamped these tablets.  If I decide to purchase one, I know what you might be thinking, but at the very least, I know I will get EXCELLENT customer service.

I would recommend it highly, with the caveat that 'buyer beware' of what I see as a few (admittedly minor) problems:CONS:1) FORGET ANY IDEA OF READING OUTSIDE!  I guessed that it would be impossible to watch movies outside because of the glare, and of course I was right, but didn't mind. But what I did mind was how impossible it is to actually use the Kindle for reading at the beach. There is just too much glare, no matter how much you adjust the settings. Soooo, don't get this as a 'reader' if you plan on using it outside to read. It's not gonna happen....2) Ridiculous though this sounds, it is really difficult to find the volume control! I am not the only reviewer to have mentioned this. I read this criticism before getting my Kindle, and thought; 'what's WRONG with these people?! How hard can it be to find a volume control?!'  The joke was on me, however, as nearly ever time I go to change the volume, I'm farting around looking for it, as it's so well hidden, and you have to sort of 'aim' your fingers just right to make it function properly. (I know; this sounds ridiculous, doesn't it...but it can't just be 'me', as so many others have cited this, too).3) Before you adjust the volume, you have to 'unlock' the screen. In fact, the screen 'locks' CONSTANTLY. You have to continually 'swipe' at the screen to unlock it, and as far as I can see, there's no way to change the settings on the screen lock.4) ADS! I don't really mind that there's ads every time you have to unlock the Kindle (which as I just mentioned, is constantly) but what I DO mind are the video or audio ads, which suddenly 'blast'. This can be embarrassing if you're using your Kindle on public transport, or secretly playing scrabble on it in a meeting at work ;)  Joking aside, I think it's really intrusive to have video/audio ads blasting out when you unlock your Kindle, and unlike YouTube, you can't 'skip ad after three seconds'.  \"Oh, just turn the volume down\" you cry. Well....see #2!5) BE PREPARED TO DEFAULT TO FACTORY SETTINGS AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS! I know three other people with Kindle Fire HDs, and ALL of us have had the same experience; after the first two weeks, the factory applications (camera, etc) stopped functioning, and we had to default to factory settings to make them work again (the result being that we lost anything 'saved' on our Kindle if it wasn't also saved on the Cloud).  The good news is that, since then, none of us have had any problems with applications, so perhaps it's a teething problem with new Kindle Fires or something.PROS:1) MUSIC! It supports Pandora, Spotify, Tune-In, etc, etc, and the sound quality (Dolby, right?) is AMAZING. Better still, plug it into speakers, and it functions as a wonderful music player.2) MOVIES! Movie quality is FANTASTIC. I didn't think I could get into watching movies or TV on a screen that small, yet it's perfect for taking to bed to watch telly. I don't have cable hooked up in every room in my house, so it's great to be able to download shows and movies onto the Kindle to watch in rooms besides my living room.3) GAMES! This is a great little toy for playing all your favorite games (mine is WordFeud), and Amazon offers tons of free game aps in the Ap Store on the Kindle.4) Power lasts...for-EVER! I had been so used to charging up my Android phone every five minutes that it came as something of a shock to discover just how long the power lasts on the Kindle Fire H.D.  I'm talking DAYS and DAYS. Yes, DAYS! Even if you're playing music or watching movies constantly, you can expect a good 48 - 72 hrs before the power runs out, and even then, it charges so quickly (an hour or two) that the whole 'power' issue ISN'T an issue.So, overall, although there are a few 'cons' (the biggest being that you can't use it to read outdoors, which is a shame, but hey, summer is almost at an end), this is a GREAT little tool for the price, and I am very happy with my easy-to-use and no-nonsense digital companion. :)", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware Of The Faulty Charging Port", "Author": "xx12", "ReviewID": "R25ZPWPN8C38BQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All in all, the tablet was a reasonable price and it did what we wanted it to do.

The Kindle came several days in advance of the estimated delivery date.  It took me a little while to figure out how it worked because the box came with the Kindle, a USB cable and a little card with a few arrows pointing out the power button and the volume...and nothing else.  It took me a few minutes to find a free Kindle book about how to use it, read it in about 20 minutes and I was back in business. I was amazing at how such a small device could deliver such performance. I'm not really a gamer so I can't comment on that but I've downloaded books, music and music videos to it and the clarity is unreal.

The screen display is great and especially the sound. I have all of my favorite apps and about 10 books on board. I also have another 200 or so books on cloud storage. I have my music on cloud storage too. Most of the time I have wifi access, so when I want to listen to music it is convenient just to connect wirelessly to the internet and enjoy it. Speaking of the internet, the device connects very fast and brousing is fast as well. I have noticed in some reviews that some a few cons with the device. For instance, the power button is difficult to find. But, reviews of the previous Fire model suggested that people were turning it off too easily by accident. That problem has been addressed with the current design. Also, I believe that it has been developed to be used with a magnetic cover. The Amazon cover is a little pricy, but I purchased an alternative one that works very nice. When I close the cover the device automatically goes into sleep mode and wakes up upon opening. This eliminates any need for the power button and also really conserves battery life. And, a lot of people have complained about the battery. First, I turned off the automatic screen brightness so that I can control it manually. In \"automatic\", the screen is much more bright than necessary and really burns the juice. Also, make sure the wifi is off when not in use. Also, I think a lot of those who purchase a Kindle Fire are Kindle users. Kindles utilize E-ink technology. Those devices only use current with a page change. On the other hand, the Kindle Fires use LCD displays which uses power on a continual basis. Therefor,they require charging much more often than every 4 to 6 wks. For a tablet device, the Kindle Fire does pretty good between charges. It will last me throughout the day with considerable usage and I plug it in every night and have a full charge in the morning. Another negative I have noted is the lack of a charger. For the price and the quality of the device, I have no complaint with the lack of a charger. One can purchase a charger for a very reasonable price. I, like many individuals, have owned a number of electronic devices and have more than one 5 volt adapter laying around. Mine works great for my Kindle Fire. So, as you can see, this is a great device. Any negatives you might have in purchasing one are easily understood and addressed. Most negative reviews are the exception.

I also have a Kindle Paperwhite.I really want to like the Kindle Fire HD more than I do but I just can't get past some of the glaring issues.  On any other machine, it'd be a 3-star product but the Amazon price point pushes this into 4-star territory.I want to use my Kindle Fire HD mainly for reading graphic novels, comics, and books.  I also wanted a quick and dirty way to check email and do light web surfing and video watching.  Well, it's a mixed bag.  There is no native support for comic files which is odd for a product that is all about reading.  An app is available but it currently doesn't work very well so I'm waiting on an update to fix a few SW bugs.  I could not get my local mp4 files to play without a video app that I had to download.  I would have thought that just about each and every video file would be rendered playable but that's not the case either.  So, I'm at the mercy of a 3rd party to get me an app that allows me to watch my own videos.As for books, I like to make use of the \"Send To Kindle\" method where I send my mobi books to Amazon.  I can then download them to my Kindle Fire HD or Kindle Paperwhite and the book gets synced across each device.  The issue I have is that those mobi files are treated as \"documents\" by Amazon so they reside in another location on the Fire HD.  And the cover art meta data is missing.  This is not a deal breaker but it's annoying and distracting.  I can side load these books into the Fire HD and they will show up with the rest of the \"books\" but they won't sync to my Paperwhite if they're side loaded - at least as far as I can tell.As for magazines, I wanted to download my Zinio magazines since I have that on my iPad but the Zinio app is not available in the app store so I have to download and install directly from Zinio.  I'm willing to do this and it works very well on Fire HD but I find it annoying that one of the larger e-magazine services is not easily available on one of the latest generation e-reader/tablets.All is not bad though.  The device is well made and the Amazon prime streaming service works very well.  The sound and picture are excellent.  The form factor is good and it's not too heavy.  My stylus works great with it.  The price point is amazing for what you get.  The Amazon ecosystem is excellent.So, basically, it's a bit of a chore to get it configured the way I want.  I'll probably get it set the way I want eventually but I was surprised at how much side loading of apps and content is needed.  I consider myself pretty tech savvy and find it hard to believe that people will be entirely successful in loading their own content.  This effectively steers them to the Amazon marketplace which in the end, somewhat limits their choices.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Really LOVE this Kindle Fire!", "Author": "Brian Driver", "ReviewID": "R2IBNT0II7UEYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You know, there was a time when I thought I didn't want or need a Kindle.  And then, later, there was another time when I thought I couldn't imagine anything nicer than my black and white Kindle Keyboard.I can assume therefore, that there will be a time when I need the \"next\" thing, but you know, I just can't imagine what it will be. I am SO, SO HAPPY with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" What do I start with first?NOTE: I'm just going to write about the reading feature of the Kindle fire...I'll address the other uses of the Kindle later (camera, watching movies, browsing photos, and email, the Dolby sound system, etc.)IMAGE CLARITY:I am totally impressed with the clarity of the image; this is definitely HD clarity. I have the 7\" and face it: the up-side of the smaller size is that it really sharpens up the image. Not only is this an already beautiful HD quality, but it becomes even more crisp at the 7\" display size.  I love what I see: covers are beautiful; magazines are gorgeous, games are bright and fun to engage in, and YouTube vids are as pretty as can be. I have not found any problems with viewing it from any angle.READING FONT/SIZE/COLOR/SPACING :And I am very comfortable with reading the screen when it comes to books. Kindle's done a great job with providing a decent range of screens for us to use for whatever light conditions I meet when I'm reading. I can use black on white, white on black, and black on sepia. Of course, there is also a variety of font sizes and type spacing available as well.TOUCH SCREEN/INTUITIVE CONTROLS:Then there's the touch screen. My old black & white Kindle Keyboard was pleasant and relatively easy to use, but this touch screen is a snap. There's a very intuitive screen with commands that cover what it is I need to do with easy-to-understand and learn controls. I have made the transition to the touch screen very easily, and I'm a 61-year old fogey. If I got it, you can, too.SHIPPED READY-TO-USEAnd I love the fact that the Kindle was ready right out of the box. No set up, no long tutorials, and no having to charge it to work it. It was ready to use immediately, and the controls JUST MAKE SENSE.PERCENT vs. PAGE NUMBERS:I'm very glad to see that Kindles are making the transition to page numbers...I don't really mind the \"percentage\" symbols as I progress, but there's something about those symbols that just makes it seem harder to advance. I think the biggest problem is that on most settings (especially with larger fonts, which people with eye problems use) it takes several \"pages\" to advance a single percentage point, Especially in a long book like, say, a Stephen King book. It may take a dozen flips of the page until you can advance ONE percent.  So I'm glad this is happening.WI-FI/16 GB/ADS:I'm extremely happy with the Wi-Fi speed...I have a slow internet service and would often have problems with my old Kindle...which I blamed on the internet-provider. But now the books and other content are downloading VERY quickly with the HD Fire. I'm quite impressed. I feel like the 16 GB storage (PLUS the Cloud) will be all I'll need.And, incidentally, I think the ads that occasionally pop up are of almost NO concern to me. I'm glad I saved the money by agreeing to get them...they don't get in my way at all. I barely notice them...save your money and opt in to this feature.CHARGING:As to the charging speed...although they do NOT provide the speedy wall charger that will shorten the charging time to 4 hours (now being sold for $14.99), I just use the wall charger I got with the Kindle Keyboard, and though it doesn't charge from almost dead batteries to a full charge in four hours, I simply plug it in at night. (NOTE: I will tell you that if you use the Kindle HD while you charge, it will take forever. While it certainly doesn't LOSE any charge when you do that it doesn't really gain anything either.)SIZE:Finally, I love the size of this Kindle...I know the iPad is bigger, and so is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", I really like this size. (Though I'm limiting this review portion to books, I will say movies have looked great on this.) This size is extremely simple to pack into anything, and carry it along with me.It's a cinch to carry around, and I've found a carrying case through Amazon that I really love, the M-Edge Incline 360\u00b0 Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\"...here's the URL: B009QU6U0YIt's a terrific carrying case, and I'm very happy with it.I'll write on some of the other features as I begin to use and be conversant with them.

Reading experience2. Time left to complete the book3. Size and handlingBad stuff:1. Apps2. Kindle Owners' Lending Library - selection and experience3. Technical glitches4. User experienceLong version:I had an iPad (Retina) for over a year now, but always wanted a Kindle for reading. So I not-so-subtly asked my wife to buy the Kindle Fire HD for my birthday, which she did. Kindle is a really good product, and I'm glad it works out so well for several folks. But here's why I am returning it after less than a week:Setup:Good: The Kindle Fire HD 7\" arrived with minimal set up required. I did have to go through a few steps of setting up accounts, etc. but overall it was a pleasant experience.Bad: email setup (Gmail) wouldn't work until I restarted the device a couple of times. Also, it asked for my Facebook and Twitter account credentials up front, leading me to believe these apps came in-built. I had to download them later (very confusing), and I still don't understand why it asked me for the information.Size and Handling:Good: 7\" is definitely not the largest Kindle of course, but I'm surprised how natural the screen-size felt after just a couple of minutes (Remember, I am used to a 10\" iPad). The best part was that it was super-convenient to hold the device in one hand for reading or using other apps. I have Yeti hands, so that definitely helped.Bad: The device does tend to get heavy after a while. Unless you have propped it up against yourself while reading in bed, the `convenience' wears down eventually.Screen:I didn't get much reading done outdoors, so I really can't give a fair opinion on the glare (or lack of it). But I did need to switch to a black background when reading in the dark, to avoid annoying others with bright light. Background color and screen brightness are now an integral part of most e-readers and tablets, so no brownie points there.Reading experience:Everyone says Amazon nailed this part, and I agree! First of all, I LOVE books and managed to catch up with reading after more than 2 years, so I'm on cloud nine already. I never managed to read much on the iPad for the 1+ year I owned it, mostly due to the unwieldy size (and I hate those iPad cases that get in the way, but my wife insists on them). I loved being able to carry all the books in the world in one small screen with me, and I burned through 2 books in 4 days.My favorite feature is the time left in the book, calculated based on your page turning speed. It helps me decide whether to soldier on for another half hour and finish the book, or to call it quits and come back the next day. That's the biggest thing I'll miss.One big reason I chose Fire over Paperwhite was the ability to read books with colors and images (graphic novels, maps, etc.). When Amazon eventually comes out with e-ink display for color and images, I'll be standing in line to buy the future Paperwhite.Kindle Owners' Lending Library:First of all, the Books store doesn't load successfully every time. It's the BOOKS app on the KINDLE, for crying out loud! (The one thing you're supposed to get right, Amazon!!!) And I don't have the patience to restart the device every time for the rest of my life.VERY DISAPPOINTED! I have Amazon Prime and I was really looking forward to free-riding on one book per month. However the selection available for free borrowing is abysmal (unless you're interested in tons of erotic chick-lit). And the experience of borrowing was messy too, unfortunately. The borrowing wouldn't work, the advice on Amazon forums (lots of it) wouldn't work, the customer service rep tried to apply a promo equivalent to the book's Kindle purchase value and that wouldn't work either.I know this is the exception rather than the norm. I was able to borrow books and get the promo later, but it was a big turn-off to go through this the first time around, and knowing there were so many people facing the same issues. Amazon could really try to improve its back-end systems. Bad, bad Amazon!Customer Service:The one reason I still use Amazon is their excellent, unfailing service. They did try to help me out with my Kindle teething troubles, but unfortunately for them most of the workarounds failed during the first few attempts. Thanks guys, for doing what you do, to keep us irritable folks happy.Apps:Another big disappointment. I knew going in that there wasn't much of a selection. There was no Gmail app for Kindle (come on!). But the overall layout and convenient accessibility of launching apps on the iPad was far, far better than the Kindle. The home screen carousel was a big letdown. Instead of having to scroll through 20 whale-sized icons, it would have been more intuitive to provide access to more apps on the same screen/page. Hope they improve this.Also, some of the apps for Kindle are of really poor quality, compared to iOS. Take Twitter for instance: the controls and navigation are clunky and usually group two different kinds of buttons really close with no visible distinction, and I end up going to Home instead of Back.Overall:I used my Kindle for everything, for the first few days. I keep it right by my bed, so I can look at it in the morning. However I updated some apps and cleaned up some unused stuff on the iPad one day, and I couldn't bring myself to pick up the Kindle the next morning. I rather chose to do my daily morning-surfing on the small iPhone screen instead. That pretty much sealed the decision for me.I stayed away from talking about audio and video quality, because we can all agree they're great on the Kindle. But they are excellent on other devices too! So is browsing, email, social media apps, etc. However if I can't bring myself to use this remarkable piece of technology, it doesn't matter how well it fares on the tech specs. And so I will be returning the Kindle Fire HD 7\" which I begged my wife to get for my birthday.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice product", "Author": "indrani basu mallick", "ReviewID": "R2QSL5YK4PE48N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second kindle .

I am a wife, mother of two pre-teen kids, a teacher, and I am definitely NOT well-versed on anything technical.  Having said that, here is my review:1. I love the slimmer design. I never thought my Fire was bulky, until using this much slimmer Fire HD.2. The Kindle Free Time is great! My kids don't have any hand-held devices of their own, so they are always asking to borrow my Kindle or my Samsung Galaxy II.  Now, not only do they each have their own profiles with their own favorite apps, games, and books, but I can also control how long they get to use those games, apps, and books. I have reading set to unlimited, and games and apps to only an hour and a half.  It also cuts down on fighting over who's turn it is.  That alone is worth it!!!3. I use my Kindle for reading scriptures and other church manuals, videos, and magazines.  This slimmer design fits nicely down in my church bag, and is SO much better than having to take bulky scriptures and two or three other manuals. This is definitely my all-in-one church device! Downloading the apps from my church website was a breeze.  The app store also has plenty of other church related apps to choose from.4. I love the default email app the Kindle Fire HD comes with! It keeps ALL my various email accounts in one place. I can now at-a-glance see if any of my accounts have new mail. I have two gmail, two hotmail, and one yahoo.  It is great seeing them all in one space, and whatever I delete stays deleted--I had a similar app on my Samsung that would delete emails while I was in the app, but then those \"deleted\" emails would reappear the next time I accessed the app.5. I love being able to upload all my pictures from all my devices (from facebook too) to the Photo Cloud.  Now I can upload or email any picture from any device without having to figure out how to get that image to the device I am using.My original Kindle came from a large retailer.  I bought my Kindle Fire HD 7\" 32GB from a popular homeshopping site.  They offered a bundle at a great value, that included the magnetic case (I love it!), cord, recharger, and ear buds.Cons? Well, I don't like sharing with my kids!! I am actually thinking about getting the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 32GB just for me and let them have/share the 7\".

You can use the pinch zoom feature to increase the screen image and zoom in, but this so annoying when you are reading because you have to constantly scroll. Other Androd tablets and smartphones allow you to increase the text size on web pages. I have added a customer image of a side by side comparison of web pages with my smaller smartphone and the Kindle hd. The text on the smartphone is considerably larger and easier to read than on the Kindle. I often find myself reading the internet on my smartphone instead of my Kindle for this reason alone.

I previously had a Kindle Paperwhite and really liked the size factor for reading, but I wanted the ability to read books as well as watch movies, so the KFHD 7\" was really more what I was looking for. I watch movies and read in bed and the 7\" had such a better form factor than the 8.9. I haven't noticed any difference in performance between either of them. Watching movies, reading, browsing the web, email all works well on this.I also looked at the Nexus 7. Why the Kindle HD? Brighter screen plus you can watch Amazon Prime videos and get to borrow a free book a month. It's the only Android device that allows you to get the most out of Amazon Prime.As far as not having the Google Play store, it doesn't bother me at all. First, if you really want a program, you can find it online and sideload it, so that point is moot. The more important factor is that Android doesn't have a great library of apps available for tablets anyway. However, the Kindle Store actually gives me more than I could get otherwise. USA Today and PBS app are two that come to mind. Do they work on other Android devices? Yes, but not all. They work on Kindle. I've also sideloaded Google Chrome, Maps, Gmail and even Adobe Flash.

I usually use this tablet for reading and games like Mahjong. Neither of these tasks should drain the battery life as quickly as I experience. The clarity of the images on the screen is wonderful, and the sound quality is nice.

As for outside reading in direct sun it does have a glare, but I usually sit in mostly shade or under a beach umbrella and  it works fine, especially if I turn the brightness control all the way up.  While I got it for book reading, I use it for so much more, The email app was easy to set up and it works great. I have all my favorite apps downloaded and they are easy to find. It is very sturdy and I have let my grand kids play on it hours after hours, from watching movie to playing games, The netflix movies seem to stream very well over my internet connection, and I actually found a software program that can transfer my dvds into the mpg4 format so I can transfer them over via computer, That is great for trips when we have no internet each 2 hr movie seems to take  about 1.5 gb of space, so I have room to leave a couple on it without worrying about space. The only slight flaw, is the power button, its very flush with the top so you have to feel for it. The battery at first seem to drain pretty fast, but then I realized I wasn't turning it off, just putting it to sleep mode, so if I hold the power button down a few seconds longer it shuts off and that really helps, also I do turn off the wireless when I'm just reading or playing downloaded games.

We have had a Kindle keyboard for a while, and it served its purpose.  I wanted some limited tablet capability, and the Fire has done more than I ever anticipated.  It is small, convenient, and the sound is excellent.I could go on about my product satisfaction, but there is one thing lacking that really surprised me.  The least expensive Kindles have a way to sort and categorize books, and I thought that they all would.I have a large collection of books, and the only way to sort them is by title, author, or date of purchase (the latter is not always accurate).  I would have thought that, in order to keep the Kindle excellence going, someone would have developed an in-house app that enabled the Kindle Fire to do what the lower cost Kindles do.I have heard there are third party apps that attempt to do this, but a Kindle-originated app would have the best chance of fitting seamlessly into this great device.  I need to sort my books, rather than have to scan through hundreds of them.I hope Amazon will develop its own software to take care of this problem.  Outside of this one minor complaint, I love my device.  Even knowing what I know now, I still would have bought it, but please, Kindle developers, do us all a favor and give us a way to organize our book collections that is at least as good as the one on the cheaper keyboard monochrome models.One more note.

I will say, the original one I bought, ended up having a factory error with the battery, but Amazon customer service was so helpful and immediately sent me a new one, which has not had a problem. Amazon's customer service and Kindle support info has also been the best customer service I have received in a long time from anywhere. It's hard to find customer service that is great these days, I feel like at least. Overall, the Kindle has plenty of storage space for my apps, is easily charged, and the battery lasts for several days (I would even say a week).

I am a Prime Member and the Amazon customer service is truly exceptional.I have been using the KFHD for a couple of weeks now.  The web browser is fast and consistent.  I loaded many apps that work perfectly (Exchange, Mint, Documents to Go, WD2Go, HBOGo, YNAB, etc.).

All the video content that is available for FREE with your Prime account is at your fingertips.  I have used other Android tablets (Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7, and Google Nexus 10).  None of them allow you to watch Prime videos \"out of the box\" - you can get around it by installing some web browsers and then side-loading Adobe Flash - but it's not very reliable.  On the Kindle Fire HD the video quality and the sound are great!  All your Amazon apps are there .. all your Kindle books are there.  No, the Google Play Store isn't available, and most (all?) Google-branded apps are not available.  But you can still do a lot of things without any Google apps.  And yes, you can get your Google Mail.  It's very basic, but it does the job.  And all my music is up on Amazon's cloud.  I've purchased some MP3s from Amazon, but you can use the \"importer\" - it will scan your computer, and upload your music to the cloud - including the songs you got from iTunes.One thing to consider.  Your experience will only be as good as your WiFi service.  If you only have access to poor WiFi service you're going to have problems - with the Kindle Fire HD - as well as ANY WiFi only device.  In the past year I've upgraded my internet service from basic speed to higher speeds.  And I've gotten a dual-band WiFi router.  So for me WiFi flies on the Kindle Fire HD.I wasn't sure before I ordered it if I should get it - and had even prepared myself to send it back after 48 hours.  I'm glad I got it.  Just wish I had waited a few days to order the 7\" .. the day I received the 7\" Amazon cut the prices of the 8.9\".  But, that's the way it is with electronics.  All things considered - I'm happy I got it and it'll keep me occupied for a long time!PS .. I've seen some reviews who complain about the ads.  Seriously?  There's an ad on the lock screen - and you click on offers on the top menu.  There's NO inconvenience whatsoever.  If you don't want the ads just pay the extra $15-or-so bucks to get rid of them.  But they're not in your face and they don't distract from the experience.And for a cover - I got the I-Blason cover - it's my 2nd one (I have one on my Nexus 10, too).  It's well made, it's sturdy, and the fit is nice'n'snug so that your tablet doesn't move around.  A great addition.Added 03/25/2013:  For those of you who know how customizable the Android system is - you're probably going to be disappointed with the Kindle Fire HD.  Unless you root it - there's virtually no customization you can do.  I haven't, and don't plan on rooting mine.  The home screen is the carousel - which is a slider showing the last apps/books/movies/music/etc that you've used.  When it sits on my desk at work it would be boring to look over and see that all the time.  So I got the TerraTime app and added it to my 'favorites' (that's the star the the bottom right corner of your screen.  TerraTime is the earth which spins - and shows night time and day time around the globe.  It has a lot of custom settings - and it spins so it's always moving.  Kind of like \"living wallpaper\" for Android - but there is no actual living wallpaper for the Kindle Fire HD.

Most specifically:1) A camera - the HD has a not so high res front facing camera which means that the kids can make video's, take pictures and use skype. This seems to me to be a no brainer in terms of upgrading. It just seems like the useful life of the Fire is extended by adding a camera2) Bluetooth - this feature again makes it seem like the usefulness of the Fire is extended. My middle kid wanted a laptop and she wasn't going to get one, I mean I love her, but not laptop love her:-). She got the Fire as a gift and then used her money to upgrade to the Fire-HD with my prompting. For her birthday we got her a case that included a bluetooth keyboard and get a word processing app (one app - all 3 kindles - that's quite a deal). She can now use her Kindle Fire HD to type papers, search the web and create content. The physical keyboard is a really nice addition and means that she has stopped bugging us for a laptop.I also want to say thank you to Amazon for making the entire process so easy. We got 3 kindle Fire's for Christmas and were able to exchange them (we love being prime members) easily. The ability to track the returns and new kindles made everyone happy and gave everyone something to look forward to. There were no issues at all with exchanging and I used the online customer service chat a few times and it was a real pleasure. Not sure if those higher up the food chain read these reviews, but the people I dealt with were great. Three new KFHD's and three happy kids.A few other cool features:1) The displays look great2) While I really wish that there was a \"kids login\" for netflix available for the kindle, that's a dispute between Amazon and Netflix. Netflix works really well on the KF-HD3) The kids like being able to access apps which I can control through my Amazon account and I appreciate that when I want to load an app it only requires me to log into my account on my laptop and do so once.Thanks!", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long??", "Author": "Avid Reader", "ReviewID": "R2BTPCKF7ZUC9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I am loving my Kindle Fire HD.

If you are deciding which one to purchase like I was, then this info may be helpful. They are basically the same thing with minor differences.1) The Nook is more comfortable to hold than the Kindle. It is not as wide, so it is easier to hold with one hand. The Kindle is slightly heavier but it it easy to get used to. Both devices feel solid.2) The Nook and Kindle have a smooth interface.When I first received the Kindle it was difficult to navigate because the instructions are poor. After approximately 30 minutes I was using it flawlessly. The Nook has a home button so if you get lost you can press it. The Kindle controls most actions with the touch screen. The Nook has better graphics than the Kindle but the differences are minuscule. You may not tell the difference. The Nook looks better.3) Both allow you to borrow books from the public library. With the Nook, it was an arduous process. I spoke to several Nook representatives and they implied that they never heard of someone having problems with borrowing books before. They gave me numbers to call, I heeded their advice, and I still could not borrow books. I Googled it and followed the instructions step by step. I downloaded Adobe but nothing worked. With the Kindle it is easy to borrow books from the library. This is really convenient because I'm a student and I don't like carrying heavy textbooks around.4) Both browsers are fast but I give a slight edge to the Kindle. They also offer free videos for Prime members although a lot of the videos aren't any good. The Kindle has a greater selection of videos, apps and games compared to the Nook. The Kindle's sound is also superior.4) The Nook HD is cheaper than the Kindle HD. Furthermore, the Kindle does not come with a charger which I find to be ridiculous. It comes with a USB cord but your computer will take forever to charge it. I'm talking definitely over half a day and I'm being generous. Do not buy the Kindle without the charger; You will be disappointed. The Kindle comes with a free month of Prime which I found to be useful because of the 2 day free shipping. The Nook comes with the charger included.* I did not mention the advertisements on the Kindle with Special Offers because It is not a big deal. The advertisements are not disruptive and you may forget that they are there. The Nook does not have advertisements.Hope this helps.

Then in Jan my husband got me an i pad for my birthday.  After using both of them I returned the ipad and replaced it with a kindle fire hd 8.9.  I am going to break down what I like and don't like and will compare a little to the ipad for those who are trying to choose between the two.Ease of use: most things were covered by the tutorial when I first turned it on. I found it fairly intuitive to use.  My 4 yo used it with very little explanation. I like the carousel and how everything else is separated into sections by the tabs at the top.  I am an iphone user so it did get some getting used to to turn it on and volume up and down. Also my husband finds it harder to navigate than his iphone.  Also I hate having to tap the screen multiple times in a book to get the home button to appear (most the time it just turns the page).  I much prefer how the ipad has a home button.  I will say that my kids do better with the kindle bc they always hit the button on the ipad and would end their game.WiFi:  It is fairly fast, in comparison with the ipad 4 I found no difference between the two. Obviously no 4g avail on kindle 7.Durability:  So as I mentioned I bought this for my 2 and 4 yo. Amazon claims they are made to take a few licks. I did not put a case on it, I did get a screen protector. My kids have put it through the paces and it is still holding strong.  My kids have dropped it on a tile floor, jumped on it when it got left in bed, and have pounded it while using.  Other than a scratch on my screen protector it has survived without issue and the screen has not cracked.  Due to knowing how fragile the ipad was i never let it out of an otter box around my kids and have been told by many of my friends they break like glass.Camera: Well here the ipad does win out 100% The kindle has a camera but only front facing for skype. No video camera but you can buy and app I think. For me I found the ipad to cumbersome to lug around just for the use of the camera and I have my I phone so it felt superfluousness for me. If you really want a camera though you are going to want an ipad.Price: Obviously the Kindle is less expensive.  For me it was a lot less. This is because I have 2 young kids and do need the protection plan.  If you actually break your ipad that is 150-200 vs 89.  Also I did not need the crazy expensive otterbox for the kindle so that saved me money as well.  Then the price of the device is a about 140 less.Apps:  So this was something that I found myself very torn btw the ipad and kindle.  There are some apps you can only get on the ipad and for kids they are great. Also some of the apps you can get for both are free on the ipad but cost money on the kindle.  What I found was they are somewhat of money pits bc they always had another 99cents to be added.  I will miss a couple of apps that I thought were cute. Adult apps i really have no idea about bc i didn't even look at any. As far as my calendar, email account, I heart radio skype and facebook i found no difference btw the two.Kindle Free time:  This is an awesome feature and probably one of the reasons I took back the ipad and got a second kindle.  A lot of times  my kids are the one using the device, the majority of the apps i would download were for my kids.  So i found it awesome that I can put them in this area and they are able to get onto what they want and I don't worry about my stuff elsewhere.  Also the subscription gives a ton of books, apps, TV shows, and movies to watch.  You can also limit the time they are able to use it without having to set a timer and pry it away when time is up.  (This helps with my kids having to share the one kindle) They have their own profile and it downloads different content to them based on gender and age.  So my son is thrilled bc his is full of Thomas and my daughters has dora more but both have some gender neutral or crossover items.  A lot of the content is educational but not most of it. Also when using my ipad my son was ALWAYS hitting the home button and I had to put it on for him again and again.  It is password protected so you can't buy anything with out the password whether you are in the free time app or not. You can add anything you download into that childs specific profile too.Well that is it.

Read positive and negative reviews of many, many tablets.  I do believe a lot of negative reviews are fictitious, maybe those loyal to another brand.?Anyway, I chose the Kindle Fire Hd.  And I am so glad I did.  I am an Amazon Prime member.  But that's not why I chose the Kindle HD.  I chose it because of the beautiful display, and to use it the way it was designed to be used.  Click a button, watch a movie.  Or purchase a movie and watch it.  I don't have to go through rooting devices,expanding SD or microSD cards or converting movies from my pc to the tablet etc.  I wanted the ease of just simply choosing and watching a movie.  And yes, using email, checking weather etc.The picture is stunninginly beautiful.  The sound is awesome.  The ease of use is what I was looking for.  It was all ready for me when it arrived.  Turn it on and you are simply a few clicks(taps) away from doing whatever you want.  I have had no lag, no reason for forced stops etc. Every single app I have downloaded has worked flawlessly. I am very, very pleased with this Kindle HD. I wanted one for home use to watch either Amazon or Netflix when my spouse chooses a horror or sci fi movie, I can't stand either. So, now I can simply choose something else while in the same room-add earphones/plugs and not a bother to the spouse.  And in case of electricity loss, or loss of wifi, I have downloaded a couple of movies to the device so I'm not totally without a way to watch entertainment(especially if the kids/grandkids are around).To be honest here, I also purchased an ipod touch 5th generation.  Yes, for what it is it is also awesome, but I do not have an account for their 'store' and don't plan on getting one.  But it's the right travel size for me. The sound isn't close to the quality of the Kindle, it gets better with the earpods..shame really.I like the Kindle HD better.  The picture is better, the sound is much better, and the ease of use as well.So, I may choose to travel with the Kindle HD.I also purchased the Kindle cover and I have not had a problem with it at all, and I really like that it turns off and on the Kindle when you open or close it. I did not choose a bright, frilly color, less apt to be noticed and stolen that way, I'm hoping.I won't be 'relying' on the Kindle for daily, all day use.  But for what I wanted it for, I couldn't be more pleased. It's an awesome tool for entertainment. Yes, the accessories that I purchased separately, all well worth the price so far. The Kindle is more than competitive in price even considering the cost of accessories.I haven't downloaded a lot of apps, some, but not a lot.  I'm not a gamer. But I did download the temple run game.  It works as awesome on my Kindle as it does the ipod touch, but is bigger and better looking and the sound better. Won't be using much productivity apps on the Kindle. A few.We'll see in 6 months how it has worked out, or a year from now. But so far, I am extremely pleased.It does seem like it takes a long, long time to charge using the usb charge connected to a laptop.

I have had my device 10 months now, at this point. My on screen keyboard is starting to flicker and disappear!! I am at the point of doing factory resets. I asked what they would do if it should fail, and was told they would \"talk about a replacement\" I researched the \"NEW\" Kindle Fire HD, yes they are making a new HD. I am NOT referring to the HDX. The new HD doesn't come in a 32 GB version, and they have removed the camera. I have 1000's of pictures taken with this device. I will not settle for a new one with no camera, nor will I settle for cheaper quality. Nor will I settle for under 32 GB! Please, go read the feed back on the new HD before you buy one. I will be saving my money for a Google Nexus 7, before I buy another one of these. I have a Kindle 4th generation reader, all my books will be transferred there. As far as my apps, I don't care, there are far more apps to be had in Google Play Store. I will not settle for a discount on a new device. I want my 2012 model. Sorry Amazon. New is not necessarily better. This is one customer who won't settle for less than what I have now.I bought this as a late Christmas (January 2012) gift, my entire family pitched in to help me get it. Living on a fixed income, I do not spend money lightly, so this was a thoroughly researched endeavor. I purchased it at a local Best Buy, along with a superb screen protector. I ordered the Honey Yellow leather Amazon case, directly from Amazon. I will leave feed back on the case separately.I studied every 7 inch tablet on the market for months before choosing the Kindle Fire HD. This is my first tablet. I currently own and use an iPod Touch 4th generation, with Retina display. My Fire HD puts the iPod display to shame.For those who give this Kindle Fire HD a lower rating  because there is no charger, or they live out side the US, this information is readily available on the internet, in advance of buying. One just needs to do a bit of research. READ THE FINE PRINT.I was aware there was no charger, it DOES include a USB charge cord for your computer, and my Fire came with about a 75% charge. I did not buy the charger simply because I went to three stores, and no one had one. I activated my Fire, which took all of five minutes. After activating I received my free month of Amazon Prime, and promptly ordered the charger with free two day shipping. So if you have not bought a charger, you may want to take advantage of the free two day shipping. AFTER purchasing and activating your Kindle Fire HD.UPDATE: While writing this review, I heard a knock on the door, and there was my brand new Amazon Kindle Power Fast Charger!! It got to me in less than 24 hours from Arizona to Washington, on my doorstep, for the same price I would have paid in the store. No gas spent to run out a look for one. I am amazed at that shipping! Thanks Amazon!Yes, you have to sign up for one click shopping. Which is no big deal. (Unless you have children who will be using this. Since I don't fall into that bracket, I can not comment on this detail.)I do not find the ads that everyone is talking about, even remotely intrusive. I will eventually pay to have them removed. Simply because I prefer that. Some of the ads are things I would love to take advantage of. I find the ads no different than surfing the internet, or Face Book, and seeing the ads there. It is simply not a big deal.I have down loded several basic apps, such as Face Book, and a battery charge indicator, I always buy the pay version of an application to avoid the ads and to SUPPORT the designers-developers of these applications. These people put a lot of work into the development and design of these applications, and desrve our support. Think of it this way; would you go to work with out pay, then give away what you designed, and receive nothing in return? They need our support.A little about myself, I am a 59 year old grand mother of 8 grand kids. Happily married almost 30 years, and, I love new technology.I am also totally deaf in one ear, and have about 50% hearing in the other. This highly influenced my decision to purchase this Kindle Fire HD. I can HEAR the speakers!! They are amazing. I just finished watching a movie, and it was awesome! My lap top has Dolby Home Theater speakers and they are not as good as the speakers on this Fire!Some foot notes here:I was able to bring the Fire to 100% full charge while sleeping. Plugged into my computer.The case fits perfect, but does need a better \"clasp\", and the case is more slippery to hold than the Fire is to hold with out it.There is \"down\" time, as it can't be used while charging. UPDATE: If you buy the fast charger there is no \"down\" time. The down time is caused by the user consuming more power than the USB cord can generate while in use. I hope this makes sense. See the comment left in my commets below this review.There are a lot of free books, apps, and so on, in the store, and many low cost books. It is a dream to read on.I have no issues with the screen flipping from horizontal to vertical. UPDATE: I have found quite a few free books and a lot of 99 cent books.Surfing the web is fast and easy. This is directly affected by what kind of router you have. A better router is going to give you faster speeds.Setting up a Yahoo e-mail account was a breeze.  Most set ups are self explanitory.A pleasant surprise; I can play one of my favorite Face Book games on this with out a flash player. That game is Fairyland. I also down loaded Words With Friends. I plan on getting other games as well, this grandma likes a few games, growing up with kids in the Nintendo age, gave me an appreciation of a good game.The camera can be activated for use absolutely FREE, by going to \"photos\" and clicking on the camera icon in the corner.THERE IS AN \"OWNERS MANUAL\"!!! Get to it by swiping down from the top of the screen. All settings will be there.The touch screen is wonderfully sensitive. My iPod has to be touched quite hard for it to respond. So the sensitive screen is a plus for me.The on screen key board is as well, sensitive and easy to use.The build of this Fire HD is incredible. Very well built. Some complain about the weight, but the weight is there because it IS very well built. The screen is made of Corning Gorilla glass.I had brief use of an Apple iPad, and I do not regret not buying the Apple product.I know this Fire HD is going to bring me many years of enjoyment.I, in no way wish to deminish the Apple products, but wish to explain my reasons for not purchasing one. They have another purpose and place in the design of things, and they did not fit my needs. As far as the Kindle \"eco system\" being geared to Amazon products, yes, it is, but so is the Apple \"eco system\" geared to Aple products. I do not find this an issue.I did not have to transfer data onto My Kindle Fire from a previously owned device, I have the privledge of starting brand new.I have yet to experience everything this Fire has to offer, and I will be updating this review in the future. As I said, there is much more to be discovered, that is not covered here.For those who are curious, this is built by Texas Instruments. A Long time company with an excellent reputation. I still have my first red LED Texas Instruments watch, over 40 years old and it still works!Many thanks to my family who made this possible.

Welch", "ReviewID": "RE94N823MG9KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never owned an iPad, though I have used them. I have also used various other tablets, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Nexus. I have owned the Toshiba Thrive 10.1\" tablet. I must say, for the money, Kindle Fire HD 7\" (without special offers) is the hands-down winner for my specific purposes.I am not a gamer, so I cannot comment on the comparison there. My needs for a tablet device, are, and the review reflects usage, as follows: reading while traveling; easy access of email (my yahoo, hotmail, gmail personal and my business godaddy accounts) which are all loaded, synched and ready to go; listening to my favorite few hundred songs; to watch the occasional movie; to be able to view my own photos and videos whenever I wish; accessing my facebook and twitter accounts; surfing the web when not in front of my Mac or my laptop.Yes, I know it may be limited, but those are my parameters. I originally thought my Thrive would replace my laptop but it did not. I believe that I will always have a laptop for various things I need to do. The Thrive was, in essence, my learning curve on exactly what I wanted, and needed, in a smaller portable device to use mainly while traveling. I carry my Kindle and my 15.6\" laptop (with all cords, chargers and a variety of other items) in my Wenger 16-Inch Legacy Checkpoint-Friendly Computer Case.The Kindle Fire HD has fantastic WiFi capabilities; never an issue. Near a hotspot? Connect. Easy as that. I have not yet had it lose a connection. The device has fantastic optics; brilliant colors that are alive and pop. It is a pleasure to show my photos to others on the Fire HD. I did match it directly against the iPad, Thrive and Galaxy and the visual is better than the competition. Dolby Digital Plus definitely delivers the goods. The sound is great. And when you plug in a good (not cheap) headset be prepared to fill yourself full of high quality sonic. Word docs, pdfs, and spreadsheets have all been viewed successfully.When I got the Thrive one of the reasons is that I thought a 10 inch screen would be better to read books when I travel. And, in many ways, it is. But I am more than satisfied with the Fire HD 7\" screen when I read. It is easy on the eyes and the form factor is also more comfortable when reading.I am getting pretty close to the advertised 11 hours of operational battery time, which is excellent. That means when flying coast to coast I am able to use my Kindle while sitting in the terminal, during the flight, sitting again during a layover, and then the continuation flight, without having to worry about running out of juice (and/or searching the airport terminal for the sometimes elusive outlet).As the Amazon Kindle PowerFast was on sale when I got my Fire HD, I purchased it. I am glad I did. At first I was a bit disappointed that it was not included with the device, but, at this price-point, it makes business sense that it is not. Amazon has delivered an outstanding device. Yes, it is all tied to their content, but that also makes the Fire HD very attractive due to all of that content.All in all, the Kindle Fire HD exceeds all of my expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone with the caveat that I have not used it with any games and do not plan to.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome kindle fire", "Author": "Trenton", "ReviewID": "R243L4MGJNRBOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this as a Christmas gift from my mom.

First let me say that the battery life is phenomenal!  We were heading out of town when my Kindle arrived.  I charged it for about half an hour...not a full charge but it was maybe about halfway.  I let my daughter watch a movie on it while I was packing.  Then played with it for awhile before we left and all during our three hour drive.  So about 6-7 hours of use total and it held that little bit of charge.  On a full charge I can play with it almost all day.  My daughter's first gen Kindle Fire holds a charge for a couple of hours max.  This is a huge improvement.  The sound quality is excellent.  My favorite thing about it is the screen resolution.  With my daughter's older Kindle, the screen is hard to see when near a window or if you are in a car or outside.  I was able to easily see this screen while we were driving and could still see it with sunglasses on.  When watching movies on it, there are no glitches or pixelating on the playback.  The movies are smooth and clear...just like watching a DVD.  My techie brother who has an iPad was very impressed with the screen.  I have only played with the camera a little bit, but it seems to work well.  I do agree it would have been nice to have the front and rear facing...but I won't necessarily use this for a camera that much.  Would have been nice to use for HD video but will be difficult to do unless I'm taking video of myself.

In the past year or so I have found myself addicted to Amazon so when someone offered this in trade for an item I had for sale on Craigslist I thought what is there to lose. I already have a few tablets but all of them are 10\" displays so this would take the place when I wanted a smaller display. Kindle Freetime was a big plus, my daughter is quite the fan. When I have handed her my android tablets previously I have found it way too easy for her to download games that cost me money, Freetime eliminates that risk completely. She likes the freedom of doing whatever she wants, I like not having to look over her shoulder. The display KILLS the iPad and iPad mini as well as the android tablets I have. The interface is quite smooth, but it is a bit different than a typical android device. Battery life is great, and streaming via the microhdmi slot to the television with Amazon Prime is really nice. I would like to see the ability to turn off the display while streaming over hdmi so there is not the distraction of the video playing over the tablet as well as the television, but all in all this is a great device.

Those little speakers are awesome.I wasn't sure how much I would like the Fire HD for reading since I have been using the Kindle Keyboard for the last few years so, I was going to hang on to the old one for reading just in case. You can now find the old one packed away in the attic with stuff I need to sale on eBay.I don't surf the web much on the Fire HD (I save that for working hours)but what little I have surfed was OK. I would like the bigger version if that was my primary concern. Amazon Silk is smooth and I guess it is 30% faster than the older version, but I don't know for sure. I do like the reading view that removes the images as they are usually a nuisance anyway.I bought the Kindle Cover and I am amazed at how it magically turns on the Fire HD when I open the cover and turns it off when I close the cover. Amazing and convenient. It makes the perfect stand as well since nobody wants to hold their Fire HD when watching a movie.The only drawback about the case is the hole that fits over the headphone jack isn't big enough. The plastic piece on my jack is bigger than the hole so the jack doesn't insert all the way. It is made for those little ipod type earbuds. So, I have to pop the Fire HD out of the case a little bit to make it work.Anyhow, I'm sure you are reading these reviews to help in your decision to buy, so I hope this helps.

My upgrade came about because my daughter has taken over my original. So there was a little bit of an adjustment period for me with the upgrade to the HD.OK, that being said, there's good and bad to the HD. Let's start with the BAD:* The power and volume buttons. This is absolutely my biggest complaint with the HD. The earlier Fire had a power button very easy to find and click. On the HD I can't seem to turn it on or off without first visually finding it (which is annoying as I tend to read in the dark at night), and even then, it can be tricky. I wish they'd stuck with the power button on the original Fire.* The Favorite section. Because the Kindle Fire & Fire HD don't have a way to organize books into collections, I've previously used the Favorite section to organize books I've read, allowing me to remove them from my carousel while still keeping them downloaded to my device. The Favorite section now is more awkward than on the earlier Fire. In terms of being able to use it as a way to organize a large collection of books, I'm not a fan. Really, though, I'd love to see them add a way to organize books into collections and off the main carousel.* The ads before the lock screen. Of course, this is something practically everyone is mentioning, but I will say that it doesn't bother me too much ... I just miss the beautiful screen savers that could be found on the earlier Fire.* The charger. I hate that it only came with a USB cord. You really don't want to be reliant on connecting to a computer to charge your device. At the very least, they should've included an adapter to be used with the USB cord, so that you can connect to a computer (which you sometimes have to do to download books ... especially those you download from your library) but also attach the adapter and be able to charge the old-fashioned way, through a power outlet. Still, this is something easily rectified by purchasing an adapter yourself.The GOOD:* The screen is absolutely beautiful (magnifique!). Especially if you plan to watch a lot of movies or TV shows on your Kindle, this alone should make the HD tempting.* The speakers are awesome. They're good on the earlier Fire, too, but it's a definite upgrade on the Fire HD. Especially at full volume, when sound often gets distorted on the small speakers you find on devices like this.* The main menu. Normally I wouldn't think of a menu as being something that would matter to me, but I really like the options and the way the main menu is organized on the Fire HD.* The camera. It's nice having a camera, but also nice being able to import pictures. This was something I regretted the lack of on the earlier Fire.* Social media options. The Fire HD seems to have been made taking into account how much people rely on social media these days, so they've made it easy to access and integrate with sites like Facebook and Twitter, as well as your email accounts.* End page of books. When you reach the end of a book you're now taken to a page that makes it easy for you to rate/review the book you've just read, but also shows you similar books to the one you've just read. As someone who will often be in the mood for something similar to the good book I've just read, I love this, especially as Amazon does a really good job with its recommendations.* Swipe down to access settings menu. On the earlier Fire you would have to press at the top of your screen, and then press again, to access the settings menu -- now you just press and slide your finger down the screen and it drops the settings menu down. It's an easier, cleaner way to access that particular menu.* It seems to hold large amounts of content better than the earlier Fire. On the Fire, once I clicked on the book menu and all of my books would pop up, the books would blink and occasionally layer one on top of another. The HD doesn't seem to have issues with this.* One thing I have to say about both the Fire and the Fire HD is that they are built durable. My daughter has dropped our Fire on more than one occasion without any damage to it, and the HD seems to be built just as well (though this hasn't been tested yet, and hopefully won't be, lol). The rubber back keeps the device from slipping, and I also think it adds a layer of protection to the device.* Like on the earlier Fire, it's so easy to search for books, apps, music, and videos to purchase. And the one-click option just makes doing so super convenient.* There are other little things to enjoy about Fire HD -- more options and extras for books, slightly larger screen, slightly thinner, easy to hold, etc.My likes far outweigh my complaints. The few things I would like to see changed aren't enough for me to not recommend this to people. It's a great little device, one I've yet to encounter any problems with. It's made well, runs well, is organized in a way that makes sense, is easy to hold, and has a beautiful screen and excellent speakers. Not to mention, it's price helps make it a great (and smart!) buy.There's two other things I'd like to comment on. First, I find that people often ask Fire, Nook, and iPad owners what they love and hate about their devices, and what they'd say to recommend their devices to others. And the one thing I always mention is customer service. Amazon has fantastic customer service, especially when it comes to their Kindles. I was having issues with my earlier Kindle and contacted customer service. They had me try a couple things (turn my device off and on, deregister and reregister my device), and when that didn't solve the problem they sent me out a new device, no hassle. It arrived in two days. They also sent a pre-paid shipping label out so that I could box up my old device and easily send it back. Simple and painless. From everything I've heard/read, this is an area where Amazon really stands out compared to other companies. If you're torn between one of the Kindles and a similar device, I recommend you take this into consideration.And, finally ... when pairing with Amazon Prime, this device goes to a whole new level. Having access to the Prime Instant Video library has made me fall in love with my Kindle in a new way. It's so easy to just access their large video library and watch movies or TV series on my device. Not to mention, you get a free monthly loan from their Kindle Owners' Lending Library. This is one area in which Amazon truly distinguishes itself from its competitors, in my opinion.Overall, I'm once again a satisfied Amazon customer!Edited Jan 05, 2013:Still pretty much love the device but wanted to add another point each for the Good and Bad column.* Bad -- I miss the charge indicator on the outside of the Kindle. On the earlier device it would light up red when the device was plugged in and charging, and green when it was plugged in and the charge was complete. Not only did this let you know when your device was charged, it also allowed you to see that it was properly plugged in and actually charging. Nothing more annoying than going to grab your Kindle Fire HD, only to realize it wasn't properly plugged in and you have no charge left.* Good -- I love that it now shows you exactly what percentage you are in your book, right on the page. On the earlier device you would have to bring up the lower menu to see how far in the book you are. Now it's listed right there on the bottom right-hand corner.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Graphics great", "Author": "Teresa Banks", "ReviewID": "RQW6WAKG7NW3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice size, has everything I need and more, for work or personal time, graphics are great and very easy to see when reading, and love all the apps that it came with.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy it!!

I think I have probably used mine certainly as a reader more than she has.  I don't use a lot of apps but I downloaded a few utility apps such as a scientific calculator, unit converter and the like to make it more useful.  I enjoy reading on the Kindle more than I expected.  A primary reason for getting them was for being able to take several books along when flying off on vacation.  With the purchase of a Kindle you get a month of Kindle Prime free (I'm going to continue with Prime) and that gives you a free down load of some Kindle books, one per month.  It's on a calendar month basis so we could down load one for November and just a few days later one for December.  And I've just down loaded one from our county library system.  So I've read two books and I'm well into the 3rd.  I love the X-Ray feature.  For example a character comes up and I've forgotten just who they are.  I use the X-Ray feature and it will show up all instances of that character by page, chapter or the entire book.  Go back to the first instance and it will remind me who the character is.  Not all down loads have this feature.  The one from the county library does not. Obviously it lays flat.  So if I'm reading the book while eating lunch at work, I don't have to manipulate a sandwich while keeping the book open at the same time.  And yes that's lazy.  I'm OK with that.  I can read for hours with no eye strain.  It's at least as easy as reading a paper copy.  There is some glare outside.  I've read quite a bit outside while at deer camp.  It's not bad but it is not without glare.  For me the screen is a comfortable size for reading.I've used it quite a bit for searching the web.  If you're used to the Apple format such as the iPhone, it's different on the Kindle.  Not in a bad way, just different.  The spell check including the anticipation of what you are going to type is differnt but once I've gotten use to it, I think I really like that feature better than on the iPhone.  It puts up several choices and you tap one to select it.  Sometimes it will anticipate a word based on the previous words before you've even started typing the next word.  For some things such as getting to bookmarks or searching the web, it's probably not as intuitive as the Apple format (tap the menu icon, starter page and then enter a search string, tap bookmarks etc) but once you get use to it, it works just fine.  And aplogies for referring to the Apple format several times but many people are already familiar with that and it seems a valid point of reference.We have had no problems with them, no freezes or hang-ups.  One time mine was not going into landscape.  I powered it down and restarted it and the landscape feature returned.  I try to remember to do that about once per week for all my portable devices just like I do for desktops and laptops to get rid of computer \"fuzz\".In short my wife and I are both enjoying them and are glad we made the purchase.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "B.

I've been having fun with it ever since.This is my second Kindle.  My old faithful travels with me to work, making it easy to read during my lunch hour.  I've found my new Kindle to be just as portable and readable, though I think the original Kindle screen will be easier to read in daylight while the lit screen on the Kindle Fire makes reading in bed at night without another light source not only possible, but comfortable.While I'm still exploring its various functions, I do like the larger screen on this Kindle as compared to my older model and I am enjoying playing games on it as well.  The touch screen did take a little getting used to, but it's second nature now.One feature I'm finding very useful is the sync to furthest page read option, since I am using both my original Kindle and the Kindle Fire.  It's very convenient to keep one in my purse and the other at my bedside and simply sync to the last page and start reading where I left off without having to bring a book with me where ever I go.  This feature also works between the Kindle apps available for download for use on a computer to sync reading between laptop and Kindle.As with my original Kindle, I love the ease of downloading books from Amazon and being able to preview books I'm considering by downloading a sample.  I like being able to start a new book as soon as I finish the last one without having to carry two books with me.  With my Kindle, I can carry an entire library of books with me.  I'm looking forward to exploring what else my new Kindle Fire has to offer.The Kindle Fire is available with or without \"special offers\" ($15 extra to be advertisement free).  I much prefer the pretty cover screens when the Kindle is idle to any ads that might have appeared there.I do recommend getting the quick charge adapter to use with the USB cable provided to be able to charge the Kindle Fire using an electric outlet rather than through the computer's USB port.

Another thing I really like is the Kindle Free Time app. I have a 3-year old and she loves playing \"games\" and watching shows but it's always so costly to buy them. With Kindle Free Time, she has unlimited access to thousands of TV shows, apps and books specifically for kids age 3-6. It's so awesome and she loves that she can pick out new items whenever she'd like. I have the free one-month trial, but for $4.99/month afterwards, I'll definitely be keeping it.

It does everything as advertised and seems to be a bargain compared to the other tablets out there. I just tested the HD output and only expected 720p since that is the advertised display resolution advertised, but was surprised to see that it is a full 1080p. The TV display for the input line was showing 1080p. I and another person visually confirmed that it looked 1080, not just 720 using a Sony Bravia 42\" TV. Also, the sound quality was at least dolby 5.1 surround, confirmed using an add on surround sound system. This had been a question I had and tried to get the info on from other reviews that only confirmed HD input, not exactly what resolution it was and they seemed to say it was OK, but they wouldn't use it for HD TV viewing. Why exactly that is, I have no idea because it works extremely well, as long as you have a 1080p source I guess - I tested using Netflix.It browses the web fast and I think the dual wi-fi antennas are helpful in that.The only complaint I currently have is the magazine selection available for kindle is extremely limited and that was something I wanted to use it for. Hopefully, publishers will catch up and start providing their magazines with full content and illustrations for kindle HD.There were more apps than I expected but I realize it's not the full Android selection, but I've found everything I want for now including some cool games.I mainly wanted an e-reader that did more like movies and web browsing.

The screen and speakers are phenomenal for videos, which has been my primary use of the Kindle Fire HD so far. I get a good WiFi signal in parts of my house where my Macbook Air doesn't. The battery life is satisfactory.I think an important thing for a prospective buyer to keep in mind about the Kindle Fire HD is that it isn't meant to cater to a poweruser, like a lot of other Android tablets. The app selection doesn't seem as comprehensive as the Google Play Store (or at least there are certain key apps that you can't get from Amazon) and the interface feels designed to keep you within the boundaries of Amazon's ecosystem--I deduct about 3/4 of a star for this. This feels like it was made to sell you content from Amazon, but if you're nerdy enough, there are ways to work around the things that you can't readily do. As long as you understand what you're getting into, it's a great tablet to own and use.One advantage it has over the other tablets is that if you have an Amazon Prime subscription, there's a lot of free content that you can't access on other tablets.My only other gripe is minor--I wish the USB port was somewhere other than the bottom edge--If used with the leather cover, it can't be charged and stood up at the same time.

It is better, it is not even remotely close to being readable in sunlight on anything but the highest brightness settings. Even in my poorly lit office it requires mid-brightness settings to be visible.Okay the good stuff:-The new design is fantastic. The new speaker system and placement is worlds better than the Fire's horrible speakers.-The responsiveness of the screen is downright shocking. I honestly couldn't believe how easy it is to type on the new screen with zero errors or lag.-Speaking of lag, the new processor is much quicker.-Streaming quality is vastly improved. The difference between the Fire and HD is noticeable right off the bat.-The ads aren't nearly as intrusive as I was expecting.Haven't delved too deeply into the other features like the camera, but if they are as good as everything else I'm sure they won't be an issue at all.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Dutchie", "ReviewID": "R2D7JC37JQKSLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a kindle touch with 3G and wifi last year for Christmas.

Most places nowadays have free wi-fi, so I can still use it almost everywhere, and when I don't have wifi I just read my book or play games :) It's amazing what all you can do with it! The design has broad enough edges to hold on to it comfortably, has smoother edges and not the boxy design of the regular kindle fire, and the quality is wonderful. I watched a tv show through instant streaming from Amazon (with my prime membership) and the quality was just as good as it would have been on my HD tv. I expected to need my headphone to get the sound loud enough, but even with the sound only halfway up it was plenty loud enough. I got a cover with it so that I can stand my kindle up at an angle for easy watching of shows and movies without having to hold it.

Yesterday, I received the Kindle Fire HD because I wanted a tablet, and my experience with my first Kindle was very good.  Video and sound on the Fire HD is awesome!  It has sharp, crisp imaging and excellent sound quality!  I use Pandora on my laptop computer so I was able to easily and quickly connect to Pandora as well as link up to my email accounts in a matter of minutes.  No fuss, no muss.  Downloading & installing apps are done in less than a minute.  WOW!!!  Now if I can get the hang of this 'cloud' thing I'll be golden. :)However, there are 2 things that would have made it a touch easier. 1 - setting the system time.  It took me 30 minutes of looking around before I found out how to set the time.  2 - if I can only find the camera app!  I don't use Skype but I'm hoping to in the near future so at this moment, I have no need for video but it would be nice if I can locate the camera app to take a few pictures to see how they turn out.

It's a Kindle.Amazon did a great job creating and defining this product.Here's what I think are the KFHD (Kindle Fire HD) strong sides:* Great for games* Great for movies. Highly integrated with Amazon for movie buying, renting and streaming. Lots of free stuff for Amazon Prime members.* HD screen* Impressive build quality* Can connect to your pc via USB to transfer content* Good sound quality (for a tablet)* HDMI connection to your TV* Fast dual channel wireless-N connectionNow, not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, it's really up to what you're looking for in your KFHD, but the customization options are limited (for example, you can't even rearrange the icons on you screen) and administration is limited (example: you can't really control the wifi adapter, and even the wireless connection control is kind of \"hidden\"). So basically the KFHD is not targeted at \"power users\".The thing I don't really like about this device is that the app selection is limited. You definitely don't get access to every Android app out there. Also, there is no support for Adobe Flash so some sites will not load properly.One other issue is that I wasn't able to connect my Kindle to my workplace Exchange server so I can't use the device for work email which is frustrating. I heard though that you can buy and app that does this. Not so great though, the competition has this for free.Given all the above, I think you'll find that the KFHD is excellent for kids. I got mine for my kids to watch movies during long drives and it did the job wonderfully. We rented the movie HD for 3-4 dollars, downloaded it locally to the device and they were able to watch it with no wifi connectivity. They were also able to play their favorite games like Fruit Ninja, Cut the Rope, Temple Run and such, and I even got FIFA 12 and Madden 12 for $0.99 each!When it's on wifi, the device has great data rate and i am able to surf, email, facebook and skype with no issues at all.there's no GPS and no back Camera (just a front facing one). But these were not issues for me.the KFHD only comes with a USB cable so i ended up spending additional money on a wall and car charger (the iphone ones don't work with it) and I will have to buy some kind of cover to protect the device. I'm a little disappointed that Amazon did not include a wall charger at least.Last but not least: customer support is very good too.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "I think this surpasses the original Fire", "Author": "Christi S. \"Bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R1LBGMI0184DSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the original Fire at the end of July when I won it from a site.

We all recognized that Amazon specifically didn't specify the operating system of its tablet on the website. My intention of finding an Android tablet was so that I can reload other paid apps that I had on Google store. So the great excitement of getting a new tablet soon bypass as I opened the tablet and recognized that the operating system was configured so that it will benefit the Amazon app store (go figure!) and there was no way I could have done to load the google app store down to the tablet. I am a student, all I needed was some dictionary and the office suite (documents to go that I paid). No way for me to re-enter the product key into the trial version.Hey if you find that you could not compete with other companies making tablets, don't make one! If you make one, we, the customer should be able to really OWN the tablet after we buy it. Not that we are strictly led to your limited market with whatever app that was a fraction of the play store. I know that documents to go is compatible with my tablet. I know there are many more medical dictionary (free apps) on play store. I hate this tablet due to the software now and plan to return it sometimes in a near future.Thanks Amazon!P.S.: I really love using Amazon buying my books and things like usual. I just hate this tablet and me being forced into one market. There was no longer freedom. That was what I hated.***Update on 7/18/13I am just now starting to love my kindle fire hd despite the fact that I couldn't customize the home screen a lot like with other common android tablets.

It would be nice to have your own pic on the opening screen and the the screen ads are a little repetitive.  The ads after you open the Kindle, recommended based on your current selection, I think, are absolutely genius.  I love the recommendations.

I had the Kindle Fire 1st gen and loved it.  I was a little apprehensive about getting the HD after some of the negative comments, but I am glad I got this one. My favorite things that are better than 1st gen Fire is the wifi.  I get MUCH better wifi reception.  The battery, I would estimate lasts about twice as long.  It charges lickety split (from 15 to 30% in about 10 min).  I love the xray feature if you forget who a character is.

She had the older black and white version. She is rough on her gear and went through four of them over the last 2 years. Because of this My thoughts on Kindle has been, \"great idea, poor execution\".This was my feeling until I had a credit on Amazon and decided to try out the Fire HD 7\". I received it in the mail on the quick thanks to my Amazon Prime membership and I was off to the races.The form factor is solid, the capacitive multi touch screen is very smooth and responsive (as good as my Apple devices for sure)and its just under $200.00. It is also very solid and sturdy. There are NO issues connecting to all types of WIFI as I have had with some of my other tablets. It just simply works.Another thing that I really dig is how great movies look. I converted a 1080p copy of Prometheus to 720p MP4 using the free Any Video Converter and all I can say is WOW!!

Just amazing!I am a prolific reader, both for pleasure and related to my profession as a a lawyer. This is the fourth Kindle our family has owned so far, and I have had it about a week so far, and here are my initital thoughts.My wife and I each have owned Kindle DXs -- wonderful devices in their own right. Mine failed (screen) about a month ago (after 30 months), but the Kindle Fire, after a year, had transformed my reading habits in bed at night. The DX, to be honest, was a bit too heavy for comfortable reading in bed, AND the external light required you to have it clipped in the binder, making the light uneven and the DX even heavier. The Kindle Fire (1st generation) was just right for reading in bed, and it did a lot of things dependably and well, but the Kindle Silk web surfing software was good but not great. I have been waiting to purchase a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet, which looks like it won't be out for a couple of months, and thought of just passing on a new Kindle, but the Surface's delay caused me to re-evaluate my needs. It seemed I really didn't need an iPad substitute, because the tablet would handle those issues, but I needed a new reader and a small one to keep reading in bed.I did buy the 32GB version because I have a LOT of books, but decided the larger screen was unnecessary in view of the upcoming Microsoft Surface or Ipad for my office. Amazon thoughtfully preloaded my collection into it, and after storing ALL 410 titles on it, I have hardly made a dint in storage. This makes if possible to store a movie or two, or even a few hundred songs. I'm using less than 3GB of storage on mine so far.INITIAL THOUGHTS(1) First of all, it seemed a bit iritating (and chinchy) that it comes only with a USB charging cable and not with a wall adapter. Then, I've discovered that my OLD Kindle Fire chargers do a very good job of charging this one -- in fact, I can't tell too much difference in the time using the fast charger, and they will keep the charge while I'm watching streaming video. It is easy to keep it charged in the car or in the various spots around my home and office. This turns out to be a good thing, because BATTERY LIFE IS A LITTLE LESS THAN I EXPECTED.(2) The \"readability\" of the screen is just astounding -- text is so crisp it appears printed. Much better than the original Fire in my opinion. I quickly scanned through all the fonts and they all look good. Screen choices are still black text on white; black on sepia, and white on black.(3) The high-def screen makes streaming movies look gorgeous and streaming has been fast and uninterrupted from Amazon and Netflix and HBO2GO.(4) As a lawyer, documents (big PDF books) are huge in my life, and the Amazon Cloud makes it so easy to load them (and music and video) on the Fire HD, it's amazing. Amazon also certainly improved the internal assumptions the device makes on displaying a PDF document, making them much more pleasing visually and easier (but not a breeze) to navigate through. This, for me, is a super improvement. The Amazon cloud player for this purpose is great and so easy to install and use.(5) There are a number of custom \"techie\" things you can do like swap out the Amazon Silk browser for an Android brouser -- chiefly if you want to see \"flash\" documents. I have not tried this yet, but with the 32GB version, there's no reason not to have both.(6) I got the simple (purple in my) leather case with mine, along with a plastic screen protector as a bundle. The case attaches very simply, and does a good job of protecting it (maybe not great --I have an Otter case on order if I take it out in the woods or park). The leather case puts the Fire HD in \"sleep mode\" when you close it magnetically. I also got a rubber tipped stylus in the hopes of minimizing smudges on the glass. It's possible that the plastic screen protector does interfere with the stylus (by not being as slick as glass). You may want to check that out if you're a stylus junkie before putting the plastic on there -- anyway, the rubber tip (think pencil eraser) doesn't quite \"glide\" over the plastic. Consequently I don't love the stylus, so unless you have an app that requires it, it's not a great addition. I still prefer my fingers to the stylus, but then I don't draw on the thing.(7) And the sound -- I'm a music lover with a huge music collection and these little speakers sound GOOD. And when you plug in some quality headphones or buds, the sound quality is exceptional. When I'm home, I now plug in my several hundred dollar Sennheiser and musical appls like Pandora or even listening to your Amazon music from the cloud really brings the music \"to life\" compared to the 1st generation Kindle Fire.(8) At night, when I finish reading, I can select some quiet music from Pandora, and then set the alarm clock feature to wake me the next morning -- you get plenty of volume for that.(9) I really like the operating system. It seems \"snappier\" than the original. Almost everything is intuitive if you are moving up from the first generation Fire, and I understand it is otherwise similar to most Android tablets.(10) When you have wi-fi, you can Skype or video conference with this baby. It's not beautiful, but it's adequate -- certainly as good as most smart phones.(11) \"Read aloud text\" disappeared from the Kindle Fire, but it's back on the HD and it's generally satisfying, meaning that I can put this on the seat by me in the car and turn the volume up and get by. It's not quite up to the voice of a great narrator, but it's useful if your eyes get tired. Now, if it would just work on an Adobe PDF document!QUIRKS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS:(1) No device design is perfect, and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablet has some quirks. The first question is why put the charger input on the side where the cover opens? By doing this, you can't set the Fire HD on your nightstand or table in landscape (to watch a video) and leave it charging using the open edge of the cover as a \"bi-pod\" to stand it up for you to watch it. Maybe there was a profound technical reason, but this seems remarkably inconvenient as compared to the older Kindle Fire, which charges from the \"top\".(2) Another quirk is the rocker switch for volume included next to the power button on what is usually the \"top\" when in portrait mode for the device. It works splendidly as an adjunct to bringing up the volume slider in the app. However, the left rocker increases the sound and the right rocker decreases it -- which I greeted with all the joy of disovering the builder had reversed the hot and cold faucets in the shower in the new home you just bought. You can adjust to this quirk, but one wonders \"who did this?\" Is it some convention where the device was built in China?(3) I think they should have included a GPS chip so we would have real map-reading capability. It will \"infer\" location from your wi-fi, and it seems fairly accurate, but we are NOT always at with wi-fi access when we want to know the weather or whether there's a movie or a bar or a Starbuck's nearby. I get a 76 yard probability of error on my office location, which is certainly adequate for a small town. In a large city with a lot of free WAPs downtown, I would think it would be more accurate, but I haven't had a chance to test that theory.(4) There is constant \"others who've purchased this item . . . bought the following\".  You get this when you load an app or a book or movie and , below it Amazon helpfully reminds me that people who bought this app also bought these other fine products. YOU CAN TURN THIS OFF IN THE SYSTEM SETTINGS..(5) Finally, my biggest beef is now I am bombarded with ads when I turn the device on as a \"splash screen\". Now the only real complaint I have about the device (and I would have bought the Fire HD anyway knowing it) is it bugs me to get ads when I'm not shopping.  I understand there was a $15.00 \"advertisers subsidy\" to the price, and if so, I'll gladly send Amazon an additional $15.00 to turn it off AND let me put a splash screen I like on it.(6)Don't get me wrong! I love Amazon and think it is one of the single greatest game changers of my lifetime. I hate to shop, and it makes life so much easier and more pleasant to do so, when I can see the recommendations and experiences of hundreds of thousands of other people with products I am considering. But that is WHEN I AM SHOPPING! When I am settling into a new movie or a delicious new book, I don't care what other people bought at that moment, and I don't want to be distracted by these ads. Maybe you can turn them off, and I'll be looking hard for a way to do it. Clarifying, I DON'T MIND the ads when I open one of the \"stores\", but I don't want them all the time. That's just intruding on my peace.If you have an older family member who is technically afraid of computers, but who would love to be able to read a little email from their grandkids and see pictures of them, this bright screen and relative simplicity may be enough for them to overcome their computer fears and help them keep in touch.SO OVERALL:(1) Sceen readability for books -- A+(2) Screen for video -- A-(3) Sound quality -- A(4) Storage capacity -- A(5) Flexibility of use -- A+ -- simply incredible.(6) Operating system -- B (because of those damn subsidizing ads)(7) Battery life -- best guess is 4-6 hours with wi-fi on. If you want to read a long book and listen to music (you can do BOTH at the same time -- how cool is that?), but you'd better have a charging source available when it gets to around 25% or less.SUMMARY -- MUST HAVE! -- make your own decision on whether the ads are worth $15 to you.

The screen is excellent, clear and vivid whether reading a book or watching video. The speakers are the best I've encountered on any mobile device, including my iPad 4, iPhone 4 or Galaxy Note. The sound is amazingly clear, even at (impressively high) volume, through both the built-in speakers or through headphones. Linking my existing LoveFilm account wasn't quite as straightforward as the instructions had me expecting, but still didn't take long, and the Fire HD handles the streaming video very well. It doesn't let you access the Google Play app store, pointing you instead at Amazon's own much more limited app store, but to be honest I don't find this a problem. I didn't choose the Fire HD because I wanted a ton of apps, I chose it because of it's seamless integration with Amazon's Kindle store and LoveFilm. If you're app-obsessed buy a Nexus 7 instead.I'd love to give this device the full five stars but it'll never get the last star until Amazon add the ability to group books into collections as you can on the regular e-readers. Without this feature, the collection on the device quickly becomes cluttered, and it's already hard to find the specific book I'm looking for. It makes no sense to omit this incredibly useful feature from their most advanced devices, and is one of the reasons I still use my e-reader as well (the other being the staggering battery life of those devices).If Amazon add the missing collections feature to make managing the device's library easier it'll deserve the full five stars, no question.

I wanted to test it out for a few weeks before writing a review. So far, its amazing. I'll break the review into sections and try to keep it to-the-point. We also own an iPad, and iPad 2.(Style, Weight)The HD 7 inch is definitely heavier than an iPad but i find the outside design/style to be more appealing. The buttons are practically invisible, everything is sleek and nice to look at. It feels good in your hands and is easier to hold than iPad because of its smaller frame. Nothing sticks out and everything is smooth.(Operation)It does take up to 30 seconds for mine to fully start-up and be functional which is alot slower than iPad, but the way the Fire HD functions itself is much better. I love the carousel and how it shows your most recently used apps, games, web sites, and books. When you rest over the top of a particular book or app, the bottom row shows you similar recently purchased items by other Amazon customers which i find extremely helpful. The top navigation bar allows you to sort through Apps, Books, Games, Web, Newsstand, etc and once you choose a category you can then sort those by Cloud or Device. In my opinion (i love organizing) this setup is way better than the iPad. The settings are also easier to understand and access, by the top pull-down menu bar. It lets you access your most important settings such as Brightness, WiFi, Screen Lock/Unlock, etc within seconds. Makes it so much easier to adjust my brightness when im reading a book without even closing the book - in order to do that on iPad you'd have to go to the Home screen, Settings, Brightness and adjust it there, then back to Home screen and back to your book. iPad just uses alot more steps in order to function. There are many things you can change on the Kindle without ever leaving your book or app.(Store)This is my only complaint and the reason i only gave this 4 stars - my store is a pain to use. Wether im trying to buy books, apps, or games it takes several minutes to load... or sometimes doesnt load at all. The Fire HD boasts better internet speeds compared to iPad but i would not say thats true. I have high speed sattelite internet which words great on my Macbook, Android phones, and iPads and works terrible on my Kindle Fire HD.

The 7\" Kindle Fire HD performs just as well as the 8.9\" model. The screen is many times more visible than that of the original 7\" Kindle Fire from which I am upgrading. Just wanted to let people know that, at this time, only the 8.9\" size has accessibility features that make it useable by the blind, so if that's the use contemplated, the larger version is obviously what you would need. Not sure why they wouldn't put the complete accessibility package in the 7\" KF HD. Perhaps there'll be an upgrade eventually. During lengthy reading sessions, both KF HD models feel more secure in the hands with a genuine leather cover. I tried a couple of cheaper types of cover (shiny and then rough vinyl) and found them slippery and finally downright unpleasant when hands began to sweat. I strongly recommend the Powerfast charger that allows plugging the tablet into an electrical outlet. It only takes about 2 hours to fully charge the tablet whereas plugging the USB cable into the computer takes all night and is not always the best thing for your computer's power supply. Also, this time I chose the 16 G memory rather than the 32. With everything always available on the cloud, there's no need to store a lot of stuff on the tablet unless you're going to be away from wifi for extended periods. Additionally, I found that the #3 format for Audible books sounds just fine on the Kindle Fire HD and requires much less download time and storage space. Am I sending back my 8.9\" tablet? No. It's being passed on to a friend who has lost much of his sight and can appreciate all of the accessibility features and the larger memory.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing but buggy", "Author": "Jaime", "ReviewID": "R6WX2JML6CM5Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned the previous kindle.

My biggest complaints from using the first-gen Kindle Fire mostly revolved around the high number of software glitches; Silk, Facebook, Twitter etc. would glitch and shut down at random, which made for a really subpar user experience.If Amazon's goal with the Kindle Fire HD was to fix all of the issues that the first-gen Kindle Fire had, then it has succeeded and then some. The updates to the KFHD's book reader software are particularly awesome, and it's nice to see that Amazon did not just rest on it's laurels in its most highly developed software. The e-mail software is also spectacular. It far exceeds my Android phone's e-mail client, and I really enjoy how simple it is to use. I use ActiveSync Exchange for my work e-mail and it's just awesome.The camera is really great as well! I downloaded Photo Editor, which I use as a front-facing camera to take embarrassing candids of my family, which has been a ton of fun. Skype is also really wonderful; the image quality is great as long as your connection is good!The speakers are quite simply the best tablet speakers out there right now. The sound is fantastic and rarely grainy or distorted.I think the biggest area for improvement would be the selection of apps available. Now that the hardware for the KFHD is top notch, Amazon really needs to step up it's game in securing rights to offer more apps, although this has gotten a lot better in the past few months.I opted to include special offers, and I'm happy I did; the ads are beautiful, and mostly appear at the lock screen when the KF wakes up from sleep mode.

Crisp screen, better ( not perfect) touch recognition, more internal memory, improved interface and sound.Some gripes remain. Battery life has not been kind to us. Perhaps it is because we use our Kindles daily for long periods of time to read, stream video and browse the web but we have to charge them CONSTANTLY.

I can adjust the screen brightness to fit my comfort zone.2. I love the ability to listen to a book with text to speech.3. I love the whispersync and immersion. This alone is a good reason to get the Fire HD. You buy the book FIRST and are offered a reduced price on the audible edition. The audible edition loads automatically on the book. Then you can choose to listen and/or read the book. The text is highlighted and pages are turned automatically which is handy when you are busy doing something else.4. I can watch the purchased movies or the Amazon Prime movies on my Kindle HD or connect it to my tv with a HDMI cable (sold separately).5. I can purchase music and use this device to listen to my music.6. Books with illustrations and color pictures are shown in HD and with clarity.7. Photos can be uploaded.8.

I skipped buying 1st and 2nd Gen of iPad and was planned to go ahead with iPad 3 due to high resolution screen and better hardware. I did not care much with 4G since I have Wifi both home and work.Due to its initial SRP, this made me wait for sometime then suddenly I bumped to Kindle Fire, it was fraction of the cost of iPad and I was supposed to buy one already but my friend told me a new version of which is Kindle Fire HD was due to be released by 14 September.  I waited for a while then I it was a great decision. I bought this amazing product from Amazon. This is perfect size for my need since I need to read pdfs/e-books and normally on the bed, the weight also did not burden my hands since its light. Most importantly the screen is HD at 1280x800 despite its size at 7\" compared to Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 which is only 1024 X 600. The dual core 1.2GHz  with 1 GB RAM is responsive, scrolling through pages, icons and web pages is silky smooth. Compared to other Android devices this is fully modified by Amazon which benefits Amazons and users fairly in terms of additional layer of security against Malware and viruses. Though the only issue is that it won't allow you to easily install third party apps such from GooglePlay, but frankly speaking Appstore from Amazon will surely give you tons of relevant apps for your needs. Speakers are good with their exclusive Dolby Digital Plus decoding but not loud (unless you install SpeakerBoost, Free and official Kindle Fire HD app you can find from Appstore. Playing graphic/processor eater game such as Ashpalt 7 runs smoothly without any issues. HD videos from Youtube or Amazon Videos plays really well and in \"real\" HD. Facebook runs buttery as well. I can confirm there are very few times that it lags or some apps stopped working, but is not big deal for me. Bottom line is you wont regret buying this cool stuff, instead of getting a cheapo generic Android device which costs around US$100, add few more bucks then you get this.

The hd movies on Prime come out crystal clear and sound is definitely an upgrade from the original Fire. The device is responsive and hardly lags unless it's due to wifi connection. Overall it's a great device, but here are some negatives that dropped it from being that perfect tablet. It's an amazon tablet. I have prime and cloud, music, and audio books from amazon so all my content is on the cloud and helps since I got the 16GB. I loaded a few videos and now im left with about 5GB left. For others, this 16GB may not be enough...go for the 32. The way amazon shows how to hold the kindle with the camera to the left, makes some games show upside down. Also the power buttons/volume are hard to find. Some apps do not work for the Fire HD yet, but hopefully they will soon. Another thing I wish they had was a photobooth type app. There's no camera app on the device, so it would have been nice to see a photobooth at least.

Overall, after using it since this morning, I can say two things. 1) It's better than the original Fire by leaps and bounds and 2) It has lots of hiccups, that range from annoying to downright infuriating.I figure I'll start by talking about what is \"wrong\" with the kindle fire hd. For one, there is noticeable lag almost everywhere except the carousel. When you press an icon, especially for the silk browser, nothing happens! Sometimes it takes a few seconds for anything to launch and you're left thinking it didn't register the touch. HOWEVER, I know this will soon be fixed by software updates so don't cancel your order yet---the 1.2 GHZ processor in this thing can do better, but the software is holding it back! Next, I can't see any difference in wifi performance. My iPad is faster in every aspect, and the range is just as good. The silk browser is still a disaster, and now THERE IS NO FLASH SUPPORT! I thought the browser was slow, but at least scrolling and pinch zooming was more fluid. Again, hopefully things that will soon be addressed by a software update. Next, the volume buttons are ill placed. They are at the top of the device, very tiny and completely flush with the device. Every time I wanted to press them I had to actually go look for them. They may grow on me but be prepared for searching for the volume rocker. Speaking of the exterior, the design strikes me as odd. The bezel on this thing is massive and frankly seems like a waste of space. The Fire seems boxier too...kind of looks like a little iPad. Lastly, those darn bars. On almost all movies I watched I got two massive black bars on the screen! Why can't amazon optimize Prime content for the Fire?? Cmon. You already have precious screen real-estate and not all of it is even utilized....and there isn't an option to zoom in to make it fit. Really, really annoying.So, what makes the Kindle Fire a great device? Well for starters those speakers!! I feel immersed in videos and they get incredibly loud. No complaints there---well done Amazon and thanks for being an industry leader with dual speakers for tablets. It's about darn time. Next, the screen really does look great. Glare seems to be reduced, but it's hard to say definitively. Either way, it's a good screen and I have no complaints.Overall, the Fire is good but not great (yet). The software bogs it down and little quirks here and there add up to a somewhat frustrating experience. Yet I can't help but love this tablet. It's packed full of neat features (like X-RAY, which I thought was handy, esp. on cartoons where it shows who is voicing each character!). I've heard many people say the Nexus 7 is better. I've used the nexus 7 too and the software is much more fluid, but the google play store has no good movie/video content. No Two and Half Men, no Big Bang Theory, no Family Guy, no South Park, no Modern Family. It sucks. With Amazon's library, you're pretty much guaranteed your favorite tv show or movie is there!Should you buy this: YESWill you be disappointed: MAYBE, BUT NO DOUBT THIS DEVICE WILL ONLY GET BETTER WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pros & Cons - What I wish I'd known before I bought it ...", "Author": "Indiana James", "ReviewID": "R3VFCNR2D17V4V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Reviews are useless without context, so let me tell you a little about why I bought this device: My experience before the Kindle Fire HD was with Apple devices supplied by my work (which is one reason why there are so many iPad comparisons below - plus, lets face it, a lot of people who read this review are trying to figure out if it's worth it to spend the extra $100 on an iPad Mini), and a Kindle Touch.  I really enjoy using all of these devices, but since I try to keep work and home separate, I wanted a device of my own and was hesitant to shell out the $300+ for an iPad or iPad mini.  After doing a lot of research, I decided on the Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I made that decision based on a number of things: 1) I'm an Amazon Prime user; 2) I watch Netflix and Hulu, 3) I checked the Amazon app store to make sure the main apps I want/need were there and they were; 4) I like that I can buy content on Amazon and watch it on essentially any device, and 5) I'm a huge audible audiobook user.I've now had the device for about 3 months and used it extensively.  Here is my review:Overall: Depending on why you want this device, it's either a great buy or a mediocre buy.  If you're using it just to consume media (music, videos, books, etc) it's fine.  It can be great, in fact, if you stick to Amazon's services and/or Netflix and Hulu.  If you're expecting something that can potentially function as a replacement for your laptop, like an iPad can, - look elsewhere.  In the areas where iPad falls short of a laptop, either the iOS or a great app usually makes up the deficit.  That is simply not the case with the Kindle Fire HD.  I'm not unhappy with it per se, but I could definitely be happier.  Bottom line: this is a media consumption, social networking and shopping (from Amazon) device. If those are your purposes, it's an overall good buy.  I don't play games much, so I can't comment on that.The two biggest complaints I heard and/or saw for this device when doing my research are the ads and the buttons being hard to find.The ads: I turned off the carousel ads via settings (because they bothered me) but I still get the welcome screen ads and it's not worth the $15 to turn them off - I don't even notice them anymore.  This really is a non-issue.Th buttons: I almost never use them. There is a volume slider in every app I've seen and I use a Kindle cover that puts the device to sleep when I close the cover flap. When I do use them they are never hard to find.  Also a non-issue.10 Pros -1) Low entry price.  You can buy a Kindle Fire HD 7\", a nice leather case and about $25 worth of media/apps for less than the cost of an iPad Mini.2) It's built well.  This was a surprise.  I liked my Kindle Touch very much, but it did feel like a cheap toy when I first pulled it out of the box.  I didn't have that feeling with the Fire HD.3) It's the perfect size.  I have an iPad 2 and it's too big to read on, just uncomfortable.  My iphone, on the other hand is too small to watch movies on for the most part.  This is a perfect medium option.  Perfect for books, acceptable for video.  I'm not going running with it anytime soon, but I do listen to music on it when I'm stationary.  It even fits in a cargo pocket4) It has GREAT sound (far outperforms similar tablets on this point).  My wife and I would occasionally sit in bed and try to watch a movie on the iPad, but even with no kids in the room it was often just about impossible to hear the movie on the iPad speaker.  We simply don't have that problem on the Kindle.  I knew this before I bought it because I watched a video on a Kindle Fire HD at a crowded Best Buy during the peak of the Christmas shopping season and heard it just fine.5) I don't use this feature, but Kindle lets you set up profiles for kids restricting time and access to certain apps.  I have 5 kids and I think this is a great feature.  I just personally choose to not let them play with the device.6) It's great for reading.  Some people complain about not holding an actual book, but I have yet to meet one of those people who has tried reading an book on an e-reader with a case.  The case makes all the difference in the world.  It gives you the feel of a book, especially the leather cases and the satisfaction of closing it when you put it down or finish.  It's dumb, but it's true.7)  I love the way it interfaces with Amazon's music, books, prime video, photo and audible services.  It's seamless.8) At the time I purchased it (Christmas 2012), display resolution was almost double that of competitor tablets in similar price range. To my knowledge, there are still no devices in the $200 price range that can touch Kindle Fire HD on display quality.9) Battery life - I feel like I use this device all the time and I only charge it once a week.  My iPad and iPhone need charging once a day.10) As an Amazon Prime member I like the device a lot.  When I need to buy, I always go to Prime first.  I can usually save money and almost never pay shipping.  When you have five kids, the convenience factor of being able to shop online, not pay for shipping and get it in 2 days (sometimes 1) is impossible to overstate.  This device makes it almost unnecessary to logon to Amazon on my actual computer.  I wish I could say that I'd tried to shop elsewhere with the device, but the truth is that aside from groceries - I buy almost everything from Amazon via my Prime account.10 Cons:1) Streaming video from sites besides Amazon prime, Netflix and Hulu is sketchy.  I don't think this is a bandwidth issue - my internet is a very fast package and it works fine on my other devices. On YouTube for example, my iPhone does better on 3G than Kindle does on wifi, even with resolution turned down to low quality. I also tried comparing iPad w/ wi-fi to Kindle w/ wi-fi on YouTube and there is no contest. iPad killed it. I think this may be a google compatibility issue, because it works fine on the sites listed above. In fact, Kindle at times outperforms my iPad on Netflix.2) Privacy - Apparently, Amazon collects info about which sites you visit via the built-in Silk browser so they can push more relevant content to you in the ads. This idea bugs me and there aren't any available alternative browsers in Kindle's App Store. You can choose to encrypt your data, but it slows things down when you browse. The talking point in the marketing collateral above says \"designed for the web\" or something to that effect, I think that's true from Amazon's perspective, but not from the consumer's.  It's designed to capture data from the web to help the company sell products to the consumer.  It's absolutely not designed for the best consumer experience when browsing the web - if it were, they'd give you a choice about which browser you'd like to use.3) App availability - You don't have access to every Android app or the Google Play store. You do have access to thousands of apps, as they get approved by Kindle (including one free app a day, which I'll admit is pretty cool). You can circumvent this issue somewhat by installing an unapproved app that gives you access to a different free app market, but a lot of them don't work well (those using Google services, for example) and none of them are specific to Kindle Fire.  For the most part, this limitation has been no big deal - I've almost always been able to find the app I'm looking for or something equivalent, but there have been enough exceptions to be annoying.  Also for iOS there are iPad and iPhone variants of apps. The iPad versions tend to be more fully functional and often outshine the full website for whatever service you're using. In the event that no iPad native app exists, you can install the iPhone app.  But when used that way, the apps \"feel\" like iPhone apps.  Most of the Kindle Fire apps I've used \"feel\" like phone apps. E.g., they are less functional and designed for a phone sized screen.4) Amazon's \"skin\" or interface is overlayed on top of Android and it is pretty restrictive in both functionality and interface. Frustratingly so, even for someone who is used to iOS which \"advanced\" users tend to complain about because functionality is limited. I'm also an advanced user, but I'm willing to put up with a more restrictive OS if, and only if, the OS is designed well enough that I don't miss the \"advanced\" features. For example, on iOS, I use my iPhone and iPad daily and I have NEVER missed having access to the file/directory structure (and if I did, I could get it by simply plugging the iPad into my computer). On Kindle I miss it pretty regularly and I simply HATE the carousel display. In fact, if I could turn off the carousel display I might be a lot happier.  I have never been tempted to \"jailbreak\" my apple devices and wouldn't be even if they weren't the property of my employer.  That's not true with Kindle.5) Google services don't work with Kindle Fire. Google Finance, Drive, Docs, Reader, etc. will not work on Kindle - at least not via any Apps that I've found.  I haven't tried to browse to them directly via the browser. Gmail will work, via Kindle's native mail app.6) No rear facing camera or flash. Not a huge deal, but annoying nonetheless, especially with a device with such a great display - I would like to take pictures without either being in them or guessing what I'm aiming at.  With Kindle Fire, you either guess and check or put yourself in the picture.  Also, I don't want every pic I take added to the cloud and/or previewed in the Carousel.7) I had to download special apps to do things it should do out of the box - certain video formats, for example, require an app to be installed.  Mild annoyance and one you face with most devices, but still an annoyance.8) There is no button (except power and volume) that is independent of the OS. So if something freezes, you can't just exit out short of killing the power or rebooting and it does freeze occasionally.  I really, really miss the button at the bottom of most other devices.  This is most noticeable when you're trying to watch video and it's stuttering.  You can't even get to the pop-up menu to get to the \"back\" arrow or home button.9) I despise the autocorrect. It's hard to describe exactly how annoying this feature is. The corrections are often wrong and I can't turn it off. I did figure out that I can add things manually, but who wants to have to do that?!  A lot of people claim that you can't replace a computer with a tablet, but after having done so for my work for almost a year, I disagree.  With the Kindle Fire, however, I can understand the claim.  I hate typing on this thing because fighting the autocorrect is a constant annoyance.  I didn't think this would be a big issue because I wasn't planning on doing any sort of document editing with it - but it's turned out to be quite a pain even with emails.10) Reading at night, even with brightness turned all the way down can be retina searing. Oddly, Sepia mode seems to be less taxing on the eyes in a dark room than Night mode.  There are apps you can use to turn it down even further, but I shouldn't have to install a special app to read comfortably on a device that is at least on the surface designed to be an e-reader.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this Kindle!", "Author": "StEfANiE \"Yes: I am a dreamer *", "ReviewID": "REF1OMILWLV63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": null, "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 7\"", "Author": "Ralph Furlong", "ReviewID": "R1TBPW970W2RV1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had a Kindle reader since the second iteration or the original.  I still have it and I still find it the easiest to read a book on when you are in bright light.  It is also the easiest on my eyes.  I spend several hours a day on a computer screen, so it is nice to get a break from the glare of a screen.Still, I wanted to see how the Fire HD performed and if it would give me enough computer functionality so that I no longer needed to take a laptop with me when I traveled.  I have an IPAD, and it will pretty much do most of the functions I want, but it is still a bit bulky to carry.  So, I opted to try out the Kindle Fire HD 7\" unit.Here is what I like:1.  The unit is smaller and much easier to hold while reading in bed.  This is something that I do a lot at night and the IPAD was just too big and awkward to accomplish this task.2.  The display on the unit is incredible!  It still does not compare to the original Kindle for reading a book on though.3.  The sound is very good compared to the IPAD.4.  There are several apps that help to make this a more productive device.5.  The unit does support Bluetooth which makes adding a keyboard easy (trying to type long documents on the screen keyboard is a real pain!!6.  The ability to add SAMBA support so that I can access storage on a network.7.  Dual band Wi-Fi, both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz are supported.Here is what I do not like:1.  Lack of animation for page turn when reading a book.  Come on, the Kindle app for Apple has this feature, why not the Kindle Fire HD??2.  Lack of animation for most apps.  Example, the Weather Channel App for Kindle does not have any animation (clouds moving, trees blowing, rain falling, birds flying, etc.) that is available on laptops or on IPADS.3. The inability to load Android Apps from Google.  There are so many more apps available that just are not on Amazon.4. Volume switches are difficult to use as is the power switch.I paid the extra fee to have the unit free of ads and I am very pleased with that even though it seems strange to have to pay to keep ads off.I would recommend this unit if you are looking for a small entertainment device that supports some tablet like features.  So far, this appears to be the best bet if you do not want to carry a laptop but still need to get some work accomplished.

It's a good tablet. The hardware's decent. Fit and finish are nice. Performance is solid. I like the size. It's a little bit heavy. Price was right. I don't really have anything bad to say about it as a tablet. Problem is, it's just not the right tablet for me.Being deaf, there are a couple of extra bullet points on my desired feature list for a tablet:1. The native media player should ideally support captions or subtitles. As of the time of this review, only the Netflix app has this functionality. YouTube videos don't display captions or subtitles, but I think that's true for most mobile devices at the moment. Amazon's own video content doesn't have captions or subtitles yet. I don't know about Hulu, since I don't have an Hulu account. So, if I want to watch captioned/subtitled videos on the Kindle Fire HD, Netflix is the only game in town at the moment.2. Since the Kindle Fire HD has a 720p front camera that works with Skype, I had hoped I would be able to make use of it with video relay services over wi-fi. As of this moment, none of the VRS apps (Purple VRS, Convo Mobile, etc) are available on the Amazon app store, and sideloading them didn't work either. These apps work just fine on the Nexus 7, Galaxy Tab, and other Android tablets, so the problem is likely specific to the Kindle Fire HD's custom Android build.None of the points above make the Kindle Fire HD a bad tablet. Right now, it's still new and Amazon is still working its way through captioning its video content, so odds are the picture will be different 12 months from now. I'm just mentioning them in case other deaf people are interested in the Fire HD.Oh, before I forget: HDMI out works great, but doesn't actually pass subtitles/captions through to the TV. I mention this only because it's a bummer for deaf people and I'd like to save other deaf people the trouble of spending money on a HDMI cable and then looking like an idiot after hooking it up to the big widescreen living room TV and sitting down with a bowl of popcorn. ;)One other wrinkle that slightly complicated my relationship with the Kindle Fire HD is the fact that I'm a heavy user of Google products. Gmail, Docs, Drive, Chrome, you name it, I use it. It was slightly disconcerting not being able to use any Google apps on the Kindle Fire HD. Again, that doesn't make the Fire HD a bad tablet, it just means that if you're heavily into Google stuff, this probably isn't the best tablet for you.What the Kindle Fire HD does supremely well is deliver Amazon content. It's a really good tablet that's enjoyable to use, and if you're happy with primarily consuming Amazon content, you won't go far wrong with one of these.I gave the Kindle Fire HD to my hearing wife earlier today. She'd been monopolizing it over the past several days because she really loves casual games, and the Amazon app store has quite a number of those. She'll also get more mileage out of the music, audiobooks, and Amazon video downloads than I will, so the tablet's definitely staying in the family.I'm probably going to get a Nexus 7, an iPad Mini, or a 5th generation iPod Touch to replace it. That's not a dig on the Kindle Fire HD, just a statement based on the fact that these other options are a little bit more deaf-friendly at the time of this review.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great, I actually love the special offers", "Author": "iloveamazon", "ReviewID": "R1I9NCAL9HPCMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people complain about the special offers, but I like them.

It is a great device for what it does. It should be seen primarily as a consumption device, as opposed to a creation device.As a Kindle reader, it does a great job, night and day. Since it is back-lit, as opposed to edge-lit, it produces some eye strain after reading for couple of hours or more. The is typical of any backlit device, such as your computer screen or TV screen.I have seen some knocks on brightness. I my experience, the brightness was infinitely adjustable manually, but in auto-dim mode, it was too bright in a darkened room. So stick with manual brightness controls, if it's too bright.The (web)  browsing experience is great! Their browser, Silk, is light and fast, and renders beautifully. It's cloud-based server-side  acceleration is really noticeable. I wish other browsers worked that way.My two knocks on the device is that:  it is too heavy; and its battery life is not that great. There is no comparison to an iOS-based device, in my humble opinion.It's too heavy to read one-handed. And, if you try, your fingers are too close to the touchscreen, and you are constantly advancing the page, or highlighting, without intending to do so. I found myself constantly paging back or forward to return to my place, or tapping the screen to clear highlights. I read a lot while lying down, and found it gets old rapidly, when you have to rest the device on your chest. It feels relatively heavier than my iPad, given its size.I realize it is heavy because of the battery. My iPad is too. Yet I would have to recharge my Fire every other day, where the iPad will go days, with comparable use. I found the getting in the habit of plugging it in at night was a helpful idea...The keyboard (on-screen) is not as good as the iOS devices. I have both an iPhone and iPad to compare it with. The keyboard on the Fire doesn't seem to predict what key you are trying to hit, nor predict the word you are typing, as effectively as the Apple products. Therefore, it is not as strong an input device.But to sum up, it is a GREAT tablet for the money. It is best seen as a media consumption, as opposed to a content creation device. It's too heavy for one-handed use. And don't forget your AC charger...it is worth the money, and you will use it often.

If you are looking for a full blown tablet or a mini computer, you will be disappointed with this device. It does utilize email and internet access, but it is primarily a media device that was intended to use Amazon content. The HD video is fantastic and the sound quality is superior to most tablets, but is is primarily for the use of Amazon media. Although Amazon Android applications are usually compatible with other Android devices, Google android applications are not compatible with the Kindle Fire. In addition, not all of the Kindle Fire applications are compatible with the Kindle Fire HD. If you order applications from your computer, for the Kindle Fire HD, the web site will let you order and say that they can be downloaded to the Kindle Fire HD, but they won't download whether they be free or paid for applications. To be sure that applications will be downloaded to the Kindle Fire HD, you must order them from the device, and not from the Amazon store on your computer. I have talked with Amazon Tech support on this issue and it is an on-going problem that can be avoided by ordering appplications from the device rather than your computer. HD content will be increased as developers offer new and upgraded applications.All in all, this is a wonderful device if you get it with the purpose that it was intended. It is primarily for the use of Amazon media, and is very useful if you have a Prime acccount that offers a lot of free media. This is not a full-blown tablet, and it is not meant to be.Update 11/05/12I have been using the Kindle Hd for a couple more weeks and have reduced the stars to 4. At this point in time, much of the content such as games is greatly reduced because of the incompatibility with HD. When ordering from the device, the choices are greatly reduced. Hopefully, this will be improved in the future, but it doesn't do much for customers at this point. This is my first Kindle, so I didn't really have any expectations. For those that have prior experience with Kindles, this device will be a great improvement in so many ways. For those that are looking for a \"cheap\" tablet, they will be greatly disappointed. Although the Kindle HD has huge improvements over previous Kindles, it is definitely not meant to have the functionality of a tablet. Even though this is an adroid device, Google apps are not supported. You can buy Amazon android apps that will work on any android device, but apps for the Kindle devices cannot be bought anywhere but on Amazon. Apps from any other source are not supported. Since many of the Amazon apps are not supported on the Kindle HD, this can be fairly limiting. Still, for the price, this device is well worth the price, and I would not consider returning it. I am hopeful that Amazon will update more apps to be compatible with this divice. I will update my review as things change, but I currently have an Apple IPad 7\" on order. I do enjoy the greater functionality of the Ipad. I also have a 10\" IPad and a 10\" ASUS android tablet that I enjoy.

Its main competition is the comparable Google Nexus 7 (the recently announced Apple Mini should be placed in a different category due to its higher price and larger screen).  Although the Google is marginally thinner and noticeably more lightweight, the Fire HD seems streamlined in both areas compared to the original edition. The sound has greater \"presence\" and enhanced stereo imaging (despite speaker ports that are virtually invisible), though audiophiles (and bass players) should not plan on selling their full-fidelity speakers or headphones just yet.Besides improved onboard sound, the Fire HD has external volume controls (one of my main irritants concerning the previous edition).  And it offers Bluetooth connectivity (an important consideration given the influx of Bluetooth speakers as well as adapters permitting wireless operation of conventional audio equipment). Above all, the image quality is \"state of the art\" (it looks as good to me as my wife's Macbook retina display), so this is an ideal tablet for streaming movies from Amazon.  And if you're member, be sure to download the Netflix app for an even greater selection.  Finally, as the household insomniac, I have a device that's perfect for reading books in the dark.Fire owners on a budget will minimally require a case-cover.

As yet I haven't found the same design for the Kindle Fire HD, so patience may be the best strategy for now (the alternatives can be pricey and less practical). As for covers/films for the touch-sensitive screen, they're more trouble than they're worth, requiring constant adjustment and of no real use (imagine a pianist insisting on covering the keys of a Steinway with plastic laminate!).Needless to say, the Fire HD is the tablet of choice for regular Amazon visitors and members with Prime.  And given the amount of time consumers (myself included) devote to technology, an owner might even welcome a smaller selection of \"apps\" to choose from  (frankly, I feel overwhelmed by the thousands of Apple apps and Google games).  I'm content to have the 8-10 games my grand-kids seem to like best and, for myself, \"TuneIn,\" a spectacular radio app that instantly streams my local 24/7 HD jazz station--without subscriptions, fees, a password or any sort of identification. Granted, the more expensive Nexus 7 from Google offers a GPS, but I'm happy with my Garmin (and neither will make navigation through the maze of games and apps any easier). As it is, Amazon offers hundred of apps (including daily free ones)--already too many, at least for those of us who use only one at a time.If you're new to tablets, try not to become prematurely frustrated.  Where there used to be buttons and knobs, you'll now discover imperceptible sliders and switches, none raised from the surface of the device.  A tablet is somewhat like a musical instrument, except easier to learn.  If, after a couple of months, you're still having difficulty, turn to the often surprising intuition of a youngster.  If that doesn't do it, consider investing in an Apple product as a last-ditch effort (but be prepared to encounter, at one extreme, plenty of \"Apple snobs\" and, at the other, even more \"Apple haters,\" both of whom can be insufferable for anyone who tries to review an Apple computer or iPod).  For that matter, as Apple products become increasingly complex, attracting more periodical literature along with \"tomes\" devoted to every Apple update, the old wisdom about the company's famous user-friendliness (who needs an instruction manual?) is becoming increasingly untrue (where are you, David Pogue?).But there's still hope.  When I had questions about the Fire HD, I posted them on Amazon's discussion board and received immediate, genuinely helpful answers from other Fire owners:http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=cm_cd_t_rvt?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1GLDPZMNR1X53Sometimes it's not a bad idea to \"follow the crowd,\" especially when it comes to the intricacies of constantly changing consumer technology.

Bluetooth pairing can often be a tricky, frustrating and time-wasting exercise--so I've learned to have an audio cable at hand after five futile minutes of seeking wireless connectivity.  My favorite small speaker is the recently discontinued Motorola EQ7 (with 4 JBL speakers). The iPod Touch 4th gen and the newly released iPod Touch 5th gen (awesome technology) instantly \"Discovered\" and soon \"Paired\" with the EQ7.

The glare cut down and the sharper text is all easier on the eyes than most tablets. I listen to my books on my daily commute and then read when I have time to sit and read. The text to speech on the Fire HD seems nice and easy to use. I am watching a tv show right now from Netflix and it is working wonderfully. I am loving this tablet so far and am already a regular Amazon customer. The ads don't bother me at all. They are the screensaver. Who sits and stares at that stuff? Great product,  Amazon.

The HD camera is AWESOME! Works great with Skype as well as several apps i have that utilize cameras to take pictures. Facebook intergration is smooth and easy to work with. The ads on the startup screen are really not an issue at all... lets be honest, who stares at the start screen anyway? Your wake it up swipe and away you go. If the ad has something you like, then awesome. If not, no biggie. It would be nice if somewhere on the ad screen was the time as i sometimes just push it to see what time it is, but thats splitting hairs.  The only issue i really have with it is when it portrait mode on the home screen. I am not a huge fan of the \"customers also bought\" recommendation part on the bottom.

I study, I prowl, I search for the best possible deal, being a frugal New Englander by origin.Not so Kindle Fire HD.I have owned my Kindle Fire for barely 2 months.  While I was in San Francisco last week, the power adapter died. I have liked the Kindle Fire, definitely the best Kindle yet, but I missed my iPad, and I was definitely thinking of a new one or of a mini.So I got back to Miami on Friday, and I order the replacement, and they ship me a new Powerfast rapid charger instead, as they were out of the original power adapters. I am chatting with the technician, and he mentions that the new HD was shipping today.Huh, I think, I've been seeing the ads.That's when I made my mistake. I start browsing the 7 * yes SEVEN * reviews on the new one on Amazon, and that got me reading the CNET reviews. I don't know what possessed me. Maybe it was the Dolby Digital. Maybe it was the RIDICULOUS download speeds with the new dual band dual antenna. Maybe it was the wimpy specs on the mini. Whatever it was, I found myself ordering a new HD, and I got a Powerfast for only $10.00 with the order, and a Roo case (that's what is on my Fire now and I love it) for $1.38 more. So I'm happy.So it arrives tonight after work.I am so blown away!  This thing is AWESOME!  This is so good! I love the sound.  It absolutely startled me! I mean I JUMPED when I first heard the quality and volume of the sound. Imagine, GOOD QUALITY Pandora without ear buds!And it is so thin and light!  Holy cow, a few ounces makes such a difference! the Fire feels so thick and clunky by comparison.  This thing is a PLEASURE to hold and it is light as a feather. And EASILY slips into a trouser pocket!AND THAT SCREEN! I cannot believe how much better that polarized HD screen is!  IT IS RAZOR SHARP. DEEP COLOR SATURATION. Crsip, crisp, crisp. Love it.And the software that they have put on the new Fire HD is yards and miles above the Fire.I feel as though I have just gotten a MAJOR upgrade.I am very happy! The e-mail app is great, all the apps are better, and they are all faster, all more rich, all with better features, just better, better, better.I am so happy!I have downloaded a few apps, and even the big ones come in after only a few seconds. This sucker is fast!  NO LAG IN NETFLIX, no lag in Pandora, no lag in radio stations.

I have detailed some of my favorite features and some things I do not like.:Some of theThings I Really Like:1. Free access to digital subscriptions of print magazines I subscribe to, such as The New Yorker, Time Magazine, Sunset Magazine, Cooking Light, Wired, etc.2. Easy access to HBO Go, Amazon Prime, and Netflix.3. The ability to switch between reading and listening to a book using Whisper Sync for voice.4. Bluetooth connectivity so I can connect to a keyboard or external speakers.5. The new HD screen, Dolby audio, larger storage (16 or 32MB),  and improved battery life.6. Ability to use Skype.Some of the Things I Don't Like So Much:1. Having to pay $15 to get rid of the ads although I do like being able to turn them back on (then off again) to make sure that I am not missing a great deal!2. The appearance of suggested purchases when holding the Fire in portrait mode. Even though you can get rid of them by turning the Fire to landscape mode, I would like the ability to be able to not see them in portrait mode. It is easy to click on one by accident.3. A small thing--the lack of a charging light on the Kindle itself. I turn off my Kindle to charge it and would like to easily be able to identify that the Kindle is fully charged.4. Slightly recessed power and volume buttons. I find it difficult to find them by touch.5. The lack of a PDF version of the KF HD User Guide in the Docs section. So far I have been using the online help, but I like to read through the entire user guide to get an idea of features.

Wonder how many are written by jealous Ipad and Nexus owners.This new Kindle just blows away the competition in my opinion. Yes it has a learning curve,but I have my Email, my music,my books and Internet apps that I use and I'll tell you what, it is just plain awesome. Silk is not slow contrary to what some have written. Just invest in a decent ISP and it is as fast as my I7 2600K speed on the I'Net.Music is another thing completely. Unless you are deaf, their is plenty of volume. Go try the same music on any laptop or netbook, and then tell me it's not better. I own a $2000.00 laptop and it cannot transmit the same sounds as this HD Fire does.The folks on here that have given a 4 or 5 star rating are the true owners. Yes there will be problems anytime a new device is developed and released, but give it and the engineers a break. I don't believe Amazon ever had the intention of competing with Apple's IPad . It is a tablet in it's own right and completely removed from this KIndle. It also costs 2-3 times more, so how can you compare it?It is stated in the lead up to this release that this device does not support Flash, but I guess some people can't read. It is a computer folks but not in the sense that it doesn't possess the ram or the processor for laptop or desktop work.It just wasn't designed for that. Buy a laptop if you need all those goodies. I have all 3. A Kindle, a desktop and a laptop. I don't expect the $2000.00 laptop to do the things my overclocked desktop does either, so why expect it out of thistablet.Ok reading. It is great. Yes I had a Kindle Fire (original) and it was terrible. SO much glare and I couldn't adjust the brightness enough to use it in dim light. I am talking about reading in bed. This Fire HD is again fantastic for anyone wanting a really great reader. No it doesn't pretend to be an e-ink reader. Lot of difference between e-ink and LCD screens.Internet. All I can say it is fast and connects immediately from 50 feet away from the router. I set up my Mediacom Email in about 5 minutes using the other provision found in settings.So, bottom line, it is a great tool for taking on trips,planes or whatever. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a great inexpensive tool.Those of you that have experienced problems with the hardware, remember it was mass produced and their are bound to be a few bad units. Return it to Amazon and get one that works. You won't be disappointed.UPDATE November 13,2012I am now on my third Kindle and 2nd Fire HD. My opinion has not changed from the above review. My daughter now owns my 1st Fire HD, so I bought another one. These devices are just the most for your money. People that don't like advertisements need to turn the Kindle to Landscape and viola, no more ads visible. The only ad I ever see is when I open the case, and I don't even see it because I swipe the bar and I am on my way to whatever I want to do.My wife has a Kindle Touch and she loves it.

I have updated to the HD fire today only because a very ill friend in and out of the hospital needed something to occupy them.  I decided I would gift the old, and purchase the new.Well I had approximately 3 hours just to play, or \"test\" things to do.  I do not claim to be the most computer literate person, but other than the ads, which are annoying at times and tabs,  I really think there has been quite the improvement to the fire.1.  external volume control  ( alot of people complained, amazon listened)  is it functionally great... no, but it is there and you can quickly control the volume, rather than just being able to increase or decrease the volume after touching tools, volume, then adjusting the volume.2.  Yes it has a front facing camera, unsure how to just take a picture like you do with an I phone etc, but found under facebook, touching photo, and playing with camera icons, the camera does come on, you can take pic, video, etc, and it will go to the appropriate icon on the kindle fire. as of yet, have not found another way to activate the camera.(but sure there probably is)3. All purchased, or free aps of the day... came preloaded or cloud available...4. the tablet itself is thinner, and lighter..... ( a nice feature, but never found the original one to be too heavy, I have a case that  goes landscape.upright, and reading postions, so this was never a problem on original, due to the case, but the Hd is definately lighter.. (little irritated that the \"color\"  choice for the case wont be here until 10/3.... even though like previous posts, the listing stated released on 9/14. so when ordering I thought I would get it just like I did the Fire hd, and the charging adapter(day on release)5.navigating around the device is faster responding.6.color, definition is definately improved7. \"amazon\" is definately the Link to shoppping/browsing shopping... but quite frankly most of my final purchases online are thru amazon... so this does not bother me.... that they are the warlord for the device. I get my stuff in the time promised 99% of the time,I pay no taxes, shipped free 99% of time and received ontime.!! and usually the price of the item is no more than \"w***art , and sometimes cheaper... therefore less costly because no taxes, and my gas to go get it)8. cant wait to test the hdmi. port  to my T.V. option( I think this is a nice feature) 9. DO NOT LIKE.... no \"light:\" to know its charging, but with a few times of playing realize it is charging when you plug the adapter in, and an \"ad\" gets put on the screen..... dont like it... but I dont care, cuz at that point I want it to charge, and usually putting it down then.10.  THE FIRE H.D.  supports the text to speech for those that need or want to be read to by the computer.11.  The fire arrived 95% (guess) charged...  in my 3 hours plus of \"playing the battery life diminished by less than a third, and I tried videos, facebook, camera play, internet search, set up facebook, skype, e-mail judged book \"reading and layout\" and tested text to speech.. and played some games......  I BELIEVE THE BATTERY LIFE IS IMPROVED!!!12. EVERYONE keeps comparing this to an Ipad..........  Its not, wont be!! and it didnt cost  like an I pad!!  BUT......... I found wifi to connect, and stay connected to be flawless for me(and I live in the country)  Found all features to run quite smoothly, and in $$$ comparison.... believe the HD  gives you your moneys worth.13.  I guess I am not disturbed by the \"quirks\" or misgivings some others are griping about.. Like I said, I am not a \"techie\"  but I can find my away around the internet, and the machines, and in all accounts so far am not displeased with the functional aspects of this device..14,  Its a 199.00 tablet, that downloaded my music library in less than 5 minutes. easily chose what apps I wanted on the device from the cloud, effortlessly connected to my home wireless network, and exceeded my expectation for what I thought improvements would be.15, I DO NOT work for amazon, apple, or any other techno type company.  I am a 50+ year old that easily manuevered aroung the new Fire... found,and saw many improvements.  I own a Iphone, and cant fault the product either.... but truly for the 199.00 I can fully put all apps, reading,internet,and staying connected to others and browsing without any major type delays/ or mental hardships.BOTTOM LINE.....I believe for the $199.OO YOU WILL KNOW you have a worthy device, but ............. it you want apple..... spend the $$$.......

The answer to that in less than one hour was NO.  I purchased the ASUS infinity and its going back.  We put the Kindle HD and the infinity side by side and played the same video...Hands down the video quality of the Kindle HD was SO much better!!!  Also the tablet either crashes or randomly hangs up that its just too frustrating to deal with.  Its going back and I will impatiently wait for the 8.9 Kindle HD.  The ICS is just not all its cracked up to be, I have never had my Kindle's crash EVER.I very seldom write reviews but I had to jump in because of all the negative (1 to 3 star reviews over not having a charger??)  Those reviews had my wondering what I had gotten myself into having gotten rid of my Kindle Fire which I had for only 2 months.  My 2nd question was if I wanted to hold out for the 8.9 screen, but having gone into the store and them showing me what that size would approx. be I decided that the Kindle Fire HD is the best for taking with me on planes and traveling.For those looking for a comparison to IPAD, did you really think you were going to get an IPAD??  From day 1 even with my original kindle fire I was looking for a decent ereader everything else was a bonus.  I did find myself playing alot of word games at night before I went to sleep and less reading though ;)So yesterday after reading all of the silly negative reviews I was checking those complaints.  Videos looked awesome, as well as the sound was awesome.  No you tube??  On my unit there was a link under my web apps that said youtube...click it tried a few videos everything worked, so I am not sure where the no you tube complaints are coming from.  Facebook is also there logged in and looked just like the original kindle fire facebook.The only problem I have is when I try to turn the unit to have the page display correctly I often find myself having to turn it several times before it is to the right side I am looking at which I didn't have that problem with my original kindle fire.With all of the complaints about the ads I started getting nervous I did not want my viewing to be obstructed.  yes I saw that ad on the lock screen and I thought this is what everyone is complaining about??  With the original Fire the complaint was you couldn't customize the lock screen.  I honestly have not noticed any annoying ad problems.  When I was watching on Hulu last night I was annoyed about the constant ads every 4 to 5 minutes now that would be annoying on the FIre but I just don't see the justification.  Think about it, if you are on Facebook there is a side bar constantly of ads.  I really don't know of many sites anymore that don't have ad support of some kind.I know I am going to have just as much, if not more fun with my new Kindle Fire HD and I am sure there is going to be much improvements to the apps as it moves along just like any new product that comes out", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A review for Low Vision individuals.", "Author": "okiedan \"Pro Bono Publico\"", "ReviewID": "R25ZOTAWW2MA0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new Kindle Fire HD 7 inch screen.  A review of the functions related ONLY to using the device as a reader/audio device. (see customer images)If you do not have low vision this review will not be of interest to you.This review is specifically for individuals with low vision.  Definition of low vision is those of us who have difficulty viewing regular sized text or who have eye conditions that cause you to have difficulty viewing text of any size.  I specify this just to insure that those who read this review understand that I am focusing in on this issue.Now as to my new Kindle Fire HD 7 inch screen.Out of the box:It took me about two minutes to get online via WiFi and download three books and two audio books.  All from Amazon and Amazon's sister site Audible.com.The case, charger, usb cable are all great.  The case fits perfect and has two small screens to allow the dolby digital audio out......The user interface is easy to navigate.I began by downloading two books from my online collection.  I wanted to SEE what the text looked like and how well the text to speech actually worked.  The books downloaded just fine via WiFi.  The text to speech worked just fine and I was able to increase the text size to the largest font.  The largest font however is a 10 on Amazons scale which is a little small for me.  I have emailed Amazon and inquired about the 8.9 HD font size.  It is my hope that it will have a larger font capability.  EDIT UPDATE:  Amazon has just emailed me and stated that they do not know or can not specify how large the font will be on the new 8.9.  So I will just take a chance and hope the 8.9 has larger fonts.  thanks amazon for the fast response even IF the response told me nothing new.  The page turns were just fine and since you can adjust the speed of the text to speech I could further refine the Fire so that it turned the page just at the right moment.  As far as the visual aspect I notice far less glare than the previous Fire.  The speakers sound fantastic.  Even the robotic voice sounds better in stereo!  :)  Well done Amazon!  So with the text to speech enabled I was able to sit back in my easy chair and truly enjoy a good book....almost adjusted to my eye needs.Text to speech is also just a tap on the screen and off you go.  IF you have purchased the Audio book it converts over to the pro reading.The advantage of the Fire over say the iPad running apples free voice over is that it is far easier to activate text to speech on the Fire.  I had tried the Kindle app on the iPad 3 and it does not offer the same ability to activate text to speech.  On the iPad you still have to turn the pages but on the Fire the page turns are automatic.The integration with the Audible.com web site is flawless.  I `purchased' one of the free books and linked audio book and all went as it should.  The audio sounds wonderful and goes right along with the book.  Once again the text was enlarged to the largest font.All in all I am pleased with my new Fire and anxiously await the larger screen.  I look forward to hopefully streaming Netflix, HBO Go, and all amazon prime videos.

It is a lot of fun.There are a few nits to pick.  No screen saver - when in the locked it goes to an add. I didn't buy the kindle with ads and it bugs me a bit that there are ads.  Also, when you touch any book in your library - you automatically get 'suggestions' for what you should buy.  I want to be able to turn those off.  These aren't huge nits - and they can fixed in a software update - but a little annoying.With all of this said, I can't call this a 'tablet' per se'.  It should be seen as an Amazon delivery device.  If you love your Amazon content - and don't mind being restricted buy the apps you can download (they have to approved Amazon Apps - not all Android apps can be used - unless you side load them) - it is a great device.  If you want a tablet in the purest sense - get something else.

I have never owned any type of tablet so I cannot do any big comparison of features, etc. I did look at a nook tablet and the Fire HD is much nicer.Suffice it to say, it does what is promised and does it well. I was able to sync my google calendar by syncing my gmail account. It carrys my theological library so I don't have to lug a number of books with me when I go to meetings and I can watch stream movies when I want to by wi-fi. The picture and sound are great.

I plan on upgrading to the pro app so I can edit my documents too.I have not been bothered at all by the special offers.

I waited a few days to make sure I was going to like it before packing up my old Fire to send to Amazon (for hopefully $83 in credit)!Updated with a few additional notes after trying out some additional features...The good:- Incredible improvement in the screen, brightness, clarity and depth of field (I think the laminated touch screen eliminates the old looking into a box feeling of the screen on the original Kindle)- Overall feel of the HD is very solid, and the design and styling is much improved over the original. (I need to find a good case though as the back is very prone to picking up fingerprints!)- The speakers sound good, volume is much louder than the original although the sound quality is what you would expect of tiny speakers.- The volume button is a welcome addition although I find it very hard to find and operate by touch. I still appreciate that it is there.- The software also runs much more smoothly in this iteration than in the original Fire. I expect that the improvement to Android 4.0 helps here.- The UI design is much nicer than on the original Fire, the black background and menu options look great.- New notification options are nice, quick settings for Brightness, wifi etc... and the ability to swipe away notifications (as found in Android 4.0)- Magazine reading - page turn animations and pop up of articles with a double tap - very very nice!- Functionality of the HDMI out is very smooth and includes full mirroring (as opposed to only video out). Full mirroring means you can see exactly the same thing on your TV that you see on the table screen. Get a Micro HDMI to HDMI cable for a few bucks and you can play games, watch movies or even read magazines and books on your tv... (not that you would but you could)The Bad:- While the height in Portrait mode has not changed, the width has increased significantly. It would have been nice to be able to use cases from the original Fire with the new HD. However the increased width does make it easy to hold the HD comfortably while reading.- The device feels thinner and lighter but not as svelte as the Nexus 7 from Google. However it is comfortable to hold for extended periods of time.- Lack of customization - As an Android user I am used to having the ability to customize wallpaper, add widgets etc... none of this is possible on the HD.- Lack of apps in Amazon app store - Most of the apps I use regularly on my Android phone are available, but the Amazon app store is limited. Some popular games and apps are not available. I have gotten around this issue by side loading some of the apps from my phone (In device settings on the HD choose \"ON\" for allow installation of 3rd party apps, backup the .apk file from another device, then use dropbox to upload from the old device and to install on the HD) I have found this works for some but not all android apps. For example I could get Instagram to install on the HD but it would not run.- No Flash support - others have mentioned this, and it is a result of lack of support in newer versions of the Android OS. I-pdad and other I-devices also do not support Flash. There are apparently work around's that involve installing other browsers (Dolphin HD)but I have not had a chance to try those yet.Neutral:- Much was made of the adds on the HD, and I can say they are very prevalent. Adds are one the lock screen and recommendations on the home screens. However so far I have received $5 in music credit and $5 in video credit, so I am glad to suffer through the advertising. I will not be paying $15 to remove the advertising.- No charger included with the device, Amazon is acting like Apple here and asking you to purchase one seperately. However, I have found that any number of USB chargers I have laying around work fine to charge the HD.In the end the HD is a worthy replacement for the original. It features great hardware and access to Amazon's great content in an easy to use package. I wish it had more customization options but for consumption of media there is no equal to the HD.

I like the wider width compared to the first Fire.  It is very light weight and the more softer contours makes it easier to hold.  The buttons took a little searching to find they are also black and not very well defined on the device.  Turning it on was simple after I found the switch and setting it up and registering it was very easy.Wifi - I am very happy with the improvements made to the wifi on the HD compared to the original Fire.  My bedroom is on the third floor and on the original Fire whenever I was in my room I would only have one or two bars on the wifi indicator.  The HD has had solid all bars showing no matter where I stand in my room.  Definitely an improvement.HDMI - I really bought this device so I could hook it up to my tv and watch the Prime VOD shows and movies.  This worked excellently last night.  It was easy to hook up and operate.  There was no constant buffering or freezes - I am very happy with the performance.  Watching on the device itself the picture was very clear with good color and the sound with the dual speakers was very clear.As a reader?  I bought the original Fire when it first came out and was very disappointed in it.  The brightness level could not be taken down to almost dark which meant that even at the lowest setting it was still too bright to read in a dark room.  The other disappointment was at how \"closed\" it was.  I wanted a reader I could load all of my books from the many different sources out there.  The Fire would not let me do that so I ended up giving my Fire to my sister and purchasing an IPAD which allowed me to have ibooks, Amazon books, Nook books and with a wonderful app - Bluefire Reader-all of my epub books.  On the IPAD I was able to dim the light real low so that I could read without eye strain in dark rooms.  The IPAD is now my main device which I am very, very happy with.  The Fire HD which I bought more for streaming the video content still has the problem with being closed to other reader apps and I still can't get the brightness low enough to read comfortably and without squinting in a dark room - those two things are what have made me rate this a 4 instead of a 5.Browser - I never liked browsing on the original Fire and I didn't like doing it on the HD last night.  I got kicked out of some of the things I entered and - it was so slow in opening things and moving around - even on Amazon's website - that I gave up.  It is not the device that I will use when I want to research things - again I think the IPAD wins in that arena.Game Apps - I haven't explored these yet but I do know that I liked the ones that were on the original Fire. I'm not expecting anything different on this device.I tried the Xray capability on the book I was currently reading and found that it will not work on all books.  I got a message saying it was not available for the book I was reading. So this appears to be a hit or miss capability.I'm still playing with the device but this is my first impression after one day.  As a streaming device - excellent so far.  As a reader - it is a great experience when you are not in a dark room. The font is very crisp and clear - the page turning is very quick and seamless.  With the black of the bezel when the settings time off you truly are able to lose yourself in the words and you don't even see the actual device.  I can see using it as a reader in the daytime, but at night I will switch to the IPAD with the lowest light setting on.  If Amazon would fix the light settings and would just have confidence in themselves and allow the other reader apps to be installed - I would be very happy to rate this a 5+.  I have the IPAD and the other reader apps installed and honestly - I still purchase more Amazon books than Nook and ibooks.  Amazon - don't worry about the competitors, please allow them in. The Fire would be an awesome device if you opened it up.All in all I do not regret the purchase.

Also, while there is no wall charger with this Kindle, we received a mini-USB cord which serves us better. I also would recommend purchasing the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" Standing Leather Case if you can spare the extra expense.

I have to say KF HD is vastly improved over last year's model. Having said that, it isn't a Nexus 7, nor is it purported to be. But if you read the customer reviews, you would think it is an atrocity that Amazon has slightly subsidized the cost of the Kindle with advertisements. The thing is, these ads are no different then when you go on Amazon's website, and if you REALLY can't stand seeing an ad when you turn on the device, you can pay 15 bucks to turn them off, on your lock screen. Amazon wants to sell you content, not hardware. People don't seem to get that. Then you have the idiots giving it one star because there is no charger included. But it does come with a high quality USB to micro USB cable, which is worlds better than the POS charger they included last year. I bundled a \"high speed\" Amazon charger with my purchase, and they knocked 10 bucks off the price. So for 10 dollars more, I get a very well made charger, that I can use for more than just charging the Kindle.My mini review:Build Quality: I think last year's model seems sturdier, with the Gorilla glass and compact feel to it. It also fit nicely in my hand. But the HD is no slouch. It has a nice, rounded design, much like the iPhone 3GS, which makes it more pleasing, aesthetically. The glass is polarized, and not as reflective anymore. This makes the screen easier to see. 4/5Screen: Those extra pixels really make a difference! There are rich blacks now, and the touch interface is much improved. However, it IS an Android device, and so you know it will be laggy at times. Reading books is a real pleasure, now. Very little eye strain. 5/5Ports and buttons: A big slam on the KF last year was the location of the power button, and the exclusion of an external volume control. The button of the KF is on the \"bottom\" of the device, it was not recessed and soft touch, and it was pretty easy to accidentally turn it off. Why they didn't have a switch, like on the Kindle 3, is a total mystery to me! Anyway, this has been changed with the HD. The power button is now almost impossible to turn off accidentally, because it is so well recessed into the unit, and is also now at the \"top\" (in portrait) of the device. The only problem now, is that sometimes it is hard to find! And it also is right next to the volume rocker. Still, that is a huge improvement. The ports have also changed. For one thing, the micro USB is much better made, meaning there will be much fewer instances of the device not being able to charge unless you wiggle the connector, especially when you take into account that the USB cable included is very high quality. There is also a mini HDMI port as well. Take THAT, Nexus 7! So with a 10 dollar cable you can plug that bad boy into an HD television. Hopefully HBO Go will allow that, someday. 5/5Audio: You aren't going to get a better sounding tablet, period. The stereo separation is fantastic, for a 7 inch device. I was amazed when watching Netflix last night, when I could hear the sounds, seemingly a foot to the right of the device. Superb. I also have some music in the cloud, and was listening to Live Rust, like it was a portable radio. The volume is noticeably louder, and clearer. I do think they should provide an equalizer, though. Nevertheless, full marks. 5/5Browser: You are better off side loading Dolphin HD or Chrome. Silk is still not that great, and using that browser gives you \"trending\" advertisements. Not a fan. 2/5The (much maligned) interface: I'm not a huge fan or the carousal, and I DO think it cripples the Android experience too much. To make things worse (for some) when you choose an item in your carousal, you get \"similar titles\" displayed on the bottom. These don't really bother me, since I like to see what other work is out there from an author or artist. I believe there is a way around this, by using Go Launcher (side loaded) or something similar. 2/5So, all in all, I am very happy with my purchase. I will probably side load the Google Play store, Youtube, and several other apps. I will also consider rooting, but I like the Amazon eco system, and I fear that will be degraded if I do. I suppose I will install Go Launcher, and see if that works for me. I didn't cover the more technical improvements, since you can just see that in the specs. As an owner of the new iPad 4G LTE, which I love, I can see how the HD will still fit into my life. It is nowhere near as bulky, and has a similar battery life. As a reader, except for scientific papers, I find the iPad to be a less-than-enjoyable experience, but it is a real pleasure with the Kindle Fire HD. Many of the shortcomings of KF 1.0 have been addressed in the HD. I'm not thrilled that I have to spend 40-50 bucks for a new case, but I know it will be worth it.Overall rating: Nifty device. 3.5/5 RECOMMENDED", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, especially for reading", "Author": "Edwin G.

I previously owned a K2, KK and Touch. Here are my first impressions with less than 24 hours of use.The device is very smart looking and a nice size to hold. There is no bezel like on the Touch. The gorilla glass covers the front from edge to edge, and the back has a silky feel, making it almost slippery. Get a good grip on it if you plan to handle it without a cover.Power up is instant. The power switch is flush with the case. I haven't been able to find it by feel and have to turn it over and look for it every time. The display is beautiful. My photos look great on it.Response is very snappy most of the time. Occasionally it's unresponsive, requires several taps or there is a lag. You can adjust the sleep setting (number of minutes of inactivity to put it in sleep mode). Oddly, the choices ranges from 5 to 15 minutes or more. I wanted to set it at 10, but that choice isn't available. It will not wake up from sleep with a touch to the screen. You have to press the power button again.If you've never had a tablet or a touch device, prepare for a steep learning curve. Prepare for a little frustration while you learn how to use it. The menu system is pretty good, but you'll still need to know where to look for things and where to tap to call up hidden menus. It is not absolutely intuitive all the time.Read the Fine Manual. Read the Fabulous Manual. Read the Fantastic Manual. There's a good User Guide in the device, but it's buried under four layers. To access it: (1) swipe down from the top of the screen to get into the Quick Settings menu. (2) tap More. (3) tap Help & Feedback. (4) tap User Guide. It's a lot more detailed than the KFHD pages on the Amazon website. I was unable to Favorite the User Guide to get it on the home page. You have to have wireless turned on in order to access the User Guide.Speaking of wireless, this device goes by the Airplane Mode On/Off designation rather than Wireless On/Off. You have to swipe down from the top of the screen to get into Quick Settings in order to change it.Don't be shy about calling Amazon for help. That's what they're there for. You can access Amazon help through the Help and Feedback tab. There's a Customer Service tab which will allow you to call or email Amazon Kindle help and leave feedback. It couldn't be easier.Transferred a couple of mp4 videos from the computer via the USB cord to the Movies folder on the Fire. The videos did not show up under the Videos tab on the Fire screen. I emailed Amazon and was advised to use the Gallery app. There is no Gallery app on the new Fire HD, only on the 1st generation Fire. The answer is in the on-device User Guide (but not on the web page!): On the new Fire HD, there is a Personal Videos app which will play the mp4s that you transfer to it. Only videos downloaded from Amazon will display under the Videos tab. Once I launched the Personal Videos app, my two videos were there. One was a movie that I converted to an mp4 from a DVD. The other was a slideshow created with specialized software that I saved as an mp4. They both played with no problems and looked GREAT!The Fire is not a replacement for the e-ink reader if reading is your main usage. I sold my Touch, even though I loved it, because first, I thought I might end up not using it once I got the Fire. Second, I like the idea of the front lit Paperwhite, its higher contrast and the time-to-read feature so I wanted to upgrade. The Fire reading experience is very different from the e-ink reader experience. Strictly for reading, I prefer a dedicated e-ink device. Also, after handling the Fire for a short while, I found it a little heavy for comfortable reading for long periods of time. I will definitely be ordering a Paperwhite as my primary book reader. Having two devices is not redundant.Books uploaded via USB obtained from non-Amazon sources will show up as Documents, even if you save them to the Books folder on the device. I find that user unfriendly and would rather have all books show up under the Books tab (just like books from any source show up as books on the e-ink reader), and I left feedback to that effect. Covers of \"documents\" didn't display, even though they are really books and have color covers. I hope that can be fixed in a software update.Despite the occasional frustrations of not knowing where things are and how it all works yet, I'm really enjoying the Fire HD. The only mistake I made was having ordered the one with only 16G of storage. Now that I've had a chance to use it, I can foresee being mad at myself for cheaping out on storage space. I'll be exchanging it and upgrading to the 32G version, so any of you looking for a deal on a new Fire HD should keep an eye out on Amazon's Warehouse Deal pages!", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Upgrade", "Author": "Janet S.

Because, Amazon, this is the SEVENTH Kindle that has been sent to me. The seventh! Shall we begin the sordid tale? One I have told to countless customer service reps, in countless countries, from countless call centers? Yes, let's.My very first Kindle I received as a Valentine's day gift - a LOVE gift, Amazon - from my husband, because he caught me drooling over my sister's Kindle HD several times and he was worried that much saliva would damage it. I should have known right then that something I wanted that much would not be a good thing for me to have. Lesson learned, Amazon, so thanks for that! That very first Kindle quit working within three months. The replacement you sent me quit working within a month. The third replacement within a week. The fourth within an HOUR. The fifth within TWENTY MINUTES.Are we sensing a pattern yet, Amazon? All of that after having been reassured time and time again by various call centers and customer service reps, all outside of the USA, that I was getting NEW Kindles and not refurbished. Despite being assured this, Amazon, I am just as assured they were refurbished junk due to lint trapped under the screen of Kindle #2, scratches on the screen of Kindle #3, and dirt under the casing of Kindle #5. That, together with the abysmal packaging - dirt, poor re-taping, scrapes and tears in the cardboard, etc. - speak USED and ABUSED to me, Amazon, particularly since Kindle #6 was a brand spanking new one, sent to me direct from online ordering.How do I know this? Because, Amazon, the call center supervisor I finally was able to get a hold of told me that all of the other reps I talked to should not have assured me they were brand new, that all replacements were refurbished, and had me place an order for good ole #6 direct from your very own little website! Too bad that good ole #6 was the DOWNGRADED Kindle. You know, the one with cheaper casing, no front-facing camera, all the extras taken off of it. Because in the scant seven months I'd been gnashing my teeth and wailing over your disappointing to say the very least product, you, Amazon, decided to add a few more pixels, a scant few more bells and whistles, and what I'm assuming is dust from the very tushie of Tinkerbell, considering that putting that X following the HD part of the Kindle justified you increasing the price another $150.You can understand my vexation, can't you? That the product I had paid the fullest price for, plus the added injustice of your exorbitant and nearly useless extended warranty that neither the retail store your product was stocked with - I assume by you, Amazon - nor indeed by you yourself, Amazon, was willing to stand behind, was now no longer being produced. But hey, we'll take off the goodies and give you a cheaper knock off of the original it'll all be good customer service and you'll be happy, right? Wrong, Amazon. So very, very wrong.Realizing at once it was not the product that I had in good faith been told was the EXACT product I had originally purchased, I didn't even take it out of the plastic wrapping. I called up the good ole Amazon helpline again, and once more shared my sad tale of Kindle Fire HD woe with its myriad forms and failings, perhaps a bit more heatedly - a friend who was with me at the time compared it to a nuclear meltdown, but I think it was more napalm level, myself - and was assured yet again that a supervisor would call me back within 15 minutes. I waited three hours. Three HOURS, Amazon. No call. I will admit to losing my cool with the next poor customer service rep from yet another call center in yet another country. It was probably approaching nuclear. I demanded a direct transfer to a supervisor and was told yet again it was impossible. Impossible for just such occasions, yes, Amazon? So that the buck can be passed on and on and you never have to directly deal with an aggrieved customer right, Amazon? Despite all fervent assurances and against my better judgement, but more likely because of the raging headache my semi-nuclear meltdown had brought on, I once again agreed to be called back by a supervisor. The wait would be no more than 10 minutes this time, I was informed. Care to hazard a guess on how long I waited? No? TWO DAYS. Two days, Amazon. No call.Perhaps fortunately for those poor souls just trying to do their job, I am not one of those people who can sustain my anger for more than a day at most, usually not more than a few hours. After two days I was determined, but calm. Once more I called. One more time I repeated my oft-told tale. Well, actually twice more, because at last I had gotten a customer service rep who did what I asked of her. She personally ensured that a supervisor called me back. From Malaysia this time. He walked me through ordering another Kindle online, my seventh now. Assured me it was brand new. Showed me screen grabs of the page when I was unable to access it because the ordering page for my version of Kindle HD was no longer being sold online.By the by, you do realize that at this point, because I had no time between the failings of the last three Kindles and the arrival of the replacements, that I had FOUR Kindles in my home, three of which were useless paperweights waiting to be sent back? In sheer price of shipping alone, if you had just sent me your fancy, fairy dust sprinkled, brand new Kindle HDX - in which I'm just betting, Amazon, you've addressed all these problems with your now defunct previous Kindle HD - in the first place or issued me a voucher for a new one off the shelf of Best Buy or a FULL refund on the junk you sent me, you would have ultimately saved money, don't you?Regardless, I received the last one I ordered and shipped back others. Alas, the 'new' one was in the beat up, torn up, re-taped dirty package. Another refurb. Lucky it is for you, Amazon, that I was tired of fighting, it was the same product I originally purchased, and that it has actually been working. I have prayed over this ridiculous thing every time I turn it on and I am keeping what I do on it to the bare minimum until it's proved itself as more than a three-monther.If this Kindle fails ... well, I'm afraid, Amazon, that your faithlessness and unwillingness to stand behind your defective product will have done me in. Not to mention your passing me around your call centers like a slightly insane, annoying in-law that comes to visit and stays too long with her ridiculous demands. It's not me, Amazon, it's you. I'm sorry, but if it fails that will be the end for you and me - and anyone else I can convince that you are the ultimate bad acquaintance. It was brief and unsatisfying and rage-inducing. All toxic in any relationship, don't you agree, Amazon? It's better this way. My friend? The one who saw the nuclear meltdown and its wintry aftermath? She's already sworn you off.You really should have just stuck with books.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet, but not for power users", "Author": "terthen", "ReviewID": "R2H9V7RJMY0VZ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quick pros and cons of the Kindle Fire HD for anyone thinking about getting one (although admittedly this review is a little late given the HDX is already out). My comparison is with the Nexus 7, as I was choosing between these two.PROS:- screen is crisp and clear- audio is the best of any tablet I've used- I found myself using the Kindle Fire HD to watch more movies than I did with our iPad given the above- great build quality- Amazing Amazon customer service--actually had 1 Kindle with a bad battery and Amazon immediately replaced itCONS:- While the \"major\" apps are mostly there, I really missed the Google Play Store- Overall the Silk Browser was slow, made me search for other browsers to use but had to sideload these (and these other browsers like Dolphin and Chrome were buggy when sideloaded)- Not easy to multitask with this, especially missed the app-switching button on stock Android- Stock email app is nowhere as good as Google's Gmail app (which you have to jump through a few hoops to get it to work on the KFHD)Overall, the Kindle Fire HD is a very nice tablet but I would recommend it more for those with Prime who want to watch movies, listen to mp3s, and casually browse the web. Essentially, this would be a great tablet for the less tech-savvy or for my mom--and the amazing customer service really helps even more there!

I am also deeply disappointed in the various apps that require weird and totally unnecessary permissions (come on now) . Having said that, I still rate the kindle highly as I was sort of prepared for the above before I even bought it. I have seen many people's negative reviews  of all the ads. I have actually been pleased with most apps, even the free ones not placing the ads in conspicuous places so I actually have little complaint with that.Kindle customer service has been excellent. They completely replaced my kindle for a minor unfixable problem and my 2nd kindle works great. I've had about 10 encounters with them and each one resolved my issues quickly and with tact, efficiency and simple niceness considering my newbieness.I have heard horror stories about the kindle freezing. I have only truly experienced that once, don't know what happened but a quick forced restart worked to unfreeze it after reading through solutions on the kindle user forum which is easy to access online. No further problems. I did have my charger simply stop working and I'm still not sure about that but it was cheap and working now. May need to review it separately since it is a separate component.All in all, love reading on it, watching videos on it, even the 7 inch screen is ok but if you really like videos, recommend the 8.5 inch one.Apps seem a little lame so far but I admit I choose the free ones or cheap ones since I am gunshot about paying for an unproven app. Still searching for a decent drafting/paint program and a better note program although the free note program I found wasn't too bad but the paid sketch app I found requires you to sign your life away, not happening, again disappointed in that.Privacy seems nil on these devices but what do you really expect?Anyway, still happy and still trying new things.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Kindle Fire is great!", "Author": "Susan Oehlke", "ReviewID": "R1ZQVPE0UZ3S0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It met all my expectations plus.

I thought people who pay for a Kindle with e ink or touch screen or whatever were nuts. Kindle on my laptop is so much easier on the eyes. A friend loaned me her 2 year old Kindle Fire with ads for me to use a few months during a long recovery from surgery. It came with a month's free trial of Amazon Prime. I discovered that owning a Kindle has its advantages. I could download free music, apps and games (not a good idea. They're addictive time wasters, but fun). With Prime there were even free videos, tough I didn't try those until later.It became clear I'd better look for my own Kindle Fire and give this friend her Kindle back, so I cruised Amazon for pricing. Since I was using a perfectly fine used 7\" KF with ads, I saw no reason to buy new. Money's tight.I tried to order a few offers for $74 or $80, but by the time I reached checkout the deal was gone. Looked into the differences between KF and KF HD, and figured I was happy enough with KF 7\". The sound was fine. The display was fine. But I couldn't get a decent price. Took a break and figured I'd have to go back to my laptop Kindle app, until I happened on an offer for a gently used KF HD 7\" for a reasonable price. It didn't have a cord or a charger, but it had a soft case. I bought and have used it happily 3 months. I decided to get the HD model because of a well reasoned review of the HD compared with the iPad and other Kindle models.For a week I had two Kindle Fire units-one earlier model and one HD. The standard display was fine. The KF HD display was excellent. The sound was good on both units, if a little better on the HD. I've never found the ads to be a nuisance. In fact the HD ads are gorgeous. Sound is subdued. I tried enhancing it with a KF speaker peripheral someone gave me. Doesn't make any difference. Sound is clear of static, and volume is adequate on the unit itself. Bought a hard case like the one I'd liked on my friend's borrowed KF. Used, it cost $3. It's great. Both units are easier to operate with a stylus. The T9 prescriptive text is a chore to get used to. But for music, movies, soundtracks and of course books, this Kindle Fire is great. It's easier to use than the iPads I've played with and way cheaper. Try and find an iPad for under $140. Not happening unless you mess with those freaky auction sites claiming you can get an iPad for $28 or something like that.A few other things to know: the 'fast' charger isn't any faster than the regular chargers on offer. My Kindle Fire charges in about 4 hours. It holds a charge in continuous use for 6. Some other chargers may be advertised for use with Kindle Fire, but plugged in, they give an error message \"weak charge.\" Toss them or return them and get a working charger. Use a stylus and you don't need a screen cover. You don't have finger prints on screen. Most reviews of those complain about how hard they are to aapply, how they cut glare but dim brightness and clarity. Why buy HD and bank it's fire with a glare filter? If you're outside, play outside, enjoy the fun. Don't whip out an e-reader to watch a movie or read. That's indoor fun, rainy day fun. Bring a paperback to the beach. If it gets wet or sandy, who Cares? Use some sense.Only problems I've experienced are with Amazon Prime. Where I live they can't really honor their pledge for faster delivery. They can give you 'free' delivery- for $89/year. I tried Prime because it offered a video I long wanted to see 'free.' It wasn't. Prime is only worth the cost because of the free videos and you don't have to find enough product to make a $25 free shipping order. Not all Prime book offerings are in fact Prime (with free shipping). Until I got the Kindle Fire HD, I didn't see how I could benefit much from Amazon Prime. Since then, I've used its privileges a lot. But I check over the order carefully before checking outSo if you don't need great HD graphics, the Kindle Fire is your best bet.

I have to say I purchased my Fire Kindle HD a year ago and I am so so happy I made the right choice in doing so. I Was Concerned about the touch screen feature.This is nothen close to a difficult touch screen. I absolutely adore my kindle HD.I surf the webpage & you can download available banking apps to pay bills.you can add your own email manually if its not listed. I was awful about checking my email, not anymore :). There is a lot of free app games etc. Free Pandora apps for music & 99cent mp3 music. Most of your books have a audio read on it even though they give you the options to purchase an additional audio read to your book,whether it reads or not. The free read feature is on the kindle & the additional audio read is different from the kindle read. Free youtube variety of every thing to music & recipes, hair styles, make You name it. Free apps for Wi-Fi free ph & txt service. This was the best selection for me. My Husband ordered this one of the cheaper in quality readers from Amazon. He was safely  disappointed after he saw how much more the fire kindle HD offers, and how easy & fun it was to use.You can read in the dark with no problem. This is it....

I researched and tested every tablet I could get my hands on, even ones made specifically for youngsters, and the Kindle Fire HD was the only one I would give my child. The construction is strong, the speed and ease of use is excellent, the screen display is beautiful but most of all the built-in FreeTime app allows for safe use by children.

I also have a Kindle keyboard that I love and use all the time. Hence, I did not \"need\" a Kindle Fire HD. However, in a moment of weakness, when I saw that Amazon had discounted the price last month, I bought myself a new toy. The next day, I thought of cancelling the order, since I did not acually \"need\" the gadget, so the expense was superfluous -- but it had already shipped. Now that I have grown accustomed to having a Kindle Fire HD, I can't imagine how I ever lived without one. My iPad has become little more than a bookend in recent weeks, as the Fire has become my go-to gadget for almost everything. To justify having two tablets and reconcile their similarities and differences, I decided in the future to use the iPad for work (I am a college professor and literacy specialist/consultant) and the Kindle Fire for play and recreational reading. That has been a good decision so far, as my iPad is a bit heavy and cumbersome to carry around in all the time, so I can just leave it in the office to use when I am on campus. The Kindle Fire HD fits easily into my handbag, and it is great to have it with me in the event that I want to take advantage of unexpected blocks of downtime.The only thing I regret is not digging a bit deeper money-wise and buying a Kindle Fire equipped with 3G or 4G wireless access. I made the same mistake when I purchased my iPad. The price difference is substantial, and it would have been hard to justify in the case of the iPad, because I would not carry it around as much. But now that I am bringing my Kindle Fire practically everywhere, it would be great if I could gain internet access from every place I could pick up a cell signal (I don't have a cell phone). Still, even without the 3G or 4G feature, this tablet is one great little gadget. Attractive, easy to use, with lots of free or very low cost applications available on the Amazon website. Oh, and the audio quality is spectacular. Really. Finally, I am enjoying reading some of my e-books and magazines in color formats. That is something I can't do on my old Kindle keyboard, which, like the iPad, has been gathering dust since the moment I unboxed the Kindle Fire.

The larger screen on the 8.9 tempted me, but I really wanted something that travels well.  The reason I picked Kindle over Nexus was very close--geez, I did an Excel spreadsheet  and everything.  KFHD plusses: speakers, Amazon ecosystem, more storage for the price (esp. with the $30 off deal earlier), HDMI out.  Nexus plusses: better form factor and weight, full access to Android apps, GPS, bit more CPU power.Very close, and in the end the ability to pick up the 32GB KFHD for $199 was just too tempting.  OK, so I am already wired into Amazon's ecosystem, and as a Windows Phone user, no stake in the Google Play world.  (Let's not soil this discussion with talk of those i-devices, OK?)  I have not run into a case where I can't get an Android app I need on the KFHD, but I will allow that this might happen in the future, in which case I think I can manage rooting the thing if I have to--it's kind of an ugly process, but I've done worse!  (I really couldn't care less about Jellybean vs. Ice Cream Sandwich vs. whatever other silly confectionery name is next.)Living with it now for a couple of months, I have to admit that it is very handy to have--forget bringing that silly laptop on vacation, or dealing with your phone screen to browse the web, this 7\" size is a perfect compromise.  Rip some DVDs and save to the device for those nights when there's nothing on the hotel room TV (the extra storage helps).  I still use my old e-ink Kindle because you CANNOT READ this device in the outdoors, at least until the sun hits the horizon, but then it's nice to have when the sun is all the way down and you want to keep reading.  The speakers are nice, but take some of these rave reviews with a grain of salt--this is not an audiophile experience by any means.I'm still glad I made the choice I did, altho Google came out with the new Nexus7 about a month later, and that might have swung me back over.

Even after Amazon came out with the Kindle Touch I still held off because I didn't think that the original Touch had the premium feel that I have come to expect from the Kindle hardware plus I was waiting on the internal light. The original Kindle Fire was exciting in terms of its ground breaking feature set at that price point but at that point I was still anti-tablet and to a point I still am. Tablets; Contrary to popular opinion cannot replace laptops.When Amazon unveiled the new line of Kindles with the Fire HD and the Paperwhite I was very excited. I immediately found a friend to buy my 3rd gen Kindle and I was set to buy a Kindle Paperwhite (which I still might) when my girlfriend told me that I was not allowed to make any large purchases until after Christmas. According to her, \"you never know what Santa will bring you\", so I held off. I loved the new Paperwhite and would read all the reviews that I could and every time we were in Best Buy I would play with it while my Girlfriend would play with the new Kindle Fire HD. She was also in a holding pattern because she wanted the new Nook HD (her old Nook broke and she wanted a replacement).She likes tablets and I did not but after playing with the Fire HD in best buy multiple times I began to like it more and more. The screen is fantastic and I am a movie buff with a large collection of movies. I looked at other options like the Nexus 7, Nook HD, and the Ipad Mini (under-speced and over priced) when it was released and decided that they were not what I was looking for. This was going to replace my e-reader and while I could get the Amazon app on the Nexus 7 it was not the engrossing reading experience that I was looking for. I settled on the Kindle Fire HD.Pros:The Kindle Fire HD has a premium look and feel with a nice use of metals, glass, and the rubberized coating on the back is quite nice. It feels solid in the hand.The screen is beautiful and crisp for videos and reading.The speakers are very nice and easily the best of any tablet.Amazon uses a heavily skinned version of android (in this case 4.2 jelly bean) and the UI (user interface) is very easy to use and fairly intuitive with most everything within plain sight.The battery life is solid.The reader centric experience is great. They do put reading in the forefront and the software options that are given to the reading platform are extensive and fantastic.Cons:The tablet is just a little heavy for long reading sessions (if you have a case it's easier because you hold like a book).No GPS is a bit of a letdown. While sitting at a caf\u00e9 in the city it would nice to use my tablet (bigger screen) for mapping as opposed to my phone. Although your position can be found via Wi-Fi it is not as good or reliable.No cellular option for the HD 7.There is no real multitasking. Multitasking by default (the old android way) is not multitasking.There are minor issues with the UI and software that should be tweaked. At the end of each book they jump you right in to a review page which I think is nice although this page is not well laid out. The text boxes are small and there are minor glitches that come up and are very annoying at times. The keyboard is too basic and should be look at as well at the spell correction. There are other minor issues and some lag as well.All in all I do like this tablet a lot and if you are a reader and/or you are an Amazon Prime member than I would say this is the one for you. There are some draw backs and I would say now that Barnes and Noble has added Google Play Store access to its tablets, cut the prices, and are spec for spec almost on par with the Kindle Fire HD line they have become a very compelling option for a solid all around tablet that does reading very well.The Kindle Fire HD line is not in my opinion the all around computing tablet. It lacks some basics (GPS and better apps selection) that are necessary for that moniker but if you are looking for a solid tablet for reading, surfing the web, watching movies, listening to music and you want it all at a price that is more than reasonable unlike some others that I will not mention (Ipad Mini) then this is a great choice.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Experience With This Product", "Author": "Programmher", "ReviewID": "R2IJL2CXIP7A0X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited to receive my Kindle Fire HD. I enjoyed the first generation Kindle Fire and only upgraded after my screen broke and the repair would have cost at least $99.00.The order process and delivery was easy and fast. I received my Kindle Fire HD in a timely manner. I charged my device and began using it.First, my Kindle Fire HD got very hot while charging. Wasn't sure if this was supposed to happen, so I continued to try and use the device. After a couple of hours of use, my screen stopped responding to my swipe commands. It was stuck, I couldn't swipe left to unlock the device, and it took me 45 minutes to successfully swipe and unlock the device - after I'd restarted it and rebooted it twice.After I reinstalled my apps after the 2nd factory reboot, I proceeded to try and purchase some add-ons. My transactions went through and my account is pending the debits, but out of 3 transactions, only 1 actually posted to my Kindle account.At this point,I contacted Kindle Support.Both Kindle Support agents were very patient and helpful. The initial offer was to replace my device; but, after reading some of the reviews and living through an extremely frustration couple of hours with this newer version, I have decided to return the device and get a refund for the price of my Kindle. The Support Agents also assured me my bank account would be refunded the charges that did not post to my Kindle account.I am now researching other devices that will allow me to read my eBooks without the frustrations I had with the Kindle Fire HD. One expects an occasional glitch but the several issues I experienced with a device that is supposed to be the leader in its category just really soured me from purchasing a Kindle in the future.

I especially liked WhisperSync and Imersion Reading.  I had a little trouble linking up my Audible account with my Amazon account (necessary for these two features to work), but Audible was EXTREMELY helpful and I soon got that ironed out.The Good:This tablet is definitely geared for media.  It is not set up to be your general-purpose Android tablet.  I knew that when I bought it, and frankly I kinda like the Kindle interface.The Bad:I know tablets can be fragile - so I bought a kid-proof case for it.  However, before I could even get the case on the tablet, the screen cracked.  Now, it was my fault - the tablet fell off my chair onto the floor - but the fall was no harder than I've have with other tablets before and they held up just fine.  Now I have hairline cracks in the screen.  I don't know if the glass was pre-stressed or just thin and sensitive or what.  They have been making bullet-proof/shatter-proof glass since I was a child (and I'm 60) ... they couldn't put stronger glass in a tablet, which they know is going to get a lot of handling?UPDATE:I bought the tablet from BestBuy because I wanted the extended warranty to be handled locally.  I took the Kindle back to them to discuss options on the cracked screen.  I learned the following:A) The Geeks in the Geek Squad confirmed for me that they have a MUCH higher incidence of Kindle Fire HD's coming back with a cracked screen than any other tablet.  Their assumption is that Amazon went cheap on the glass in order to keep the price low.B) The Best Buy \"Full Accident Replacement\" plan is not all it was presented to be.  I didn't understand how they could make any money the way they presented it, and I guess I should have pressed.  They knew that the tablet was for my granddaughter and talked me into a 3-year accident policy so she would be fully covered.  It turns out that any time you bring the tablet back with accidental damage, they will fix the problem but it also terminates the policy.  In other words, my $90 3-year accident policy provided the exact same results as a $40 1-year policy - I got a new tablet with no coverage.  I can see this makes sense to them - they'd go broke if they didn't have some sort of limiting clause in the coverage.  I just wish I had understood it better because the odds were that my granddaughter would break it in the first year (and it turns out I broke it in the first week) and so I feel like I spent and extra $50 for nothing.

My ONLY objection is Amazon doesn't play well with Google and wants to trap me in the Amazon ecosystem.

I want to use my 2-Step Authentication to log into my Gmail account and Amazon tries to force me to use their embedded e-mail application which kinda sux.  I wanna use my Google contacts...but Amazon tries to force me to use their Contact database..which kinda sux.  For my needs...I NEED everything to sync seamlessly between my laptop, my phone & my table...and unfortunately...the Kindle Fire falls short (unless I root the fool thing which I don't wanna do).Maybe because I love Amazon so much...I decided NOT to return my Kindle Fire...instead giving it to my 13-yr old son.  Since I gave it to him today...he has used it so much playing games he has had to charge the battery 2x.So...the good part...the Kindle Fire is a great device for most uses I would imagine...the screen resolution is awesome...the features are awesome...and of course...Amazon is always awesome.

When I stated that the advertised battery life was 11 hours, he kept saying \"each device is different for battery life depending on how it is used.\"  I only use it for reading!  I learned right away that I could not use it for checking email or facebook because it eats the battery in even less than 3 hours.  Just now, I picked up my Kindle Fire HD 7\" to read, and even though it showed more than 50% battery when I put it to sleep last night, it was too dead to turn it on this morning.  So, it ate up 50% of battery life while it was asleep.  This is so inconvenient to be unable to read when I want.

Pros: relatively fast processing, tabs on tabs slow it down very little with a decent wifi connect, fun pointless games and apps, good res and color on screen, easily accessible settings menu allows you to adjust brightness volume web setting all available while running any app, and the main selling point for me, price!! Conclusion, it's a fun reasonably priced web toy for fbookers bloggers online shoppers ect. As far as doing anything useful with it?

And even though I loved it the day I received it I wanted to wait before reviewing it so the 'new tablet smell' had worn off. As a comparison we also have a Nexus 7 and a Ipad 2 in our household. And while I'd prefer not to I don't think I can write a proper review without a little comparison to the other two.The quality of the screen and the media abilities make the Fire HD hard to beat. Amazon sells it at an amazing price and it can often be found at less than $200. That is little money for a machine that does a lot of things. How can they afford to sell it at such a price? Because they are making a bet that a new buyer will use it to consume media they buy through Amazon. If you are already making heavy use of the books, music and movies through Amazon Price then this tablet is for you. Be forewarned that it makes buying stuff even easier than the website though.The screen is fantastic, showing good, vibrant colors and great resolution. The touch screen is very responsive. Amazon also used what they call 'Gorilla Glass' for the screen making it very tough. How tough? It has survived my 6 year old, 5 year old and 1 year old without a single scratch. This is the only tablet I own that I didn't feel the need to put a screen cover on for protection.Reading, the new fashion way. I have no read so much in years since after getting into tablets. And if you are a ready the Kindle has a lot to offer. The screen is good making the letters crisp and dark. Amazon provides the ability 'to borrow' certain books from its store each month. There are also more magazines/periodicals available on the Kindle than any other tablet. I do find the table to be a bit wide for one handed reading, but it's not heavy. It does lack the light feel of the Ipad and Nexus even though they are similar in size. The volume buttons are decently placed and not easy to accidently hit, unlike my Nexus.If you are after the latest apps the Kindle Fire will leave you a bit cold. Amazon offers a good deal of apps and the Kindle uses a modified Android OS, but the selection is tiny compared to the Google Store and even more so compared to Apple. If you want a tablet to do everything fairly well I don't think the Kindle Fire is it. This device is made for the media consumer and used, web browsing, Facebooking, photo sharing and the like are much easier done on the other tablets. I purchased this device mostly to use to read magazines I couldn't get on other tablets, and so my kids could watch movies during plane rides and long drive. For that it has excelled.

Amazon has a very limited app base, and therefore the majority of the apps are not there.  For example, Candy Crush, Sirius radio and Bodymedia.

The refurbished unit was like new btw. But having grown accustomed to my previous 7\" 1st gen Fire, this is just right. There are also minute differences on the keyboard, etc. between the sizes that I was already used to. I think the 8.9 is too big and heavy; and this one is just right :) Love Fire in general, and enjoying all the new functions, especially the audiobook/ebook synchronization, as well as the new standard text-to-speech voice which is certainly improved on the original. I am also for the first time typing on the bluetooth keyboard which paired perfectly once I figured it out and types amazingly comfortably (by Amazon), plus the original (leather) Amazon case (in blue); the difference in price between the sizes allowed me those extras (and a charger). Works great. Also there is a phone app so you can make and receive calls. 5-Star performance! :)Update:  I returned this unit for a refurbished non-HD (gen. 2) Fire. I just don't think the HD adds anything (the screen of my original Fire is perfectly responsive and visually; it doesn't have the slight pauses or glitches of the HD. I reasoned the 10-point touch screen & HD-quality \"video card\" (or whatever a Fire has) takes more RAM and software to operate, hence possibly accounting for the difference from my *perfect* 1st gen. unit. I watch Netflix and HD-quality YouTube videos on my 1st gen. and honestly don't see a difference. I also know the refurbished units are just as fine and functional as new ones. I got two more cases with the deal, one being a duplicate of my favorite which is hard \"fabric\" that completely zips around unit and has no \"straps\" (Marware beige) Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Beige (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)  Most of the new features like text ebook/ audiobook synchronization (immersion reading) are included in the new (2nd gen.) software and I'm hoping the new text-to-speech voice software is as well. They are not HD-dependent. Of course I am sacrificing Bluetooth functionality (keyboard, separate speakers), HDMI-out for a larger screen, and one App that allows you to use the device as a phone; probably the microphone is missing too, and of course the camera is (mine was too dark and grainy anyways, not nearly as good as a built-in laptop cam for example). So, no Skype on the non-HD if those features matter to you (the phone App was neat).My main beef was the screen, again in the HD 7\" Fire was yellow, with less contrast (for text ebooks) than my 1st gen. which I far preferred. Mostly I use my Fire for reading ebooks, and that was what was important to me. I keep my half-way brightness setting, and it's always sufficient. Secondly I browse websites and videos, and my 1st gen. is nimble & quick and perfectly capable. So I'm hoping the 2nd gen. I have now ordered will have the hardware designs I prefer with *some* of the new features (software). I can only hope for the quicker, brighter screen; I know the interface has been updated to the new standard which I found equally useful to the original. It is shipping now... :) As a small last insertion, the Kindle (ebook reading software) function, in the updated version, covers the text of your ebook with the menu enabled at the top, more like the Kindle White. The old Fire doesnt do this; it does, however, do it on the bottom. This will be the same between the HD and 2nd gen., so just a minor irritation. Btw, I received the sale price of $169 here so the difference in price between the HD and non-HD unit was a non-issue.I removed one star for the more yellow, darker screen with less ebook text contrast.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved my kindle fire hd, until it crashed and froze on me not once, but twice!", "Author": "Patrick McCarty", "ReviewID": "R2IDXJGM5BNA9K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I used my fire for 6 months with no problem.

After using it for a couple of months I have found some things I like and some I don't like. I like the added storage - better for more movies and apps and now room for my music as well. I love the dual speakers. I also like the USB connection. I don't like the on/off button - really hard to find when using it in the dark. I also miss the lighted on/off switch. Plus the switch doesn't light up when it's charging like the Kindle Fire so I'm not quite sure when it's done. I'm also not very fond of the ads that pop up, but I just ignore them. Have not tried any of the other features like the camera. Overall pleased with the product and glad I purchased it.

I can say with certainty that it was made with just about nothing but entertainment in mind.  The screen and sound are phenomenal, and I've found so many free (and AWESOME) games that it has supplanted my phone as my primary mobile gaming device literally overnight.The CONS I have found are as follows:Occasionally the keyboard pops up on its own.  I have to drag the menu down and press \"back\" to make it go away.  This is particularly irritating during a fast paced game (in Temple Run 2 or Iron Man 3 it's a kill order)The fact that I have to pull down the menu to navigate; I'm used to my android phone having at least a couple of static buttons.  Home and back buttons that are quickly accessible would be a plus, though I can see how people might have to worry about accidentally tapping those buttons.For such a high-powered device, I've found it to be a little bit laggy.  Iron Man 3, as mentioned above, has become my go to game.  It's got extremely good graphics, and I can understand that can cause a bit of jumpiness.  I'm going to try it on a iPad tonight and find out which gets better results.  (As a side note, am I the only one astounded by the fact that our mobile gaming platforms now outshine the PS2?!)Really?  No official youtube app?  No official hotmail app?  I have to side load and cheat the system on day 1 if I want to have a usable youtube and hotmail?  I mean...really?And lastly, not a gripe, but more an announcement.  The interface is a bit beyond me; I have yet to figure out how to put a website permanently on the carousal, and I hate having to switch back and forth between device and cloud storage to pick an app.  The front page only contains that one carousal, and it is constantly changing based on what apps you've installed/used most recently.  Why not have a second carousal, that you swipe down to, where you can have things permanently stay regardless of cloud or device storage?  I mean, since there apparently aren't official youtube, hotmail, or cracked apps for this device, it would be nice to access those websites quickly and easily.Huh.

I thought to myself YAY, as i cancelled my layby and brought the new kindle.The one thing i noticed first was the price difference. In australia an ipad mini is around $360 for just the 16gb wifi only. Whereas the kindle fire is only $230 (so that already is a $130 saving). i just couldnt justify spending more on something i wouldnt be satisfied with.As soon as i got home, i opened it and just looked at it for a little bit.

I just cant see myself taking pictures on the kindle, but i love the idea that i can skyped with my family now.The next thing was the display of the kindle, or the layout of the main page. At first i didnt like that when held in portrait, it showed what other people had brought when that app was selected, but after going through the settings i found how to turn it off.The coolest thing i found was that you could go onto the amazon website and look at apps than send them to your kindle fire (when connected to wifi) and all i had to do was sync. i also love that i dont ever have to connect my kindle to a computer to use.After having the kindle for just over 2 days i havent found anything i dont like yet. but i am still experimenting.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "Claire McCown", "ReviewID": "R2ZGZ7YOXIRFYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product.

It is not entirely user-friendly and it took lots of phone calls to Amazon to understand some of the features. That is a feat in itself, as they do not put their contact info where one can easily find it. I'm not sure if they even put it on this website. I had to go to Google to find their phone number for customer service. I keep it with my kindle. The images and print are small and cannot be altered. You can temporarily increase the size by moving your fingers on the screen but it goes away and you have to keep changing it. They said there is no fix for this. I also have trouble using certain features on the kindle compared to the computer. I can't listen to music samples or view movies using my Amazon Prime membership. I am not sure yet if those things are possible or if they are simply difficult to figure out. There is a huge learning curve with this item. I almost wish I had waited for the next version to come out and see if some of these issues are addressed.The price dropped by $20 after I got it and I had to spend money on extra accessories. They give you a USB that only attaches to the laptop computer so I had to shell out for a wall adapter as well. I got the case to make it more portable, but it's still pretty hefty. I also got the warranty in case I dropped it. Ca-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching. I spent well over $200 by the time I added on all the necessary extras to make it really worthwhile (screen covers, stand, car charger, wall adapter, stylus, etc., etc.). So, don't think that the advertised price is all there is to it. The stylus really is necessary as it sometimes does not recognize a finger swipe. I found some package deals on Amazon for these accessories so it pays to shop around. I did feel that this was a better value than an iPad or other brand.It gets me online, I can listen to music, watch videos, read ebooks, check email, surf the web, etc. I'm sure it does a lot of things that I haven't figured out yet. Good luck with that. The emanual is rather skimpy. If you can invest the time to learn everything and spend time calling for customer support, then it should be fine. It doesn't completely replace a pc but it does more than my cell phone which is not a smart phone by any means. I have a \"Stupid Talk\" from Wally World. This gives me more (which is more than none) media options for travel and convenience. I got the Prime membership which has its own pros and cons. I did a lot of research before buying and there is no way to know everything (after all, you can't ask what you don't know). Overall, I do like it and use it a lot. In fact, I am using it more and more as I get to know it. I just thought it should have included more accessories and that it should be either easier to use or easier to get help to figure it out. If you are really techie, then perhaps you will understand it better and have better luck. It would be nice to have the larger size, but that would weigh more and take up more room...which, for portability is a consideration. It's smaller to transport than a laptop but not as functional. Then again, it isn't meant to be or there are things that I haven't learned yet.Just find that customer service number (google it) and keep it handy, lol. I practically had them on speed dial for a while. It is a cool tool to have when away from the home computer if you don't have a smart phone. If you do have a smart phone, not sure that this would also be necessary? I guess it all depends on your needs, budget and level of technical expertise. Case in point: I wrote this review from the kindle and had to come back on my pc to edit. It uses autocorrect and changes things such as numbers and symbols. You have to really be on guard because it will also sometimes change words! I can't seem to find a way to turn that feature OFF! It has some other items that also behave that way. You can lock the orientation as it keeps turning even when I don't completely turn the unit, flipping the text around. Bottom line: it takes time but not everything is as one would expect. By the way, it comes with a camera but post-purchase I discovered that this is for Skyping, not really for taking snapshots.

It is so versatile. There are fun games and great, useful apps (not to mention a free app each day); great speakers for any music you download or put onto the device, an incredible screen display for shows and movies, and not to mention the great platform for books (probably the reason you turned to the Kindle).First to the books: - The X-Ray feature is awesome: you can click X-Ray at any point in your book (while connected to the internet) and you will see defined terms, names, and other points in the book where that term is mentioned - greatly useful and convenient. - Immersion reading is great: the service where you can read a book and listen to an audiobook at the same time. It's innovative because the book highlights itself as it is read by the audiobook. Additionally, it syncs your place no matter which medium you use. If you listen to just the audiobook for a period and then jump to the book, the book will turn immediately to where you left off on the Audiobook.Now for movies: - A similar X-Ray service is present for movies. At any time, you can click on the screen and IMDb pops up with the actors that are on screen in the present scene.Fun and handy if you're trying to remember that actor you know you have on the tip of your tongue. - The screen is incredible and boasts full 720 HD. Great for all the videos on Amazon Instant.  I highly recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a tablet for great functionality in several respects: Great HD screen, incredible speakers, awesome programs.Also, I'd like to add that I highly recommend having or getting Amazon Prime while you have this device. You will be able to get free two-day shipping on so many items on Amazon.com and an ever-expanding and great amount of free TV shows and movies (not to mention a brand new slew of them from Viacom including shows from MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central - shows, I might add, that are no longer on Netflix!). Amazon Instant Video (as the Amazon Prime video service is called) is building up to compete with Netflix and Hulu Plus, and it's really a great service for the money! Also on Amazon Prime, you get a free book every month with no due dates. In other words, have the book as long as you want! But only one per month.And one final word. DON'T PAY TO GET RID OF SPECIAL OFFERS!! Special Offers only appear when you click the unlock button. They appear right before you unlock the device and NEVER after. The only place to see them is on the \"Offers\" tab of the home-screen carousel. They are not intrusive, they are not annoying. Also, the special offers include decent book suggestions and daily deal offers, free or discounted App downloads, new shows or audiobooks, and sometimes even completely free, no-strings-attached Amazon MP3 credits. Seriously, don't be foolish and pay to remove ads. They are overall a great service, especially considering the fact that the device is cheaper because of them.All in all, an excellent device. Do your homework and research different tablets for your specific desires and needs. But this truly is a useful, fun, and versatile device.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I don't remember life before my Kiindle Fire HD", "Author": "Nevermore", "ReviewID": "R1VP7WTO8RKXVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this baby since Sept of 2012. I first purchases the Kindle Fire and within a week I exchanged it for the Fire HD. To say this has become an essential part of my life would be an understatement. There isn't a single day that I don't use this. I resisted getting an e-reader for years, I find caved and I'm so happy that I did. As someone who has used Amazon for the better part of 10 years, it was no brainer and I'm thrilled with my purchase.Keep in mind, I'm not a techie.  I've never been one of those consumers that needs  the most technically advanced anything,  so for my needs the Kindle Fire  HD is perfect. Perhaps some other devices have more bells and whistles for but an average user this definitely does the job. So for me the pro's are numerous.PROs:The size:  I don't need a larger screen. I find reading magazines or books quite comfortable. For me the portions are ideal. It fits easily in any of my handbags. I love having access to my favorite reading materials (books/magazines) at my fingertips without having to lug them around. This was one reason why I resisted e-reader for so many years, because I thought I would miss the experience of real books, umm frankly, I don't.  ). Also, this baby has taken quite a few falls and I've had no issues. I use various Kindle covers to protect it (purchased from Amazon of course).WiFi: I easily find signals to jump on. Financially I don't want to commit to wireless plan so for me the free WiFi is more than sufficient.Apps/Games: I've synced all my emails to this device so I can easily check them. My Google Calendar is also easily accessible. As for as complaints about not having access to a million apps, who freaking cares. There only but handful whatever that I've needed, I found. I'm not going to bellyache about 2,000,000 apps available elsewhere, that I probably won't ever need anyway. First world problems, folks.Video: I've downloaded both Netflix and Hulu to this device and they work without issues except for the occasional buffering issues. Between those two apps and having Amazon Prime membership, my TV/Movie needs a pretty much covered.Offers on the lock screen: Some people complain about having to pay to remove this feature. I've actually enjoyed some of the offers and taken advantage of them. When you turn on your device it's there for half second, I couldn't care less enough about this to pay to have it removed. It's a non-issue in my book.HDMI: One of the reasons I chose the Kindle fire HD was for the ability to watch videos/movies off my kindle onto my TV. I ordered this HDMI cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004286VMW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1). Sometimes depending on the video image may not be as crisp, but that's okay.Amazon Customer Service: The one time I had technical issue early on with my device, I called and they walked me through some steps and my Kindle was back online. The fact that you can speak to live human being anytime of the day, is simply awesome. I find the representatives knowledgeable, friendly and beyond helpful. Amazon Customer Service ROCKS!CONs:Silk Browser:  okay I will admit that it kinda sucks at times and I've had to have it restart on many occasions. It's annoying. So I side loaded the Dolphin browser, which is better, but frankly I've had numerous restart with that as well. Whatever.The Fast Charger: Okay the USB plug that comes with the device isn't sufficient to fully charge the Kindle, so you really have to end up buying the fast charger.  $20 bucks yeah that sucks but you need it for this this thing. I was able to get $10 credited back to me by calling customer service. Not only that I charge my cell phone with it to. #scoreVolume & off buttons: I'll admit because they are so flush against the device (and so close together) it can be a little annoying. I don't use the Volume on the device, I simply access this feature through the drop screen. I also have a cover that turns the device on and off so I avoid using the actual buttons. But if this can be addressed in future updates, that would be great.Spending Money: Okay that's not Amazon's nor Kindle's fault. Because of the obvious tie in and by signing up for Amazon Prime, I think I've ordered something at least every single week, since I've had this baby. Shopping is beyond easy. Browse, click, purchase. It's almost too easy. *shakes fist at Amazon*So needless to say, I'm a very pleased with my Kindle Fire HD.

Yes, there are some better-executed pieces of hardware out there, but not at this price.  It does what it is intended to do, and I love to see a company put attention to just getting the job done rather than filling it up with all kinds of unnecessary features.The software, on the other hand, needs some serious attention in 3 areas:1) Compatibility with Google Play.  Admittedly, this would require Android certification, which I understand could impact the price.  But I would pay a couple dollars more for more freedom with apps.  Either that, or improve the offerings on the Amazon store and make sure they work flawlessly.2) Stability.  The first weekend I played with the device, I got it to crash (not just an app, but the tablet) several times.  All while just doing normal things like shopping or web-browsing.  It occasionally \"hangs\" with no indication of what it is waiting on.  The web experience isn't quite as blazing fast as we are led to believe.3) Usability.  Amazon has done a great job integrating their shopping experience with the tablet.  It is clear that this is what got the majority of their attention--and why not, as Amazon is all about shopping?  However, Amazon is also all about books, and KINDLE is all about reading.  I *expect* a nice way to organize my reading material, but there is none.  Zilch, Nada, Nothing.  You get the carousel, which is kind of cool at first, then just annoying.  It commits what I consider the principal mortal sin of a UI: it gets in the user's way.To summarize:  For the price, it's really hard to do better.  But if you want a Kindle to be a KINDLE (focused on reading) rather than a shopping tool, maybe just stick with the lower-end pure Kindle readers.  If Amazon will make organization easy and make the carousel optional, then we might have something really amazing here.  There is no reason the hardware can't do it.

I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it. I already had a Kindle Touch which I love, and and Kindle 2nd Gen and couldn't imagine what use I would get out of a gadget that streamed movies and played games. That is what my laptop is for! I bought it in April and I fully expected to keep it a few days and send it back.I was very wrong. I'm in love with this thing. The Kindle Fire HD is one of the best things I've ever purchased. Movies are gorgeous and the sound is really good for something this small! Games look great and are fast. The web browser is fast. Reading books on it is not as comfortable as on my Touch but it's definitely okay. Being able to change the brightness and contrast helps. Reading out-doors not so great, but that's to be expected with a shiny screen. It's also very easy to figure out right out of the box. The pull-down menus are pretty easy to figure out as are the settings and how to change them. The ads are completely non-intrusive and only appear on the sleep screen. I appreciate the \"Offers\" tab so I can check out the specials. I LOVE the \"customers also bought\" feed at the bottom of the screen. I thought I would hate it and turned it off at one point but I turned it back on.I should say that I'm still exploring the capabilities of the Kindle Fire HD and finding out what it can do. I don't use it for photos or documents. I don't Skype on it or use it for e-mail or Facebook yet, so I can't comment on how it works for those things. I'm perfectly happy with it as a device to watch movies, play games, shop at Amazon and read on at this point. The battery drains pretty fast when I'm streaming videos but otherwise really lasts, even when I forget and leave the wireless on!I have zero complaints about the Fire HD. I can't put it down.Edit: Not a complaint so much as an observation. I downloaded a game a couple of days ago, (Jewel Legends:Tree of Life)and noticed that the Kindle heated up quite a lot when I played it. The longer I played the warmer it got.

But web surfing was only acceptable after 18 months. Some of the sites are very slow to load. I was on the fence between Fire HD 7 and Galaxy Tab 2 7 with the choice went to Fire HD. The main reason for me was HDMI although I would also like micro SD support.Web surfing is better but still no comparison to my desktop.The screen is significantly better than the original Fire. Colors are more accurate and the dynamic range is much much larger. Pictures are now more natural looking with a gradual transition from dark to bright, much closer to my calibrated monitor.I am not bothered by the ads, actually not sure where the ads are. No access to Google play is not a big deal for me. I only have a few apps loaded and that's all I need.Finally, I decided to stay with 7\" size. I just can't see to need to use a 10\" tablet. 7\" is just about right for carrying around and big enough to properly display everything I need.

This happened for a little bit when first bought but after a while it did not happen any more.  The screen plays in HD and is fantastic.  The sound on the Kindle is amazing.  I was sitting on my patio watching a movie.  I KEPT pausing the movie because I KEPT hearing something behind me.  About the fourth time I paused the movie, I realized the sound was coming from the movie on the Kindle.  Surround sound?  Not sure but WAS shocked then delighted by the quality of sound!

Both suffer the same issue of terrible battery life.  On a full charge they last about a quarter of the time my ipad will last on a full charge which quite frankly is pretty poor.  Also, I had to have the first on replaced as the original one I received had defective sound right out of the box.  Another issue I have with these Kindles is the OS.  The way everything is laid out is not intuitive and straightforward as Apples OS.  It's better than the ipad in the fact that you can view the contents of the Kindle Fire HD in windows explorer on your computer, something you cannot do with the Apple OS.  However, I hate the fact that when putting ebooks on the Kindle you have to reformat it into Amazon's specific format for it to show up properly on the Kindle.  That can be very annoying and time consuming when you have a lot of books.  Lastly, I have gone through MANY chargers.  The Kindle is VERY picky with what will work to charge it.  It's total crap that it doesn't come with a charger, HUGE negative there, and when I forked out the money to buy the Kindle fire chargers, 2 of them would not charge it!  I am forced to use my IPAD's charger!!!  crazy.

I don't get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I've had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother's tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7\" is just perfect for me. It's light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it's fresh on my mind, and I'm reviewing everything I read.I didn't realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I've always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I've even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what's on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn't last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn't take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I've been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can't hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading.

It has really great computing time, it is smooth and the pictures are insanely high quality, just as advertised. However, this device is probably the most troublesome device I've ever owned and I will explain why.The ads: Now normally, I really don't care about the ads myself, they are more of a minor annoyance than anything at best, but when you start putting advertisements for your books and charge a $15 just to get rid of them, that's going too far.  Yes I've heard all the arguments for the ads, \"Oh it's not that big of a deal!\" Or \"It isn't like you see them that much.\" both of which are wrong.  It is true that the ads are not big of a deal, but the fact that you pay upwards of $170 for one of these only to be a walking consumer who's only purpose is to spend more money, that's basically a slap in the face.  As for the \"You don't see them that often\", you are constantly bombarded at the bottom of your screen with a \"Customers also bought!\" sort menu.Now while the advertisements are the minor part, I'll move onto the some other issues, because not everyone dislikes ads as much as I do.As for things like basic features, you're not allowed any customization for your kindle, you cannot change any aspect of it.  In addition to this, you're forced to use apps that have been submitted through their App store (That is to say, you cannot use Google play on your kindle unless you go through special measures, which in itself is ridiculous) As for the search engine that you use, the default search engine is Bing.  I mean come on, the top most searched item on Bing was \"Google\" for upwards of 28 months straight.You know, I hate bashing products, but for $200 you can get a much better product.

The space of 16GB is more than enough for my books and documents, as well as music and streaming online video. I think I personally would have been better off with a slightly bigger capacity model, but I really don't notice it as much as I thought I would. The product is very well designed in many ways and performs extraordinarily well. I was afraid the processor would be too slow, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was more than enough. The only two things that are mild downsides to the product are [1] the lack of access to the Google Play store and apps (I've managed to install Google Maps anyway, so no harm done, ultimately) and [2] some of the inconveniences with the automatic Sync when wireless turns on.The first is less inconvenient than I thought, as Amazon has many good apps of its own (many of which are the same as Google Play or overlap). The only real problem is lack of certain Google apps, like Maps, but which you can find ways to work around. I would appreciate a partnership to share apps between the stores, but it probably won't happen. The second problem is merely annoying. When you turn wireless on, the Kindle automatically syncs with Amazon, which can cause slow response time for 10-20 seconds. When a software update is being downloaded, it doesn't let you know that this is occurring but this slow response time becomes more noticeable for a longer period. It would be nice if one could pause or otherwise be informed of what the Kindle is doing during this. It can be easily remedied by going to Amazon's Kindle support page and downloading the update to manually install it on the Kindle.I would suggest to Amazon that their new software update include a feature to see the progress of and pause the download of these updates, rather than have them occur surreptitiously in the background, as well as to be able to disable these automatic Syncs.ADDENDUM - Just as an aside, I found that I had a dead pixel on my first purchase back when this model was released. It really wasn't a big deal, but I called Amazon and was immediately shipped overnight a brand new model. That's a new standard for customer service quality. And that's part of the benefits of buying this product from Amazon - the company is trying head-over-heels to be helpful.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ammending my previous review of 1 star to 3 stars", "Author": "L.

I received my kindle fire HD yesterday and have been on the phone with tech support twice and read hours and hours worth of forums trying to get it to sync with these features.  Tech support just told me that apparently as of April 1st, Google has changed their settings so that this is no longer an option.  This is incredibly frustrating, as this was a feature that was advertised as possible when I bought the kindle fire HD and was the main reason I went with this device.  I am going to return it today.  Huge bummer.New 3-star review: after three hours working with various tech support people and finally being transferred to the developer, the nice gentleman I spoke with was able to get my kindle synched with my gmail, contacts, and calendar despite all three previous tech people I spoke with saying this is impossible.  Now my kindle works great and I'm happy.  It's easy to use, looks nice, and does the trick at a fraction of the cost of an ipad.  Why only increase my review to three stars? a) one of the reasons it wasn't synching was because my brand new kindle was shipped with software that is three versions old according to the developer I spoke with (he was equally perplexed as to why new kindles are being shipped with very outdated software). They should ensure that their products are up-to-date so we're not wasting our valuable time getting our new product up to speed.  b) the bigger, better kindle fire HD lost some of the features I liked on the kindle reader.  For example, when reading a spanish novel on my kindle reader I was able to hover over a spanish word and link it to a spanish-english dictionary.  This is not an option on the new kindle fire (double-checked with tech support) and spanish words can only be linked with a standard spanish dictionary (no english translation).  Seems weird that the more expensive version doesn't have a simple feature that the kindle reader has.  c) The ever-present ads on the home screen are very in-your-face.

I have other apps on my phone that I use dailey and wanted to have them on something bigger so its easier to work with when I need the info in those apps....nope cant get those from the google app store....kindle dosn't support any google apps....strike 2. At this point I'm frustrated but I still like my Kindle fire HD. What really tossed me over the top was that I'm a model aviation flier and I seen 3 apps in THE KINDLE APP STORE regarding model aviation. So....I downloaded all 3 apps and tried to used them....Upon opening them I found out I have to have a Pocketmags account. So I tried to subscribe and it couldn't be done through the kindle fire...so then I went online and looked it up and had no luck .So I went on the amazon site and searched for pocketmags to see if I can subscribe though there to use the apps since I got in through the kindle store and it says that ITS NOT COMPATABLE WITH THE KINDLE FIRE HD 7\". So I called up and the fellow I spoke to said there not supposed to be in the store and they are not gonna work cause they don't deal with pocketmags.Well....I'm frustrated enough to write this review and Im seriously thinking about returning the fire and getting a Samsung Tab2. Unless your only gonna read,watch movies YOU download or give it to your kids to plays games on,I seriously dont think it all that. Is it bad ...no...is it really worth the $200 for the 7\" and the 300 for the 8.9...well...if your gonna read ALOT watch movies ALOT and play games..then yes...If you need the internet and you need to do personal things and want to do your reading and use it as a reference device sometimes, then definatly not.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "My overheating Kindle Fire HD 7\"", "Author": "dannetta clayton", "ReviewID": "R1FSD0GP1A1E1B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The first 4 months I had the Kindle Fire HD I loved it.

Jones \"sjones301\"", "ReviewID": "R2TXBQFGMJFMHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love the Kindle Fire HD.  I am not a big apple fan so wasn't interested in an ipad, had considered a google tablet but read mixed reviews on some aspects of it, so I decided on the Kindle Fire HD. I did have some concerns.  I had tried one out at a kiosk at a mall around Christmas time and it seemed clunky (slow, screen freezing) and some of the reviews are negative with comments on charging issues and inability to connect via Wifi.  Still, I took a risk knowing I could return it thru amazon.Delievery is perfect when ordered thru amazon, it is already setup for you on your amazon account.  Email, facebook, twitter apps all easy to setup and default to your login's so you just tap the icon and you are in your account.  Netflix App - works great.  A coworker and I were on a business trip, he with his ipad, me with my kindle. I watched several netflix movies over the hotels Wifi (some freezeups as it streamed but nothing beyond minor annoyance).  His ipad couldn't stream anything at all.  We were in adjacent rooms so we should have been nearly the same distance from the wireless router.I've also downloaded a number of movies via Amazon and they play back great. First one I downloaded the HD version and it looked great, but true HD costs $1 more.  Next movies I downloaded were SD movies and they looked just as good.  I also like that I can connect an HDMI cable from the kindle to my TV.  I do this in hotel rooms on business travel - super cool.  On airplanes the small screen is just fine and the sound thru headphones is great. SD movies also download a lot faster. HD took about 8 hours, SD took about an hour.  Just plan ahead of course.I find web surfing to be sufficient on the silk browser. If you try to tap links too quickly before the page fully loads it might lock up and have to be restarted. Don't know if this is the fault of the browser or the kindle. The biggest hurdle is the smaller screen but zooming in is intuitive and fast.the only true negative I would say is I'm not thrilled with Amazon prime's options of free movies. I didn't realize at first you could only stream them, not download and watch later.  And their selections are not much different, certainly not any better, than Netflix.  I will likely cancel amazon prime.  What IS the differentiator over Netflix is the options for downloading just released movies that were recently in the theater. You can get those without amazon prime.  Trust me, I really wanted to appreciate amazon prime but if you have a Netflix account it is not much different (well, the free two day shipping I suppose but I rarely need something that bad - not worth $80 a year).I will agree that lack of any written directions is odd and although I consider myself tech savy, accessing some things was not obvious. I did figure it out via reading posts online. Others have complained about the power button and volume tabs being flush with the device so they are hard to find.  Trust me, get a cover/case for the kindle and most of them have touch points that make it pretty obvious where the buttons are.  I'd think even without a case you eventually learn. I found it frustrating at first too and after 5 weeks the buttons are a breeze to find.I think a front and rear facing camera would be an improvement, but I have taken a lof of pics with the camera pointed forward, just have to know where the button is to take the pic on the screen.  It can be awkward but do-able. I post a lot more pics on facebook now!I would highly recommend this product.

With all of these \"toys,\" why would I buy a Kindle Fire HD 7?  I was looking for a real personal computing device.  The criteria was 1) something small enough for my purse; 2) very easily readable, bright screen; 3) easy connectivity to personal and corporate email/contacts/calendar; 4) something on which to keep my favorite photos; 5) something that would allow me to download selected iTune music library and podcasts; and, 6)easy navigation and an intuitive, touch-screen interface.  Finally, cost was a factor.  I was looking for a good value.So what I have learned in my five-days of Kindle HD7 ownership?  First, it is hands down my favorite \"tech toy\" and I am very impressed.  My iPhone5 has a nice look and feel, but it is not a pleasure to use.  For someone of my age (63), the screen is too small to be comfortable to read, and I dislike the lack of the easy navigation of an Android device.  On the Kindle Fire, I was able to quickly set-up my email accounts, both personal and corporate.  I use the Amazon Cloud for personal and business storage and all of my documents were immediately accessible.  I was able to find a reasonable selection of apps.  I was able to convert my music from iTunes to MP3 and store them on my Kindle Fire.  I also was able to transfer my favorite photos. Connecting to Netflix was straight forward and the stream rate excellent.  The Kindle navigation is easy and intuitive.  The Kindle Reader is particularly good and you can adjust not only the size of the font, but the actual font type.  I paid the $15 and had the ads on the lock screen removed, which for me was a good investment.  When on WIFI, the transfer rate is incredibly good.  The music quality is also decent.  I purchased a compact case and it fits easily in my purse.  When I have been in doubt about how to do something, I easily found good instructions on the web.Now, the downside (and there is always one).  The Amazon Store for apps is limited when compared to the big-brothers (iTunes and Android).  I was pleased that most of the apps I use frequently were there, but had so few downloads that the ratings were meaningless.  I also found some slick apps after looking up reviews on the web. The other negative, is that many of the apps are not free.  Beyond buying the Office Suite, I have never had to purchase apps, but for the Kindle, I am having to pay for things that should be free. This will probably get better.Another annoyance is the carousel - now there may be workarounds of which I am not aware, but out of the box, this is the experience. If you listen to a song, access a book from your library, or use an app, it is added to the carousel.  If you want to remove it, you have to do so manually and individually.  The size of the carousel images on the 7\" screen mean that only 4 images are displayed, so there is a lot of wasted swipes to get to something.  The workaround for me was to add my most used apps to the favorites and by-pass the carousel all together.  My recommendation to Amazon (and this could be done during an software upgrade) is to provide an option to adjust the size of the carousel images (large, med, and small) and also provide an option of selecting which type of applications or files are automatically displayed.  I would also like to see the option of just having a \"tile screen\" like you have on a smart phone or Windows 8.The final caution about the Kindle Fire HD, especially when run on a home network is the ease in which you can shop on Amazon.  Amazon is one of my favorite companies and I have purchased a variety of products over the years.  I am not someone who typically just browses for retail products.  However, with the Kindle Fire, it is easy to go from watching a video, looking at the news, reading a book, to shopping.  With 1-click and Prime (free for 1 month) you could easily be the proud owner of stuff you really didn't want and can ill afford.At the end of the day, another reviewer said \"you get what you pay for.\"  For me, I believe that this will prove to be a good investment.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD", "Author": "henry", "ReviewID": "R3P23NGO62L0QK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I enjoy my KINDLE HD!!

A typical volume of manga is about $6 (if you're not reading them illegally on the internet of course). A volume purchased on the VizMedia Manga Reader* app is $5. Between Naruto, One Piece and Bleach, this device easily pays for itself. Also, as nice as it might be to have an actual paper volume, those things take up a lot of space on your bookshelves.Most importantly, the HD is gorgeous. I have never seen manga look so beautiful. Just the cover of One Piece (which is not the most artful manga imho) looked like an exquisite work of art. I just got my Fire yesterday so I haven't gotten to read Ao no Exorcist, Tegami Bacchi or other art-heavy manga yet.Essentially, ink can only be so sharp on paper, but with the HD the image is clearer than it would ever be in print. Also, colors fade from paper but these colors will stay sharp no matter how many times you read the volumes. Also, the zoom maintains crispness so you can appreciate those little details in Zoro's Rengoku Oni Giri, Itachi's Susano'o or Byakuya's Bankai.I know some people only read manga for story, but for me it's both about the art and the story so having such beautiful images really makes this baby take the cake.Also, the wifi is super fast so you can read the chapters easily when they first come out (rather than waiting the day or two for the Jump release) although I never find the images on internet manga readers to be as crisp as on the Viz app, especially when you zoom in.Bottom line, if you read manga every day (like myself), get this product. Oh, and there's also a CrunchyRoll & Hulu+ app for anime although I haven't watched anything on it yet.*This was actually slightly a pain in the butt to download. Basically, you need to search for it in the App Store under \"Viz.\" However since this is probably more of a problem with the app store rather than the device, I won't know off a star. If you're a Shounen Jump fan, you're going to want this since you can subscribe to Jump which does a simultaneous release with Japan. Also, like I mentioned already, you can buy volumes for a less than paper.

The graphics are terrific, the sound for something so small is unbelieveable, reading with the adjustable font is a breeze and if I get tired of reading it can read to me. There are many apps to choose from and it will take sometime to read through all of them. One problem I had was though was going to pages and finding some had all the graphics and others had nothing but text. I studied its settings for quite a while, gave up and called support. It seems that new version of Kindle you must go into the Silk brower menu, scroll down to advanced settings and make sure all the boxes have an orange check mark in them. Once you have made that adjustment everything works fine. I am adding that in case anyone else is experiencing that particular problem. That is easily resolved. Also another very minor issue was the virtual keyboard. It is very sensitive and it took me awhile to get that straight so I wasn't always hitting the wrong letters. That was just a matter of getting use to it. I found buying a case for the Kindle to be challenging. I found, for myself, the case that has grooves to hold up the screen to be a much better choice than those that just fold back and keep sliding flat. The cases are all pricey so I would definitely recommend the ones with the grooves. I find myself using this device more than my laptop.

I didn't want to pay the IPAD price, however. I travel a few times a year, so for the convenience factor I wanted something bigger than my smart phone, but smaller than a laptop that I could have books, games and magazines on for those cross-country flights. I was eying the Kindle Fire when it came out, but never pulled the trigger.  I'm glad I didn't, because now there's the HD version.I was a little leery of a 7 inch tablet, but I can say without a doubt, I love the size.  It fits in my purse so it ranks high in the portability factor.  Part of my hesitation of buying something smaller was I didn't want to have to fiddle with the screen to enlarge the size.  Not to worry:  my email display on the Kindle is LARGER than the IPAD and the keypad is very easy to use.  Internet is fast and easy too.  Video?  One word:  gorgeous.I also do not need a lot of storage as I do not need every newfangled thing which comes on the market.  I have downloaded a few game apps, about a dozen or so \"other apps,\" a handful of pictures, some music and about 5 or so books and barely put a dent in the storage space.  (My so called smart phone would have been \"full\" at the first app I downloaded.)  I also did not know how I would like reading books on a devise.  Well, I made a small adjustment--I switched the background from white to sepia.  Made a huge difference and I can read in the dark without the need of a book light.  And the size of the devise feels like the actual size of a book.Battery life?  For the amount I use it, (quite a bit on the weekend and from time to time to quickly look up something during the week) I only need to charge it once a week.  (I think the Specs say the battery life is about 11 hours, so it's fairly accurate.)  The only drawback is it takes several hours to charge.  Once I bought the PowerFast adapter(?) and got into the habit of charging it overnight, it was not a problem.I was hesitant to get on the tablet resolution, but now I am sold. I didn't want to pay the price for an IPAD (or the Mini) and I am so glad I didn't.  I actually prefer this over the IPAD. I am seriously considering getting rid of my data plan for my smart phone because I barely use it any more.  (I just have to get over my \"what if I need to look up something when I am not near WiFi\" bit.) I also think this may be something my 75 year old father, who won't touch a computer, would be able to use much more confidently.  I am also a frequent Amazon customer, so it is effortless to manage the devise through the website.So, if you don't need or want all the bells and whistles of an IPAD, this is a great, easy to use alternative--at a much better price.  Another added bonus:  if you have a Discover Card, you can use your cash back bonus when ordering on Amazon as well.  I was able to get it at an ever better price because of it.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "lisa \"lisa\"", "ReviewID": "R25JMZMSJPW30A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my Kindle Fire!

After reading multiple reviews and comparison charts, in my mind I had viewed the Kindle as my least favorite. I had read the CONS associated with the Kindle (the lack of apps, the \"ads\", a front facing camera only, lack of maps/GPS apps, and a slightly inferior processing speed), and was instantly turned away from the idea of Kindle... until I tested it out firsthand.I went to a couple different electronic shops and started with the Google Nexus 7, which was my first choice based on what I'd read. Although the GPS features and processing power might've been \"better\", I found the interface to be completely confusing and counter-intuitive. I quite frankly didn't like the feel of it, and the screen seemed smaller and cramped.Despite being an Apple user, I just didn't like the iPad mini either, especially for the price.Finally, I decided to go ahead and check out the Kindle. I loved it right off the bat! Just as many of the user reports have said, if you're looking for a tablet for videos, reading, and general web surfing, this is the tablet for you! I was able to find ALL of the apps that I'd ever want for it, and didn't have any problems with the \"ads\", which are mostly thoughtful suggestions about other apps, books, and videos that may interest me based off my collections. The processing speed is incredibly fast, and the book and video quality is crisp. You can tell that Kindle focused on keeping the viewers & readers happy, and it most definitely paid off.In addition, I genuinely enjoy the Amazon ecosystem. I can access all my books, movies, and songs from any device, be it my phone, tablet, or computer, and love the added bonuses of Amazon Prime's free videos and book borrowing. I was pleasantly surprised to see the few forgotten amazon songs that I'd purchased on my phone months ago appear instantly on my Kindle Fire HD. Free Cloud support is as good as it gets!On top of that, I had an initial issue with my Kindle synching to my German Amazon account (instead of my American account). Within 2 minutes, I was on the phone with a Kindle Support Technician who walked me through the process of resolving the issue. I couldn't have been more impressed.All in all- make sure to personally test and play around with all the tablets. Despite specs and reviews, you have your own unique needs and preferences, so make sure to invest the time to take a look for yourself. I'm extremely glad that I did!---GENERAL NOTES:APPS: I've become more and more impressed with the availability of apps on the Kindle. Maybe my expectations were low to begin with, but since opening it from the box (Feb 2013), I've had access to everything I'd wanted, including- Twitter, Skype, EverNote, Flixster, Netflix, Bodybuilding.com, MyFitnessPal, Spotify, Pandora, and all the latest popular games like Ruzzle, Temple Run 2, and Minecraft.SCREEN: My husband is a movie / tech buff, and was the first to comment on how clear the quality of video was, even when streaming from Amazon's Cloud or Netflix. I personally found the size and quality superior to the Google Nexus 7, which was slightly cramped, especially when viewing videos from the internet browser.SPEAKERS: I'm an apple fan, but I'm constantly complaining about the speakers on Apple products, even on my Macbook Pro. The Kindle Fire HD speakers are located on either side of the tablet (when horizontal), and will knock your socks off! I was extremely impressed with both the quality and volume capacity, which was an unexpected bonus.\"ADVERTISEMENTS\": There has been a lot of debate regarding the ads on the kindle, but to be honest, I've found some great apps, books, and movies as a result. To me, it's seemed no different than Netflix recommending other movies based on your interests, and I've grown to like and appreciate the ads as a result. Funny though, because I initially thought this would be a show stopper for me, since I'm extremely anti-advertisements.USER INTERFACE: Although initially I felt the interface to be lacking that \"open\" feel of an operating system, I've become extremely fond of the simplicity in navigating across media selections, web browsing, storage, and settings. The carousel customizing is as effortless and as intuitive as an Apple product, and is always a welcomed sight upon logging in. This was probably one of the biggest deterrents for choosing the Google Nexus 7, which confused me to no end, despite having owned an Android phone in the past. Amazon has done an incredible job at keeping its tablet simple with a high quality, no-lag interface.PROCESSING: I'm notorious for opening multiple tabs and multi-tasking across games and videos (yeah I know- ADD much?), and have been EXTREMELY impressed with the Kindle's ability to not only keep up, but perform without lag. Of course it's still early on in my ownership, but I'll re-visit this review after I've had a chance to load it up with additional apps and media.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: Amazon is second to none. They put their customers first, and I've read about it time and time again. When I first registered my Kindle, I had mistakenly registered it with my German Amazon account. When I logged in, my entire Kindle was in German. Within two minutes, I was on the phone with a technician who was able to resolve the problem. There was no wait, and they even followed up to make sure my issue was resolved. I couldn't have been happier, and have nothing but confidence in their priorities towards me as the customer.OVERALL: Phenomenal tablet, especially for the price, and truly unbeatable customer service!", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "clifford r artis iv", "ReviewID": "R2HMZU6FNMCZIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this simple, for a $200 tablet, it's probably the best deal out there, sound and picture are great, quality and durability seem second to none, only negative is that the apps are slightly limited, since you pretty much stuck with Amazon App store. well sort of", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A one in all device", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R1QBZ56IDBZB7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was surprised by the many things it could do.

It does much of what I need it to, however my main complaint about it is that you lack access to the google store withou \"rooting\" the device.  This is a significant drawback to me as I do not want to \"root\" the device and potentially break it but I really want to be able to use the device to its full potential which means having access to more apps than in the limited amazon catalogue.  Yes, I realize I should have gotten the Nexus 7.With this said, the Fire has benefits that the Nexus 7 does not.  Having played with my neices Nexus 7 I find the picture quality on the Fire HD is superior, plus you can't beat the ability to plug the Fire HD into a high def television and watch its content on the television.Overall, it is a amazon content delivery system.  I find I spend more money in the amazon store than ever before, but I do not necessarily find this as a negative.  I generally enjoy what I am paying for and amazon makes it very easy to buy digital and non-digital content through the device and they do so usually much cheaper than brick and mortar stores or other alternatives.  As long as the price point is good, I think I will have no problem with this at all.So in short:  Negative - No access to the google play store, no rear facing camera (just the front facing camera)  Plus - Most everything else", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 7\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB", "Author": "momofgus \"rhodasmom\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q0Z561V34QUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this Kindle.

The ads don't \"pop-up\" and are hosted in the menu section or as a sort of screen saver.  Are they worth removing?  I don't think so, they don't really bother anything.  Is it easy to use?  YES! you can download movies/tv/music, if your a prime member you can stream tons of movies/tv for free over your wifi.  I did notice if you have a slower connection or poor contection it does stop a lot also there was some \"buffering\" but a lot less then on my computer.  The picture quality from amazon movies is great.  The sound is excellent, surround sound quality, which makes up for the occasional buffering.  Books are easy to download and read just like on any kindle and the app store has several great apps and games many for free.  I did note download times where much slower then I expected but not too bad.  The Carousel feature, to me is annoying.  If you use any app, go on a webpage, or read a book it automatically gets put into the carousel screen for easy access.  This feature, to me, makes everything seem jumbled and I really wish it wasn't there.  I also wish they would make a deal with apple so that you could get your itunes music or movies but that will probibly never happen.  As far as cost, I feel it is the best price on the market for what's as close to an ipad as you can get without having to pay 3x more for an ipad.  The kids love the games, I love Amazon.com, TV shows, and kindle.  What I don't like, is it doesn't have as much battery power as I'd like it to have lasts only about 3-5 hours, no data without wifi, and doesn't power off when charging.  It does not come an acutual power cable to plug in to charge it only a USB cable so you have to either buy an adaptor or hook it up to a device (like a computer) to charge.

Everything was good with that until my toddler jumped on the bed landing on top, softly, but hard enough to crack the screen.

And was staring at the homepage and realize, $199  for a good tablet that you know is going to be good quality, (I've heard excellent things from my friends) really wasn't too much when I think that my tablet (which by the way was a gift) was over $250. Without much more thought I placed my order and planned on keeping it a secret until it arrived.Now, normally I can keep surprises just that, a surprise. But after each minute I was getting more and more excited. I ended up waking him up from his nap 10 minutes later saying \"You're gonna love me forever!\" ;-) Knowing he already would, he replied with \"And? What else is new?\"After I explained what I had done he was still waking up and was just like \"Yeah, uhuh, okay, cool, thanks\" just like a man. ;-) An hour later however, he asked, can you pull that up again and let me look at it? HAha, he stocked Amazon checking out the features every day waiting for it to arrive. Those two days passed so slowly!!Needless to say, he loves it!

I know crazy but this was going to be our anniversary/Santa presents and intended long term to cut down on all the books we have laying all over the house.  The value of the donations have become less and less.  I also had to look at impact for budget.  For some reason the the 3G was slowed down and not delivered, so quickly eliminated the paperwhite and next went on to the the regular Fire.  I liked it, there were a few issues that did not excite me.  So I figured I would give that one to hubby ---he kept saying all he wanted to do is read books.  Next I turned on the HD, pulled down some free books and games and did test drives.  I loved this little gizzmo.  It was the answer since I could not afford the IPad or Sony Tablet at prices being sold on Black Friday or afterwards.  So on Anniversary offered the two units to show hubby.  I had already sent the paperwhite back.  The 3 g had been received that day but did not look at.He liked the Fire, but when he saw the clarity of the Fire HD he was hooked.  So I called Customer service and explained I wanted to upgrade ---no problem.  I sent the Fire back and we had two Fire HDs in 2 days.  The only problems we have is with we the users.  To save money we shopped Half Price Books, a Ministry Book Store and others and bought used books to read. So for $1.50 to $2.50 we have been reading most of the recently released books --at least a year fresh from original release.  Amazon has advertised that it had all these great books under 3.99.  To us that is not true.  There are a lot of bodice rippers and low end mystery thrillers written by authors unknown all using method or template writing.  Yes we can find the great romances and literature where the copyright has expired, and are reading some of those again.Also what we have discovered is that the price of e-books of the current novels available in paperback ---Walmart offers them $2.00 cheaper and if I go to Costco, I might even save more.  So what is a great idea of being able to purchase books in the middle of the night and those books being of authors we love and we would save money ----is not so.The Kindle HD is great but it is a ripoff with the cost of the books versus your local market.  At this point I am thinking I should have waited and bought us both wifi tablets with an extra keyboard and a reader application.  I do want the mobility, I want the apps for recipes and shopping and such....so am asking myself was this such a wise move.  A small pc is onsale for only 30.00 more than what I paid for the kindle.  I know the tablets are higher.Learning how to use the Kindle HD was confusing because we could not find the instructions, two of the guides we downloaded were useless (I am a business and technical writer, have had experience with such documentation)---so many of those guidebooks suck real bad.  Because I have been on disability--I have been out of tech world since 2007, so we have been experimenting and guessing how to bring up specific menus and such.  And no we don't plan to watch movies or such on it --we have direct TV and we don't travel.It is a great product. Great quality.  I think it is much better than many of the current ereaders out there.  The catch is the price of the books---crazy as it seems paper from local stores is cheaper than the ebooks.  Totally crazy.Update: PS we bought both Fire HD units at Amazon. Hubby wanted me to emphasize that his ereader he really really loves it.  This man always has a book in his hand literally.  Now the challenge is keeping new reasonably priced books in cloud for him and I to read.  I am already 4 books behind him.  I am trying to look for books $5.00 and under.  Some came out this week.  And there were some sales and price drops on a book we have been waiting to read for quite some time.  So we had some electronic book price saves last night.  Including a special diet recipe book I was interested in.  Hey Amazon, I wish there was some way to say (at least for some books) that we were finished and would like to sell back at a price of 1-5 dollars (depending on original prices).  We don't need the digital clutter again and in reality you can't tell it is \"used\" and can sell it again.  Just a thought.  Hubby does like the mobility of carrying his ereader in its little case along with his business pouch.  He reads at lunch or while waiting for someone...and at home it is in his hand from time he rises til the time he falls asleep.  No it does not go in the shower.  And I have taken it from his hand when sleeping so he won't drop on floor.  at 74 he is still working.  But he has said his dream is to retire and just beable to have book after book to read and a small herb and salad garden to tend.  I have already loaded some books that were free on subjects of gardening.Note to Prime Product manager.  The free offer made with much celebration that you can check out one book a month to read---I personally think that is insulting.  There are books we want to read and keep and many read and release.  Wish the offer could be expanded for such avid readers.  For example he just finished the first series by Julien May each costing 9.99 (that was part of santa present).  Now we want the next groups that range in price from 6.99 to 11.99.  A total of 9 books.  So could quickly reach a $100 dollars to read.  Here is the problem.  You are offering the edigital version of Sorcerer's moon as Hard Copy at 2.99 and the eversion at 7.99.  If I have prime....my shipping may be zero ---so here you make it more advantagous to buy a hardback even though you have a great piece of equipment to read a digital book!!  If I want them used, I can get some of the volumes for as low as .01 or 04 cents.I briefly read yesterday that there has been some type of settlement related to price fixing of book prices and now publishers and sellers must follow formulas or such.  The article tride to explain it but just made me more confused.  For now I guess we will be buying both hardback and digital.  That is okay when doing my medical and genetic research I like writing and marking in the books and most of them are not available in digital formats.  Usually I can find several scientific papers that cover the subject to use as source documents.Thanks I just wanted to put in examples about the pricing issues we face.  Other than that we love your Fire HDs.I have used the web surfing and we may branch out.using our own wifi in house.  I may just save up for a tablet that I can use to document research as I read in other places than office.  Then can load into the megabrain in the office.We do love your product.  One other change ----we recommend that a link be available that when first turned on the link to the user's guide be a popup.  This would have saved us hours and hours of frustration during this first month.  Since we just found it, will read.  Maybe we will use more functions.

You definitely can install non-Amazon apps, but it involves changing some settings (and obviously introduces some risk, since Amazon doesn't review non-Amazon apps for malware or the like).  This is somewhat mitigated by Amazon's free-app-of-the-day.  Some have been mediocre, some have been great, but either way it's a good way to try some things out and expand your app library.Verdict:I think the Kindle Fire HD is going places - that is, the app store ecosystem is the biggest thing holding it back right now, and that's only going to get more robust as time goes on.

If you want an in depth comparison you can easily search the internet and there are quite a few very good reviews comparing these tablets head to head.  But the general gist, TLDR of most of these comparison reviews-Screen- Nook>Kindle>Nexus7>TabProcessing Power- Nexus7>Nook>Kindle>TabGeneral Recommendation- Get the Nexus7 if you want to do \"stuff\" on your tablet and want the latest and greatest android experience and get a kindle/nook if you are hooked on the amazon/bn ecosystem.Now onto my Kindle Fire HD 7 review...Why did I get the Kindle Fire HD 7 vs the other tablets in this price range?  Honestly, just for two reasons... the microHDMI combined with the very sharp, vibrant screen.  The Nexus 7 can do everything the Kindle Fire can do (a lot of things little bit better, a few things a little bit worse).  But the Nexus7 can't connect to televisions with HDMI (although there is a workaround involving either a special tv or the purchase of some more hardware).In general what can I do on a tablet that I can't do on my Android phone?  Pretty much nothing. I can watch movies, read books, read magazines, surf the web, skype, play games and text all from my phone, just like I can from any tablet including the Kindle. So if I can already do everything on my phone what separates a tablet from an Android phone? THE DISPLAY.  So not only is the Kindle display better than most tablets at this price range, but you also have the option of making the display as large and as sharp as the best television or monitor at your disposal.And with that thought process I decided to purchase the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7.  After a lot of use and a lot of tinkering, I found this machine to excel in many areas as well as have deficiencies in some.--Positives--Screen- advertised as \"the most advanced\" 7\" display, the Nook definitely outclasses the resolution of the Kindle, but the Kindle screen is still very sharp and 720p streaming and movie watching is a dream.  Text is bright and clear. Viewing angle is very good.  Glare is very good.MicroHDMI- I'm not sure if the Kindle HDMI outputs 1080p when hooked up to a 1080p capable TV since the screen on the Kindle only goes up to 720p, but 1080p movies look amazingly sharp when streamed from the Kindle, definitely a HD experience.  I have not been able to hook up the HDMI to a surround sound system to test if it streams surround sound, although I have heard that if you stream your movies from Netflix or Amazon, you only get stereo sound through the HDMI.Speakers- \"room-filling stereo sound\" is what Amazon advertises... I'd like to add in that it has to be a fairly small room.  But despite the borderline false advertisement, the speakers with Dolby audio are awesome.  Don't expect some kind entertainment center sound or even mediocre external pc speaker sound, but these are the best speakers I've heard on a tablet by far.  Great for when you are watching videos with someone or just want to listen to music without headphones.  The one negative about the speakers is the positioning.  The speakers are located right where most people would place their hands in landscape mode.  If you tend to have a death grip on the tablet then your hands will muffle the sound.Form Factor/Build Quality-  This thing is solid.  Feels like a quality piece of electronics with adequately thick bezels to place your thumbs without touching the screen.  This is especially important for two handed holding of the Kindle.  Kindle is comfortable to hold with one of my medium man hands although smaller hands might not deal well with one handed holding.  The tablet is not \"pocketable.\"UI- Heavily modded Android that cuts all the fat.  The Kindle UI successfully simplifies Kindle operation to let users easily do what a Kindle was made to do... read Amazon books, watch Amazon movies, use Amazon apps to search the web, read email, navigate social networks.  This UI is perfect for people that just want user friendliness and don't want to fuss with much else when they consume their media.WiFi- To be fair, I don't think my internet connection is even fast enough and my wireless router new enough to take full advantage of the Kindle wifi.  But even so, I have noticed that the range on the Kindle is very good, much better than any other wifi devices I own.Amazon Prime-  Very large content collection as well as features not found anywhere else such as x-ray for movies and books (sort of a running index of characters or actors as you read or watch), whispersync to sync whatever amazon content you are doing with all your other devices and immersive reading, which is pretty much the Kindle reading to you as it points out what words it is reading.  It isn't necessary to have Amazon Prime (it is very competitively priced, but still an extra expense), but the Kindle was designed to consume Amazon Prime content.--Negatives--Processing Power- With quad core processors being the processor of the present, dual core processors are looking a bit long in the tooth.  Kindle plays games well, runs apps well and multitasks well enough, but compared to the quad core competition the Kindle definitely is not zippy and definitely is not as future proof as other faster tablets.  But if all you are doing is reading or watching movies, how fast does a processor need to be?  A single core processor can read a book fine and the Kindle can handle HD movies without too much of a sweat.  So really unless high graphical gaming or a lot of multitasking is your main concern, the Kindle is fine.UI- simplicity for profit has a cost... and that cost is totally neutering Android.  The Kindle excels at selling Amazon products and ONLY Amazon products.  The Google Play store is locked out, almost all of the Google apps are locked out.  The UI is not customizable, you can't add widgets to the UI, a lot of popular apps are not available from Amazon and there are a lot of advertisements.  You can bypass most of this with a lot of tinkering, rooting, sideloading and work arounds, but as of the writing of this review you still cannot get the whole unfiltered Android experience even with these efforts... although you can get very, very close.Form Factor- while the form factor was a positive for handling, it is a negative for aesthetics.  The less bezel the prettier is the trend, and the Kindle looks positively retro in this respect.Keyboard- Just not good.  The touch keys are responsive, but the keyboard itself just isn't well optimized for the tablet form factor.  It wouldn't be a big deal if you could just go to the Amazon app store and install a new keyboard that suited your needs, but unfortunately that currently isn't possible.  For some reason Amazon wants you to use their keyboard and only their keyboard even if it ruins your text input experience.  The auto correct is also lack luster.Hardware Buttons- The power button and volume rocker look very nice on the Kindle.  They are the same color as the Kindle back and flush with the device.  But by looking good the buttons give up some ease of use.  It is difficult to feel out the buttons on the Kindle for use.  With a lot of use I have learned to gradually adjust, but still annoying at times.--Conclusion--For media consumption, I think this tablet is an obvious choice.  It is a JOY to watch movies/tv, read books/news/magazines, surf the web with this tablet.  If you want to play graphically intense games and want cutting edge Android features, then this Kindle might not be the choice for you.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Totally Enjoy", "Author": "2dogmom", "ReviewID": "R35UV4RVEKM9YO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really enjoy my Kindle Fire HD 7\".

I got one of the first ones out and was perfectly happy with it.  I also bought 6 Kindles: 3 keyboards, 2 touches, and an original Fire--and gave them to relatives whose budgets are tight and who like the same books I like. They stay registered to me so we save a lot by reading the same books. Plus last year my son gave me a fantastic new iPad for my birthday.  Did I mention I love all this techie stuff?Admittedly, lugging around the iPad for reading is heavy and the original Fire's battery doesn't last as long as I'd like and it's heavy as well, so I sometimes I brought my original Kindle Keyboard for reading in doctor's offices.  (OK, I admit to being a septuagenarian and having to spend a lot of time in doctor's offices).So cut to the chase.  I read great reviews on the Paperwhite.  Generous son gave me an Amazon gift certificate for Christmas.  So I got a Paperwhite.  I HATED IT. Returned it in 48 hours.  I hated it so much wouldn't even foist it on a relative.  So there I was with a nice $200 credit.  I used it to get the Fire HD.  OMG how it has changed.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  It's sleek and not as heavy as the old Fire.  The back has a nice grip to it.  The ads are unobtrusive--really, I can't understand the complaints about them.  It's pretty.  It's easier to use.  I just throw it in my purse (IMHO no case needed--doesn't scratch) and off I go.  Hot spots are so common I don't worry about 3G availability, and I usually have several books downloaded. Controls are way easier to use than the original.So now, up in the cold Northeast, my sister has a nice original Fire to keep her cozy as she snuggles under tons of quilts in frigid weather.So if you have an old Fire and are wondering whether to get the new one, don't you have a nice sister or brother or aunt or uncle you can give the old one to?", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 7\"", "Author": "Carolyn Bernosky", "ReviewID": "R1V0BISPXE1DRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It fit my needs for reading without an attached light.

I was particularly attracted to the Kindle FreeTime feature -- she could have her own (less expensive) tablet, but I could strictly limit what she could do with it and for how long.  Without having to be looking over her shoulder every second.  And mostly, its great.  But there are still some areas to improve.  For example, if you bought the Harry Potter books from Pottermore, planning to put them into Kindle FreeTime for your kid to read them -- forget it.  Even though you own them, and can put them into the Kindle Fire, you can't put them into FreeTime.  Doesn't seem like it should take an engineering genius to figure this one out.  Two other things to note: music is not part of FreeTime.  So if you load music on your Kindle Fire, you cannot listen to it in FreeTime through the normal built in music player.  You can download an app that plays music, and add it to the FreeTime.  But when your kid's app time runs out, and the music is still playing, they cannot get back into the app to turn it off...  Also, though the device is my daughter's, I want her to be able to share it with her brother without eating up her own app time.  So I made him a profile.  But to go from one profile to another, they have to first exit FreeTime, which requires the parental password (i.e., me).  It would be better if it was like those Windows interfaces with user profiles -- each kid has a password for their own profile (so little brother can't use big sister's app time!), they can switch without my involvement, but I have the master password that controls entering or exiting FreeTime.  So its basically good (except for that Harry Potter thing), but has room to improve.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Christmas present for wife.", "Author": "Mike K", "ReviewID": "R1RZ5ZRP0DLB9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the Kindle Fire HD 7\" for my wife as a Christmas present and she absolutely LOVES IT!

I waited to review it, because glitches and problems generally show up after the excitement has worn off.  I've had a couple of thoughts of \"I wish,\" but nothing that would make me lower my rating.  Here's what I like--and what I don't:This screen is absolutely beautiful.  I wanted it mostly for books, but videos and content are flawless on it.  The books are beautiful and crisp, too, with plenty of options to change brightness and color.  This cuts down on eye strain.  There is a glare, in bright sun.  This is worse than a regular kindle, but not as bad as most tablets.  I was expecting much worse, with the HD screen, so I've just put it down as the best possible at this time.I wanted this because I'm in college and constantly needing books.  It's faster, easier, and cheaper to download kindle books than to try to buy them in a physical copy, especially when I need  some of the more obscure titles for my classes.  I still have books that I want for myself in hardback form, but nothing beats kindle for college!The build is sturdy, but light.  I don't feel like I'm going to break it if I touch it, but it's comfortable to hold.A lot of people complain about not being able to get Google play content and try to find workarounds, but I don't need that, so it's not an issue for me.  I'd rather buy from Amazon, anyway.  Past experience has taught me that their customer service and quality is superior.  If you aren't like me and you want to be able to access absolutely everything in the world on one device, it might be a drawback.  For me, it's not a problem.  I haven't come across anything I need that Amazon doesn't offer--usually cheaper and/or better then the other guys.I am not very techno-savvy, so it's a plus for me that this device is easy and ready to use right out of the box.  I signed in to Amazon and had everything I've bought in the past at my fingertips.One MINOR drawback is the memory.  You'd think 16gb was enough, but it's only enough if you keep your content in the cloud.  That's fine, if you aren't traveling, but if you find yourself without wifi access you cannot get to your content.  I downloaded a season of a tv show, knowing I would be without wifi, and it really ate up the memory, slowing my kindle fire down a lot.  After watching, I removed the episodes from the device and the slowdown disappeared.  I found myself wishing for more memory, then.  Most of the time, though, I rely on the cloud and 16gb is fine.  I just have to remember that small limitation.  (If I were buying one, I'd go with the 32gb model, personally, and have a little more room to download content for the times I'll be without access.  This was a gift, so I cannot really complain.)  I love the cloud and use it for most things, anyway, so it's a minor issue.  The only time memory is a problem is when I'm traveling.  For some, that might be a bigger issue than it is for me, as it's a portable device.  On my daughter's tablet, which has expandable memory, we are able to download a lot more content and take it with us.  Entertainment is never out of reach, even without internet.  All in all, though, my kindle is easier to work, has a better screen, and is organized better.  Everything has drawbacks.I haven't found anything in the three weeks I've had my kindle fire that would make it anything less than a great value.  I definitely recommend this device.

The Kindle Fire HD is running Android. Amazon has changed a few things from Android about how the operating system works. If you are looking for an alternative to the iPad or tablet, this is worth a try.  Kindle Fire HD is more a devise for media consumption than a tablet.

Right out of the box I was surprised at how simple it was to operate and get used to the interface.  I purchased the 32 GB instead of the 16 because we would be using the Fire mainly for educational games and books.  I opted to get Amazon Prime as well around DEC 20 due to a late gift need that had to get here before Christmas.  Holy COW does that make a difference in content access!  I would highly recommend going with Prime for the sheer volume of free movies and TV shows you have access to.  I LOVE being able to pull out the Kindle Fire HD, access Amazon, find any item, order it and know I will have it in 2 days... and be able to do all that in under 5 min.  Oh yeah - AND watch all of the BBC Sherlock shows with a beautiful HD picture!Now for the device itself:The screen resolution is incredible - crystal clear.  Streaming video and app downloads are extremely fast.  There are a few lags with YouTube videos every once in a while but I would still give the speed 5 stars.  Touch sensitivity is excellent. The sound from the speakers is really nice - not tinny at all but could still use a bit more bass which really is a nit-picky comment because the speakers are the size of your thumbnail!  I have cranked it up to max with no distortion.One recommendation to Amazon and to new users:  DISABLE the predictive keyboard!!  What a frustration that has been!  Didn't really \"catch\" that it was turned on as the default which was VERY annoying because this setting carries over into EVERY APP and every website you try to access.  Amazon:  You should ship it with predictive turned OFF as the default.I had a feeling we would like the Kindle Fire HD a lot... did not expect how much I would LOVE this thing.  Home Run Amazon!

All apps are not gamesFreetime has 3 categories for apps to include Video, Apps, and Books. There are limitations placed on video and apps which generally is acceptable but there is a distinction that needs to be made between apps such as DoodleJump which is a game and journal or the email app/Journal/Dictionary/Overdrive/Math education AppA1. Create a category for games in addition to category for apps. This way apps for writing a paper can be set to a different time than the games.2. All limits for System ToolsI consider the app store, browser, email, calendar to be system tools. I would not have a problem with my son using the internet for a few minutes in freetime doing some research on Google for school. However, this time needs to be limited and should be limited and accessible in Freetime.A2.

The kids love that we got it, and the free time app means I can set specific books and apps that are appropriate for each child.I've been going through Amazon's free books, and reading lots of books from 100-200 years ago, which has been a lot of fun.  There are some bad ones, and some have better or worse formats when they were copied into the kindle format, etc. but a bunch of good ones.And I also just found a whole set of Tom Swift books, which I'd been looking for for a long time without success.I ended up buying the Fire HD without special offers.  I originally was considering a Paperwhite, and each upgrade costs around $20, and so it is pretty easy to end up at the Kindle Fire HD, $20 for each jump.The one thing I hadn't thought about is that the Paperwhite is better than the Fire for reading - I'm still hoping to find an app or a hidden setting somewhere that will let me set the text color so I can have less light output when reading at night.  I have the brightness all the way down, and the background set to black, but the text color is white, rather than a gray, and so my vision gets funny white lines when I'm reading in the dark, and then look away from the kindle.

Easier Navigation and switching between apps.2- Kindle has a more sensitive and receptive touchscreen, it seems that I have to push the screen several times sometimes for the Samsung to respond.3- Samsung have a better App Store(Google) compared to the Amazon.4- Samsung can have a SD drive added.5- Samsung has back and Front Camera, Kindle just front.6- Samsung has less memory(8GB, 4.5 usable), Kindle starts with 16GB.7- Kindle processor is 1.2G while the Samsung is only 1GHz.8- Samsung seems to get a little sluggish at times specially when opening several apps in a row where never had that issue with the kindle, maybe because the kindle will not allow apps to continue running in background after closing them.9- Seems that the battery life is a little better with the Kindle.10- Kindle does not come with a charger(Ridiculous!) and alot of complaints of ads while using Kindle.11- Amazon customer service is superb, I don't think anyone beats them.12- Samsung has GPS, not the kindle.13- Kindle has hDMI output, not the Samsung.14- Samsung measured usable Ram is around 700MB and not 1GB.15- Same Price.16- Amazon Video Library and access is great, Parental control is great. Don't think Samsung has a Parental control and still haven't used their video library and to see if u can download bought movies to watch later?!17- Samsung options and settings are more versatile and editable for the experienced than the Kindle.So far, Seems the Kindle might have been a better option but not sure, I'll keep the Samsung for now and update this review as things change.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it, love it, love it....", "Author": "Kimberly A.

I debated on getting an iPad for a long time. My husband has one and it seems pretty nifty. And I already own a 3-year-old Kindle, so it seemed pointless to buy something I already have. But because I already own several Kindle books, and I buy audiobooks on audible.com, I decided to go with the Kindle Fire. So glad I did. Here's what I absolutely love:- I can hold it in one hand and it's very lightweight (that it's stylish looking is a plus, too)- the color and graphics are outstanding- the sound quality is all that Amazon says it is. I listened to part of one of my audiobooks, and love it!- I can sync to my email account- It has a calendar and contacts feature (great for taking my work on the road)- easy to type on and navigate through- no comparison to my old Kindle. Just none at all. It's like comparing a horse-and-buggy to a Ferrari.I'm actually not very tech savvy. I can't handle anything too complicated, and I tend to get frustrated very quickly when I encounter poor, counter-intuitive designs. But this product has so far been very intuitive. I was finding my way around on it right out of the box. Pretty simple to use. I still need to figure out how to highlight in the eBooks and print up my notes, but I understand it has that feature, and I'm sure it will be pretty easy to figure out.

I now can read any book without pain because I can prop up the Kindle Fire HD and turn pages with a touch of my finger and don't have to hold it.  The back lit screen makes it easy for me to read in bed at night when my husband is sleeping.I used to own a Sony Reader and the Kindle Fire HD is a much better product. The Sony Reader was in black and white, was not back lit, could not play videos and did not connect to the internet. Those were all important features when I was looking for a replacement for my Reader. The Kindle Fire HD could provide me with those features; the Sony Reader could not. The only advantage to the Sony Reader was that it weighed less, but I have accommodated for that by getting a holder for my Kindle that allows me to prop it up so I don't have to hold it.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great device!", "Author": "Autie", "ReviewID": "R2D2DGMENS4BLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas from my boyfriend.

No big deal for my wife, but it is frustrationg as heck when you want to see something on YouTube and 2. No Dish Sling Player. I can watch dish from my cell phone, computer, everywhere like I was sitting at home for $0. They have a $14.99 app that works on a Sling Box, but that is something totally different.

The 7 was received as a Christmas gift.  The 8.9 was purchased for $58 after trading-in old, not-being-used electronics.  This purchase of the 8.9 was made after being, suprisingly, overjoyed with the 7.  As my first tablet, I was initially skeptical.  But that feeling soon disappeared. Of all the debate over what is the best tablet, I can say the Kindle fire HD is, for me, the best tablet. I do not need a laptop replacement.  Instead, this is the perfect fit of a simple, streamlined device that can access books, magazines, movies, game apps, and Amazon products.Having tinkered around with both over the last two weeks, I am of the opinion that the 7 is the less buggy, more consistent, and, paradoxically, the more snappier of the two models (the 7 is 32gb, the 8.9 is the basic 16gb).  I am curious if anyone else who has used both the 7 and the 8.9 shares a similar experience?  Despite having less horsepower, does the 7 to you seem the more stable of the two?  I seem to get less \"issue\" with the 7 compared to the 8.9.  Additionally, when I factor in the portability of the 7 I find myself saying the 7 is the better option. And this is despite the 7 giving up screen real estate and greater resolution.Have I lost my mind??", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS KINDLE IS ON FIRE", "Author": "MARTHA G VANEGAS", "ReviewID": "R31ZV7XH5KSMZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVING THE KINDLE FIRE HD!

If you are as I am fairly flush with Amazon content and don't really like messing with the iTunes world, this is a robust little device married to a plethora of content. Audio is acceptable but not ear popping - haven't tried it yet with earphones.The only complaint I have is that the native app selection isn't as complete as say my Android phone. Hope that will improve with time.When you compare price with iPad there is simply no contest - I got 2 of these for LESS than my other sister spent on her iPad2.

We have an iPod touch, 2 iPod Nano's, a MacBook Air, 2 iPads, AND to cap it all off, an Apple TV. We are obsessed with Apple products. I was a little hesitant to buy a Kindle for this reason - I thought that maybe would should just pony up the extra $150 and get a iPad Mini for our toddler girls.We decided against that for 3 reasons:1) Our toddlers have broken, cracked, otherwise broken our first iPad one too many times. The front glass is fragile, and even with a supposedly \"military grade\" case on it, our daughter dropped the iPad onto a tile floor and .... crrrrraaaackkkkk. We read reviews that said that the Kindle glass was much more sturdy, so we thought that we'd give it a go.2) We were really excited about Kindle FreeTime. We spend a lot of money on the Apple AppStore buying books and games, and the prospect of paying only $3 per month and getting unlimited books and games was too alluring to pass up.3) The combination of the higher initial price and the higher maintenance price of buying new books and apps for the iPad was just too great of a difference to ignore.We are very happy with our decision. The Kindle has been a great addition to our current line up of gadgets. While I wouldn't use the Kindle exclusively, I do like having it around as a backup for myself and as the primary gadget for my children to read books on. At this price, and with Kindle FreeTime, it's a deal that can't be beat!", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good as an IPad", "Author": "Andrew E.

We chose the Kindle Fire because of the Parental Controls that can be enabled on the device.  I love the fact it can be set up so she can read unlimited and play games for 30 minutes a day.  We looked at several devices iPod Touch, the Galaxy Tablet as well for us there were many factors that played into our decision.  Our child is 7 and does not need Facebook, Twitter or to be surfing the internet on her tablet - I love the fact I can block this on the Kindle.  The main reason we chose the Kindle Fire HD over the iPod Touch is most School Districts consider iPods as music devices and not a tablet, so she would not be able to bring the Touch to school (and I was not paying for an iPad - our child is 7).  If we ever let her take the Kindle Fire to school she could (I do not see that happening but it is an option we have.)  I have played several games on it (I also like the fact that I can block those \"pay to play more\" parts of games), streamed video and read on the Kindle when my child is in bed.  We also didn't pay the $15 to get rid of the ads because it is on the lock screen and it doesn't bother us.  If you us the \"Free Version\" of Kindle Free Time you do not have the other people viewed, it is a very simple screen.  The fact that there is only a front facing camera doesn't even bother us, because we are not going around taking photos, we use it to Skype and why do you need a back side camera to Skype with?For us this device is perfect for what we needed.  I was not expecting a \"lap top\" if I wanted my child to have a lap top I would have purchased one.  I wanted something they could read books on and play the occasional game or stream the occasional video on.  The Kindle Fire is that it is not a computer or a lap top it is a gaming device that you can read and learn new skills with (whether it is a piano or a language).I now wish we would have bought one for our other child so they would each have their own and no fighting would ensue.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "The new, improved Kindle Tablet, HD.", "Author": "Glenn Lee", "ReviewID": "RDQ3AJ6YMMK8S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new improved Kindle Fire HD worth buying.

She has been so thrilled. This is a great tablet for her. I really struggled with which tablet to get for her. Yes she is 8 and its an extream gift, but we knew she would use it and take care of it. The tablet is made really well with a great feel to it. If it wasnt for an 8 year old i would not have bought a case for it, it just has that good of a feel to it.  I chose this tablet because it was for a child and i know there is only so much she would need it for. Mostly entertainment. Yes it is, in a sence, a way for amazon to get you to buy from them all kinds of media, but im happy with that. I love amazon. Everybody in the family knew she was receiving this for christmas so it made it easy for them to buy a gift card to excatly the place she would want one to. On a parent note...i chose this tablet for 2 deciding factors. One: its user friendly. I didnt have to spend an hour trying to figure out how to operate it. It came registered to my amazon account, and when i wanted to put my daughters name on the kindle instead of the name it came registered to ( mine) it was a snap. And those types of things usually take me forever to figure out. Everything on this device is very simple to use. I was worried how to swap things in and out of the cloud before i received it, but that also is so easy. You dont even have to think about it. Its plainly there and explains itself. So for anybody that wants a tablet but struggles with electronics and how to make them work right, this is for you. I wish all devices were this easy. The second deciding factor for me was the parental controls. And im not even using the free time feature. That adds even greater saftey and control even over how long your kids are allowed on it. But just from the standard functions i was able to set a passcode for turning wifi on, im able to block anything i want without locking everything as a whole. I can block just movies, or just the web, so thats why i went with the kindle,its the tablet she asked for, but it was a great choice. The ease of use and the great parental controls the other tablets didnt offer. The picture qualty is amazing, as well as the sound. They are not lying when they say these features are great. So this is just my 2 cents on my thoughts on this device for our 8 year old.

I previously had ordered a 10\" Coby, but returned it because it lacked the Apps I was looking for. It also had a very week camera. This Kindle Fire HD is my second, as the first one had a defective camera. Amazon was great and sent me out a replacement in a couple of days. The base price of this tablet only covers the tablet and a USB cord. There is no USB home charging plug. You will have to buy your own case, screen saver, stylus, and a App to make the camera work. This was done to keep cost down and to make you purchase them through Amazon. Some of the items I purchased through Amazon, others I bought elsewhere. Amazon had a ton of Apps for this tablet, so there is no problem finding the ones you need. Some are free, others have a small purchase price. I'm totally satisfied with this tablet and received great reviews during my family Christmas party. Note: Some of the Apps like Facebook are limited and takes some time getting used to. I'm sure in time better Apps will be available for that and others. Netflix works great as does Pandora, Skype and the camera takes decent pictures. The battery seems to hold a good charge and drains according to what application your using. The unit seems to pick up the wireless signal with little problem. If you get the one with the advertising for $20.00 cheaper, it's no big deal as it's only on the backround when you go to unlock the tablet. It looks like a keeper to me. The only problem I have with Amazon is that they ship it in the manufactures box that's no bigger that the unit itself and leaves little protection for the unit. I believe that's why my camera didn't operate on my first one.

I understand though, I hold no grudge against them for that. I have just recently gotten this new Kindle and it is a stunning device. I have owned it for two days and during that time I have noticed absolutely no lag in the device or those pesky ' force closes'. Before I continue I would like to state that I am 15 years old (just in case any of you wonder if your teenager would like it) I am a heavy gamer but I also take my education very seriously. Yet another reason why my mother and brother decided to get me this device.When I first opened the box I immediately noticed it's sleek shape and larger boarders. Thank heavens for those, the grip is much easier and the smooth back keeps me comfortable during long periods of use. The system itself is exquisite. It moves smoothly and apps work wonderfully.Upon turning on the device after setup you can see ads on the screen. I honestly don't know why people complain so much about this. How long do you really look at your unlock screen anyways? Besides, the Ads are quit interesting if I do say so myself. Everything I had on my previous Kindle was found in my Cloud and I was extremely grateful for this, I didn't have to hunt everything down again. The camera is not as great as advertised but wonderful nonetheless. The power and volume buttons are indeed hard to press at times but it' s better then always accidentally turning off your device. At the bottom of your home screen you can see recommendations, I think that was a fabulous idea. I find books, games and apps much easier and more suited to me much faster then wondering aimlessly in the store.Next, the speakers. Amazon has the right to brag. My brother has an IPad 2 and even he was impressed by the stunning quality of the speakers. Clean, crisp sound without that annoying hiss you heavy in other devices. I honestly find' t expect them to be that good. It makes gaming and movie watching beyond amazing. I usually have an equalizer app I install to get better quality from my speakers in other devices but here, there was no need. The app actually made it sound slightly worse. It' s called Player Pro. Try it for yourself and you will see the difference. Theses speakers need nothing done to them whatsoever.The screen too amazed me. Once again compared to my brother's IPad I could see basically no difference. The HD display is crisp and bright. Colors are vivid and the darks are actually dark. When out in the sun the direct sun (Florida the sunshine state!) I could still see everything perfectly. Even though I could see many reflections on the screen the apps and books were still strongly visible.The original Kindled were all about books and I'm happy to announce that they still kept that same style going on. The books look stunning. The letters are so clear and there was no strain on my eyes at all, even when I was reading in the dark. The white on black feature helps make reading on the eyes much easier on those conditions.One thing I truly love is the Silk browser. Wow, it is fast! Even compared to my computer it was fast! Not even my mom' s Mac book pro could compare to it' s sperm! I do all my Internet surfing on the Kindle and I will continue to do so in the far future. One thing that bugged me about it though was the fact that I had to go through a different page to view my bookmarks. I would much rather go to it first but it's no biggie. Just one more click of a button.Also, on the home screen I really did like the swipe down for favorites but I suppose the bottom is better due to the fact that I can see it everywhere I go.The Kindle keyboard is a loveable yet frustrating thing at times. I personally like the layout and all but I have an issue with the auto correct. When I add a word to the dictionary and I spell the whole thing out I would prefer if it wasn't changed. This can hopefully be improved, it' s a small bug but very irksome at times.Now, back to gaming. I tried out the new Need for speed on the Kindle and was once again blown away. Graphics for almost every game was stunning. The speakers give a nice boost to overall improve your gaming experience along with the HD display. Also, the fact that apps don' t crash (none so far anyways) is just another reason to love it.Now, as a student I have a plethora of homework that has to be done. I' m not even going to bother going on my computer anymore. If you're even slightly tech- savy then you should have no problems doing your work on this device. The flash player is missed though, but once again no biggie. It can be downloaded from a third party source.As far as battery life goes, it' s great considering all the heavy use I do on this device. Just for today I was gaming (not those small little apps either, I was racecar driving!) watching videos a, on the Silk browser, reading and much much more. I got a good 8 1/2 hours on my device with auto brightness and never once turning off the WiFi. Also, speakers were on full blast.I am dissatisfied with one thing though. My charging cable does not work properly. When I first plugged it in it showed that It was charging then it wasn't then it was...you get the drill. At first I thought it was the charging port (thank God it wasn't' t) so I plugged and unplugged. still the same thing. I made sure everything was properly connected but alas it was the cable itself because I tried a different one. I am currently using the cable for the previous Kindle fire. I hope this can be fixed. I am going to call customer support and see if a new one can be sent in.Well, there you have it, a review from a teen's point of view. I hope this helped all the parents out there debating if they should buy this product.I am thoroughly satisfied with this product (the cable not so much) and I will update (if I figure out how) any problems or improvements that have been made to this device. Sorry for any grammatical errors you may encounter. I am still learning the ways of English and considering I wrote all this from my Kindle with this slightly bothersome keyboard please forgive me.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Reading again with the back light that helps aging eyes.", "Author": "Beverly Breakey \"Beverly Breakey\"", "ReviewID": "R1FFWLB52BAGG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you for this product which will last me a lifetime.

I simply wanted a tablet to use mainly as an e-reader, but occasionally for games and internet access.  It is perfect for those purposes in my eyes.First, I love how easy it is to read books on the Kindle.  The contrast makes the words easy to read without straining your eyes.  Its the middle of winter here so I haven't had the chance to take it outside and see how much, if any, glare it has when read in the sun, but other reviews have said it is great in the sun.  My husband even said the books are much easier to read on the Kindle than on his I-pad.  The contrast simply isn't as great at he says reading on the I-Pad strains his eyes after a while. It also fits perfectly in your hand so you can hold it with one hand and use your other hand for other things, something an I-Pad is simply too big to do with.Internet access is great.  I've never used it off of my home internet, but it runs extremely well on there.  I don't do much on the internet so it does what I want.  I wish Facebook was easier to navigate on the Kindle, but honestly, I'm not that concerned about it.  If I need to I'll get on our desktop to see things clearer or a picture in larger form.  I don't use it to watch videos on the internet as I think the screen is too small for that being spoiled with a 55 inch tv.I enjoy playing games on the Kindle.  They look fantastic on the HD screen and they are a great time waster for me now that its cold and wintry outside.The Ads that everyone complains about don't bother me.  I never look at a lock screen longer than it takes to unlock the screen so they can put whatever ads they want there, I honestly will pretty much never see them long enough for them to register.  The suggestions everyone complains about at the bottom of the screen don't bother me at all.  They have actually helped me when I'm stumped as to what book or game to get next.  Its helpful since it suggests books in the same genres that I have been reading so I don't have to sort through all the books on Amazon to find the next book I want to read everytime I finish a book and haven't yet decided which book to read next.  I really think people are being too touchy when it comes to complaining about the ads and suggestions.  I really don't notice either unless I want to.The only downside I can think of at this time is the charger.  The one they give you is essentially useless.  I was going to buy the wall charger anyways, but while waiting for it to get to me, I had to wait 8+ hours for my kindle to charge to 80% from 30%.  Honestly I think that is deceptive and Amazon should be ashamed.  They should at least give you a USB charger that charges decently, especially for people going on long trips where a computer is the only constant source they have to charge their Kindle.  I hope Amazon rethinks this profit plan on their chargers because you should at least give people something that works.Overall I would recommend this product to others (In fact I already have to my mom).  Too many people are trying to compare it to the I-Pad, which it was never meant to be.  It is not an I-Pad nor is it meant to be in direct competition with them.  It is a great e-reader and perfect for people like me who don't do very many complicated things on the internet.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "ROCKS!!", "Author": "B.

I called Amazon the same night and it was immediately resolved. I had a brand new one within 2 days of my call, and all I had to do was send in my defected one with a shipping label that they paid for.

Even though I'm a Prime Member, I was too impatient to wait 2 days or 1 day shipping from Amazon, so I went to my local Best Buy to purchase the Kindle Fire HD.  I was a little skeptical about the quality of KF HD.  I was blown away when I started using the KF HD!  The sound & picture quality is incredible!  The buttons for volume and power are hard to feel but that became a non issue once I put the Amazon case on it.  Everything on the KF HD works great.  We use Skype on a weekly basis with no flaws. I love the IMDB integration on the KF HD (I've been referring to that website for several years).Kindle FreeTime wouldn't set up the correct way, so I contacted Amazon Support.  I had to reset my KF HD in order for the FreeTime to set up parental controls.  So, far FreeTime works great.  My 3 year loves when he is on \"His Kindle\".  I have my other 2 kids with their own profiles as well.  The time limits allows them to have to share.  Once their time is up, the kindle FreeTime locks them out and they tell me so I can activate the next child's profile. The Kindle FreeTime comes with set items that you can take off depending on your child's age or gender.  My kids enjoy playing games that we play (where's my water, free flow; etc) and I added those games to each child's Free Time (which I already had on my account.)  Keep in mind that once you deactivate your FreeTime, you do not have access to the set items unless you already have them on your account.I don't read books on my KF HD, I prefer to read books on my Kindle Ink Reader.  I read daily for hours and love to get lost into a book.  And the ink reader feels like a physical book.  When reading on the web on the KF HD, I find myself zooming in to read.The only (personal) problem, is that I had to share my KF HD with my husband!  Ummm...He took it all the time!  I had to ask to use my own Kindle!  I will be purchasing another KF HD for my kids.I am an Apple Girl (for 3 years)  and a Amazon Fanatic >>(for 9 years now!) and I think that the KF HD is a solid, affordable tablet that is great for kids and adults.  With that being said, I purchased the iPad Mini the day it was released and I love it!  I love that all my apple products sync together.  I had to put all my notes, reminders, lists; etc. that I had on my iPhone into the KF HD; which was more work then checking back between my devices to make sure I had everything.  I prefer the iPad mini but that is just my personal taste.  Both the KF HD and iPad mini are great devices just different depending on what you are using it for.  If you are a business person, then I can tell you that the KF HD is not for you.  Try other Tablets that will fit your needs.For the price, Kindle Fire HD is very affordable for those who are Budget Savvy.  I don't like the whole Apple vs. Amazon's debate.  Both are solid tablets and I love both Companies.  I totally recommend the a Kindle Fire HD over those kid based learning devices that cost the same as the KF HD!  The KF HD has everything those devices have and more!  As a mom of 4 kids; ages 12 & under, I can tell you that kids will eventually get bored of those kid learning devices or out grow them.  Kids will not have that problem with KF HD because there is unlimited learning available and it is displayed on a beautiful HD screen with vivid colors.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet", "Author": "WILLOW", "ReviewID": "R16UZJKI9JB2FC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had the Kindle Fire HD for 2 days but I love so far, if anything changes I will update.

Although many of my friends use either iPads or Samsung tablets (one uses a Nook), I can find no significant differences or deal breakers, excepting as noted in this review concerning devout Apple users.  So, as a semi-technical consumer:1) the quality and build is great and it feels very solid;  2) reading books and full-color magazines is easy on the eyes, even in widely different lighting conditions, and navigation tools are well thought-out;  3) streaming movies (we use Amazon Digital Library movies, Amazon prime movies, and Netflix movies using a wireless \u201cG\u201d home network via Verizon FIOS internet connection) is trouble free on this Dual Band Wi-Fi unit (just as seamless as on our TV/Roku combo) -- meaning no dropouts or buffering issues during HD throughput\u2014even when streaming movies to 2 devices in our home ;  4) the screen appears very sharp, with really good color and contrast, and runs without hesitation (redraw speed?\u2014I\u2019m not sure of the correct term).  To my eyes it clearly appears to be TV-HD quality (perhaps due to the size difference compared to a TV) and is a pleasure to watch.  5)  The sound, using either the built-in speakers or a Pro35 headset is outstanding considering that this is a hand-held device!  Great technology here!  6) The new Fire Main Menu system works fine, but is a significant change from prior Kindles.  I believe that the older Amazon \u201cCollections\u201d menu option should be immediately integrated into the this new system to get up to only 4 stars on this single feature\u2014Major Menus.  However, Amazon, along with every other manufacturer, should be chastised for allowing hundreds of digital books and other media access on handheld devices without a robust, extremely SORTABLE-BY-USER-CHOICE, directory-type system.  Each user has reasons for looking up books and movies by category, type, year, size, etc., and no one has developed a great menu system with multiple lookup-sort choices that seem to sort well.  The stop-gap measure seems to be the ever-present \u201cfavorites\u201d item on everything.  This isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but I\u2019ll withhold praise until a User Group moves Amazon to upgrade this wide-spread annoyance on their line of products.Using only a few game apps, maybe 500+ books, and various sources for streaming movies, I\u2019m unsure of the need for 32 GB.  The 16 GB may have been fine, but there was little price increase between the two, and upcoming apps may make amount-of-memory an issue, so I opted for the 32 GB.From my experiences, I know that there are many different, and widely known technical specifications that favor an Apple product, Samsung product, Nook, or a Kindle to a technophile.  And, I certainly understand someone knocking all Kindles if they are Appled up (iMac, iPads, iPhones, Apple Movies, etc.).  However, the greatest value for my money \u2014 returning a high-quality product that satisfies common uses for the dollars spent \u2014 has been in the Kindles.  The Fire HD continues this assessment.My bottom line:  If the user-valuable technological advantages indicated a move to an iProduct or a Samsung, I would have done it at this point.  Vast choices of streaming video, and loads of free books, are potentially available for every major platform.  However, I found this product was excellent for my purposes and I would purchase another Kindle Fire HD again without any hesitation.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Lady of leisure", "ReviewID": "R3SDC46NVEN66S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm pleased with my kindle after returning an HKC tablet I bought from Walmart for exactly $94.01 less. I had something to compare my new kindle, I mean it was a cheap ridiculous tablet as oppose to say an Ipad but still. My main purpose of getting a tablet is firstly, to watch movies on the go (my commute is about 4.5 hours a day). Reading books, listening to music/audio books, browsing the web all come second. I initially bought the HKC tablet to buy movies from google movies to download and watch later. BIG MISTAKE. Google is still having problems with that app working on some of it's tablets. Being that I already have amazon prime and tons of TV shows/movies on my cloud, it made sense to chalk up the extra money to get a kindle. I got the kindle Saturday, it's Monday and I think I spent the entire weekend reading, watching movies etc without leaving my house once. The fact that I can also shop buying anything from cat food to biscuits using my kindle is an additional bonus. The clarity and sound from this little gadget? Amazing! The ease to shop or browse? Wonderful. I read some reviews that mentioned the tablet not being easy to navigate but for me I didn't find it to be the case. It is similar to using a MAC vs. a PC- I mean, you're used to your apps being set up a certain way but Kindle's unique to kindle. True, I prefer to create folders of apps I use frequently, combining similar ones e.g my games in one folder on my home screen because I'm anal about organization. Kindle doesn't let you do that and it took a little getting used to. I think the only con for me at this point is that the apps amazon offers doesn't compare to the google ones. Not even close. It's an annoyance in a way but I still have my smartphone with android OS so that takes care of that. Barring that, the kindle is close to being my one-stop shop, exactly what amazon intended. I'm hooked and this thing is 'my preeeeeccciiioussss\" <-(in my best gollum voice)ETA:(12/19/12) I figured out how to get my beloved apps from Android on to my Kindle which makes this lil' technological contraption exceptional for what I need.

VPN works with the Kindle Fire HD if you know how to", "Author": "IndieHeart", "ReviewID": "R1S1ELYNZ1F4N0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have lived with my new Kindle Fire HD for about a week now and can say that I am very well satisfied with my purchase. I chose the Fire HD over the Galaxy Nexus because I was looking for an inexpensive media tablet to have fun with. I spend my entire day doing technical support work and don't want to do it when the day is done, so I wanted something that doesn't require any level of geekery to operate. Because I am a Prime member, I was also attracted by the Kindle Lending library and easy streaming of Prime Video.Will it go everywhere with me when I'm not planning on needing to do any work? Yes. A hearty yes. I need books everywhere I go! (My iPhone is fine in a pinch when I need to pick up a Kindle book, but not for long periods of reading). I am also able to sideload my own videos for those times when I will not have a wifi connection for streaming. Fantastic screen with excellent resolution, even at an angle, so viewing doesn't have to be a solo endeavor.Absolutely fantastic sound! I am so glad that I got the Fire HD instead of the basic Kindle. I hate wearing headphones. The sound is not only full for something coming from such small speakers, but the volume you can get out of it is substantial. I can hear over my treadmill and from several feet away when I set it up to stream video while my TV screen is occupied with WII step aerobics.The new gen Kindle Fire HD also supports VPN. Kinda sorta. So let me give you a tip on the VPN support...except for Cisco AnyConnect, at the time of this writing, the VPN clients available in the Amazon store for the Kindle do not work with the Kindle Fire HD (yes, even though it leads you to a long list of VPN apps when you go to Settings > Security > VPN). AnyConnect is a great app, but it only works with Cisco routers, which are usually used in a corporate environment. If you use an online VPN provider, you will need a non-proprietary VPN client.I spent hours looking for a VPN client that doesn't require root access to the device and finally found FEAT VPN. It is not available in the Amazon store. Do yourself a favor, search for it on the web, install it, and go. You'll save lots of frustration if you don't have to install and uninstall all the possible options in the Amazon store. You will need the certificates (the same ones used by OpenVPN) from your VPN provider during setup. If you use HMA for VPN, I let them know and they updated their wiki, so they even have the steps laid out for you there.I got the chance to use Skype with it the other day and found it adequate to the task. I have never been able to use Skype well on my wifi at home on either my iPhone or my netbook. Too much buffering would generally put a kabosh on it. However, the dual wifi on the Kindle Fire really makes a difference.I am also digging the text to speech for books. I find it annoying when I have to put down a book to do the dishes, etc. Not anymore. My bathroom hamper serves double-duty as a Kindle stand so that I can read in the bathtub. My life is now perfect :-)Will I be taking the Kindle instead of the netbook when I need to be able to do work when I am traveling? No. Even with the very nice bluetooth keyboard I purchased for the Kindle, I would not want to write a long document with it. Remote access to my home PC (yes, there's an app for RDP access) is also terribly slow. Do not expect a Kindle to take the place of a laptop. It is fantastic as a media table, but it was not designed (and can not be expected to) replace a PC.Recommended apps to make your use of the Kindle Fire even better:ES Task Manager to quickly close your running apps if the unit starts processing slowly (because apps continue to run in the background after you close them like all Android devices)Dolphin Browser (has Flash support -- I like it better than the Silk browser)You may want to check out SnapPea for alternate app store and device backup", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Kindle Fire DS", "Author": "Jasmine Dismuke", "ReviewID": "R1JLCX9SEYPRFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in love with my kindle fire .

I ju...", "ReviewID": "RSRI3K9V7DIVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hereafter in this review, I will refer to the Kindle Fire HD 7\", which I have recently purchased, as the \"KFHD\".BE AWARE (as I was NOT, which caused me to to buy, and then have to return for replacement, several items): the \"Kindle Fire\" and the \"Kindle Fire HD\" are two different machines that require their own specifically designed cases, screen protectors and other \"accessories\". Just be aware of which version the accessory is made for.This is really one of the most exceptional pieces of electronics that I have EVER owned.It does SO many things, right out of the box: you can read books (books download in seconds), listen to music (songs download in about 5 seconds), use email, subscribe to magazines, watch personal videos, watch movies(stored on your device or stored on the internet), make Skype phone calls and Video Calls, listen to Audiobooks, shop at Amazon, surf the Internet, store and look at your personal photos, and look at your personal Microsoft Office documents, PDF's and other file formats. Amazon Prime customers can \"borrow FREE books\", watch a limited number of free movies and TV shows.THEN you start adding apps to give further functionality to your KFHD, MANY of which are free ... or have free versions. The KFHD is an Android operating system Tablet Computer and therefore the number of \"Apps\" available to expand the functionality of the KFHD is just astounding.Most \"paid\" apps are only $0.99 ... although I DID pay 4.99 for Microsoft Office Pro which allows me to edit MS Word documents, MS Excel spreadsheets and  Power Point presentations. I've given my KFHD the ability to take handwritten notes, be an alarm clock, play games, be a calculator, have a calendar scheduler, play chess, turn into a still camera AND a video camera, be a stopwatch/timer, look at the weather, and display information about the signal strength of available WiFi hotspots. And I've JUST begun, as I've only spent about $10 on apps!!!Much of what the KFHD does requires a WiFi hotspot. So I bought a WiFi hotspot device and subscribed to a 4G network. So, I am now in CONSTANT contact with the internet. and am just astounded in what a difference this haS made to my life. I live in an EXTREMELY rural area. It is 10 miles to the nearest McDonalds which is the only place in more miles than that that has a WiFi hotspot. I used to store ALL of my books on my Kindle Keyboard. Now, I read a book and delete it. If I decide that I want to read it again, I simply tap on the book and it downloads in seconds and I can read it again.Many Kindle books are now linked to Audible books. So you can visually READ your book while it is simultaneously being read to you with the text being spoken being highlighted in a light gray.The sound of the KFHD is much better than my Kindle Keyboard, but if i am SERIOUS about listening to my music, then I use the 3MM Audio Out plug to plug into my 130 watt per channel Kenwood with four foot speakers and rattle the windows. The KFHD plays MP3 files which are digital ... like CD's ... so the sound quality is nothing less than astonishing. I've even bought portable external speakers to go with my KFHD and MP3 file player.Which Leaps and Bounds cheaper than the Apple iPad, this machine is a fair chunk of money. You will DEFINITELY want to buy a case for YOUR KFHD. Also, a stylus is a VERY desirable accessory ... unless you particularly LIKE wiping your greasy fingerprints off the screen.The 16GB model is $200 and the 32GB model is $250. The larger KFHD has other options and is accordingly more expensive.Speaking of memory, this is the ONLY real complaint I have about my KFHD ... In fact, I consider this to be a SERIOUS oversight on the part of Amazon. NONE of the Kindles have a slot to plug in a SDHC memory card ... like the NOOK Tablet does. I can DEFINITELY see a use for such a card. Movies are BIG files and a memory slot in which you could select which of your memory cards to plug in would be very nice ... VERY useful, and is the ONE SINGLE thing that keeps me from giving the KFHD a full five star rating. Without a doubt, I feel cheated over the lack of such a slot.Don't hesitate ... go get one NOW.

But in the case of the Kindle Fire HD, it's just a terrific device. I don't understand the naysayers. This has to be the best $200 I've ever spent. Even my husband who spent north of $500 on his iPad has a tech crush on my Kindle Fire!I'm a mom of young kids, and the \"Free Time\" program is perfect for managing my children's screentime, which I limit carefully. This feature alone - combined with its price point of only $200 - is the reason a mom should consider the Kindle Fire over and iPad (for the Dads) or the Google tablet (for gamers). I can set an allotted time by child, and I can pick which games and apps the child can use during that time. There are no more tantrums or fighting over the iPad - and what a welcome relief that has been.I used to haul a laptop upstairs wrap up the day's work and web surfing, and now I just tote my Kindle Fire tablet up instead. There's something nice about not having your work laptop tethered to you 24/7. The Fire keeps you connected but isn't ringing like a phone and isn't reminding you of work. It's an entirely pleasant experience.I'm an Amazon Prime customer so this is a dream to me. I order whatever I want with such ease - who has time to boot up a laptop when you just need to buy something quickly?I look forward to future enhancements of this device. In the meantime, I will be buying my mother one for Christmas because she's interested in a tablet but she's overwhelmed by the iPad.The Kindle Fire HD hits all the right notes; I recommend it highly.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compared to the old kindle fire....", "Author": "cloudi", "ReviewID": "R2Z5TTC3AHUN9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the old kindle fire as a gift a few days before this one came out.. I obviously returned that one and purchased the new one. This is a MAJOR upgrade.  It is so much faster and everything just looks and sounds better.  I enjoy it because I like Amazon.  I like to be able to shop and download music from there because they usually have the best price and if they don't, it's only a matter of time before it goes on sale! I use my kindle to read, shop, use some apps, and watch netflix and videos.  For all of those functions, I love it! I wouldn't recommend it if you were looking for a tablet pc to edit documents etc. This is more for entertainment purposes and you're basically buying into the ecosystem that Amazon offers, which is much better deals on everything! I also own an Iphone and you can just download the music to your computer and add it to your itunes.  I would much rather go through that process than waste extra money on overpriced music and videos!

I don't have any ads at the bottom there is nothing there and I did not pay to have them removed.  There are lock screen ads but in HD they look like pretty pictures and are good deals. You never could personalize the home screen anyway and as for a clock, if you are concerned with the time then you shouldn't be on a tablet playing anyway. The sound is wonderful I don't need my extra speakers anymore. Don't worry about flash there are plenty of ways to get it and watch what you want. Rapid charger: yes the cable is slow to charge but I have an iPad charger and does speed it up, because this baby goes everywhere with me. So get it if you want its good besides any issues from the software or performance you know Amazon will replace it under warranty. I haven't heard of Amazon saying \"oh well\" at any issue.

After downloading my apps, music, photos, playing some games, etc. I am very pleased with my purchase.  Touch to speech on the reader is a good feature, xray features for movies and books is awesome and photos of artists in my music library is a special treat. Some of the issues I read about in other reviews about special offers being an aggravation are practically a non issue. The product offers on the home screen can be hidden by changing the home screen viewing option in settings.  I am still getting familiar with the features and every time I use it (which is often, I think I'm getting addicted to it), I find more things I love.  Love the Bluetooth, love the HD screen, love that it is thinner than the first Fire. So far the only thing I don't love is not being able to choose what goes onto the carousel.  Things keep popping up. It' s not anything that would make me return it though. I have added the apps I use most to my favorites and don't really use the carousel very much anyway.

I bought this primarily due to my already being a prime member which gives me a ton of streaming options. That's getting better all the time! Netflix had better watch their back.  I can't use voice search and that bothered me but I went for it anyway. I'm glad I did. The keyboard input is pretty easy to use and once you have entered a few characters your result usually pops up. My biggest gripe is the clunky carousel. It's easy enough to navigate around but it's like the big elephant in the room no one wants to acknowledge. There's no need for it.  I already have another tablet I use at home and this one was bought strictly for travel. This doesn't do all the \"nifty\" things a pure android tablet does but makes up for that with a tremendous amount of free content from Amazon.  I've looked at all the ways you're supposed to be able to make this act more like a pure Android device but I see no need to do that. It does what it's supposed to do and very well at that. I'm giving it 5 stars in spite of the carousel.Recommended.Update after having the Kindle HD for a while now. You can add voice search to this by using the dolphin browser{or other I suppose} and side load google voice search.

First, there is no manual that comes with the Kindle Fire HD and I had to learn how to move around by trial and error.  I looked on line for a User Guide or something I could download but there are books etc you can buy.  After several searches I finally went to Best Buy and one of the Geeks there told me how to go to the User Guide on the Kindle. There should be some kind of instructions given with the Kindle that tells you where to look.  I had no idea.  You can find this by,after opening the tablet and turning it on, unlock and slide to the left.  Then on your home page,drag from the top down and that brings up headings at the top.  Then go under (More) in the right hand corner and open that. Then go under (Help & Feedback) and then (User Guide). You can find out how to do things there.  It would have saved me a lot of time and effort if I had known how to do that when I bought the Kindle Fire HD.  Not sure how I will like it yet since I have just learned how to move around and do things on it.  I did manage to learn how to download a few books.

Don't like the ads and would love to pay to get them off but sadly, there are not any instructions to tell you how.  LOVE IT!!!I do love my Kindle Fire but there are things I do not like.  I know with more capabilities it will be a heavier product - it's a bit too heavy for my old wrists.  I do not like the way the charger hooks up - on the bottom?  Cannot charge and watch a video or read a book with the cover on and propped up.  Speaking of the cover - if you bend it too far backwards, it shuts the tablet off.  I'm not happy with the cover at all.  Its awkward especially when charging. I have taken it off and will go back to my old work tablet padded cover - will let you know how easy returning and refunding it will be.Some of the apps are difficult to use.  Locations services suck.  I cannot get the weather, moon and star charts to take a location or even find it.  These same apps are much easier to use on my iPhone.  I was hoping for better viewing of the night sky but no luck with location services yet.I get a loud crack from the speakers every once in awhile that is disturbing.I love the graphics and the clarity of the videos.  Watching movies is really nice.Trying to find an app that will download my songs from iCloud to Cloud is a challenge.  Downloading my pics a chore also.

In cahoots with the Amazon ecosystem, you have a device that is powerful and puts amazon's digital content at your fingertips.Some notable additions to this model:-The speakers are incredible. The sound is clear an loud, easily loud enough to fill a whole room. Listening to music and watching movies with friends on the go is better than any laptop or tablet experience.-Streaming is notably smoother.-HDMI out makes your kindle a portable streaming box you can take with you anywhere. For prime members this means taking the whole streaming library to anyone's house on their big screen TV.- The Amazon Ecosystem is a big turn off for some, but for Prime subscribers it's awesome. You have all the benefits of Prime at the touch of a button.-Physical buttons for sound.Some not-so-great things:-The buttons that were lacking on the last iteration of the device are way too flush with the unit, making it pretty hard to just press blindly.-The Power Button and Sound buttons are close together, making it pretty easy to put the Kindle to sleep when you just want to turn the sound down.-Limited App Store.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Forchildren", "ReviewID": "R39XMV5GV2N0I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my Kindle Fire HD!

Even if you have to spend extra on the wall charging adapter, this devise does almost everything I could ask from it.  It's not a desktop/laptop, so don't expect to be massively productive.  However, if you simply want a device that allows for you to surf the net, watch videos, and listen to music and have it easily accessible, this device is for you.  Cell phones certainly provide all of that, but clearly with a smaller screen.  The 7\" HD screen is beautiful and has not much of any glare issues.  Streaming videos and music is simple. The audio, as you've read everywhere else, is amazing, relative to all other portable devices of this nature.  For $200, you're getting a lot.  People will compare this to the iPad, which I cannot do as I don't own one, but I'd imagine that if you want to do more with a tablet, spend the extra $300+ and get an iPad, otherwise, if what I listed is all that you're looking for, don't spend the extra money and buy the Kindle Fire HD 7\".  The concept of value is different from person to person, so be objective when comparing this device with the iPad (and other tablets) and just know what you're looking for and what you can afford.

I made the decision to \"upgrade\" to this newest kindle because I also have the first Kindle Fire, but wanted better sound quality, more storage, and to be able to view it outside. Since I greedily pried it out of it's cozy and nicely constructed package? I have not stopped using it. Other reviewers are much more eloquent than I about all the technical \"stuff\"; and \"spot on\" in giving the HD praise about sound quality and visual crispness. Amazon design team has done a remarkable job creating this device! I have had the opportunity to compare this to the iPad 2.. and my kindle wins hands down. Or.. 2 thumbs up. ; ) In fact, I have given my older Kindle Fire away- chocked full of books and games. As much as I use this device for reading, playing games, watching movies, and.. yes, purchasing items from Amazon; I wish I could give it a 5 star rating. However, there is one design flaw that irritates me every time I am charging my device,, so I am mentioning it in this review. As others have mentioned, the power button is flush to the bottom of the device (probably because of the numerous complaints about the first model KF button getting inadvertently pushed off). I like this power button design.. but! I wish there was an indicator light on the power button to let me know when/ if device is charged. The battery icon in upper right corner is hard to estimate exactly how well charged the device is, so I downloaded the \"round circle number\" application to remedy this. Otherwise I would happily give this the superb rating it.. almost deserves. Also, if you are on a budget and find the price of the official protective case a bit too much?

My only big complaint is if in a movie you accidently hit the time line bar at the bottom of the screen it looses its place and it is damn hard to get back to where you were. I have managed to do this several times. With books because I tend to listen to books and follow reading. The time line at the bottom of the screen blocks the text.

I chose to buy it ($20).Advice to other reviewers: STOP complaining about how it's so tied to Amazon. It's a Kindle for pete's sake! The whole idea is to be tied to Amazon. Anyone who has ever had a Kindle knows that. Just as the Nook is tied to Barnes and Noble and iPad is tied to Apple. Get over it.  STOP comparing it to the iPad and to some extent the Nexus 7. Again, this is a KINDLE. Many of the things low reviewers are complaining about are things that are obviously going to be the case. of course Amazon wants to put ads on these devices. THAT is how they make their money, not the device itself. A lot of people actually like them. If you don't, pay your $15 and be done with it. It isn't going to have a rear facing camera or GPS. Again, IT'S A KINDLE! It wasn't designed to be a full fledged table but a multimedia consumption device. As such it does very well.

Chat applications work great (IE: Skype, KIK, Yahoo, Wireclub, AIM)6. Cloud sync uploaded all of my previous books from my Kindle applications (Windows 8X & Desktop applications)7. Sturdy and durable. Have two cats already it's been knocked off my nightstand a few times, doing great!8. Love that you can purchase the warranty along with the HD from SquareTrade.CONS (Very Minor):1. Definitely the on screen keyboard. Would like to change this out due to it completely trying to take over my whole screen. What's with the Jitterbug dinner plate sizing for each key? If you don't know what reference I am pointing to look up the Jitterbug phone. The buttons are like font size 72. Not sure how to resize the onscreen keyboard. Not even sure if that is an option at this point. Went and googled to see if it was didn't find much. Also no resize is available in the settings tab.2. (See #1) Id like to be able to resize and adjust my font overall. Not just for the books you download. Seems there is only an option for books.3. Silk is slow and my screen will stick sometimes. Silk browsing is for basic needs but I keep having to remind myself that I need to slow down with the demands and remember this is not my desktop. The Kindle is not a replacement for a desktop, laptop or even an iPad. It's a fun multi-media machine for people who are constantly on the go like jet-setters.The fact that anyone is even comparing it to an iPad (which I have seen on the reviews) isn't really fair to Kindle. I see some of the reviews yet again later today and people are still expecting it to function like a desktop. Come on people!4. More privacy options. Meh. Im the only one who handles my Kindle but there are some people who like to be \"hands on\" with your devices and fun toys.

Would like a way to organize my books but eh really isn't a must have. Just more over a suggestion.Personal complaint about myself: How come I always miss the awesome sales on the Kindle Fire HD? I bought it around Father's Day and noticed the day I bought it, the day after was a $20 markdown! Then today I get on to do a review and it's $30 off! DAMN IT! *Fist in air* Ah well. C'est la vie!I will say this is a must for mom's. I can see why the appeal is so great for people with kids. Talk about a life saver for those long car trips, day's at the beach, grandparents house, dinners, etc. Not a mom yet but if I was Id definitely have at least two around at all times to keep the kids from going bananas.If anyone has any answers to #1 & 2 on my Cons list let me know! Id love to get this squared away. Otherwise my cons are very minimal. I really, really like the Kindle Fire HD. Im a huge fan of all the books and media Amazon has made available. With that said I just became a member of Amazon Prime. About to watch my first movie and I can tell you right now I'm super excited!

I installed the \"Send to Kindle\" program on my desktop and I can just right click a file and pick \"Send to Kindle.\" The document is delivered by WiFi, no cable required. My Word documents are automatically converted to Kindle format, and I can copy PDF files and pictures too. There are so many ways to manage content on and off the device, in memory or in the cloud, that one could be overloaded with options.Of course, buying eBooks from Amazon and getting them delivered to the Kindle is trivially simple and fast, but many public libraries will let you check out eBooks for free, sometimes through Amazon, on your Kindle. Add to that many other free content sources like the Internet Archive and Project Gutenberg.I hook an HDMI cable from the Kindle to my HD TV and stream movies in HD right to the TV (or do it on my lap without a TV). I also sometimes browse the web that way when I want to show my wife some cool YouTube video or a photo.I also find the Kindle Fire HD just fine for browsing the Internet, reading email, sharing photos, and carrying documents around to meetings. It's just a great way to make my content portable. It's just the right size to carry around without getting in the way.Here are some suggestions to get more out of your Kindle Fire HD:1. Get the free ES File Explorer. This let you navigate your files and directories. One drawback to the Kindle is that there are so many ways to deal with content; you might not know whether something is a download or a book or a document. You can find it, install it, play it or view it with a click in ES File Explorer.2. The Dropbox app is one easy way to make your content portable, and share it on your smart phone, Kindle and PC. Once installed, you can go to web sites like Project Gutenberg and click on a Dropbox icon to move a book automatically to your devices.3. Check out dedicated apps for your common online activities: WordPress, Wikipedia, Facebook, Netflix, Twitter.4. Wireless headphones such as Creative Labs WP-300 Wireless Bluetooth Heaphones are great for watching movies without disturbing anyone.5. A great tool is the free PC program called Calibre that can convert content between different publishing formats. If you have content in a format that the Kindle doesn't support natively, chances are that Calibre can convert it (especially effective converting ePub) for the Kindle (or that you can find a free Kindle app that supports the format natively). Calibre can also maintain a library of content on your PC and your Kindle.Just about my only unfixable complaint is that it has no external storage. A micro SD card slot would have been just so nice. I hope that the PDF reader will be updated to support newer compression standards for scanned documents. It would be great if the Silk browser supported the Adobe Flash plug-in, and it would really be nice if one had access to the larger Android marketplace without hacking the system.I've bought a lot of gadgets since my first computer with 16K of memory. Some got used every day and some gather dust.

The kindle fire HD is just the fun, processing power, usefulness, and great help of the ipad in a more compact, much cheaper form.specifically, here is my opinion of the features.Look and feelThe device is light and the rubber/polycarbon/whatever (i dont know what the material is called)feels very comfortable to hold and has some grip to it. i like the sleek black and slender design of the device, but its a little annoying when trying to find the wake/sleep button. after a while you get used to it.Screenthe HD in kindle fire HD is no lie. pictures are beautiful, watching movies in Hd in a small package is AWESOME and the sensitivity from touch is excellent. i even have a thick screen protector on and notice no differene in the touch reaction.SoundDOLBY AUDIO IS A STAND ALONE FEATURE. the sound out of any handheld device speaker is usually not much to brag about, and even less for sound quality, unless you have a kindle fire Hd. the audio out of this device from music and video is exemplary, and definitely top of the list.SpeedInternet browsing is fast and the fact that the device organizes AND stores your most visited sites is a nifty featurette. i especially liked how it only took about 25 minutes to download a full movie from the store DIRECTLY to the device. my connection speed for my internet may have a bit of credit there, but still, its fast.Apps, entertainment, and productivityof course, 1/3 of the appeal of a tablet device is for mobile games, movies, apps, shows, and entertainment in many forms. while the amazon store does have the most popular and many of its own apps and games, the choices and selection is not as immense as the itunes store. however there are still plenty of free apps that are great and many more paid ones that are even better.Reading (duh)Kindles started as devices witht the sole purpose of storing dozens of books in one thin package. i read on both devices i owned, and definitely preferred the kindle fire HD's reading capability over the iPad's. if connected to the internet, many books will have pre-highlighted sentences and exerpts. These features are CRUCIAL to a student in highschool or college, since you can save those pages, find a certain quote, or reread important pieces.Performanceone major concern about tablet computers and smart devices is their technological capability. battery life on the Kindle Fire HD is pretty average to most others, but it can be optimized with the correct settings for a couple extra hours. it doesnt take too long to power on either, which is another bonus.CustomizationThe only major downside to this device is that it has extremely minimal options for personalization, excluding the addition of a case. There are 3 customization features this device has currently known to me. 1) you can choose to have advertisements as a lockscreen background  2)You can have a series of decorative pictures as your lockscreen background  3) \"(Your name's Kindle is displayed in the top left corner of the homescreen. there isnt any way to choose your own background picture or maybe change the internal color scheme. disappointed here.Overall ImpressionAll things considered, the 7\" Kindle Fire HD is a marvelous device with loads of features, making it a top contender as one of the best tablet devices currently available. in comparison to the iPad, my opinion leads toward the kindle. Personal reccomendations for accessories: The amazon Kindle fire hd standing leather case(advertised along with the device). It's a durable case that adds great protection, and its also designed to wake the kindle when the case is opened, and make it sleep when you close the lid. also, i recommend the Armorsuit Military shield screen protector. its not as easy to put on as other screen protectors, but i feel like i installed a force field generator. this thing absorbs impact and scratches, and over time the minor-medium scratches will disappear.i reccomend the Kindle Fire Hd 7\"!! and im sure that the 8.9\" Kindle Fire is just as good, with a bigger screen and possible 4G connection.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for International Customers", "Author": "Vidia Rampersad \"Vee\"", "ReviewID": "R38W04M9G7QY62", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you do not live in the US then please read the restrictions before buying and go to Kindle Support and read up the section on travelling outside of the US.For all the wonderful features the Kindle Fire HD may have, you will not be able to experience most of them as you cannot buy or access music, games, apps or most everything else besides books.I am very disappointed, but it is my fault for only reading the raving reviews and not the notification about using outside of the US up there next to 'In Stock'.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Should I get my kids the iPad or Kindle HD??", "Author": "Greenband", "ReviewID": "ROOGA2T0K42PQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some of you are probably trying to decide whether or not to buy your kid(s) an iPad (or iPad Mini) versus the 7\" Kindle HD.  Other reviewers have done a fantastic job of feature comparisons already, so this review will be subjective based on kid feedback.I've had every generation iPad for myself personally and my kids have used them all in addition to an iTouch.  For myself, I would never switch out my iPad 3 for a Kindle Fire.  The power/volume placement, weird screen rotations by apps, strange settings, difficulty sharing accounts on the same device, app selection for business, etc. make the Kindle Fire not a fit for me.  The top of the line iPad is a much superior device to Kindle Fire HD.  However, the iPad cost hundreds of dollars more and most casual users (consuming personal content, games, video, etc.) will never care about the differences.My kids care about 3 items in order of priority:* Games* Reading books* Occasional web browsingAfter lots of research I bought 2 7\" Kindle Fire HD devices instead of iPads.  The simple verdict - my kids love the devices and won't touch the iTouch or iPad devices lying around.  For younger kids (5-12), the 7\" size is perfect, screen is great, and app selection is fine.  The iPad is a superior device with a MUCH better app store, but they just don't care.

Spend the extra -- get the HD!", "Author": "Rene Rains \"Rene Rains\"", "ReviewID": "R23N39BX7LLJDK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being an iPhone owner, it took me some adjustment to get used to how the Fire works organizationally (Amazon's Carousel was totally foreign to me), but now that I've had my HD for a few months, and I am really enjoying the heck out of it!  The image quality is so SHARP that if it was on a big screen, it would look real.  The sound quality is so clear and distinct that at times it sounds like it's coming from behind you, or beside you, rather than just from the device (the tiny speakers have a bigger volume than my Toshiba laptop).  My favorite quality, though, is the ports.  I spent about $6 and ordered a cable from an Amazon vendor so I could plug it up to my HDMI port on my TV.  It is so much nicer watching a video on the television where everyone in the room can watch it with you.  If you do this, MAKE SURE you buy a cable that is MICRO PLUG (not macro -- there is a difference and macro WILL NOT fit) to HDMI.  I bought the 10' cable so I could plug it into the TV and sit on the couch with the Fire so if desired I could pause what I was streaming.  While streaming from my wifi to the Fire, there are times of slight distortion where the pixels are visible.  This is minimal, but is actually due to my internet because if I am not streaming through wifi but watching something that is on my Kindle, there is NO distortion whatsoever -- crystal clear picture.  While my Fire is hooked up to my TV and I'm streaming through wifi, if any distortion appears on the Fire, the distortion is more prominent on the TV.  But overall, this is VERY minimal, and usually just lasts a fraction of a second.  If you are streaming an Amazon video that has xray, and your Fire is plugged up to the TV, this xray information will appear on your Fire but will not carry over to your television via cable.  I bought the wall plug when I ordered the Fire so I could get it half price, and that is what I use to charge it.  I've never charged it using just the supplied USB cable, so I am unable to judge charging times.  If you're using an extension cord, the wall plug does get a little warm after being plugged in for awhile, and since I'm a little bit freaky about the house catching fire, I do not advise leaving it plugged into an extension cord while you're not home (have not noticed this heat if directly plugged into wall socket).  Something else I advise:  get a stylus.  They seem ridiculously priced, but I found a 3-pack on sale at a store and passed two out to fellow Kindle owners.  The stylus is great!!!  You can \"touch\" small items, and your screen stays fingerprint free!  I do not have a screen protector but I do have a case.  When buying a case, there is a difference in size in the regular Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD, so make sure the case you buy says it will fit HD!  My only real complaint is Flash.  I've tried to watch some flash videos, and I get the message that flash does not support the browser (which is Silk).  I have tried downloading the Flash player in other versions, but have been unable to find one that works.  This is something I would like to resolve, but it's above my computer knowledge.  I know I need to call Amazon (Amazon's customer service department is fantastic!), and I'm sure they can tell me how to resolve this, but I just haven't found the time yet.  I did not pay extra to have the ads removed, but the ads ONLY appear on the Lock screen, and as soon as you \"swipe\" to unlock it, the ad is gone.  The ads are not bothersome at all -- save those bucks to buy a HDMI-to-micro cable.  Here's one more trick.  I try to rook things around to save a few bucks.  The regular Kindles (e-readers) are free 2-day shipping, but the Fires (tablets) are not.  I knew I was going to buy Amazon Prime so I could stream, so I first bought Prime for $79/yr on one transaction, then I went back in and bought the Fire and wall plug on a second transaction so I could get Prime's free 2-day shipping on those items (since I pre-ordered the Fire, the plug was shipped earlier and I received it before the Fire).  I did end up \"losing\" about 3 days worth of Prime subscription because I ordered the Fire about 3 days before release date and my year of Prime started immediately upon order, but ended up saving in a long run because of the free 2-day shipping.  In short, buy the HD (not the regular), a stylus, and a micro-to-HDMI cable.  One more thing.  My friend has the first edition Fire.  She lost her charger while on vacation but had a charger to something else that fit the plug.  Now, her Fire won't charge.  Her brother is smart with electronics, and he told her that just because the charger fit doesn't mean it would work, and he told her she needed to buy another Fire charger and it would probably start charging again, but she hasn't done that yet.  A co-worker ordered a Fire (not HD) recently and didn't buy the charger because she said her Nook wall charger fits it.  I warned her what may happen.  Don't chance it, people.

After thirty years it is no longer possible for me to go to sleep at night without reading for a while first, but the arthritis in my hands is so bad that holding even a paper back for more than a few minutes was causing significant pain and numbness. The Kindle completely solves this problem for me (especially with the separately purchased cover that allows me to prop it up). But I'm so glad that I decided to go with the Fire HD, rather than the Paper White or original reader, as I am really enjoying watching Hulu Plus and Netflix with headphones during those times when it would disturb my husband (who works from home) to have the big TV going.

We got Kindle Touch as gifts last year, and quickly found out how easy-to-use & useful it is, so we thought we'd give the Kindle Fire HD a try.  It's great!  Easy to use, and boy is it handy for checking emails--even I could figure out how to set that up :-)  We'd recently \"unplugged\" from cable TV due to cost, and have been on \"free antenna\" service for the past couple of months.  We got Amazon Prime, and were thrilled to find that some TV shows we'd been missing are available, free, for Prime subscribers.  I got a Bluerigger HDMI cable to go with the Fire, and have plugged the Fire into the TV to watch the shows.  The clarity of the picture is outstanding--actually better resolution and \"watching experience\" than we got from our cable provider!  What a great device, and at a price we could afford.  We'd recommend this to absolutely ANYONE looking for an affordable, easy to use tablet.  Get Prime; you won't  be sorry you did.  ******* UPDATE, NOVEMBER 2013:  I've had this Fire for almost a year, and it's become indispensable.  We don't miss huge cable TV bills, and Prime video adds new offerings all the time.  I also check email and Facebook much more frequently than I did on computer, because it's so convenient.

I will never be accused of being an early adapter or tech nerd, nor do I still watch standard definition TV or use dial up.  If you are on the fence about making the leap to a tablet, you can not go wrong with the Fire HD.  I purchased the product when it first came out, and decided to actually use it and put it through the paces I would need to have it handle before writing this review.First, the picture and display is wonderful.  From other tablets I have seen and looked at, it is only surpassed by the new ipads that cost 2-3 times as much.Second, it is easy and intuitive to use.  Don't let the fixed ads scare you.  They are only on the start up page and no where else.  If you absolutely can not live with it, simply use the opt out option when ordering.Third, the touch screen works well and I have had no problems.Fourth, the sound is great for such small speakers.  I have streamed many shows that are in stereo and they sound great.Fifth, the web browser and speed works fantastic as well.  It has no problem picking up wi-fi in any area it is available.  The included skype app works perfect as well.Sixth and last, if you are an Amazon Prime member, the Fire HD is a no brainer.  The seemingly limitless amount of content at your fingertips is amazing.  Not to mention ordering things to be shipped from Amazon is easier as well.Overall, I could not be happier. Yeah, some geek can sit and disect it and pick someting apart that the Fire HD may not have, but at the end of the day if you just want a simple dependable portable device for surfing the web, playing games, watching streaming content and skyping with family and friends the Fire Hd is the best deal out there.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "au812", "ReviewID": "RW4AD3E4ABLS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been debating on an E-reader for awhile now and was waiting for the new Kindles to make a debut!

Let's go through some major features:SCREEN: This is where Amazon put their money, obviously. The color saturation is nice and the pixel density is great. The bezel makes holding it a breeze. It's also very sensitive ... maybe too much? I've accidentally pressed buttons just by brushing them as I move my finger to scroll. Regardless, it's definitely a good screen for the price range.BUILD: I bought a case for mine, so the backing doesn't get put to much use, but it is nice. Unlike other reviews, I don't see a problem with the siding - you get what you pay for; don't expect iPad quality for Kindle price. The screen is nice, but I get the feeling without a case it would shatter easy. Also unlike other reviews, I'm not bothered by the buttons for power and volume. They're easy to find and use, and subtle enough to look good.PERFORMANCE: This is where I ran into a problem. When I first opened my Kindle it didn't take long at all to start. This morning it was lagging a bit. I was not impressed. If that's what a couple games do to its speed, I shudder to think what a movie would do. I also seem to have difficulties watching some Youtube videos. I'm not sure if that's the Kindle or not. The games run good, though the advertisements do get in  the way sometimes. I had to download an app to get a better idea of my battery life, though. Once again: not impressed - that should come standard. Web browsing is decent, not too fast though. But let's be fair, it's a tablet, not a full-sized computer. Overall it's good quality.CAMERA: Oh, dear. Umm... major letdown . I knew it wouldn't be a good one, being only 1.3 megapixels  but this is sad. If the screen is where the money is, I think the camera was an afterthought, if that. Amazon, you seriously couldn't have sprung for a bit better? I think my Tracfone has a better camera on it, I'd have to check. The video quality is grainy at best, and it's almost an insult considering how much went into the screen. It's passable, considering its only use right now is Skype.

I bought the Fire HD mainly for reading, so I haven't done much web surfing or anything else with it. One problem I ran into with an arts and crafts book was that the book contained a couple of basic sketches that I was supposed to trace and then use for a project. I have the Kindle reader app on my notebook computer, so I opened the e-book to that drawing, taped a sheet of tracing paper over the display and traced the picture. That was somewhat awkward, but it worked out.I've subscribed to a couple of digital magazines that get delivered to my Fire HD; when I opened up one magazine up and saw the page view I was afraid I had made a mistake by subscribing but I quickly discovered the zoom capability, which makes it easy to read the fine print.Although I have been accustomed to organizing my e-books into collections and that feature isn't available on the Kindle Fire HD, I still think the Kindle Fire HD is a fine product.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "cowan98", "ReviewID": "R275LWWMB8VVY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got for my child who is nine and we have been very, very happy.

One more thing to point out here, the way the airlines are now charging for overhead bin space you can put this in duffle bag under your seat and no charge!!! The only thing I think I would have liked more clarity on is do you charge battery before using or did it come precharged.

The multicolored ink is attractive on the Fire's screen, live links can be accessed online in seconds, and paragraphs are shared easily via Facebook or Twitter.  I really enjoy reading on this e-reader.But the Kindle does so much more.  I've already purchased several songs, Paul Tough's new e-book, and a Rolling Stones' music video easily from Amazon; all were delivered instantly, showing up on my Kindle in no time.  Amazon had it right to position the new Fire as a \"doorway\" to access--and promote--all its products.  Furthermore, on a recent airplane trip west, the Kindle fit, albeit snugly, in my sportcoat patch pocket and provided access to the internet--and my e-book--on the road.  Battery life is long, lasting all day between charges.  Most unexpectedly, the new Fire screen displays downloaded iPhone photos beautifully: what a gorgeous e-photo album it is!

Using the Internet was painfully slow.  Streaming videos was out of the question.  I could watch only a few minutes of a video before I would get kicked off the Internet by my router, and even then, the video was poor quality.  Even downloading apps was an exercise in frustration.  Mostly, the device was good for reading books, which could be done on a cheaper Kindle device.All of that changed when I replaced my old router with a new, high-speed, dual-band router.  Now, I am very excited about my Kindle Fire HD!  It's starting to replace my laptop for tasks like browsing the Internet or checking my e-mail.  I love using it to listen to Pandora radio, enjoy YouTube videos, or watch Netflix or Amazon Prime videos.  The video and sound are great, especially when I use a pair of nice over-the-ear headphones.The Amazon app store helps make this device fun.  I've gotten several free games.  Most of them are demo versions or have in-game ads, but I can't really complain when getting free entertainment.  With the touch screen, game play is enjoyable and intuitive.Of course, I still love the KFHD for reading.  The glowing screen is perfect for reading in bed at night without having to turn on a light and disturb my husband.  Downloading old, copyright-free books is easy via Amazon.  I also have Amazon Prime, which allows me to choose a book each month from the Kindle Owners' Lending Library.  The library is not as extensive as I would like, but it has some good choices.My biggest complaint about the KFHD is the \"on/off\" button. It's black, flat, and very difficult to find.  I always spend at least half a minute looking for it.  I understand that the virtually invisible buttons make the device look sleek and futuristic, but I would prefer a colorful button that's easy to find.To sum it up, this device is everything it's cracked up to be... as long as you have a good, fast router.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does what it's meant to do", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R1QW683ERID0ST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I tend to research things a lot before buying them.  I waffled back and forth between this and the nexus 7 for a while, but eventually I went for the KFHD 7\" 16GB tablet because I am a Prime member and wanted something that would stream instant videos from Amazon.  My receiver had a free HDMI port so this worked out well for me.  The nexus 7 doesn't have a micro-hdmi, and while there are ways around that this was just better for what I need.  I have a dual band n router which works wonderfully with the KFHD.  I haven't had a movie drop or skip yet.  I have played some online games on this and have yet to get the boot or experience much lag.  It's great for books.  The battery life seems slightly better than my wife's old KF.  The screen looks great.That being said, it is noticeably slower than the nexus 7.  My mother in law let me use hers for some time and it is a sweet device.  It is more responsive, faster, and has a ton more app options than the KFHD.  In the end, if it wasn't for the prime membership and streaming content you can get with the KFHD, it's no contest.  The Nexus 7 is better.  However, for me the KFHD does what I want better than the Nexus 7 would do.One star off for the crappy processor and borked/forked version of ICS.

Let's get one point very clear: This is NOT a tablet computer, in the regular sense... With that stated, here are the pros and cons, from our perspective:Pros:Beautiful displayClear beautiful soundFast operationEasily connected to a WPA2 wireless (secured) networkCons:  *Web browser will not interface with banking institution...In fairness, part of this lies in the fact that my bank has not written support for Amazon's browser. However, a browser needs to meet certain specifications in order to be considered 'secure.' We are talking, after all, about our money...  *Not configurable to tasteWhile I fully understand that the ads are there to compensate for a lower price, let's place some perspective on this: the price difference is $15.00. For me, that's 1/2 an hour at work. For many, it's much more than that. What do you get, in exchange for your $15 discount? You get a lot of Amazon 'educated guesses' on what ads they think would most entice you into purchasing more products through them. I, personally, do not consider the fact that my wife cannot configure her browser as she wishes it to be, even if the extra $15 were paid.  *The interface may be BASED on Android, but this is not an Android tabletThe Kindle is to tablets what Verizon is to wireless communication devices: proprietary control designed to push you toward purchasing more product controlled by the 'owner' of the operating system. Just as Verizon bastardizes the Android operating system to make sure that they are in as much control of your usage as possible, Amazon has followed suit with the Kindle and actually prevents any true customization. Again, this is not a 'Tablet PC.' This is a book reader with great display and extra features.  *Purchased keyboard/carrying case was not even recognized.I am an electronic gadgets junkie. I am also an enterprise deployment engineer for a major computer solutions provider. I can script and automate most administrative functions of of an enterprise deployment of a business computer OS installation, and make it compatible (out of the box) with multiple platforms. If I have to fumble through several screens in order to try (and fail) to connect an USB keyboard, how is the average user going to feel?  *Any app you use is automatically added to your carousel.While for many people this might be a god-send, neither my wife nor I consider this a feature. We consider it a nuisance. Kindle simply wants to make far too many decisions for the consumer. We are not sheeple in this house, and are quite capable of thinking for ourselves...  *Either charging or keyboard, never both.The Kindle provides only one USB (micro) port, which means you can never use an external keyboard, and be charging the unit, simultaneously. for those like my wife that don't like virtual keyboards, this is definitely a drawback. For something that is billed as being as useful as Amazon claims the Kindle to be, there are some severe limitations that prevent this unit from being classified by anything other than a glorified book reader.Summary:  While the Kindle is not a bad product, in and of itself, it did not fit our needs. Neither did it fulfill our expectations (based on advertising descriptions) of a tablet PC. I have built every computer I have owned, from the motherboard up. I am not technically impaired. With the Kindle in my hands, I felt very much like I was begging for the right to make decisions for myself, and still being declined. This very well may be useful for people that do a lot of reading, but it is definitely not worth the $300 we ended up spending. It took less than an hour to decide to send this back.Perspective:  It is not my desire to belittle the product. The two stars are not indicative of the product, but more how the product failed to fit our specific needs. Others may have a different experience, based on their specific needs. However, We are very solid to ourselves when we stated that the Kindle is definitely not worth the asking price.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bump in the road", "Author": "Thomas M.

That they need to corner just their app store...Honestly right now I wish I would have bought another 7\" tablet and just downloaded the Amazon apps to it, instead of getting the limited, dare I say timid Kindle Fire HD.

It worked great for prime movies for our 3 year old on or vacation. She loves it. She's still a bit more comfortable using some of the kids apps on an android phone, but it's probably just easier for her to handle at 3.The text to speech is really absurd.

This device allows you to read your eBooks, magazines and newspapers. However, it is much more than that. You can also surf the net if you are connected to Wi-Fi, and you have the option to download and watch your favorite movies or television shows in high definition. Additionally, you can download and play your favorite games. Amazon also now offers the Kindle Fire HD that is 8.9 - inches and an 8.9 - inch version that also offers 4G.This eBook Reader has an LCD, high-definition 7-inch display, measured diagonally. Additionally, it offers the best resolution on our lineup at 1280 x 800. This screen will bring your movies to life while still allowing you an excellent reading experience. Weighing in at 13.9 ounces with a 7.6 x 5.4-inch facade and a 0.41-inch thickness, the Kindle Fire HD is still small enough to throw in your backpack and take just about anywhere with you. This device also comes with a 1.2GHz dual-core processor and dual-band, dual antennas. This allows you to download your content much quicker than older versions could. Additionally, the Kindle Fire HD comes with Dolby audio as well as dual-driver speakers, which creates a surround sound effect.One of the great options that the Kindle offers to its users is its dedicated content server. This allows you to shop on Amazon.com and download any book you like at any hour of the day. Amazon currently offers over a million different book titles that you can purchase. Additionally, it offers a lending library for its Prime members. Being a Prime member requires you to pay an annual fee to Amazon, but you will have several perks such as borrowing eBooks from the lending library with no return date. You can also stream videos instantly on your Kindle Fire HD.Amazon also offers you the ability to download textbooks for students. Currently, it has over 150,000 different textbooks available with more being added every day. Using the Kindle Fire HD for textbooks is a simple way to keep all of your books in the same place, without taking up a lot of space in your dorm room or backpack.Amazon offers over 208 different newspapers, which are available for download on your eBook reader. Some of these newspapers include The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The Washington Post, just to name a few. Additionally, you have the option to download magazines as well. You can choose from over 400 different magazine titles. The digital magazine subscriptions are much cheaper than a mail subscription, and you can download your magazine almost instantly and begin enjoying it.For those of you who enjoy reading and keeping up on blogs, the Kindle Fire HD will help you to do that as well. Amazon offers thousands of blogs that you can become a part of using your eReader. You can find a Kindle blog on just about any topic that interests you, including news, entertainment, sports, science topics and more. Some blogs are free to join, however many also charge a monthly subscription price of a dollar or two.Memory/Battery Life:9.8/10Because high-definition media files are larger than average, the current Kindle Fire HD comes with your choice of either 16GB or 32GB of memory to ensure that you have enough space to download and enjoy your favorite content. Amazon also allows you to store anything that you purchase through its site on the Amazon Cloud at no additional cost.The standard battery life of the Kindle Fire HD is 11 hours for surfing the net, reading or watching videos. However, battery life is also affected by other factors such as downloading content and your preferred settings. You can choose to charge your device by plugging it into your computer with a USB cable or plugging it into a wall outlet.Additional Features:9.8/10Because this eReader also functions as a tablet, it comes with an LCD display. You can select the brightness of your screen; however, you do not have the traditional gray scale levels that are on the older Kindle models. The LCD screen offers you more choices when selecting the best brightness level for your eyes.The Kindle Fire HD offers a host of new features never before available on an eReader. This new eBook reader offers X-Ray for both movies and books. The new X-Ray feature allows you to tap the screen during movies and it will bring up the list of actors that you are currently viewing. It also allows you to view other movies in which the actors star in as well. X-Ray for books allows you to look up character information such as biographies and information from Wikipedia.Summary:The Kindle Fire HD is a completely new experience for eBook readers. The device allows you to view your movies in the best quality HD we have seen on an eReader, while also allowing you the best options for reading. The new X-Ray feature for searching information on actors and searching Wikipedia for book information allows the Kindle Fire HD to really stand out.

It replaces my second gen Ipad. Is it a clone of a iPad? No, they both offer different capabilites, but as a consumer consumption device, it fits my idea of a tablet. What i like about it: I like the small size and lighter weight vs my iPad. Yes, the iPad mini is out now, but its way more expensive and I dont need thousands of apps from iTunes. I am a long time Amazon book customer, so obviously this tablet is about Amazon books foremost.  Its nice to see that there is a large selection of apps now available through the appstore. Didnt used to be that way and was a deterrent to buying one.  It works fine on my home wi-fi. One quirk i noticed that there is a bug where when i switched back from sepia mode to white background, the background stayed sepia but the lettering turned black instead of the darker sepia coloring lettering. I frankly liked it a lot better. The white background tends to have a yellowish tinge to it, so the sepia colored background and black lettering is easier to read. Getting around on this unit is a little clunky compared to the iPad, but I suspect I will get used to it. I do like the reader feature on the e-magazines and websites where available. Lack of a notebook was puzzling so I use my Evernote for notes. Printing via wi-fi? Not an option but will find an app that will allow me to do that, I am sure. Email was simple and easy to set up. Skype is available to face to face video calls. No back camera like the iPad. Battery life is impressive. I used it all day yesterday including a 2 hour video, interent , mail etc, and still was only down to 50% this morning, so very very nice. So bottom line, you want a book reader? internet capabilites? email? Skype? then this unit will fill the bill and half as expensive as the iPad plus i have 32gb of memory instead of the 16gb I had on my iPad.

The display is just incredibly amazing vs. the original Kindle Fire. Did I say it was amazing? Yea, I did. It is AMAZING!2. The battery life is much better with wi-fi on or off (in my emperical observations about 25-50% better).3. You can actually determine what your side-loaded videos are without playing them. The picture is much bigger and hold-touching the picture brings up full details. Yea!4. 32 GB of data storage (actually more like 29 GB, where did the other 3 GB go? :)).5. Smoother and faster response due to the processor upgrade.The improvements I like least:1. I miss the light on the power button. Now I'm never sure if the device is charged without turning it on.2. I actually liked the outdented power button. Yea, I did hit it accidentally a few times, but it was much easier to find when I was sleepy and done reading for the night.3. The recharge USB connector on the left side instead of the bottom. I use a Marware case and with the old Kindle Fire I could just plug it in. Now I have to open the case and plug it on on the left. Please move it back to the bottom?4. To me the volume buttons are useless.  Actually maybe the power button is useless too? This is a touchscreen device, there is a volume control easily accessible on the screen.  Maybe power can just be done by having a touch power off (big for when I'm sleepy :))? Touching the screen could then turn it on (at least for a few seconds until you unlock? Then just a charge light would be needed. I would really like that.Just as an FYI, I got the 32 GB version because I like to sideload videos and I paid the extra $15 to get rid of the lock screen ads.One last comment, I really liked another review where the person stated there are other much better general purpose devices out there, but I use this device for entertainment and content consumption, so for me it is the best device on the market.

The improved display, the much better sound and the somewhat better Wifi all contribute that verdict.  The only negatives are:* No Flash - not Amazon's fault and hopefully this will be fixed eventually - all new Androids are affected. I guess I could add another browser.* I miss the LED on the on/off button that told me if the old Fire was charging or fully charged.  Of course some people hated the very sensitive button/LED located on the base of the old Fire so maybe they had to move it - still a LED would be nice.* The server seems slow at times.  I have bought apps that have taken over 6 hours to appear on the Fire HD even though they were listed immediately on \"items you have purchased\".  This was never a problem on the old Fire.* Items deleted from the carousel have sometimes mysteriously reappear.* The commercials are not unduly obtrusive.

Fortunately, it DID make it to my mother.  She loves her Fire!After having a Kindle gen 2, and then an HTC Thunderbolt with the Kindle App...and being so comfy with the Thunderbolt Kindle App that I was reading on it 100%, I sold my Kindle gen 2.Was waiting for a Fire that had HDMI output and the HD did so I bought.  It is beautiful and I like it!Now... I live in rural northwest Montana and by choice have no cable or SAT TV.  I also have no wired DSL, but use Vmobile Hotspot on my Thunderbolt and a MIFI device for internet.  Currently, only 3G.  4 stars because the 3G streaming is marginal vs my ROKU box which does fine.  I'm guessing the ROKU has built in capability for buffering/memory ??  I tested at the same time(s) on each device.  When I go to \"town\" where there is 4G, the Fire streams and downloads like \"fire\".  I should have 4G at my home fairly soon so just a waiting game.  Not sure I will use the HDMI as the Kindle screen is wonderful and it is just me so will probably just watch movies, etc. on the Fire.I still read most on my phone but since the Fire gives me access to the lending library will use that as well.Sound is excellent...LOVE the sound...how did they do that???The Fire is just large enough that I am happy with most sites via Web vs my phone which is too small for most.  I have bookmarked favs and like the mobile access to them.I think that sums it up.  For me, the Fire HD is the exact right size with all of the wireless stuff I want, i.e. internet portability in exactly the right size.  Between the Fire and my phone, I am mobile-y happy!***EDIT 10/18/2012I continue to be very happy with the HD Fire after nearly a month's use.  I have not had a single issue with anything not working correctly.  I am enjoying video, music and quick access to the internet anywhere - my phone is a Wi-Fi hot spot or if I'm in town, I have lots of options for wi-fi connecting.  I often have some items queued for download and while I'm grocery shopping, they automagically come to the Fire!  The more I use it, the more comfortable I am with the navigation.Reading:  Although I typically am still using my phone for reading...just habit, I have sampled magazines and cookbooks and very much like how they appear on the Fire.  I have a case which allows vertical and horizontal \"standing\" so it works very well in the kitchen following a recipe.I did unsubscribe from ads and do like not having them - well worth the extra $15 to me.  The screen saver and recommendations at the bottom of the screen do not bother me and I have often found other things I \"need\" :) - I will probably not remove them when we are able.In addition to just being very happy with the device, I still feel like it is a bargain, especially as an Amazon Prime member.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big step for Amazon.", "Author": "D.Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R3NMIUFDE4QWRF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kindle Fire HD is a strong competitor for tablets like The Nexus 7.

Also the camera, I am happy there is one, yes, but you can pretty much say there isn't one because you can only use it for Skype and only Skype. I guess Amazon hasn't developed Albany feature for the camera to use for fun. But its still a good addition for skyping. Overall those are really the only things that I have a problem with.

I have had this device now for a couple of days and have been trying out the various features while testing the battery life. I was concerned with some of the reviews regarding the glare and weight of the device. Personally, I had no problem with those. I actually enjoy the weight of HD because I have a better grip and it feels more natural (kind of like a book). I found that I had difficulty gripping the keyboard kindle because it is so thin. I also took the HD outside, directly into the sunlight and found that with a few adjustments to the brightness/background settings,reading was quite pleasant. In fact, I rather like the ability to be able to change the background color on my books. With that said, I do miss the battery life I have with my other kindle but realize that with a tablet there is a tradeoff.

You can tell they have put some thought into the packaging design so it doesn't take lots of space, or filled with plastic bags yet the content is still being protected. There is still plastic in the packaging, but it was kept impressively minimal.The other thing is what most of people complained about: the power adapter. Amazon provides only a USB cable in the box. It can be plugged into your computer or any USB charger you can buy for less than 10 bucks anywhere. This is definitely a step toward the right direction. Think about it, over the years, how many different chargers you have collected with the electronic gadgets you purchased. After the electronics become obsolete after six months, those chargers will just end up in the landfill. Using the standard USB charger benefits the consumers as well, it's exchangeable and can be easily replaced so you don't have to spend a fortune if you lose your original one.

It doesn't seem as intuitive as some other tablets I've used, but it may just be my unfamiliarity with it. I'm embarrassed to say I spent about half an hour trying to find the settings. They are in the pull down menu from the top of the screen; there is no icon for it. The beginning instructions showed me that, but I forgot. It is a bit hard to hold. I'll be getting a case very soon. That should resolve the finding the power button and ease of holding issues. I'd heard it was Facebook integrated, but there wasn't an icon for that either.

There are ads when you turn it on, but they aren't obnoxious or obtrusive.The carousel on the home menu is great. It automatically adds your most recent applications to the front.

If you want a tablet that provides endless amount of entertainment and media options, delivered to you quick and simple while always looking for new book, movies, or game suggestions that might interest you, the Kindle Fire HD is absolutely perfect.  Regarding the first point, given that this is the 2nd generation of Fire tablets I feel that this device should no longer be docked a star for lacking things like the full Google Play store.  Amazon has fully established that this is a different beast, and really focuses completely on delivering a massive amount of media to the user.  In that regard, it excels.As an owner of the previous Kindle Fire, the new version is an upgrade in every facet.  The resolution is higher and the screen looks far sharper and clearer, delivering a much more pleasant quality across the board, whether it be reading books or watching HD movies.  The sound output has significantly been upgraded, so that finally there's a portable device that can put out sound that everyone in the room can hear, something my other portable devices or laptops can't do.  The faster processor and additional RAM onboard has resulted in a far smoother, snappier UI.  The carousel now flips through your recently used content without the lag in the original Fire, making it easy to pick and choose applications without missing any screen presses.  Need more memory to load your own content?  16 or 32 GB is far better then 8 GB, where I felt limited as to what I could load on my Fire.  As for the device itself, while the width of the device is increased slightly, the thinner size and additional bezel actually make it more comfortable to hold in both portrait and landscape modes for reading or viewing content.  For current Fire owners, the upgrade is well worth the money as the Fire HD just delivers a more complete and pleasant experience because of the upgraded hardware.  Technical spec listings are great, but all people need to know is that Amazon has released a far more refined version of what they wanted to do last year, and it definitely shows when using the device.The UI is also tweaked from the original Fire, as this comes out as version 7.1.5 versus 6.3.3 on the old Fire.  The categories at the top have been revised to focus on content, adding links like Shop and Audiobooks to the menu.  Below the carousel where \"favorites\" used to automatically sit now show suggested content.  Recently on a news webpage?  It now shows trending articles.  Recently played Angry Birds?  It now suggests other games like Where's My Perry or Cut the Rope.  Just watched Thor via Amazon Prime Streaming?  It also suggests Captain America and Iron Man.  Like I said, Amazon is trying it's hardest to send content your way, and the Fire HD delivers it without being too obtrusive.  I could do with the small text at the bottom left corner telling me to read Harry Potter for free with Amazon Prime, but that's a minor annoyance that could go away depending on how that changes with my usage patterns.As for Games, it doesn't seem like too many of my existing games support Amazon's new GameCircle feature that adds achievements and friends.  I see Jetpack Joyride, Cut the Rope, and Temple Run with it though and its kind of neat for those that play a lot of games on the device.Yes the web browser defaults to Bing search.  Yes, you can easily change it to Google from the Settings. :)And finally... while yes, there are ads on the lock screen, I also was able to receive a free $5 Amazon MP3 credit.  I can live with a few Ultrabook or Titanic movie ads in return.  It might not be as elegant as the images of records or patterns like on the old Fire, but if Amazon wants to give me more free credit periodically, I'd gladly take the half second to glance at the ads before unlocking my device.Overall, an incredibly fine device.

First, I choose Kindle Fire because of all the great positive reviews, price, and ease of downloading items from the Amazon Store.I travel alot of work and use the Kindle mostly during these periods of time.  I'm not a heavy user and only have 5 books downloaded, 1 game, and three movies. I use it mainly to check email, Facebook, and access other areas of the internet to keep me occupied when traveling.My main issues with the Kindle are these:1.  The USB cable has to fit a certain way in the Kindle in order for it to properly charge. Trust me, I know how to but a USB cable into the Kindle, but once in, I may have to prop the Kindle on top of a book or maniuplate the cable somehow to charge. I've tried other cables and the same thing happesn.2. The Kindle freezes on me ALOT!!  While clicking on links (even in the AMAZON STORE) I have to click on a URL several times to get the link to unfreeze or I have to wait several minutes.  This happens all the time. I don't understand how people cannot find this frustrating.I see people using other tablets with no problems.  They swipe the pages, click on links, and charge without any issues.Just really not happy with the product.

Weigel \"Donna Weigel\"", "ReviewID": "R3OBD1SWMAC812", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Let's face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn't really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn't work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don't by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn't have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn't organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It's a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn't bad. It's simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn't as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don't think this is a big issue to most people.  I'm dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can't read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn't an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn't last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn't needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn't bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I'm just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn't care to pay to not have them. I'm really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I'm glad I didn't. I don't need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don't.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn't for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I'm sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.  It seems about a year is when the big price change happens.Good luck with your new decisions!", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "the things my granddaughter likes and dislikes about her kindle", "Author": "Clinton Thompson", "ReviewID": "RXI8110PD5E3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this was gotten for my granddaughter and she is not to happy with it.,.She thought it was bigger and have 2 cameras not one.She does like the fact that she can talk to her father on Skype she says she can live with it for now ,its all her mother could afford for now.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "No problems!", "Author": "Igotthejoy", "ReviewID": "RUAZO9XCFEVXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got these for my kids because refurbished was cheaper.

They use the working parts and make a refurbished device. It works like any new one, but it is not brand new. This means that it is 'like new'. If you're looking for a cheaper Kindle Fire HD(tm) for a child, a relative, a gift to someone, or your husband/wife you cannot go wrong with this. This device is either a 16GB for $129.00 w/offers $144.00 without offers or a 32GB for $159.00 with or $174.00 w/o offers. However, they are not that intrusive if you want to pay $15.00 for it to be shut off to make it a unsubsidized Kindle Fire(tm). If you want to only see special offers when you want to, you'll have to pay for the ability to control it.Some complain about the \"customers who bought this also bought\" under the carousal, I do not know why it's a problem since it is really not intrusive. This is a great starter Kindle(tm) or a toy for the techno-geek in all of us. The only thing is there is no MAYDAY button and help is only by e-mail/site/phone. I have to say that Amazon's Kindle(tm) team is par none to any other tech support. They are the only customer service that is excellent with helping you and they do not talk down to you like some of the other companies.The 2013 version that replaced this as a new device has a sharper display, more color rich, and doesn't have a camera/mic but a slightly higher speed processor. This has the front facing camera and mic so you can Skype. The cost difference is $40.00 for the new HD 16GB. It is $10.00 more for the 8GB version. 8 GB is a lot for a book reader however if you are a gamer, then you should buy the 16 GB version, or buy the 32GB version of this which is $159.00/$174.00 with/without offers. If you have an older kindle that is broken you can trade it in for this kindle with a 20% discount ($103.20/127.20 16/32GB) There's one more thing, Amazon's Kindle Support is the best. Amazon goes above and beyond to satisfying the owners of Kindles. In addition, the regular customer service is just as good. In a world of customer disservice, they are by far the best.

The build feels solid and heavy in a good way, the back is wrapped in great textured coating making if feel less likely to slip, and the bezel and glass look good. The rocker button for volume and on/off are conveniently located on the side, and it has two inputs for Micro USB and a very convenient Micro HDMI output.Start up and registration is simple if your a prime member, and downloading apps although severely limited is easy. I had the original kindle fire and sold it because I couldn't stand that the carousel added history for EVERYTHING, which cluttered the simple starting screen. It looks like Amazon is continuing the line with this which is unfortunate. Everything you open or read will be put in the carousel making it cluttered and unusable, but for my mother-in-laws expected use this will be fine.The software still feels buggy, and hesitates when scrolling and loading, making it feel much slower than it's competitors. Using the Silk browser is still just okay, it's still slow and the user experience hasn't really improved over the Kindle fire gen1. Moving music over from either the cloud or USB was fast and simple, and at refresh the album art was loaded.The picture is clear and beautiful and the stereo speakers are among the best sounding in any tablet I have ever used. Amazon did a bang up job on the audio, so much so I would love to use this tablet if they would ship a version with vanilla Android (not going to happen) with a completely add free experience.Here are some things to consider. This is a great simple tablet. It only comes with a USB cable and not a charger, so be aware of that. It does come with a front end camera but no camera app. I believe this is intended for Skype usage. Recommendations are pretty heavy but can be turned off in settings. Ads haven't been an issue so far but let's wait and see. It's a bit heavy to use as an e-reader so stick with the original Kindle.Now, if the iPad and some other tablets like the Nexus (although I question their first gen screen fracture problems) this tablet would rate much higher. I give it 3.5 stars, but since this is not an option it stays at 3. Price did not factor into the rating, or this would be at 4 stars.Overall this is a solid tablet that has its quirks and amazing qualities.

I bought this for my 8 yr old. Amazon does have the Kindle FreeTime App for parental control. However Kindle FreeTime is soarly lacking. What I expected from a topnotch company like Amazon/Kindle is content profiles and apps streamlined for both parent use and/or kid use. Instead, when I bought this device for my child I now find out that it's going to be a hassle EVERY TIME just to ensure that she doesn't see my Amazon Contents and purchases instead of her own kid-friendly stuff. Here is why I say the Kindle has proven to be Not So Kid Friendly and Versatile:1 - (This is huge) Kindle FreeTime does not startup automatically. As a result, my child has to bring the device to an adult every time she starts it up so that we can safely navigate past the Adult themed Amazon account we have for buying everything from movies, music and Christmas presents for the kids to get her logged in to the safe Kindle FreeTime profile. For as much advertising out there that Kindles are great for kids, it seems like a no brainer to create a feature that automatically loads up the kids' stuff, not Mom and Dad's stuff at startup. Netflix finally figured it out...anytime now Amazon.2 - Content is what Kindle is really all about right? Want to let your child listen to MP3's in their Kindle FreeTime profile? Perhaps some Raffi MP3's or Kid's Bop? Sorry, they can't listen to MP3's in Kindle FreeTime. Ironically, I can choose which books, videos or apps to share from my Main (Adult) Amazon account, so if I want to share my Season 2 of Hell On Wheels or Steven King Thriller with the kiddos, the Kindle FreeTime app makes them just a button away. But sorry, Raffi is a No-Go. But wait, it gets worse - have a county library system that will loan you books for your voracious kid reader?...Guess what, in the Kindle freetime App, they can't read borrowed books! So again, my 8 year old ends has to be in my adult profile to read the borrowed book and some of the titles I read just aren't suitable for kids! Seriously Amazon?Hopefully, Amazon is working quickly on these issues (and I DON'T mean by only making it available on the newest Kindle device). In the meantime, unlike a Leapster, or some of the other Kid's Electronics devices, Kindle and Kindle FreeTime App is not so hassle free for Kid Friendly features.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really like the Kindle Fire HD but now not so sure about longevity.", "Author": "TriTroy", "ReviewID": "R1YX8V0ND9QPM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Note at end regarding a failure of one of the two kindles.  Have had these since Nov 2012.My wife an I really like these tablets.  We also have an iPad.  The Kindle is a really great size for portability.  I don't use it for movies though I think it would be good also.  We do use it for a number of apps like; calendar, email, games, etc.  Lots of apps avail from Amazon or through third parties using their apk files.  Google how to use with Kindle if you need to use these.  Great color and no issues ever with graphics.  Sound is fine but better of course with earphones.  Our kids use them almost every day as well so they've been pretty durable.  Never had an issue with the storage capacity yet on this 32GB unit.  I also use this for magazine and books.  I've had very good luck and like the reading experience on the Kindle Fire HD though others have indicated less than stellar experiences.  I suspect this was due to the publisher though, not doing a very good formatting job for the tablet.  I use the Kindle much more than the iPad due to the size and the number of free apps avail.  Overall, very happy with the Kindle Fire HD.Got two of these... his/hers.  Well after one year and 18 days, hers quit working.  Yep the warranty is one year.  She, was not happy.  Having already attempted a hard reset (more than once), the screen was blank and stayed that way.  Amazon tech basically had me do more resets with the power cord attached and not attached. No workee.  Thanks to Amazon though, they replaced it anyway.  Don't know for sure if the fact that we purchase a fair amount of stuff through Amazon and are Prime members and have been customers since 1998 made a difference but the rep did indicate this was a factor in the replacement after the warranty expiration.

In my opinion the way you close out apps is weird as I keep thinking the bottom option should be remove from carousel but it's actually uninstall. Amazon is real strict with what apps you use on your device so app selection is very limited. Facebook is the only major social site that actually has an app released for it. Twitter, youtube, and instagram don't have offical apps available so you'll have to use 3rd party apps for the web browser called silk. The biggest issue I have with the Fire HD is silk. Bottom line, it sucks. It's very buggy with alot of websites and doesn't perform well with flash players. Amazon is extremely strict with apps so you can't go install google chrome or any alternative.

What makes this product so great is the new screen, sound, and whisper soft technology. All these advancement come to you for a great price.The screen on Kindle Fire HD is bright and crisp. It has a 1280x800 high definition LCD display. It packs a punch even with its small 7\u201d screen. The picture is clear no matter the viewing angle. The Kindle Fire is made so that there is no gap in-between the screen and touch sensor. The gap in most small tablets, including the Kindle Fire 7, make the screen hard to see in outdoor light as well as when lying in bed. This is not so with the Kindle Fire HD; the screen is great any light at any angle.The sound on the Kindle Fire HD far surpasses the sound on Amazon\u2019s older tablets. With the HD you have clear sound that you don\u2019t have to struggle to hear. With the original Kindle 7\u201d, the sound was so low and muddled; headphones had to be worn to really enjoy any form of sound. This is not the case with the HD version where the sound is clear and loud.The feature that makes the Kindle Fire HD a one kind unit is the Whispersync software. This software is the best tool for children with a learning disability since the invention if dictation software. My daughter cannot read and thins tool has made her fall in love with reading.  The Whipersync links your kindle book to the audio book. When you buy a kindle version book you are offered the ability to buy the audio book from audio.com for a discount. When you download both the book and audio they are synced to each other. The reader can open the book press play the book is read by the HD while the tablet highlights each word that is being read so the reader can follow along. If the reader moves on to another task they can listen to audio without the book on the screen. When the book is opened back up it starts off the where the audio has left off.

I do recommend getting the fast charger if you plan on using it extendedly because it comes with a slow charging USB chord that can be attached to a wall adapter or any computer/laptop and this may be too slow for your needs (6-9 hrs to fully charge) but you can use it while it is plugged in which makes the extended charging time take a little longer but if your playing Temple Run2 you don't really care. :)I recommend this to anyone who may be on the fence, this is better than my husbands ipad (he wants a kindle now lol) and has an amazing display. The HD is beautiful and better than most big screen tv's. I would buy the Kindle HD TV if it existed the HD quality is that good. And my husband agrees! Nothing bad to say about this!

Compared to our iPad 2 this has great graphics and loud speakers! Really looks great. Our kids love the freetime app. I take a point off because the app store is lacking. I did however find 1mobile.com and got some free apps there. I also take a point off because a wall charger isn't included. It takes forever to charge with a usb. I believe I heard it takes 9 hours to fully charge and you know with kids they have no patience. I inquired about getting a free prime trial since I haven't had prime in 6 years. Amazon support said the prime trial is only good one time. Which really sucks btw when you think of how much I buy just from amazon. It couldn't hurt them to give me a free trial. Anyway, that's all.

I have had a Kindle Touch for a couple of years so I am used to the reading advantages of a Kindle.  One thing to be aware of is the Fire does not had a screen that can be read in the sunlight.  At first I was disappointed by this, but I just decided if I am going to read on the beach I'll just use my Touch.  I have also used the web and wifi, set up an email client (the one that comes with the Fire is web based and awful).  I have used Skype.  It works fine.  Which reminds me of another thing to be aware of, there is only one camera on the Fire, and it's not for taking pictures, it points towards the user and is there for skyping.  It would be awkward to take pictures of anything except yourself.  I loaded a few free games for my grand kids, they of course like it, but it's not a big deal for them. They have their own game/learning devices.  I am going to load some version of a DOS emulator for Android so I can run a few old does apps that I wrote for personal finances.  So you have in the Kindle Fire, all of the old features of the Kindle touch plus, color, web and wifi, streaming video (many free movies if you are a Prime member), email, and other tablet features.  I know there are a number of other tablets out and coming out that are cheaper than an iPad, but the Fire was one of the first I believe and is still a good buy.

Shin", "ReviewID": "R107HP1KMJJ3FA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my first product review on Amazon.  I've purchased many, many products in the thousands of dollars through Amazon.  I have never had an issue with the services provided by Amazon.I've purchased this product (on Amazon) over 6 months ago. I've read the description of this product on the Amazon page.  The descriptors extol the virtues of the Kindle Fire HD.  I made a conscious decision to buy a non-Apple product.  Partly due to the lower cost of the Kindle and partly to stop owning everything Apple.After using the Kindle Fire HD, I have to say I'm very disappointed with the product.  For purposes of watching streaming movies via Netflix and reading digital books, the product is fine.  For anything beyond those two simple functions I can say that it doesn't provide satisfactory performance.  Surfing the Net via \"Silk\" is not fast.  I compare this to the iPad.  Ease of use and navigation of data (apps, photos...etc...) is not, at first, user friendly.  In fact, even after using this product daily, I still don't find it user friendly.  The video viewing app (for personal video files) that came with this product is woefully inadequate.  The app I purchased via the app store isn't much better.The first thing that troubled me initially was the constant ads that kept popping up each time I turned on the Kindle.  I had to manually disable this.  The option to disable it is there; however, I disliked having to take the time to do this in the first place.  I did not buy the Kindle to be inundated with ads!As I am not a technically inclined person, this review is coming from the \"average\" layman's view.  I deeply regret not purchasing the iPad instead (to save a few dollars).  In fact, I may end up purchasing one in the near future (from Amazon, of course).  The bottom line is this product is ok for watching streaming videos and reading books.  If you want more from this (and if you own an iPhone like I do) then you're better off getting an ipad.  This is just my personal opinion.  Everyone else can make their own informed decision.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Kindle Fire", "Author": "Tara \"Tara\"", "ReviewID": "RSDC45DTRTHCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my Kindle Fire.

The hardware and price point are fantastic, though.Full disclosure: I purchased this device with the intent of using as a general purpose tablet. After significant and risky modification, it is everything I wanted in a tablet (and more)!Amazon appears to be taking steps to restrict buyers from choosing the operating system they wish to run through over-the-air updates (not disablable without rooting). I found their launcher (the carousel) to be intrusive and cumbersome. Every application, book, etc. that you've opened is kept in order (you have some freedom to choose what displays first, though) of access. I did not like this at all nor did my wife, the reader.Google Play cannot be loaded onto the device without rooting, even though the device is Android at its core. Rooting runs the risk of bricking the device and probably voids the warranty.Bottom line: If you are purchasing this device as a tablet, you may be disappointed. If you are okay with being restricted to the Amazon App Store, don't mind not having freedom over the launcher used (unless rooted...but even then custom backgrounds aren't possible on the currently shipped software version), and aren't interested in modifying anything about the device, this review does not pertain to you.

Bloch \"BigdogNJ\"", "ReviewID": "R13MQR5RO76CRC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So here's the thing: I bought the Kindle Fire HD primarily because I wanted a lighter weight, easier to handle ebook reader than my iPad. I like the functionality and flexibility of the native reader app much better than iBooks or the Kindle app for iPad. For this purpose, the Fire HD was a perfect choice. Buying, borrowing, searching and referencing reading material just isn't done better on any tablet. I definitely got my money's worth, especially at the discounted price.If, however, you're looking for an inexpensive Android OS tablet I suggest you look elsewhere. Amazon has so customized and crippled the operating system as to make it unrecognizable. The home screen carousel is pretty useless if you have more than a few apps installed. The app library view would benefit from the ability to create folders or multiple screens. In general, the flexibility and customizability of the Android user interface has been totally blocked in favor of an Amazon centered market interface. The Silk web browser doesn't do Flash for crying out loud.All this would be tolerable if only you could download the darn apps you need. As I write this, I realize that my main frustration is being forced into the vastly incomplete Amazon App Store for all my app purchases. Amazon has banned Kindle users from the wealth of applications that makes Android an attractive OS in the first place. You can't access Google Play and there are tens of thousands of applications there that are not available from Amazon. I've hit this wall too many times to recommend the device overall.I can't say I would have purchased a different e-reader had I known just how limited the tablet functionality would be on the Fire HD, but I probably would not have spent the bucks on this one.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "King's Approval", "Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "RIUSSWGLDOP2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son love's his Kindle!!!!!!!

But it does not support flash (who cares? Well, you will because that means no amazon streaming video.)I really wanted the prime instant FREE video deal, so that's why I bought the Fire.  I did not get that it would be as small as it is---I LOVE IT! Yes, this is the one you will want to take with you all the time.  Thank you, Amazon.  It's so bright and beautiful, it's amazing! Now, Jeff, if you could please just make it take notes like the samsung note I would be in heaven.The OTHER BIG THING is that if you live in Outer Mongolia, which is apparently where I live, you will not be able to stream at a speed to make the instant video work.  I actually live 2 miles from the center of a large metropolitan area, but somehow that also equates to O.M. (aka Outer Mongolia).  OK, so I thought I could just download these free babies over the hour or whatever it would take---wrong.  The Amazon deal does not let you actually store any videos for free, only stream. So, off to McD I go to watch videos---I am not kidding!Keep that in mind if this is your sole goal for getting it.  On the other hand, I love mine and THAT was my sole goal for getting it.  I JUST LOVE IT!!! I'm embarrassed by how much I love it! I don't know if this is so or if it is coming, but it seems like if you had a blue tooth, you could just use this as your phone as well---and if the next paragraph could also be implemented. (see next paragraph)I would love it so much more if it came with a fast version of whispernet like the kindle and you could just use it whenever and wherever.  Love it even more if if had a battery compartment.  C'mon, how hard would that be and what a great selling point!!!!!!!!!!!  Is anybody listening---please make it run longer---make it solar! Make love last!And can anyone tell me if you can lock it?  You can lock the samsung note, and that is pretty darn important in case you lose this little guy.I have had this now for a week, so I am updating:PROS:1) so small, so light, easy to take everywhere. I bought a kindle when they first came out and hated it. But I read all the time on this one. I pull it out when I am waiting in line at a drive thru. It is the coolest little guy. So user friendly.2) Screen is to die for---brilliant.3) You get videos for free from Amazon, but (see above) only if you can stream4) This is not just an ereader or movie watcher, you can also search the web if you have wifi accessCONS (I am mentioning these, but I would not let any of them deter you from getting this gadget, I LOVE MINE):1) Prime free video access is limited to CERTAIN videos, not everything, and you cannot store and watch later, you have to watch when you download and have a very good wifi to get them to stream2) The thing takes longer to boot than I think it should, I want it to pop right up (Picky, I know. Sorry, Jeff)3) I want an Amazon button---I want to be able to go straight there. The only way I know to do it right now is to go to the web button and go that way---don't want to do that, don't think I should have to. I KNOW Jeff will agree4) It needs a little keypad on the first page to let you put in a lock code, like Samsung note.5) I do not understand how to know what is going on with the wifi connection. There should be some place to go to troubleshoot that. If you swipe the right bottom corner on samsung, it will let you see a lot of your settings. The Fire puts this somewhere else and among the setting is nothing on the wifi connection. I know there is a little icon on the upper right, but earlier today it was saying I was connected, but I could not go anywhere on the web, so it was not.6) Like all of these devices, it dies right in the middle of what you are doing---needs a battery compartment!  YES, it does!77) The inside keypad needs numbers on the first screen (see Samsung note) because we all use numbers now in our passwords8) If you could get the writing app Samsung uses, as I said above, it would be KILLER!", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle fire HD", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "RAX2L0PKDMIS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great item great color great sound would recommend it to everyone.

It became a tool I used just about every day.  I still do, but... After just over a year, the charging connection became loose.  I had purchased an extended warranty so returned it to the store and upgraded to the Fire HD 7\". The first one I had also had charging issues, Amazon replaced it for free. The second one had volume control issues.  The main volume control would go all the way to the top and it would beep whenever it felt like it.  I would pull up the volume and turn it down but it would just go back up again by itself.  Amazon replaced it for free.  The third HD 7\" arrived in the mail about a month ago.  The first day I had it, it turned off by itself three times.  That problem has not repeated.  I recently downloaded an audio book to listen to.  When I started to play it there was so much static I could not hear the words.  I plugged in headphones and could hear just fine so I think the problem is the speakers. It crackles during game sound effects too so it's not just that one book.  I expect Amazon will replace it again without any hassle.

After 10 months of use, I absolutely love my choice. It was less than a third the price, and I think it's better for reading books. Here are the reasons why you might like the Kindle Fire HD better than the iPad: Videos play more smoothly; any mobi-format file can be read aloud with passable precision by a pleasant robot voice; it works seemlessly with Amazon purchases so if you use it rather than the iTunes store, you'll want the Kindle; the free app of the day is far better than anything free in the iTunes store; it's far easier to return stuff, complain about stuff and get refunds with Amazon so if an app doesn't work or a magazine subscription doesn't work right, no worries. I love the way graphic novels and comic books are treated on the Kindle, with each panel enlarging and slightly rising off the page as you read it and a simple swipe takes you to the next one. That said, if you read a lot of graphic novels or comics, you'll want the 8.9\" Kindle because the 7\" is just a tad too small for detailed comics -- I still read a ton on it, but it could be better. (That said, I prefer the 7\" size overall because it's so much easier to carry around.) Here are two things I don't like about it: If you listen to audiobooks using the Kindle, it's impossible to scan forward or backward. Say your brain wandered and you didn't catch a few sentences to you try to move it back a tad, this is easy with an iPod but it's extremely frustrating because the screen buttons are small and overly sensitive. The other shortcoming, which is minor, is that I'd like to be able to play an audiobook while scrolling along with the ebook version -- I'm not talking about the Whispersync function where audio/ebook versions are paired by Amazon, but rather when they're NOT Whispersynced. This is not possible. All in all, love it love it love it. I especially like Readability.com, which converts any online article into a Kindle ebook file and emails it to my Kindle for easy reading at my leisure.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic All-in-One Device", "Author": "L.M.", "ReviewID": "RKY9CVBWFXRE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd never even touched an iphone or ipad before getting my Kindle, but after I saw how much these little devices did for a reasonable price, I had to get one. You can read books, play games, access the web and get apps for your favorite sites, check your e-mail, watch netflix, listen to music, etc. It's easy to use and extremely functional. The small size makes the product easy to carry around, but the screen is big enough to watch movies or play games with ease. I have had a great time on my Kindle. It makes it possible for me to have my e-mail on the go (as long as I have an internet connection to hook up with). Sound quality is great. I have nothing to compare the HD screen with, but it's very clear. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a tablet without the huge price tag. Also, since the Kindle is from Amazon, you get access to all the apps Amazon puts out. The selection is not limited and you can find tons of free apps. Many of the books and apps with a price are under $3.I really wish they included the charger though. For the money you put into this product, bundling in a $20 charger shouldn't be a big deal. I'm currently sharing one and am hesitant to spend that much money. It seems like that should just be included like when you buy a computer. I guess the USB cord charges it when you hook it up to the computer, but if I recall correctly, I got a message on my Kindle saying it would charge slowly.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "A month later, I'm happier with it", "Author": "Gesualdo", "ReviewID": "R31Y6RBVPC31VW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My new Kindle Fire HD arrived this morning, just a little over two hours ago, and so far, I'm not very happy with my purchase. I'd read enough reviews that I felt confident I was getting a good product that I thought would be useful. I thought I was getting a regular tablet with the bonus of being able to watch my Amazon videos on it. But as a convert from a more traditional Android tablet, it seems like this one is missing a lot more than I was prepared to give up just to get that one little extra.The one pro I have found so far: the HDMI port. That will make it nice for hooking up Amazon prime to the bedroom TV without having to set up all that stuff on my laptop.#1 on my con list? No charger. Really? Luckily, I happen to have one laying around the house from when my previous tablet bit the dust. Who sells a rechargeable product without a charger? And making one available - just $20 dollars more - is really in poor taste. Amazon, if you're going for the \"amazing customer experience\" that my management teacher keeps talking about it, UR DOIN' IT RONG.And then I couldn't find a free GMail app in the store. Or YouTube. Right now, I am really regretting my decision not to buy a Nexus.I bought this tablet for two reasons - reading my textbooks for school and watching videos in bed while my other half is sleeping. So far, only the textbook option is looking viable, and I'm not even completely sure about that yet - I need to have Google Drive installed so I can load my book pdfs that I scanned.I'll keep fiddling with it to see if I can configure it the way I want it, but so far, I'm not happy. I'll post an update if my attitude changesUPDATE 9/15/13I've had my new Kindle Fire HD for 36 hours now and my review stands.I was finding various workarounds for the apps that are not available through the Amazon store, and it was really looking like I could be happy with my Kindle. And then I discovered the fatal flaw. I can't watch my Dish DVR content because the Dish Anywhere app is not available and it does NOT work in the browser. I'm in college and working full time, so I like to watch TV on the go. With this setup, there's no way I can do that.Moreover, Google Music does not work in the browser either. I'm sure Amazon would prefer I simply use the Amazon Cloud Player, which is a very nice app. However, the storage over at Google is so much more generous. Amazon will store only 250 of my thousands of mp3s - unless I pay, of course. Because I am a musician, I always keep a wide variety of music available. Google music was perfect for that (and free!) and it, too, is now unavailable.I was about to raise my rating to 3 stars and potential, but now I'm tempted to lower it. Dish and Google Music are big deals on my tablet.UPDATE 9/17/13Okay, I'm willing to concede a star. My Google music is still not available, which I don't like, but everything else seems to be working out fairly well. It's doing what I need it to do and it's more or less humming along. At this point, I'm happy enough with it to use it without [much] complaint. It seems stable, which is a big plus. Now I just need to wait and see if it develops problems. If not, this is how my review will stand.UPDATE 10/17/13I'm conceding one more star. While I'm still displeased about not having access to my Google apps - because, you know, Google owns me - this is otherwise an excellent tablet. It's stable and fast and easy to look at and use.I've been pretty diverse about what I use it for.*I watch video a lot. I figured out how to make Dish work. YouTube nicely plays in the browser. It's nice to be able to watch my Amazon videos. Amazon has even developed a beta version of a video player that works around the flash content that no longer plays on Android devices (thanks, Adobe!). The video player didn't work very well, but it would be tolerable for short video (1-2 minutes). Keep working on it, Amazon. I'm looking forward to watching Blue Bloods someday.*I'm trying to work on some memory issues, so I play Mahjong a lot. The game is buggy, but that's a problem with the game, not the device.*I do a lot of web research. I think the Silk browser works great. By far, the best of all the mobile devices I've had. One of the best parts is that it plays nice with my school's courseware and also with textbook publisher sites, so I can do schoolwork on my Kindle.*I read textbooks for my classes. I haven't tried using a Kindle textbook (yet) (do those even exist? I thought you could buy them, but you still have to use a regular computer to read). Basically, I bought and dismantled an older edition of my textbook. I scan the pages into PDF form, upload, and then use the Kindle reader to do the reading. It's a little labor intensive, but I can do the scanning while I'm doing something less productive - like watching TV - and then I can read whenever and wherever I happen to be.*Facebook works really well - better than on my phone. In fact, I use Facebook almost exclusively on the Kindle. The exception is when I want to upload photos. The camera is on my phone.*The Calendar app is probably better than the standard Android app. I find it easier to tell my various calendars apart.*I'm not so fond of the email app. It's okay. The native Gmail app is just better.*I like using the Amazon cloud player for my music, but 250 songs doesn't cut it. Google offers so much more storage space for free. On the other hand, since I buy my music exclusively from Amazon, everything I buy is automatically available immediately. It just makes me sad that I can't afford to keep my large-ish CD collection handy without having to transfer the actual files to the Kindle.I was happy enough with this one to buy another for my technophobe hubby. He loves it. It's way faster than his hand-me-down laptop and easy to understand.FWIW, I didn't pay the extra to get rid of the ads. And as annoyed as I get about looking at ads in my face all the time, having \"special offers\" on my Kindle Fire has been tolerable.

I didn't feel the need to upgrade from my Kindle Keyboard to a Kindle Fire especially since the Fires are essentially tablets (which I already own one), I felt like it would be a waste to buy it when all I'd be using it for is reading. A few weeks ago when the Kindle Fire HD 7\" went on sale, I bought it on pure impulse. I wanted a new Kindle back in June and was leaning towards a Paperwhite but a friend said I should hold off because a new one was probably coming out in the Fall so I did. When I learned the Paperwhites didn't have speakers or audio capability I decided not to buy one because I regularly listen to audio books with my Kindle Keyboard and was disappointed when I learned that the Paperwhites didn't have that option. The day after I learned that, the Kindle Fire HD 7\" went on sale and I felt like it was a sign that I should get it. So, I did. Just in time for my birthday, too! :DI've had the Fire HD 7\" for exactly a month now. In all honesty, it was rough transitioning between a Kindle Keyboard to the Kindle Fire because there's just so much stuff on the Fire to go through. I also had an issue with the fact that my Fire kept turning on by itself to the point that it took much longer to charge than it should have (since you can't necessarily use the Fire while it's charging or it charges even slower than the basic cord allows). I couldn't figure out why it kept turning on when I wasn't doing anything until I realized that my Fire was still trying to sync my personal documents (I have an extensive library). Between how much it was charging and how often I was using it, it took a full week before I was able to charge it completely because that's how long it took to sync completely (I'm assuming). If this is happening to you, I would leave it alone until all your books and personal documents are visible when you are in the cloud section of the Books or Personal Docs tab. The longer I used it, the longer it took to sync so try not to do anything the first few days after you register the device IF you have a lot of content in your library.From then on, I really loved my Fire. I didn't think I would adore it this much because I wasn't too excited about having a Kindle in color but now that I have it and been using it consistently for a month, I'm glad I bought it. There's still some issues with it, mainly the fact that sometimes when I open books or personal docs, they don't show up on my carousel no matter how long I read them or have them open. It's almost as if the Carousel is frozen even though the Fire is still operating correctly in all other ways. When this happens, I can't use the 'remove from device' feature on the carousel otherwise it just stays on the carousel no matter how many times I try to delete it, only the 'remove from carousel' feature works and that's slowly. I'm not sure why this happens and I've searched the web enough to know that it doesn't seem like anyone else has this problem. Although, others have had the reverse happen, where books show up in the carousel but not in the books or personal docs tabs, which is NOT my issue so I couldn't figure out a way to fix it. I just let it fix itself, which could take a day or two. I think it might have to do with my constant adjusting of the brightness and then letting it fall asleep only to change the brightness in the morning to a higher quality. I'm not sure but that was the only thing that all three incidents had in common when I thought about it. It's not a big deal so I don't feel the need to call customer support (yet) since everything else on the Fire still works. My only other issue is that I wish the carousel was completely revolving. I have a lot of books on my carousel and it gets frustrating when I'm looking for a book and don't see it when I finally reach the end, only to have to scroll all the way to the left to get back to the beginning. If it was revolving, it would be so much easier to get back to the beginning. If someone has an idea of how I can get to the beginning without scrolling forever (without deleting anything from the carousel) please share! I've tried opening tabs and such but that still leaves me at the end (the right) of the carousel. Hopefully there will be an update that changes this soon and I know others might not like it revolving so maybe Amazon will give its users the option of having a completely revolving carousel or its current one. A lot of my friends don't like the carousel but I love it!So, the Kindle Fire HD 7\" gets 4 stars from me. I love it, I adore all its features especially since I can hook it easily up to my TV to watch videos with it. I adore the fact that I can read on it at all times including when I turn the lights off and I love the fact that the screen is so crisp and I can adjust the brightness as much as I desire. There's a ton of things I still have to explore but I'm a happy camper because I can read easily on it AND the speakers are amazing.

My girlfriend owns an iPad 3, so I will be using that as a comparison.Out of the box, I was actually quite impressed by the kindle's look and feel, but soon was quickly and heavily disappointed.First I would like to say the few things that I WAS impressed or was pleased by. Again, the look and feel of the kindle was very nice, and looked well built. The interface and operating system was very user friendly, well organized, and easily understood. The Dolby speakers were crystal clear. And the fact that your Kindle doesn't ask you for a password whenever downloading an app (Something that an iPad or any apple product does). These are really the only things I was pleased by, and as you can tell, they are not that important.Now with the bad:First, after using it a few days, I noticed it was not that smooth and rather choppy and slow. Especially when opening apps, it was very laggy and choppy. Yes, it has a quite clear and nice screen, but no better than the iPad. Maybe the Kindle needs more RAM, or a better processor? I don't know. All I know is, it was nowhere near or even close to the iPad's standards in terms of the smoothness.Second, the touchscreen is nice, but not good. It is not that responsive and its not as.... Intuitive, I guess is the right word. It just doesn't feel right. Especially when scrolling down a webpage or \"turning\" a page in a book, it doesn't feel as if it's at your fingertips. Again, slow and non-responsive.Third, after using a couple times, apps such as facebook, vine, silk (web broswer), they would start to freeze and then crash. This would rarely happen in an iPad, especially in a new iPad.Last but most important in my opinion, the battery life. This is just flat out disappointing. With all new devices, I drain the battery until its at 1% or empty. I did this with the Kindle, and then charge it overnight. After my mourning routine, its been about 14 hours, I come back and notice that it was stuck at 99%. It would not reach 100%. Something that bugged me, but I thought \"whatever\".I read that Amazon states you can have up to 11 hours of continuous use, and realized that is a load of crap. I was reading a book, with airplane mode turned ON, no apps running in the back, and brightness at about 25%. After about 45 minutes, my battery has drained roughly 10%. So at MOST, if I continued to read until my battery died, I would get 7 MAYBE 8 hours with the lowest possible settings. However, this isn't that bad, but its not the worse part.The thing that made me most disappointed was the amount of battery life drained even when \"sleeping.\" Last night, I used my Kindle until about 81% battery. With WiFi turned off, no apps running in the back, etc. I go to bed. I wake up in about 7 hours, and see that my battery has drained to 60%. I immediately thought I must have a defective Kindle or battery. But after doing lots of research, I found out that this is a common trait in Kindles! Ridiculous! It wasn't MY Kindle, it was everyone's! The only reason this is such a big deal to me is because my girlfriend once went on a family vacation but left her iPad at my house. After 4 days of it being turned on, WiFi on, everything on, but merely \"sleeping.\" It drained from 89% to 86%. 3% over 4 days! Whereas my Kindle drained 20% in 7 hours!These are just the major negative features I have experienced, there are still many but minor things, including the ads and \"Customers also bought.\"Please, don't call me a Kindle Hater and that I'm just trying to bash on Amazon or Kindles, because I'm not. I'm a loyal Amazon customer and really tried to love this, but I simply could not with all the CONS outweighing the PROS.All in all I am very disappointed in this product, but I did get it during a promotion for $150. I guess you get what you paid for, but I would recommend everyone to pay the extra amount for an iPad or iPad mini, because it will not disappoint like the Kindle, well not this much anyway.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "We are a 4 Kindle family now!

I did not hang on to this product long enough to evaluate those features as they are of less interest to me.What I wanted from this device is an excellent e-reader at a great price. The Kindle Fire HD does satisfy these criteria. The look and feel of the device is great and the screen is impressive. However, I was upset to learn that there is a 5GB limit on personal document storage. I bought a 32GB version because I wanted additional capacity for my PDFs. Also, there is a 50MB limit on individual file sizes that can be transferred to the kindle. I do not know the technical software details behind this limitation in detail. I read that all files are somehow converted to some kind of Kindle format for viewing. This may be incorrect. I have many documents that I want the freedom to transfer and view on a device that exceed 50MB. The last straw is the Mac app \"Send to Kindle\" which fails to send anything to my Kindle. I am only able to send documents to my kindle by e-mailing them to an amazon cloud address. I used the online troubleshooting and my own Mac knowledge to attempt to fix the problem, but I am not even interested in contacting tech support as I have already decided that I have encountered enough trouble and enough limitations on my use of hardware that I have paid money for, that I am going to return my Kindle for a Nexus 7 that allows me more freedom to do what I want with my property.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for what I use it for", "Author": "LBDDiaries \"LBDDiaries\"", "ReviewID": "R3J8UIEAJBAXSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't really wanted to jump on the tablet bandwagon. I've been very happy with my plain, ordinary Kindle Touch.  I have a PC and a laptop, along with a cell phone. Why would I need a tablet or pad, too? BUT when the Kindle Fire HD went on sale about the time I was eye-balling a Kindle Paperwhite 3g I decided it was time to run a test to see if I'd use a tablet at all. The Fire HD was less expensive than the Paperwhite, so I purchased it.Right now it is a glorified e-reader that I love.  I like the benefit of being able to check things online in color without the software closing it down (like it would sometimes do on my Touch). That is a great benefit.  But just like my cell phone, sometimes the smaller keyboard drives me bonkers. I'm not adept at typing with my thumbs like so many can. I am a \"poke one key at a time\" typer - slow. Give me a real keyboard any day.Being that I am not gadget savvy, it is nice that it is VERY easy to begin using. Help is a simple tap away. Changing the brightness is a breeze (which you need when reading at night, to adjust your reading screen).  I love that I can read without a lamp on or an attached book reading light.  THAT is the entire point of my desire for a Paperwhite.  As an e-reader, it is wonderful.  Larger screen, easily adapted to personal reading desires - loving it for that.I haven't sent emails or the like but my son, who also bought one, says it is a breeze. He loves is beyond belief.  For me, when checking a website, it is small but easily enlarged with fingers. I mean, I can see why people love having everything at their fingertips.  Everything is right there, easy to see and in beautiful color.  In the end, tho, it really is just a glorified e-reader for me.If you are new to tablets, this is a perfect place to start and play around but you'd probably rather the larger one in the long run.  Will I buy the larger tablet?  Don't know. Not right now but maybe in the future as a replacement to my old laptop (as long as I get the keyboard to go with it).UPDATE 2 MONTHS LATER:  I've now had the Kindle two months and still don't use it for much more than an e-reader.  I do go online often then realize why I shouldn't - the print really is small and even when you expand (which it does very easily), to me it is awkward. It does sign on quickly and goes to the websites almost as fast as my laptop.  As far as I can tell, it does everything it says it will, with ease.  \"Help\" is not hard to find and the few apps I downloaded - calculator, etc., work beautifully.  All in all, I'm glad I bought it because if I do want to buy another book by an author right away, I can easily do so (smile).  But in the end, it is still just a glorified e-reader for me, one that only has 11 hours on it - which is a con in my book!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first Kindle I don't love", "Author": "John R. Sponauer \"John S\"", "ReviewID": "RUNIR73FANYR9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Longtime Kindle user here; this is my third Kindle, going back to the original, and all are still in operation. Also an Amazon Prime devotee (have bought everything from peanut butter to an elliptical machine) and quasi-tech geek. I genuinely love my previous Kindles for reading. They were/are transformational machines.I am also quite price-sensitive. Not wanting the size or the price of a full-size tablet, I finally decided to look at mid-size 7-inch-range wifi tablets for general app usage for work and home productivity, as well as music, games, etc. I have several devices that I was hoping this purchase could either replace or supplement:* A 3rd generation 32GB iPod Touch, which is my primary music player. Sadly, it has an increasingly bad headphone jack. I have an iTunes library of 2,000+ songs on it. I also use it for couchtime and hobby apps (Words with Friends, astronomy reference, Web, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). The tablet would replace it for the main apps, as well as music playing.* A Samsung Galaxy Exhibit smartphone, used for mobility-needed apps, GPS and quick photos (tablet would replace it for apps, etc.)* An old Vizio tablet (which just sucks on nearly every level and which sits generally unused :) ).I use some combination of my devices on the go, sitting on the couch at night, or in the car to listen to music.For this purchase, I considered the 32GB Nexus 7, the 32GB iPad Mini and the 32GB Kindle Fire HD. Prices varied from about $200 for the Kindle with Amazon's sale, up to $400+ for the iPad Mini. I chose the Kindle Fire HD and paid for the ad-free option, as well as a year of music storage on Amazon Cloud Player.I've had the Kindle for about a week now, and immediately put it to use on a five-hour family road trip and several-day camping trip. I have imported my entire music library into Amazon Cloud Player and attempted to download all songs onto the device (more on that later). I have also downloaded about two-dozen free and paid apps from the Amazon store, sideloaded several other using my Android phone and Dropbox, and have both downloaded and streamed HD movie and shows.PROSPRICE: By going with the Kindle vs. the iPad, I can find other things to spend the saved $200 onFORM FACTOR: I think the form factor is solid. Feels like a non-toy. It's a tad heavier than I expected, particularly with the Otterbox case on it, but it's not bad.SCREEN: The screen is really bright and vibrant. Love it. For reading in the full sun, look, it's not an e-ink regular Kindle, but I find the screen readable. Better than I expected it to be.SOUND: The sound is excellent, truly.PERFORMANCE: Performance so far is fine. Very little stuttering of anything (more on that later). I find it very responsive to commands. Very quick to go between apps, etc.BATTERY: Battery life is better than I expectedAPPS: With very little effort, you can install many non-Amazon-approved apps without rooting. I don't feel I'm at a loss for apps. Between what Amazon offers and what I've side-loaded, I think I more or less have what I need, with very, very few exceptions. Sadly, one of them is my beloved Sky Safari Pro astronomy app, which just doesn't work side-loaded so far. *sniff*AMAZON INTEGRATION: It couldn't be any more integrated with Amazon. Offers recommendations to what you're using, reading, etc. Seamless with the purchasing, etc. It really feels like an extension of their site, to be honest.CONS and ANNOYANCESCHARGING: The lack of an included wall charging cord is crazy. The official one (sold separately) is very effective, though, and does charge it quickly. USB charging performance using the provided cable is terrible, in my opinion.INTERFACE LIMITATIONS: The locked-down interface is more limiting than I expected it to be. Little things like you can't use your photos as a wallpaper or lock screen? Really? For what purpose is this removed for those of us who paid to have ads removed? Yes, you can dig around the file structure and perform some minor surgery to make it happen, but you shouldn't have to. Put it this way: Apple wouldn't make you do that.PERFORMANCE: OK, it's generally good. However, several times, my music has skipped and repeated several seconds or so, particularly toward the end of songs for some reason. Similarly, I tried to record a short video with it, and playback was stuttery to the point I couldn't use it. A few HD movies that were downloaded have stuttered a little bit. Not too bad.MUSIC / INTEGRATION WITH AMAZON CLOUD PLAYER: I have nothing positive to say about transferring my collection of music over. Well, I guess other than it imported my iTunes library fine into the Cloud. I created some new playlists in the Cloud easily, so that's fine too. But good lord, what a nightmare it's been downloading the library to the device for playing offline. Literally, it took days to download everything, and I still don't know what I'm missing, since the song total counts on the device and the Cloud don't match. The thing has completely messed up numerous times, stalling and crashing while downloading, creating genres on the device that don't exist in the Cloud (example: \"13,\" which consists of a random collection of songs and albums, including multiple songs from the same album, so \"13\" isn't representing the track number). I have found no easy way to see what songs are still not on the device other than flipping through each song. It's just been one big poor experience so far. A very, very poor replacement for my iPod and iTunes. Not even in the same class in terms of user interface; even the control buttons are tiny and not as easy to find / use.INTERFACE LIMITATIONS: Similarly, there are no music controls on the lock screen, which is terribly annoying for using it in the car as a music source. Completely avoidable and not easily understood why this feature doesn't exist. This is a HUGE issue when using the Kindle in the car as your music player. To skip a song, I have to turn the thing on, swipe the lock screen, type my password and press Next Song (if I can press the tiny buttons while driving). Dumb, dumb, a thousand times dumb.GOOGLE ACCOUNT INTERFACE: That you have to sideload apps for YouTube, GMail, etc. is just crazy. Yes, the built-in mail apps works for Gmail. The official Gmail app is better.INTERFACE LIMITATIONS: Can't create or organize basic folders for apps?INTERFACE LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the Amazon App store are truly not terrible. However, since this is basically an Android tablet in all but name, why not offer more flexibility, like Widgets, etc.?WIFI: The \"faster WiFi\" is not noticeable to me at all.So, in short, was it worth the purchase? Meh. I guess so. I had hoped to like it a lot more. It's my first Kindle that I don't love. In fact, as I write this, I'm not even sure I like it, on balance. It may end up on eBay soon.However, for the price, I suppose I cannot complain, and there is hope that the software will be updated over time to replace the annoyances above. I wouldn't hesitate to give it as a gift to a tech-challenged person who sits around an open WiFi connection all day, but anyone with more experience or expectations may feel let down and constrained.

I have my own way of organizing things, and I have my own personal aesthetic tastes, and I hate that Amazon has decided for me how I'm going to interact with my device.Aside from that, there are a few more minor issues: the Screen Lock button and the Volume buttons are hard to use sometimes--it would be nice if they weren't flush with the rest of the device.

It was nightmarish when I couldn\u2019t even fit ONE book into my bag! I fretted and beat my head against the wall and said a lot of bad words (even made a few up just for the occasion), when my mom suggested I break my no e-readers rule and just buy a kindle and stop whining. With a lot of frustration and hostility, I did order one, sure I\u2019d hate it and would have it sent back in less than 24 hours.It got here and I was still unimpressed, I opened it up, determined to hate it, but the more I played with it, the more awesome it became. I did get all the little gadgets to go along with it (a case, a screen protector, a stylus and the accelerated charging block) which added to its appeal, and within a couple of days of hating even the idea of one BEING IN THE HOUSE, the kindle won me over. It was frustrating at first, like trying to see the internet pages with tiny font and whatnot, but I finally figured out how to zoom \u2013 and then I did all of my ordering of items from my laptop so I didn\u2019t have to deal with tiny font or zooming. It saved my vacation, I did not have to hurt a single person due to my aggravation of not being able to read, and made life more interesting as I played with it.I am very happy with it thus far; I\u2019ve only had it a few months, but so far, no real complaints!

I sit in an office all day, I have all the computer I need all day long.Tablets - much cheaper, but again, data plan and e-OCD (letting computer rule my life)Kindle - I love this thing! It's light-weight. I can rent library e-books for free, I can get cheap or free deals on Book-bub, it has built in wi-fi so I don't need to buy a data plan (if I need a computer that badly outside of work I'll use my smart-phone), it's user-friendly, it's backed by Amazon (that's a whole other review, but the short version is that it doesn't get much better than Amazon backing their products), reading books on it is a dream - so easy to set up the reading preferences and I can read in the sun. I don't ask for much with the few electronic items I possess and I couldn't be happier with this one. The only 'con' I can come up with is that this is my 2nd Kindle Fire HD 7\" because my 1st one within a month developed a malfunction. The screen orientation stopped working.

Unworkable issues:1. kindle fire too heavy to hold and awkward to read in bed more than 30 mins. Ordered case with it and prop option dies not work in bed.2. Prime is great for now getting free shipping til I get on road but I went thru all the kindle prime free movies, tv and books in two weeks; nothing left there I want to see or read for free so I will cancel prime once I'm done stocking up on what I need for trips.3. Kindle us WAY TO HARD to get around and find things like my email, my saved pics, free prime etc. I have a masters degree in information use and if I have trouble, other people must. It's a use ability/search and find function that's not so good. (Coming from a long time Apple user where I can always count on being proficient with their products in 30 minutes)Overall, I will use my kindle for my own library access and once in a very great while to purchase a digital book but do not feel its worth the price for such a small window of use.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love the kindle fire hd 7", "Author": "cathy yunker", "ReviewID": "R7CAAZN32G4F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was so easy to start up.

So when I finally broke down and bought a Kindle, I thought they would be amazing because it's expensive &, with so many options for tablets (or tablet like) choosing this one would make them really want to keep me happy. But I've been disappointed with the help; I ordered a Kindle but accidentally didn't correctly get the \"As Seen On TV\" special, I couldn't cancel my order but had to reorder (not a huge deal, but definitely an inconvenience). Also, the Kindle doesn't come with a charger..or a decent charger. It comes with one that goes into the computer and \"slowly\" charges. Quite annoying that I have to spend another 20$ to get a normal charger. You'd think it'd be included! Other than that, the actual Kindle is great; easy to download books, games and use.
