{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Step Closer", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R3MU84B6T9NYD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPad pros and cons", "Author": "Larry J. Crockett", "ReviewID": "R4VCE1TBRME86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.October 18 2011 Update:I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.I just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.I guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's cool, but has its flaws - and do you really need one?", "Author": "J. Harvey", "ReviewID": "R1YNKZ8Y1IOMEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.If you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?This is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.Advantages:If you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.The iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.The only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.For me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.Wi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.If you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.Limitations:The iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.The screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.Although the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.If you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!A lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.Despite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).The thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparison of my IPad 2 with my Xoom", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "R3RXN27YVJW4VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.External appearance and feel:The iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.Both weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.Both have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.Hardware performance:The Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.User Interface:The iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.Operating System:The iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.Applications:iPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.Browsing:Because of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.Camera:I don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.Speakers:The Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.Battery life:Difficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.Internal storage:The Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.External storage:The Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.User Experience:The iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.The Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.Support:Apple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.Bottom line:I believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.If I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.Update 7/5/2011We have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.However, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.Another problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.The iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.For us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.Update 7/7/2011The Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Went from \"why do I need it\" to \"Can't live without it\"", "Author": "C. A. Sinclair \"doctorcreation\"", "ReviewID": "R1FENBQH0LHSET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-onlyA really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is \"always ready\" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.DELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)FORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.APP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.SLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.HDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.iOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.PROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.SATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)HOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.SCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.PRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptopAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.BATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)WIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.DISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)FILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?PRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!CAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.COST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.TOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.WISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)Touchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.USB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)Retina displayInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)GPSCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.Smartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A few things that haven't been covered...", "Author": "Expert Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1HDDISACYGGRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.I will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.In summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "honeymoon is over", "Author": "bkluvr", "ReviewID": "R35YBRP4F9OZZ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i bought this from apple because amazon didn't have it yet.  I am middle- aged, love my nano, a kindle devotee from the first days, don't have a smart phone, and am a pc user.  at first i was awed by the touchscreen and the resolution quality.  images are gorgeous.  but now, it is really annoying.  too often the screen doesn't respond, and then reacts when you don't even know you're touching it.  the word processing function has been limited and limiting from the start, for someone accustomed to microsoft.if you think in buying the ipad you are getting a  compact, fast, light computer, you are not.  it IS fast.  a computer it is not.  no flash player is definitely a hinderance.  what it is great for is apps, games, (although the screen has been frustrating there too), watching movies and tv shows,  some browsing on the internet, and as a portable photo album, because images are truly fantastic on the ipad.  i find the screen very fatiguing on my eyes, and have the brightness level down almost as far as it can go.  i would never dream of reading a book on it.  kindle has nothing to worry about, as far as the ipad as a reading device.  the fact i can't see the ipad  screen outside, even in the shade, is also unfortunate, but i get it, that's a backlit screen.i am submitting this review not to bash apple, but to clarify a bit to people not familiar with macs and/or touchscreens what this device is about.  would i buy this device again? not unless it sold for maybe $300.  it is more a toy than a tool.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.", "Author": "carol irvin \"carol irvin\"", "ReviewID": "RFX4JZ7CUL8NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.The above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"Right now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.For those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.Also if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.There is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.These above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.I absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.I also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.

Lleras", "ReviewID": "R3SEXRV40Z31JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.Why do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.Portability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.For those of you debating between the 3GAT&T;, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T; has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you dont need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.You will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.Overall my score goes as followsComfort and portability A+Battery Life A+App Diversity and usability A+Interface A+Expandibility C (I dont need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)TV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)Cammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)Other thoughts:Get a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.Get a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.Investigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.Be realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations.

So, here is the \"Dummies Guide to the iPad\" to help you make that decision.\"I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum\" :To begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.You will be able to:-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around-Send and Receive Emails-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection-Watch Videos and Movies-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)-Download and Play Games-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)You will NOT be able to:-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :THE WIZARDSNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.The iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!Once the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!APPSThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.Apps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.LOADING PICTURESThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.THE PICTURE FRAMEWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.Tip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!PRINTINGPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.It is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.Finally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!If you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.The iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"Good luck!*** update 12th October 2011 ***Apple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)Amongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes. Always accessible as long as there is an internet connection.iCloud also allows the iPad to be used without having to 'Pair' it with a computer.

So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldnt stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets.

VonCamper", "ReviewID": "R2LAI9RDEW7FTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)I've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).My history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.To recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.This second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.It's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.As far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.What makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.My iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T; smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).This tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.As for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.Importantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.As for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.I hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.  Thanks for listening.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing product that I can't give 5 stars", "Author": "Marlon R.", "ReviewID": "RZ7FL90SYZDPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's no question the iPad is an amazing device. Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.PROs:It's amazingly fast.Amazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.It turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".Loads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.Tons of content available, much of it free or just $.99Built well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.It's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.CONs:Sadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.If you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.Lack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.Text ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.Safari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).If you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.The war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.SUMMARY:Despite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.However even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "thought I was buying new product", "Author": "edsnpw", "ReviewID": "R33LNBFFDXLG3Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.

Not quite perfect, but good enough for me.", "Author": "Leo Stark", "ReviewID": "R4HF0MLW53MX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I got my iPad 2 the first Friday of summer 2011, and have been loving it ever since. I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.Hardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.Cases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418). I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.iOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-Battery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+Speed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+Weight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. AOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.All in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the  Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you. The iPad 2 is still great,but the display on the new one and the better proccessor make it a better buy.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Versatile and Powerful", "Author": "Jeffrey A.

The iPad 2 is sleeker, much thinner and lighter.  These are big differences if you plan on doing a lot of reading on the device and need to hold it for extended periods of time.  The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.

I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):Favorites:1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.Least Favorite:1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.Overall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.Advice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3).

Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.Cons:Everyone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.Editing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard. Speaking of the keyboard I cannot for the life of me understand why apple cannot put arrow keys on it! So annoying! Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!A lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.Also - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.This is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).However, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing. I would wait until google improves Android or microsoft comes up with some hardware that will kick Apple of its perch, because there is nothing like a normal windows operating system.

The 2nd generation is much faster than the original.2. The design, while very similar is more sleek and lighter.3. The cameras are a great addition.Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.Convenience - I take this to class and with the addition of a bluetooth keyboard I am able to easily take notes in class while carrying FAR less than my laptop in weight.- The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)- The app store is getting better all the time - there are plenty of applications that make using this extremely convenient without having to take the laptop around (it weighs around 1/5 that of my laptop)- even if you bring the charger - it's far less bulky than the laptop charger.This really is the future of mobile computing. The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.The majority of my iphone apps work on this tablet.The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions.If you waited the first time - wait no longer - very much worth it in my mind.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The ipad 1,2,3, and 4", "Author": "Jo Apple \"Jo\"", "ReviewID": "RLHS8GHEA78HP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation.

It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.2. It was too big and heavy.3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.I am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their \"return\" \"credit\" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.I got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a \"magic cover\" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The \"magic cover\" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for \"repair.\" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a \"new\" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a \"refurbished\" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a \"new\" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).Besides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the \"frame\" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.Apart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.By the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.What I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.The networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.For more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.The Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.What I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.You can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.It's black and white, but that's OK with me.It's small and light weight and very easy to use.The leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.Reading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.I've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you \"buy\" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.Anytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.It also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.It holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.Anyway, if you're interested in an \"eReader\" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.If you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.I know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.I think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using \"streaming\" because of the networking issue.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A truly useful device that makes a PC much less necessary", "Author": "S. Jentsch", "ReviewID": "R374CVRZO4753Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.Apple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.Both products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.Using the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.That's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.Browsing the web is a joy on the 10\" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.Reading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.One of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.Speaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the AYL\u00ae 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black). It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.The iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.No other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only) would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.The best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.Anyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs. While the iPad 2 is a major investment, I don't regret making the purchase. I think the iPad 2 is hard to beat!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2", "Author": "arlene rosich", "ReviewID": "RX1XCQKYD9JFK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Although the ipad 2 was functional I could not use it beyond 6 feet from my wireless network.

I\u2019m actually sick of reading about all of them! My ipad already does all of those things. I used mine all through community college now I\u2019m in university and I still use it hours every day. I have friends that have other kinds of tablets. One of them has the newest ipad that I like but I was also thinking about a newer kindle which another of my friends has. The kindle is nice and so is the new ipad but when looking at the screens and then looking at my ipad I LIKED my ipad2 screen better than theirs. The colors are better. IDK why. Even my friend said that the color on mine was better than her new ipad even though that one has the newer screen.I\u2019ve had mine for 3 years. Although it\u2019s older, it\u2019s still great as the new ones just not as great of a screen. The one thing I dislike is the cameras are not as great as some other tablets but I still take a lot of beautiful pictures though. But everything else is great.

I would tell people \"I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?\"  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).Initial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.But, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a \"courtesy\" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!Apple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple \"genius\" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.So anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST IPAD", "Author": "Diane Tulli", "ReviewID": "RWLYPJOIXXIN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS MY FIRST I PAD.

The ipad 2 cam sucks but it can record really good vid.At the end the ipad change my life and it will help and change yours.Mark my words the ipad (tablets) in the future will replace laptops in like 5 to 10 years.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "fast excellent service", "Author": "ignacio a. llanos jr.", "ReviewID": "R3S968L3DZ9HVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the ipad 2 is great works nice and is everything i expected and more love the white color and the screen resolution is awesome.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Heather P.

The iPad was easily my last choice of all  tablets when i started my search, because i have had a bad history with apple and i swore off all of there products. I noticed a trend when i start going deep into the reviews and previews of competitor tablets, and that trend was that everything hoped to rival the iPad. There are decent alternatives, but unfortunately the iPad is still the tablet to beat.I choose the iPad 2 of the iPad 3, because for the upgrades from the predecessor were not of any interest. I take photos on a dslr, and if i want to watch HD videos then i can watch them on my laptop.So far i am guilt fully enjoying the iPad 2. It has proved to me more useful than I envisioned: It's productivity apps work across multiple platforms, it's home to one of my favorite card games (magic 2013!), and it's internationally user friendly (chinese gf).My biggest complaint is more on the OS and hardware side of things.

I learned my lesson to pick and choose what I feel most comfortable using and to not be so stubborn about supporting a company that I dislike.  I should say the only thing I dislike about Apple is their computer operating system.  It's not an operating system for me.  I don't feel comfortable using it and it is definitely much more boring than using a Windows operating system that has a gazillion more software written for it.  I'm a Windows guy, grew up with Windows and dabbled with Linux.  I tried to jump on to Linux band wagon long time ago and attempted to stick to it.  It was after several years that I realized Linux was likely not going ANYWHERE on the consumer side for the foreseeable future.  Linux will always be known as a great server operating system, reliable SAMBA share server, etc, but it will never surpass Windows or OS X.  Even Mac/OS X is popular among the consumers and look what this operating system is built on top of!  That being said, it does me no good to hate Apple just because I feel like it.  I bought their iPad 2 device and have been using it since it's initial launch (I did not buy it the first day of launch online, but definitely 3-4 days afterwards).  This device has been great since I purchased it the first day.  Yes, it does not support FLASH, but I realized this before I decided to buy the iPad.  The screen is sharp, the performance is fast and the screen touch is extremely responsive.  The battery life is really good compared to other devices (e.g. iPhone 4s, iPhone 3Gs).  It is a device for casual usage, you browse, you email, you do stuff for leisure.  I sometimes forget to connect the iPad to the charger over night, but I have not had to charge this device for 2-4 days, depending on how heavy I use it.  It's not like the iPhone where I MUST recharge it each night or else it will DEFINITELY run down the battery to critical level.  Granted, it's the WiFi version so it does not have the techno-complication of having to deal with 3G.  iPad 2 is very stable and robust.  I am definitely the type of person who would take every opportunity to criticize an Apple device, but I have to admit that I have had absolutely no problems using this iPad device.  I have no experience with any other tablet device in the market, but if you are wondering if you should get one or if this is going to be a reliable device, I can definitely say it has been super reliable in all phase it was made for since I received it.  Again, it does NOT support Flash, so be aware of this before you purchase it.  It's light weight, does a LOT of tasks that you can do from a computer and has a whole ton of apps available.  If you want to compare it to a computer, don't try to completely compare it apples to apples (pun intended), because it still isn't as \"flexible\" as a computer.  My laptop has a built in physical keyboard and mouse, I do not have to purchase a separate keyboard or mouse like I would have to for a iPad (you have to use the virtual keyboard on the iPad).  I can truly multitask on my Windows laptop, on the iPad it's \"semi-multitask\" at most.  The iPad cannot come close to the laptop's 8GB memory, 750 GB hard drive laptop that can run VMWare, play online multi-player games, store files where-ever I want, in whatever directory I created.  There are SO many things I can do on a laptop that the iPad currently cannot do... so unless you ONLY browse, type a few emails, make a few purchases from Amazon/eBay or other available stores and maybe chat occasionally online... then don't expect this iPad to really replace a laptop or desktop (I'm typing this review via laptop as it faster to do than on an iPad).  One negative about the iPad, but it's not Apple's fault, the Apps that people sell may be written for the iPad only or for iPhone only but sometimes written for both.  This means that if the app was designed specifically for the iPhone and you buy it... then it will not LOOK optimized for the iPad since the screen size on the iPad will make it stretched.  If you purchase the app for the iPad, then it may not even be available for the iPhone (I haven't seen an app for the iPad available for the iPhone).  Often they sell TWO different versions of the same app for both devices, so you have to pay double the amount to use them on your two devices.  Again, this review is about the iPad device, not about how the apps are developed, so overall, the iPad 2 is awesome... highly recommended for a tablet purchase.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sleek and functional", "Author": "J.

Just an oversized iPod Touch? That comparison always amuses me. Really? Ok....then buy an iPod Touch and write letters, and read articles and/books, watch videos, etc. on that tiny little screen. One of the major points of the iPad is it's larger screen!!  Some guy wrote about how the iPad sucks because of fingerprints on the screen. Really??? He must have filthy fingers!! When using my iPad I don't ever see fingerprints that get in the way of using the device. Oh sure, I see them when the unit is OFF, and then I wipe it clean if needed. But when it's on?? Please.The iPad can be used for almost anything we normal people do- reading, entertainment, shopping, surfing the web. No flash?? True....but really, there are not that many instances that pop up where the lack of Flash is a problem. If it were a real problem, then Apple would not have sold tens of millions of the device thus far. I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people \"purchase\" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really? You mean....you didn't know that when you bought it?  Seriously, some of the naysayers for this product that say \"it sucks\" and so on are clueless. This is a FANTASTIC product! Ok....so it IS a little pricey, I'll given them that. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab. Most products of this type that cost much less simply are not worth it. Maybe the Kindle Fire will be? Who knows?

Plus right now they are engraving it for free. iPad 2 - 16 for 499.00, w/ 3G 629.00. You can even go to Walmart and get it for that price. I also thought that ALL iPads had to be sold at the same price - I could be wrong here, because I heard that through a friend. I don't know how long of a wait shipping is here, but as of this writing, my delivery date would be July 22-24.So, if you don't mind the wait and you want the best deal for your iPad 2, Apple is the best bet. Or play it by ear and hope Walmart has one in stock and get it the same day.PS. My 5 stars rates the actual iPad itself. It's a great tool and I absolutely love it. Goes anywhere and the fact I can FaceTime with friends across state/ country is totally Star Trek, (I mean, this man totally knew what was coming. In the 60's, can you imagine.)I originally bought the 32GB with wi-fi only. Figured since you are not bound by a contract, (ie. 2 years to subscribe) I would get the 3G just in case I ever wanted that feature. You cannot upgrade. If I were to go on a trip, I could subscribe to 3G for a month and then cancel. THAT is AWESOME.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet But Not Perfect", "Author": "David L. Williams", "ReviewID": "R340UD6CAFHE49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my Ipad2. It is fast, very reliable and stable, and just plain fun.  But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.  First, as other reviewers have commented, the camera is the pits and really not up to Apple's ususal outstanding quality.  The second issue, in my opinion, is the slick aluminum back side material.  It looks pretty but really necessitates a case because it is slippery and without a means to get a better grip, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable fall.  I found the same problem with my Iphone.  It would be a much better devise if Apple used a rubberized type material on the back.  I spent alot of time comparing the Ipad2 with the Motorola Xoom at Best Buy before making my purchase, and I really don't think you could go wrong with either tablet.  The Xoom has a far better camera and does flash which might be a big plus if you are really into video and gaming. But flash also comes at a cost in performance and stability which is exactly why Apple doesn't use it.  The Ipad2 seems more intuitive to me and just seems to work better and do things quicker. But I have to admit that my familiarity with Iphone may partly influence my opinion on that point. Ipad also has many more apps available at the moment. One other drawback though,in my opinion, is the need to tether the Ipad to Itunes. I understand their logic, but I really wish it had a simpler PC-Ipad interface. Honestly if I didn't already have an Iphone I might have been inclined to buy the Xoom, but that's not taking anything away from the Ipad2 - it is a great tablet!", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "For those of you on the fence ... (gamers especially)", "Author": "H. Wang \"nycmode\"", "ReviewID": "R1FCQ0XY5I8VMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By now there are plenty of reviews that offer the pros and cons of the iPad 2 versus other tablets on the market.  With that in mind, I've decided to focus this particular review only for those of you who are in the same boat as me - which is debating whether or not to upgrade to an iPad 2 from the first gen iPad.After giving it much thought, I recently took the plunge and I am 100% sure that I made the right decision.  However, this is only in the context of how I use the tablet, which is primarily for gaming and other graphic intensive apps.  Previously I owned the AT&T; 3G iPad with 32GB of memory.  After giving it much thought, I decided to purchase the wi-fi only 64GB iPad 2, since I realized I don't actually used the 3G much.Most of the apps I use are very graphic intensive.  EA games such as Dead Space, FIFA 11 ... or Gameloft games such as Order & Chaos, Starfront, and Dungeon Hunter ... I play those games often and noticed a HUGE difference after I transferred my data to the iPad 2.  The games run much better, and there is a major change in terms of performance.  There is much less slowdown, and FIFA 11 actually plays like the way it should - fast and crisp (and not slow and turgid, like it was when I was playing the exact same game on the first gen iPad).  In cases like this - having the faster processor and added RAM makes a huge difference.Now if you're the kind of person who plays simpler, less graphic intensive games like Angry Birds, Diner Dash or World of Goo, you will probably not notice anything different.  You also won't really notice any difference if you stream or purchase videos as the display is the same as before.  Sorry, but no retina display this time around.But what you will be pleased with is the fact the iPad 2 is far lighter than it's predecessor.  This is important for those of you who spend a lot on the iPad playing games (like me).  It was no secret that the previous iPad was bulky and difficult to hold.  It also made it very tiring to grab the device for an extended period of time (making it difficult to play intense FPS or sports game without frequent rest periods).  The iPad 2's weight makes it much easier to hold and less burdensome to play games for a long time.  Long story short, my hands don't feel numb as often as I did when I used the old iPad.As for the other bells and whistles such as the camera/face time, etc ... all of that is well and good.  The interface is easy to figure out, so there isn't much brain surgery involved.  The smart cover is also a nice touch, though it's not a necessity.  I personally have one though, and I like it very much.So the biggest question here is - should you upgrade to iPad 2 if you already own one?  If you are a die hard gamer, the answer is 100% absolutely yes.  The difference in performance is absolutely striking and you will see the benefits of upgrading within seconds (so long as you play games that take advantage of the upgrade - i.e. games w/high production value).Even the apps I run outside of games run noticeably smoother and faster.  Using video/graphic intensive apps like CNN or ESPN XL is a snap, and they run much faster than on my previous iPad.In short, should you upgrade from the iPad to the iPad 2?1. If you play hardcore, graphic-intensive games - YES, upgrade ASAP2. If you run a lot of apps at the same time, like to use video/graphic intensive apps - YES, upgrade3. If you run apps that aren't that taxing (lighthearted games like Angry Birds, simple interface apps), or use the ipad to mostly surf, write email, etc - NO, upgrading is not necessary unless you have cash to spare (save your $$ for the iPad after the iPad 2 IMO).That's my 2 cents for folks on the fence.

I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.However, I warn purchasers of used AT&T; iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T; uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T; iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T; in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T; SIM card was required.  A local AT&T; store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T; is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T; store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T; removed it because I had not used any data.I rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.  However, for those who want to use occasionally use the cellular capability, you might want to do some more research.

A good one, of course.PROS:Weight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.Design: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.Durability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.Display: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.Apps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.Camera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.Battery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.Performance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce \"motion sickness\", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.Features: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.Overall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.Sent from my iPad", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product/Great seller", "Author": "dabrown", "ReviewID": "R3245CIL86TL5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an excellent package; iPad, cove and external keyboard.

With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones dont get timely OS upgrades)4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they dont deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.Reasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:1. Dependence on iTunes2. No SD input3.

Now that it has been released for six months and I own one, along with the first generation iPad and a HP Touchpad. I feel I am one person that can give a fair review of the item. Examining how the iPad 2 is an improvement over the original on the outside, inside, and how it compares to the Touchpad in terms of hardware and software is a great way to show why the iPad 2 is worth buying. When first grasping the iPad 2, you notice it is much thinner than the iPad 1. It is approximately the same thickness as a simple pencil; you may ask how does it not break? Well it is construced of aluminum on the back and gorilla glass on the front. The gorilla glass in the iPad 2 is double the strength of the similar type of glass used in the first generation iPad. The testers at the website Gizmodo.com compared these two pieces of glass with two pieces of wood and bending the glass between them. The iPad 2 glass stretched twice as far before breaking.  The glass is not perfect though, it will break it dropped without a case because it is indeed glass. Unlike the iPad 1, the iPad 2 has special tiny magnets built in around the screen that allows Apple's new product the smart cover to be usable. The cover sticks to the iPad 2 and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. This interesting feature is a feature not available with the first iPad. The screen size and resolution is the same as the original iPad, with a 9.7\" IPS technology screen and a 1024x768 resolution. A new addition to the iPad 2 is the cameras on both the front and the back of the device. The front facing camera, similar to that of the one in the Apple iPhone 4 is mainly used for skype and video conversations. The camera on the back is a low one megapixel camera, and is quite grainy. I cannot imagine anyone having a use for this and I myself have never found a use for it. It still is better than the originals iPad's though, since it does not even have a camera.  The iPad 2 can also be bought in the color white, unlike the original. I bought my iPad 2 from Apple.com the night it was available and got it in a few days with free shipping.The internals have gone through a drastic change between the two iPads. Apple, along with every other technology giant upgrades their devices to meet the latest technology. Apple has shown this by upgrading from the slower A4 single-core processor in the original iPad to the faster and much smoother dual-core A5 processor found in the iPad 2. The random access memory or RAM has been doubled between the two devices from 256 megabytes to 512 megabytes. The RAM upgrade allows more webpages to be open simultaneously in applications such as skyfire and safari. On the original iPad if you open ten pages at once, the device is quite slow and can even become unresponsive; on the new iPad ten pages is no problem, with no slowdowns. The speakers are the same in both iPad's, although the placement of them is a bit different. The hard drive storage options are the same in both devices, depending on how much you need. Available options are as low as 16GB to as high as 64GB. The video memory has also been upgraded in the iPad 2, allowing games such as Infinity Blade to run quickly and look much better, more realistic even. The figures in Infinity Blade look more closely to real humans than those shown on the first iPad. Overall it is good upgrade to the original in my opinion, since the price of the two is the same starting out.Knowing the iPad 2 is a good improvement over the original, how does it compare to similar tablet computers in the market? I own an HP Touchpad which is a similar tablet and it is a close comparison. The Touchpad features the same type of display, sporting a 9.7\" IPS technology screen just as the iPad 2. I consider the two being a tie in this category, because there really is not much of a difference. When it comes to overall shape the Touchpad is shorter than the iPad but the same width. I do not see this as being much of a difference either. The iPad 2 is considerably lighter than the touchpad it feels like, this should not matter too many people, the difference is not to major, and with a case the weight equals out. The touchpad has smaller hard drive options than the iPad 2; having only 16GB and 32GB options. I do not know many people that would use the full 64GB of data that can be bought in an iPad 2, but if you need that much than the iPad 2 would be the device to go with. Both my iPad 2 and touchpad have 16GB of data and I do not find myself looking for more space at all. My original iPad has 64GB of data and if I did not put my movies on it, I would have no use for the full 64GB. The camera comparison between the iPad 2 and the touchpad is another tie. While the touchpad only has one, front facing camera, it is of a much higher quality than both of the cameras on the iPad 2. Since the touchpad does not have a camera on the back and iPad 2 does, I give them a tie.  The touchpad has a dual-core processor, just as the iPad 2, but it is .2 gigahertz faster. The .2 gigahertz does not seem to make much of a difference, but since the speed is clocked faster, I give this to the touchpad. The battery life on the touchpad is very close to that of both iPad's. I do not notice much faster drainage between the three devices. A notable difference in the two devices is the speaker quality. The iPad 2 has decent speakers but not the best on the market; on the other hand, the touchpad uses higher quality beats audio, which is argued as some of the best on the market in 2011. It shows this, the sound quality on any music is like comparing static to clear, smooth sound between the two devices.  When it comes to price, originally they were both tied at $499 for the base price, but now the touchpad has been lowered to an extremely good, low price of $99. If you are on a budget and want a nice tablet, the touchpad is for you.When it comes to software, I have to say the iPad 2 dominates this category all around. The touchpad, which runs on WebOS is a system that does not have near the developers or supporters that the iPad 2 and the app store has. The app store has well over 500,000 applications that can be downloaded for free, or for a small fee to the iPad, whereas the touchpad has only a few 1,000. This attracts many more people to the iPad 2 because there is many more applications for anything you can think of in the app store, the selection of apps is very limited if you are buying the touchpad. If you are using a phone as a main internet connection, you will notice trouble when trying to connect the touchpad to the internet; this is because the touchpad does not support ad-hoc networks. This is a downfall for people like me that live on the iPhone internet tethering; the iPad 2 does support these networks and has no trouble connecting. For most people this will not be an issue but it something that should be known and that I was not aware of when I bought the touchpad. When using the touchpad, it is just as fluid as the iPad 2 when it comes to scrolling between pages of applications and searching through the device.  WebOS itself is not a bad system to use, and if it had more applications I believe it would be a great system.If you are stuck on deciding a tablet computer to buy, ask yourself what you are expecting. If you want just a simple tablet computer, with no cameras, lots of apps and good ability to function, the iPad 1 would be good. Although if you want a nice, newer tablet with a camera you have to decide how much your budget is? The iPad 2 and the touchpad are close in mostly every category besides the selection of apps, is the price difference of $400 worth the app store? I myself believe the iPad 2 is a wonderful device to have and use if your budget can afford it, otherwise I would highly recommend the $99 HP touchpad.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "iGod", "Author": "Thinkman \"SmartEnoughToKnowBetter\"", "ReviewID": "R6RXLJJ7UQP92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have difficulty with my arms, but my finger dexterity is still pretty good.

When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the \"original purchase date\".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.

There were no scratches or dents...nothing on it that I would be surprised of. Thank you for such a quick delivery. This will definitely give me time to familiarize myself prior to the start of my hiring season in the next couple of weeks!The iPad is in wonderful condition. I am so glad that I ordered the Verizon version. The data package deals are not too bad and can be purchased directly from the iPad. The apps are super fun and the apps that I will use for my kids are not that expensive, between 2 and 5 dollars. A note to self would be that IBM Lotus notes is not immediately compatible with Mac. The installation looks as if it happens, but the id name does not install. There are Youtube videos with instructions, but I am not the most computer savvy so I do not necessary understand the instructions.

(reiview may still need revising)", "Author": "moon fox", "ReviewID": "R3LM338BSH5SJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons..It is faster.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin..Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?The following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!First facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.Camera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B gradeApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.Battery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.App download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!WiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!Speakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.Covers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.App Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.Note where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.Video and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.Personal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat..The apps are great and so are their function..A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad..Videos and photo booth..speed!-------> ZOOMGRAND CLOSING..These are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading!

While its price may be a little expensive I defiantly think it's worth every penny.Part of the reason the iPad  is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems. You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable!!!", "Author": "mate", "ReviewID": "R2ABV8KH4CLFBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not sure if I'm gonna get a black or white but I'm very glad I got the white cuz it's really coooool!!", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Rafael", "ReviewID": "RQU2HO49E9KQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente producto, hice mi compra desde Venezuela y el aparato llego a tiempo y en perfecto estado, altamente recomendado el vendedor.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "CRiley10", "ReviewID": "R2VZ1QK5RIE4YH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband ordered this item (iPad 2, 16gb, black) for work. He loves it. We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.In conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected.

The box is very sleek and makes you very happy with your purchaseSetup: Now since this is only the wifi version, it doesn't require much setup.Now after everything was setup, I had fun connecting downloading all the apps and seeing what neat things I could do with it. I have an iPhone so I was apply to move over all my photos, songs, files, etc to the iPad and it was very easy. The plan for this iPad is to use in meetings and allow the customers to flip through the pictures or files that I am showing.Downfalls: The issues I have been having with this is that since I only have an iPhone 3GS, the tethering (personal hotspot) can only be connect through bluetooth so the internet isn't as fast as through wifi. I also wish there was some sort of case that comes with the iPad. I had to spend an additional $50 for a case to protect it. The front cases that Apple make I find are not helpful at all in terms of protection so I wish Apple would offer a better of assortment of accessories rather than having to buy 'made for the ipad' products.Overall I am quite happy and am enjoying the iPad.

After a month of frequent use, I must say it is the nearest to perfection piece of technology I have ever owned.

All of these are better than on a PC, Mac, or Ipod Touch, all of which I have experienced and own. Being a guy in his 50's, I like the ability to read with finger swipes, and adjust the font size to suit my eyes. I like the Flipboard app organization of articles I read.

Lynch \"the_onewhoknows\"", "ReviewID": "R16AH9C7KZ45FG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "April 4, 2011 -- Apple Security shot would be robbers of the Chula Vista, CA store, killing one person and severely wounding two others, No iPAds or other Apple equipment was damaged, so Apple investors' earnings and capital are safe.Most people probably would not go to the same extremes as Apple does to protect their iPad's, iPod's, and i-everything else's.  But think about WHY you want an iPad-2 or similar device, then compare the convenience and utlility of owning the devices, and Apple's iPad is very hard to beat.The big negative is the high price.  Another is no full hardware-level interface for UBS, SD, or Flash/Shockwave/Adobe support -- I can't figure out why not. You can hook several devices into the iPad-2, but in most cases (especially for cameras, SD cards, etc.) you'll need to have at least one physical media adapter.  Apple has maintained that Adobe Flash, Showckwave, et.al are obsolete, so they have no plans to support any of it.  Time will tell if Apple is correct (if not, then expect another adapter in a year or so).The positives outweigh the negatives however.The size and weight make the iPad-2 extremely easy to carry around, and convenient to use. For now, this IS a major advantage, but 'Moore's Law' about the rate of electronics miniaturization is still 'in effect', so the iPad-2's weight and dimension advantage will be gone within 2 years. By 2013, it's a good bet that all devices will be at elast as light and thin as the iPad-2, and they'll all do 'more stuff, faster' for about the same (or maybe less) money.The iPad-2's camera-system, with 'face-to-face' conferencing potential is more of a theoretical advantage than a real one: it only works well if you and the people with whom you're conferenceing have similar device capability (2 way video) and reliable broad-bandwidth availability. Otherwise, the experience and results are less than thrilling.The iPAD2 RAM memory is double that of the iPAD (512MB), which means faster performance of many graphic-intensive apps, and better responsiveness for users who like to 'multi-task' with several apps running at once.The Application software availaible fo the iPad-2 far exceeds that which is available for most competing devices, both in terms of quantity and quality. This is probably the main reason to get an iPad 2 -- you can just do more stuff (useful, recreationsl, fun, or other) with an iPAD-2, because more people have developed and marketed apps for the iPad/Apple platform than has been the case for anything else.  Given the overall state of flux for mobile computing, with platform and operating systems shifting, APPL (with a relatively stable operating platform and system) may be able to maintain its advantage in applications for some time.Worth killing people to own?  Don't mess with Apple: if you go into their stores, be sure you have enough money to get out alive.  In the mean time, April 2011 seems to be a good month in which to sell AAPL common stock. Legal and other problems appear likely to take a severe toll on the company'e equity valuation.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't drink the apple kool-aid", "Author": "Brandon Sherman", "ReviewID": "R11VB13AMPSRVD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do you like watching online media that comes from other media distributors and not just pay apple for everything you watch? Would you like to watch videos you already own on a mobile Device without hours of re-encoding to Apples proprietary format for each video you want to watch?Well then don't buy Apple products because they have the same IRON Grip on every one. I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.If you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work. (two things Apple don't want you to be able to use so you have to get videos and games from them.)Now I can't speak for the Galaxy (though I've heard good things) but the Asus Eee pad is great for video. To watch video on the Asus Eee pad you plug in the pad, it comes up as a drive, you drag your video files to the Asus pad, and then you watch them without having to re-encode. This pad has played every video file I've tried. Be smart get almost anything other than an Ipad, you'll be happier not being told what you can do, and what to buy, that is ALMOST as good as what YOU actually want to do with a product YOU spent money for.And remember don't drink the Apple Kool-aid and don't listen to the brainwashed hype of the Apple sheep who tell you to stay in the heard.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Apple does not fix Ipads", "Author": "UNHAPPY BUYER", "ReviewID": "R1QGO04HYAG62W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BUYER BEWARE - IPADS ARE DISPOSABLE ELECTRONICS. My Ipad broke so I took it to an Apple store, but THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. Instead Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option may be to throw your Ipad away. This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period. If you are one of those that just has to have an Ipad then buy the cheapest one, otherwise buy the competitors for \u00bc to \u00bd the price of an Ipad.
