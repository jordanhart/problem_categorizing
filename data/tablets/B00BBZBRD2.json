I like 32 bit windows 8 as you can use 16 bit programs from the past (I know, counter-intuitive to what touch screen apps are about) But I don't care much for win8 apps anyway. At home I plug in a mouse and keyboard (I bought the jacket, otherwise no USB ports!) I also bought microSD memory which is stuck into the paperclip hidden port to extend storage. I like how Windows finally caught up with Android regarding turning the tablet to automatically resize to portrait view - good for my PC Kindle reader - I use the software download and not the app.One thing I found exceptional was the sound quality - at first it seemed kind of muffled bass colored, but turn up the volume - about twice the output volume of any other PC I have owned (I am talking about quality headphones plugged in first - not using the ultra-mini speakers which you shouldn't expect much out of in the first place.)WiFi power sucks - I guess they were engineering towards power savings in that department - so you have to be close to an APSo, a lot more memory and a more powerful WiFi receiver would make this ElitePad smokin'!", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BBZBRD2"}}
