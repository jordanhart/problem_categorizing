{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Tablet!", "Author": "Sandy Y. Liu", "ReviewID": "R3J9F7FQMAAZQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've refrained from buying a tablet for several years now. I've ogled the ipad and the new ipad for many years now, but I've not purchased a tablet because I have a smart phone (HTC evo 4G) and a laptop and a tablet just seems like a duplication of what I already have.  However, times are a changing and I'm seeing how the right tablet can enhance my work life (I\"m an attorney).  So, for my 2012 birthday, my husband \"gave\" me a tablet.First, I bought the new Ipad. Then, I returned the Ipad because it is incompatible with everything in my house and work.  I don't want to install ITunes everywhere I want to be able to plug my tablet in to download/upload documents.  I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows. I like to put my apps around borders and group them..Second, from Costco, I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and played around with it. I really liked it, but I feel like between the Samsung 7 inch tablets and the Note 10.1, the Tab 2 10.1 is the Jan Brady of the lot... so.. this leads me to the Note 10.1.I was able to conduct a side by side comparison of the Tab 2 10.1, the Note 10.1 and the Ipad.  The Note (and Galaxy Tab 2) were noticably lighter and thinner than the Ipad.  The screen on the Samsungs were also slighly (like 1/2 inch) larger than the Ipad.What I really liked (and grew accustomed to from my HTC Android phone) was that when you plug the tablet into your laptop, the laptop recognizes the tablet as a connected device.  Conversely, the Ipad did nothing more than open up Itunes.  Further, when I dropped a document (.pdf or WORD) into the Note 10.1, I could see it actually syncing with the device.  Then when I turned on the Note 10.1 to find the document, it was easy to locate!  Conversely, on the ipad, I had to download a $4.99 .pdf viewer and a $9.99 word processing application, and then upload the documents via Itunes before I could make my documents work.  Since my home and office set up don't include any Apple products, the Ipad just is not a convenient option for me.Now the I also noticed a difference between the Note 10.1 and the Tab 2 10.1 in speed (the Note was just a tad quicker), and just the feel was just more smooth.The S pen: I uploaded a .pdf document and was able to use the S pen to make notes on the document.  That was pretty cool and much neater than writing with my finger.Control:  I'm a control freak. I want to put the app icons wherever I want them. I also like to arrange them by group around the perimeters of the screens.  I can do this on the Samsungs.  I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I \"need\" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store (\"PLAY\").  One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.  The other app was a e-transcript reader.I'm really happy with this purchase and my very first tablet.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm finished, finally.", "Author": "Allen Alberti", "ReviewID": "RRD6ILBHI7T2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is going to be short because you can already read about the specs on this tablet everywhere.  I have 5 tablets and have had 4 smartphones, and I have over 20 styluses (stylii?) including a Jot, Jot Pro, DAGi, and a Nomad Brush.Simply put, I am never buying a tablet that doesn't include an S-Pen again.

It is very useful for students. it has a lot of features for college students like S-Note. you can take notes while recording the lectures. The best of all S-Note does all your math problems for you. it recognizes the formulas, and shapes like triangle as you draw. once you draw something just hit search and it will give you all the possible answers for that questions with the graphs.The pen is very accurate with many different options available like paint brush, pencil, marker and sketch pen.The camera quality is awesome front and back.Very light weight.Good battery life and very fast.(yes, it does not slow down)..It's got the Microsoft office just as the desktop version, named as polaris office. It's got PhotoShop preinstalled.The flash player has to be downloaded manually by going to app store and search for adobe flash player installer. after installing the installer just hit download and install and enjoy the flash sites.The adobe reader needs to be downloaded and it offers a great deal of features in it like highlight text in different colors, add stickies and notes into it and it is very smooth.The games play very smooth like GTA3 vice city stories and some others.It is a universal remote control that means it controls all kinds of tv's, dvd, blue ray players and dish network boxes and a lot more.Overall Its a great deal and worth spending $499. I love it.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Functional tablet, first-gen. game changer", "Author": "Tim Kimzey \"fstop\"", "ReviewID": "R3SKCEH2187VB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others, i read the horrid initial reviews spitting out the viral misinformation about this tablet and although i was interested in it, i almost dismissed it and continued to search for another tablet. I'm glad i didnt after reading actual USER reviews, and forums such as xda developers give much more enlightened information.Although i am still getting my feet wet after just a few days of ownership, i am very happy with my investment.This tablet is the perfect bridge for me between a smart phone and desktop, and in many ways adds functions that even a highend desktop is incapable of, in particular the stylus s-pen input. Personally i wanted to be able to use the device for drawing and photo manipulation, as i am a photographer/graphic artist. Is it perfect? No, but ive been using Photoshop since about vs.1 and seen it grow by bounds. PS Touch is still an infant, but is usable, it can only get much better with updates and new versions.If the prospect of writing drawing and input with a pen is not for you, then by all means maybe you should look for an alternative with a \"better\" screen. The pen input is the whole point (pun intended) of this device, and even though this is new to tablet tech, it works quite well. I have used a Wacom input tablet for years on my destop, but was always frustrated by the hand on tablet while looking at monitor issues. As an artist being able to draw on the device is so much more intuitive, precise, and FUN...the way it should be. Thats not to say there is not a learning curve with the softwares. But being able to bring a device this size with you anywhere and draw paint etc, without a bevy of actual paint tubes, pencils, other medium, is just amazing. The software is somewhat limited as yet, but is still useable and should only get better as developers and users realize how useful and desirable this can be. I am using Touch as well as Autodesk Sketchbook, Infinite Paint/Design, FrescoPro, among others so far.The battery life is just amazing...this thing can literally go all day long. If you dont use it continuously all day it can last for days without charging.Does it feel cheaply made? Not to me. But im more concerned with what i can use it for instead of the look or color of the shell or the brand logo emblazed on it. Seems quite sturdy and mine doesnt creak in my hands.I got the 16gb version as it was readily available, and i added a 64gb card to the slot, for less than the $50 extra for the 32g model. Thank you so much for adding the card slot, Samsung!The audio quality is very good. The builtin speakers are great for their size, lack bass, but have clean clarity. The actual output is very good though. Ive read that the opamp is made by Wolfson but cant confirm, it is comparable to the SQ of the GalaxyNexus phone though. My preferred music player is PowerAmp (amazing sq and user tweaking).Wifi and Bluetooth work very well. Great signal with good range. No problems connecting to any bt devices so far. Have also used my Epson 645 to print from tablet wirelessly.Email and browser apps work great as does the Multiscreen with limited but useful apps.This review was written using the Note with the on-screen keyboard.I will try to update with more information as i use the Note more. So far i am extremely happy with this tablet!*** UPDATE (10-7-2012):Still loving my Note.Am using several art apps successfully on the tablet, including AutoDesk SketchBook (i'm using the full paid version), Infinite Painter, FrescoPro, and ZenBrush.So far, really like it. The S-pan is pretty precise and i think there are a good many levels of gradation/pressure sensitivity.PS Touch is usable for editing photos on the fly. \"NexusMediaImporter\" is a great app for dowloading raw files into your Note.You will need this or similar adapter, which works quite well for the cheap price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00(Sanoxy Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet. With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive. I use the app on my smartphone as well (GalaxyNexus) to be able to able and transmit photos out of my DSLR in the field (i'm a photojournalist), and it works quite well.If you have read the comments, you'll see that a 64gb sd card will work great in the Note 10.1, AFTER the latest ICS upgrade to 4.04. Otherwise, you will need to reformat some of the newer cards that come formatted in the exFAT format to FAT32. But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.My particular card is a Sandisk \"MobileUltra\" SDXC card with a Class10 rating. It works great in the Note, and i have over 50gb of content on it, including music (MP3) and photo (JPG) files.I have also opened text files, including MS WORD documents, that will successfully open using the included PolarisOffice app on the Note, and are then editable in Polaris ;) which seems to be a very nice included software on the tablet.Also, i just dont understand the reviews, comments on the Note's so-called horrid screen resolution. It seems quite sharp to me. No, it doesnt have the 'HD' resolution of some newer devices, but it is my no means bad. It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10\" screen. I have also downloaded and am using different fonts, with i think look even sharper to my eyes.The Note10.1 is a nice tablet for the price, and is quite functional to actually DO THINGS with. Until the MS Surface tablets appear and we see how well the new Win8 touch interface works, S-pen is among the very best interfaces for writing and art there is at the moment, and the price is quite reasonable for this technology.***UPDATE 10-19-2012A few more comments with more use:The Polaris app will view, open, edit files including Word, PDF, etc., and is a very useful and well developed app.The sound quality of this device is very good, particularly when using apps such as PowerAmp to tweak the sound.Battery life is EXCELLENT, i can use the Note for generally 2-3 days of use (with at least 2-3 hours a day) before a recharge.Reading works well on the Note as well, including Kindle, Aldiko, Nook, and YouVersion apps. Also using some digital magazine subscriptions.As i almost waited for the release of MS Surface, with the price now being known to be $600 (with the keybord cover), i am happy i didnt. That's for the RT version, not the full Win8 version to be released next year, with a much higher price to be announced.And the Note's touch interface with S-pen is i'm sure still a more advanced input, as well as the limited app availability for WindowsRT at the moment.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally found a tablet that works like it should.", "Author": "Dave S \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R11TL419DKRBOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a long time and did alot of research before buying my first android tablet. Based on professional reviews, I purchased an Asus Transformer prime. Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money. Again based on professional reviews,  I purchased an Asus Transformer Infinity. I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems. What I learned was - Do not trust professional reviews. This Samsung galaxy note is such a pleasure to use.  It does everything I ask it to do, in a timely manner. I have had it for a couple of months and it has NEVER crashed on me, not once!  The more I use it, the more I love it. I have not taken my Dell laptop out of the case in over a month.  Excellent web browsing, syncs with my desktop computer chrome browser. I find my self using the S-Pen more and more. I can consume media from virtually any source. Great with any game I play and it's an excellent e-book reader. I manage my TiVo's over the network and web, I can even make and receive phone calls and send text messages using Google Voice  and Groove IP (If I have a WIFI connection). Every week, I find something new that I can do with this tablet. I average about 3 days between charging, and that is with heavy use. The front facing speakers sound very good compared to other tablets I have used. The display is not 1920 x 1080 but it looks fantastic and that is what matters to me. The note actually has better color reproduction than the Asus Infinity. Being able to use two apps side by side has been a life saver. Just a note: Adobe flash player installed with no problems, and I am able to watch all forms of video on the web. In closing, from my experience this is the best tablet on the market at this time, and I highly recommend it!", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best there is in the tablet world at this point", "Author": "Pen Fanatic \"Penz\"", "ReviewID": "R2L1FUO9T6XFHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally had the 16 gb but sold that to a friend due to my dislike of the limited space, and I bought this 32 gb right after. This device is AMAZING. It does everything you need a tablet to do from watching videos, downloading all kinds of apps, listening to music, surfing the web, reading books, and most of all TAKING NOTES.My laptop has been gathering dust for a long time now since I got the Note 10.1. I use it on a daily basis for all sorts of tasks from balancing my checkbook to taking notes to playing games and even word processing.The word processing is a bit of a headache on any device without a good quality physical keyboard. I bought a Logitech keyboard for Android and now even word processing is a breeze on this (especially with good applications like Kingsoft, PowerWriter, and the built-in Polaris). You really can't go wrong with this device. It easily beats out the iPad (which I also own, the third generation) in everything except perhaps display (which is better on the iPad). The multi-tasking is just plain ridiculous on the Note 10.1 (ridiculous as in amazing -- sorry for the slang). You get Android 4.0 on the device initially, and that allows for multi-tasking. But when you update your software to the Jellybean version (4.1, I believe), you feel almost like you're on a computer. For a number of apps, you can use split screen, resize windows, etc. The other day I was able to keep open my Lecture Notes app (for handwriting notes), my Polaris app (for viewing documents), my calculator, a music player, and I'm still able to open more like movies, and YouTube and an Web browser! And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows. You can even close out one or more windows (either individually or all at once) with a simple swipe or tap.Then it also comes with dual speakers so if you don't have earphones, you can still easily hear the video or music you're listening to. It's so easy to watch videos and movies and shows on it in landscape with those speakers when you're with company. Also, let's not forget its main feature: The S-Pen! Another amazing innovation by Samsung. This is especially useful for students, artists, and business people. You can write as though you were using a pen and paper. You might wonder the usefulness of it, but trust me, you can do so much on a tablet with that kind of capability. It comes built in with photoshop which I don't use but everyone I know seems to rave over...and the S-Pen seems to be a natural tool for this app. For apps that I use like S-Note, the ability to type something and then draw an illustration or a chart or write out an equation/formula saves me so much time and effort. The handwriting recognition is also one of those features that when you try it you, you'll wonder how the heck did you live without it?Going from this to the iPad was a major step down. I own both and use both, but this is a far superior machine with far superior functions. I personally think that this is not only the best Android tablet out there currently, but that it is better than any tablet so far ever made. This device not only makes things like gaming, movies, etc. possible and enjoyable, but goes a step further by making the tablet a serious tool for actual work like writing and note-taking and editing images, etc.While I can go on and on about how much I love the tablet and how great it is compared to the competition with all its features and capabilities, there are going to be some drawbacks naturally as no device is perfect. The battery life is good, but that's because I rarely take it off Power Saving mode and only occasionally type on it. The built-in S-note is limited to some extent in that it doesn't carry with it other useful features found in ordinary word processors like word count. As a handwriting app, it's great, but I find myself using Lecture Notes more (a couple of bucks on the Play store) because the size of each page on the latter as well as the ability to customize between college ruled or wide ruled (or blank) makes it feel more like paper when writing notes completely by hand. Accessories don't seem to be anywhere near as common (if a lot even exist) for this device as for the competition especially as for the iPad. Keyboard cases designed for the Note 10.1 are horrible made-in-China products that work only barely and are not suitable for fast and/or accurate typing. Even Samsung's keyboard dock for this device doesn't even exist in the US as of yet, and if you're in the States and want to buy one, it looks like you're going to have to settle for one from Europe, like the UK (though I've heard there are some US onlne stores that have their hands on these and selling them here). The display does not match the iPad's no matter how much better the Note is than the iPad. It's not a \"bad\" display by far, but the Retina Display is simply crisp and beautiful to look at. Also, I don't like the 10.1\" design (others may disagree). I feel that a shape like the iPad's is more practical for writing notes and doing things like playing games, but that might just be a very personal preference. (In case you don't know, the Note 10.1 is longer/larger than the iPad by a bit, but it is more rectangular in shape while the iPad comes closer to a square in shape, but not quite a square.)I don't know what else to say: if you have any questions, just ask and I'll be happy to reply.My final opinion: I think that this device convinced me that the tablet can be seriously used as a device for work as well as pleasure, and that accessory makers should start focusing on this product for making keyboards, cases, etc. I also feel that this tablet should convince developers to focus more on Android apps than on iOS apps simply because devices like this allow for so much more flexibility and because I see this as leading the way for more innovative Android products in the future.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung hits a bulls-eye", "Author": "Omalika S. Lipp", "ReviewID": "R1MNFKULY130X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this tablet from Amazon last Thursday as a \"warehouse deal\" - it was pretty much brand new - no detectable wear or flaws whatsoever. The top of the box had a \"Quality Control\" check-off sheet stating that the data had been wiped, factory reset was completed, and everything was inspected. Even the plastic peel-off things on the Note was intact. If a warehouse deal is available, definitely jump on it.This is my first tablet, but I'm quite a tech-junkie, so I'd rate myself as an \"advanced user\".I won't beat a dead horse here. The five hundred or so reviews before mine can give you plenty of insight into the S-Pen, the processing power, the battery life, etc. Rather, I'm here to touch on what has been overlooked by other reviewers, and to rate the entire unit as a whole.Things I found out after I bought the tablet:-Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean was released for this tablet only a few days ago. Being able to play with the tablet before and after the upgrade has let me see how much more improved this Android version is... and it is stellar. Besides the obvious stability fixes, it just... works! The applications and user interface is SMART. I can't stress this enough. The apps work with each other (Dropbox and QuickPic are good examples), and the interface is great (custom home-screen, widgets, etc.). When I open a file in Photoshop, it asks me what source I want to use. I have more shortcuts to apps than I know what to do with. I can switch between applications flawlessly. When I downloaded a 3.5gb game, it asked me if I wanted to save to external SD instead of on-board memory (YES!). When I try to charge it from a source that doesn't provide enough power (it needs 5v 2A), the tablet tells me that it is receiving inadequate power. When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs). I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card. It accessed the SD card witout any issues. Coming from my HTC Desire HD as my last Android device, these are huge advancements in interoperability and ease-of-use.-iOS is inherently better. This is a sacrilegious statement, I know, but hear me out. iOS comes out-of-the-box with stellar capabilities and performance, not to mention having great customizability. On the other hand, Android comes with some very, very quirky issues out-of-the-box (How about the fact that I can't set a lock-screen wallpaper that isn't a square? I have a 16:10 screen and you force me to use 1:1... WHY?). But, the upside is that there is an app and a fix for everything. If you find something quirky and poorly designed within the Android OS, chances are, someone else came across the same issue and wrote an app to address said issue, usually for free. On the other hand, while iOS is inherently more robust, the expansion and app-based fixes are much more limited. If you find something quirky and weird in iOS, chances are, you're stuck with it forever. This means that Android is weaker off the starting line, but as you customize the OS and add your own personal tweaks and such, it will eventually surpass iOS.-This thing is solidly built, with a beautiful screen. Don't listen to the naysayers about how pixilated text is, because it really isn't. 1280x800 with a 10.1\" screen gives you 150 pixels per inch (PPI). For reference, the 15\" MacBook Pro Retina has 220 PPI (113 PPI for non-Retina), and the iPad Retina has 264 PPI (132 PPI for non-Retina).As far as the build quality goes, I haven't noticed a \"creak\" or \"squeak\" when I flex the tablet. Then again, I don't use my tablet as a torque wrench. I keep it in a book-like case and treat it as if it cost me two car payments (which it did). And I assume most people who buy one of these will do the same. Why worry about things that aren't an issue?However, there are some quirks to Note (haha, get it?).-The 3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet. This makes it kind of awkward to use when the tablet is standing upright with a case, as you have to route the cable behind and around the screen in order to prevent it from obstructing your view.-You can't choose the location of your Google Play store. I live in Japan and want to shop the American Play store. However, because it detects my IP address as originating from Japan, it forces me to use the Japanese store. The only way to circumvent this is to use a VPN or some other more questionable methods. On the other hand, Apple's App Store lets you select the region you want to shop from. Luckily for most of you this won't be an issue.-There isn't a solid-quality keyboard case yet. iPads have a plethora to choose from, but this tablet only has a handful, and none are very well reviewed. Your best bet is to have a small Bluetooth keyboard if you need to do some serious typing, until a good case/keyboard combo is manufactured.The bottom line: This thing rocks. Whatever purpose you need a tablet for, you'll find some unbelievably amazing things that are possible and most likely completely unrelated to what you originally purchased this tablet for. One thing that comes to mind is cloud-based video editing. Edit videos on your tablet, the file is compiled/rendered off-site on a high-powered computer, and the final product is sent back or available on the cloud. The capabilities are literally endless.Just do yourself a favor, stop shopping around, and buy this tablet. If you don't like it, send it back.

It is truly great for productivity and for minimizing the amount of papers you have to carry. It is great to:1. Take notes at school on PDFs given out by professors. Before I had to print out the slides before class, take notes, and then carry them around for weeks to be able to study them. Carrying around all those notes was so messy not to mention heavy! I now just download the lecture slides and take notes using annotate or use the multi-screen option by using s-note.2. I do all my homework on this. I just use s-note to do all my homework (I'm taking several science classes) and before I needed to carry around several color pens, and erasers and papers just to be able to do my homework. Now I just create a document in s-note, export it, and upload it using dropbox, and then I can print it from any of my devices linked to my dropbox account.

I used all three of them several times a day for a period of three weeks. The Nexus 7 was nice, but was too small for tethering to my DSLR and lacked a micro SD port. The Asus was slow, uncomfortable to hold, and the high resolution screen meant that many of my apps would no longer run on it. So I gladly returned the Nexus 7 and Asus TF700T, and kept the Samsung Note 10.1 for myself. I own a photography studio and need to provide my artists with updated technology on a regular basis. This means I have been very fortunate to use over a dozen different/new computers every year...Without any exaggeration, the Note 10.1 is the absolutely best tablet I have ever owned or tested. That's not to say that it's \"perfect\". (If you are looking for \"perfect\", that's not a realistic/possible expectation to begin with.)The Wacom technology built in is a godsend to any student, professional, or artist who wants a more effective way to interface with the tablet and do work or take notes. NOTE: The small pen is pretty cute, but I never use it. I bought a $10 Axiotron Pen instead. That pen is light weight too but full size, allows for ordinary Wacom nibs to be used, and gives the full pressure sensitivity you'd expect from a Wacom device.Other things I like about the Note 10.1:- Samsung's two frontal speakers are amazing for a tablet, and honestly are better sounding than many lighter laptops.- The tablet's rounded edge design makes it easy to hold in your hand.- Speedwise, this tablet soars. It was far faster at running the same software than the Asus TF700T was.- The interface is more enjoyable to use and feels more refined than the Google Nexus 7's was.- There are so many different little \"EXTRAS\" added to this tablet that it's enormously fun just to play around with, such as the ability to control most the electronic devices in your home, and the haptic/vibration feedback when playing games.- When sitting in the mall studying on the couches, I use the remote control feature of the Note 10.1 to clandestinely lower the Mall's main TV volume or change the channels without anyone else knowing how it happened. Ha ha..The reason I bought all three tablets was because I read a couple ridiculously bad reviews for this particular product on smaller \"so-called professional tablet websites\". I wanted to test the tablets for myself and make my OWN best decision. After using the Samsung Note 10.1 and seeing how powerful, smooth, and FUN it is to use and work on, the only thing I can guess is that those \"few other sights\" were being bribed by Apple to give bad reviews for anything Samsung makes? Out of all the complaints I read on those other reviews, half of what they said was a pure lie, and the other half was user stupidity. (After owning the Samsung Note 10.1 for myself, I cannot believe how absurd those initial reviews were.)But seriously, don't take my word for it! Buy this Samsung Note 10.1 and any other tablet you are curious about. Compare them carefully for a couple weeks. I bet you will do just as I did: return the other tablet(s) and very happily keep the Samsung Note 10.1 instead!", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comparing it to the 4th gen iPad when used for graphics / art", "Author": "Rick V \"Bargain hunter by day, shopaholic at ...", "ReviewID": "RCH6UQRD296ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since the are already so many reviews on here for this item I thought I would add a specific angle.

As a matter of fact, I was always the type of guy building PC's, creating FreeNAS servers, experimenting with software etc. more Microsoft than Apple.The adoption of Apple into my household came when I started to buy computers for my Dad, nephews and nieces and MIL. Due to distance it became aggravating to get the calls where they were stuck with a blue screen or something else after downloading some virus or upgrading some driver. It was always something. So I decided that I would buy a tablet to see if my dad would be able to use that. That was e first Apple device into my home.I liked the usability, simplicity of the interface and the Apple-typical lack of buttons. All in all, I was pleased with how fast my 80+ year old dad was able to use it. No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.then cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.I found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them. I was a believer.I stuck with the iPads and am currently on the 4th gen. Since iPads are invading my workspace I find myself using it mostly and running into some of the limitations.How I use the tabletsI mostly use my tablet work wise for the development of graphics for presentations that outline complex solutions. We do not use standard PowerPoint stuff but have a philosophy of custom and hand drawn pictures that can, if necessary, be Peter live on a whiteboard.Since the ipad does not have any native pressure sensitivity I had to wait until someone came out with a pressure sensitive stylus. At this point there are a few on the market and after looking at reviews I settled for the Jot Not Touch. I mainly use it with Sketchbook Pro, Touchdraw and so on.Here are the limitations I have found:- the disk tip that is needed for precision on the ipad is still somewhat inaccurate and hard to handle. I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.- the pressure sensitivity seems to go off and on. Sometimes I find myself pressuring harder and harder to get the same results. This makes for lots of time spent handling the stylus and ipad combo rather than thinking about the quality of my graphics design- the styluses for the ipad that have reassure sensitivity either have weird tips or are bulky to handle. I am 5'11\".I also use the ipad to communicate via iMessage with all my family all over the world. iMessage is so simple and effective and I get it everywhere.without ads and other nonsense.Finally,and this is quite important once your have the Apple drug in your house: I have connected my home with a series of Airports and time machines. The airports connect to various stereo systems and apple TV's and I can simply control. Everything from my ipad, or my wife from hers.it is supremely easy and connected at a fraction of the cost I would have had if I bought the Sony or Bose solutions for this.Now about the GN10.1I bought it because I was working on another graphics project and got fed up with the clumsy stylus and ipad combo. I even paid overnight rush shipping to get it. And you know what, the Samsung embedded pressure sensitive stylus is so much better than the solution needed with the ipad. The tip is precise, the stylus is the right size, perhaps a little too light and thin but better than what I had for the ipad.I have spent less time messing with the hardware and more time on my work, so great kudosto Samsung.Also, the GN is fast, there is nothing to complain about with the 1.4 quad core compared to the ipad.The screen, however, on the ipad, is visibly better when. Drawing thin lines. It doesn't brother me too much since I can simply zoom in and the pixelation disappears but I can't wait for the next GN gen to see if samsung is going to up the ante and increase screen resultion.I also noted that the battery of the GN seems to notably outlast the ipad battery. My guess is that it outlasts my ipad battery by an extra 30% or so. Maybe because the Bluetooth stylus on the ipad hogs battery? I dunno, but again, Samsung gets it right-er, erer...So conclusion: as a graphics tablet solution the Samsung is hands down the winner. Ipad should not even be considered as a mature solution. The retina display is the only redeeming quality.When it comes to messaging etc... It's criminal what junk sits in the Google Play store. Everything seems invested with adware and when you buy versions with no ads you are looking at tons of different solutions... Which nes will your friends be willing to use? Now your friends have to start adding software to message you if you do not make the right pick. Especially when you have your friends and family spread over the globe.That is what I feel is really needed: a native android version of iMessage that works between any and all androids. Bridging into iMessage is not androids responsibility but for crying out loud, I don't want to download and pay for tons of crappy messaging software that does not let me reach my friends and family.  Apple wins.I am using Skype on both,  but find myself more on the ipad with iMessage to stay in touch.Finally, the integration into my household with the airports and stereo links. Luckily my synology audio android software can speak.  Airport, so there is a solution albeit a little bit jerryrigged. This android audio app streams and controls music on any synology diskstation and can feed it into your apple network if need be.  Apple, since they have a vertical solution that you can expand with, is very well integrated. Apple wins.I love both tablets, am deeply impressed with the Samsung solution since its not a simple copy and steal solution and love the ipad for its simplicity. However, for what I use them for work wise I would part with my ipad and stick with the Samsung given the graphics execution. Apple needs to step up in that area or they will lose out in schools, hospitals etc as the stylus model for note taking comes way more natural than thumbing your comments and notes.Sorry, for the avalanche of words. Hope there is some wisdom in here someone can still use.Ps: the apple soft keyboard is nicer than that on the Samsung BUT the wider screen on the Samsung makes it more convenient and natural. hope Swype makes me a convert.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best work productivity purchase I've made in a long time", "Author": "P. Suarez \"Yes, Mom\"", "ReviewID": "RA139YJCMQS02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first time I've ever decided to write a product review (although, my wife may have written some one this account) - but I feel compelled to b/c of how much I love this product.I am often an early adopter of tech-things.  I bought an iPad on the first day it was on the market and then an iPad 2 not much longer afterwards.  I initially bought it with the intention of using it for note taking at work (assuming the capacitive stylus would do the trick), but soon realized it just couldn't do the trick.  I still loved my iPad and took it everywhere - being small, instant boot time, etc - made it the perfect way to consume media.When I saw the Galaxy Note come out, I was curious, but didn't think much of it.  I didn't want to get into the habit of getting a new tablet every year, so I thought I'd wait it out.Then, over the holidays I was in a Best Buy and decided to check it out - and was amazed how well the stylus worked.  So, I went ahead and bought one.Fast forward to now.  At the start of the new year, I took all of the paper out of my laptop bag and replaced it with my Galaxy Note (I keep a small pad for emergencies).  I just realized today, I have yet to use that small pad and use my Note for just about everything.  I'll take meeting notes on it, brainstorm, mock up slides (I need to work in ppt a lot).  And whenever I look to learn more features, I find more than I like.For anyone who wants a digital notepad for work, buy this tablet.  It is one of my favorite purchases I've made.  And I loved my iPad - but this is just better.If you don't want to use it for the digital handwriting, it still has great things with multi-tasking, widgets, and some superior interfaces to what I had with my iPad.  But if you want to use it in a work setting, I can't see buying any tablet other than this.Also - for those who do like writing apps, I highly recommend papyrus.  It's a great complement to S Note (S note is great for notes - papyrus is great for general whiteboarding/brainstorming)", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectations", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3PH0CUCSXMA68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy Note 10.1 exceeds my expectations.  As with any computer, laptop, tablet and similar, how you intend on using it influences what features you need and want.For my needs; I needed a tablet which facilitated document annotation, (hand-written) note taking, and on-the-fly free-hand drawing of technical diagrams.  I needed a large color screen to function as a reader for large technical documents and textbooks.  I spend a great deal of time each week deeply involved with writing and editing technical manuals, Visio drawings, and similar.  There's also a substantial amount of time conducting research.For me, this isn't a toy.  The Note 10.1 has been a production device.  (I can't speak to any of the multi-media apps or features as I do not use them.)Things I've noticed in my productivity since incorporating the use of the tablet:- A drastic reduction in printing documents!- Less baggage under my arm from meeting to meeting or working lunch- No longer losing hours of productivity having to review paper notebooks for key points, and then create electronic documentation on my laptop- No longer have a stack of 8-12 reference books within arms reachI plan on ditching the smart phone (soon) in favor of a quality, yet bare-bones cell.  The tablet can do everything my smart-phones can do and an enormous amount more.  Doing the number crunching, I can cut my personal telecom/computer related expenses each month by investing in the tablet and ditching the smart-phone.In addition to Google Play, there's also the Samsung app market.  Google Play has a larger quantity of apps at this point.  But, it's important to note that Samsung's DROID market has apps that Google Play does not.  In my opinion, the markets compliment each-other.It ships with a power cord that can charge the tablet via wall outlet and USB.Solid construction.It's spot-on for my work use.(For play, it even works like a remote for my non-Samsung home theatre.

I know that, via Geekbench scores, most modern tablets are 10x slower than a desktop counterpart made today (1700 vs 17000), so I expect performance to be as fast as a Pentium 3 CPU made a decade ago...I got my Note 10.1 from a local company, on sale for the same price.  It came with JellyBean (4.1.2).The resolution, 1280x800, seems small as newer tablets have 1920x1200, 2560x1400, or whatever, BUT there is more to life than resolution - can the graphics processor handle the resolution? Can it multitask while dealing with large screens?  Articles online do tell how the Note is so much more fluid at multitasking compared to competitors with higher resolution screens, because the resolution isn't taxing the processor.  One article, which rated this model lowly, showed specs and benchmarks that cremated equally-priced competition and found no pragmatic reason for the low score.  Especially as their own benchmarks showed it being quite competent.As for screen color quality, I've no complaints at all.  One online video comparing this to another Android-enabled brand for the same price with higher resolution showed the Samsung Note having better color and wider contrast gamut (more shades of gray).  To me, it's not the resolution but color accuracy.  Only one other tablet brand I know of does better, but I run Android.Another screen issue is with games that are made for smaller resolutions - if they look jaggy on 1280x800, I do NOT want to see them on 1920x1200 or higher because they will look far worse.  All the games I played were lightning-fast.Never mind space consideration - higher resolution imagery takes more space.  32GB could get eaten quickly, to say nothing on bandwidth (if I chose a model with 3G/4G/whatever as opposed to wi-fi).  1280x800 is the sweet spot for tablets; and I am not looking so close at it that I can see individual pixels - and if I did, it would be to see if any pixels were stuck (constant color or white) or dead (constant black).2GB of internal RAM is nice.  It takes a LOT to get an Android to get up to 1GB of RAM usage, but with 2GB one can have more programs open, with none of them being closed automatically in the background.  I'll never use all 2GB at once, but it's nice to have.My smartphone (Android) is zippy but this Note SCREAMS with power. From disk access to app loading, this is amazingly fast.  SSD technology is one reason why a processor whose benchmarks reveal something comparable to decade-old x86 processors makes things seem faster.Photoshop Touch is a useful app, and runs surprisingly well on a snapshot I'd taken with the camera (ditto on my smartphone), but I still prefer the full-blown app.Love the S-Pen.Adding my account to the Android store was easy, and I have 2-step authentication.Oh, when looking for a screen protector, look for one where people say the S-Pen is not diminished with use.  I bought a high-end brand but returned it because people said it made the S-Pen worthless.  Amazon and distributors it hosts sell high-end protectors, which I will be posting on after getting them...If anything, I do not like:Live wallpaper has to be gotten to by clicking on the installed live wallpaper app.  I didn't (yet) find a wallpaper setting that segues into live wallpaper choices, but that's probably due to battery considerations.  Still, a 7000mAh battery ensures this thing will last for hours with ease...The outer case is plastic and feels weak rather than sturdy - a rubber case is highly recommended.--------Summary:--------Definitely a highly-recommended device.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "S-Pen makes this tablet a class of its own. This tablet competes mainly with Windows 8 tablets", "Author": "kievite", "ReviewID": "R3FSUXY84N5FMM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Even the most devout fan of Android would have to concede that it has failed to repeat its smartphone success in the tablet arena. But in the second half of 2012 Google tried to change that. They updated Android to more competitive version 4.x and released their own tablet, Nexus. Which in 7\" version competes in price with Amazon Kindle and wipes price-wise iPad mini.But the most prominent tablet released during this attack on iPad dominance and preemptive strike before the release of tablets with Windows 8, was actually Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 which was released in August 2012 with Android 4.0. Along with S-pen, the device has amazing quality of internal speakers and generally as a media consumption device it competes with iPad head-to-head. Apple felt the pain and promptly sued Samsung. Google maps are fantastic on this device :-). As for standard Android applications, B&N; Nook Reader is available out of the box. Amazon Kindle needs to be installed. Adobe Acrobat also needs to be installed.This tablet is more capable then iPad due to presence of Wacom active digitizer and S-pen. With S-pen, you can write notes as if you have a pen and a paper. That's an amazing feeling. Due to S-pen and Wacom active digitizer this tablet essentially wiped out as competitors all Android tablets without Wacom digitizer (including Google Nexus) and has main competition only among newer and more expensive Intel-based Windows 8 tablets such as Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T. Difference in price with Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T is approximately $150.I am using it as an expensive and super capable personal organizer and so far I am a satisfied customer. You can use it all day and recharge at night.In other words, tablets with S-pen and Wacom digitizer are a new class of tablets, with new, important areas of use. But Intel-based Windows 8 tablets has the same advantages and more capable OS, so you need to decide what you want. If you use the tablet mainly as an organizer and media consumption device its OK. It you plan to double it as netbook or laptop, then Windows 8 tablets are preferable. So if you feel that you might need Bluetooth keyboard, it might be better to get Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T, otherwise this tablet is adequate and cheaper. Battery life is approximately the same.Another advantage of this tablet is that you can rely on the huge amount of Linux-style Android applications such as SSH server and rsync (simplifies backups of your data), hacker keyboard, VNC etc. With SSH and VNC your laptop becomes external input device for the tablet.Provided default ecosystem is definitely closed Apple-style and you need to apply efforts to break the straitjacket you are put in. That why I put one star down. For example, you can download MP3 files from your desktop to the tablet via USB link using charging cable, and you can download them directly to the Samsung player Music directory. But this sucker does not list them. Still you can play them if you use file browser and click on the file. In this case there is a popup that proposes two players and you can choose any of them.In summary, the main attractions of the tablet is S-pen which makes it possible to use it as a personal organizer as well as access to Linux applications ported to Android. Power users who know Linux well can benefit from this tablet by using proven and well known Linux applications ported to the Android platform. Those power users, who don't know Linux might be better served by Windows 8 Pro tablets with Intel CPUs. For example, if you plan to work with Office documents on the tablet get Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T -- a better tablet for power users who need keyboard with the tablet.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "Karl Fields", "ReviewID": "R2S1FUUHV6GJRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I debated between the iPad and Note 10.1. I\u2019ve had an iPhone for three or four years, and my initial inclination was to stick with the familiar, but I ultimately decided on the Samsung and couldn\u2019t be happier with my purchase. This is my first Android product and I must admit there was a learning curve as I was getting it all set up the way I wanted, but that\u2019s all behind me now.One of the things I love is the flexibility of configuring screens with the various widgets that are available; it gives me so much more control over how the tablets looks and even works. I\u2019m also big on the memory card slot. I haven\u2019t used the S-pen a lot, but in the little experimentation I\u2019ve done, it works as advertised, and it\u2019s high time someone developed a stylus with a fine point rather than those stupid, rubber-nosed things that are like writing with a clown\u2019s nose.One of the magazine reviews I read criticized the Note for its plastic case, but I\u2019m finding I rather like it. It\u2019s very light for a large tablet, so I don\u2019t mind holding it for long stretches while reading or watching a movie. It also feels very secure in my hands. With the iPad, I felt as though I had to be extra cautious for fear of it slipping out my hands.On the minus side are the location of the headphone jack and the Google Play store (formerly Android Market). The jack sits along the top of the tablet (if you\u2019re holding it in landscape mode). This is mostly a problem when watching videos, as I have to consciously move the headphone cord off to one side and hold it there so it\u2019s not dangling across the screen. Putting on the jack on the side or bottom would have made more sense. Also, I\u2019d heard of the shortcomings regarding the Play store, but figured certainly I\u2019d have access to the apps I most wanted. By and large, this is true, but there are some apps I have on my phone that I\u2019d like to have on my tablet, however they aren\u2019t available for Android.

My goal ultimately for any tablet I bought was to have it replace about 90% of my laptop needs.This tablet does that and so much more!!  I made sure to do a ton of research before purchasing. Some of the things I do on a daily basis on my laptop (which is over 3 years old and needs a cooling pad to not overheat, ugh!) is email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu, HBOGo, Amazon Videos, listen to music, photo editing, blogging on Wordpress, Office stuff, managing my websites via GoDaddy, Facebook...and that's pretty much it. Nothing too heavy, but the video stuff and photo editing are deal breakers for me.Out of the box I updated it & installed a Flash APK. I right away tested watching a video from Amazon Instant Video; did a jig when it worked perfectly!I love the display. All the video apps I installed worked really well with Hulu Plus being an exception, it was kinda jumpy, but I don't watch it all that much unless I miss one of my shows on cable.I practiced using all the different keyboard options, and the one I really like by far is the split screen option to use with your thumbs when holding the tablet horizontal. My second favorite option is the handwriting one, although it takes a bit of getting used to. Right now I am typing this using a Logitech bluetooth keyboard I bought, because I knew it would be a pain to type long emails or documents with a digital keyboard.I still haven't had time to test the PS Touch, but all I really need to be able to do is layer pictures, which isn't really taxing or anything.I did buy an adapter so I could use my USB drive, and it works perfectly! It recognizes all my pictures, videos, documents, PDFs, etc. I back everything up on my USB so it was really important to me that the My Files system worked well, and it does!I installed the Firefox browser and it works very fast and I really like the tab system. I can do work on the internet just like on my old laptop.I see myself being very happy with this tablet, and I also see it boosting my productivity. I need to explore the drawing apps and notetaking apps more, but I take a lot of notes throughout the day so I am sure I will find a method I like. So far I have installed Papyrus Beta, Quill, and LayerPaint. In 'testing' modes I enjoyed Papyrus the best. Another goal of mine was to increase how much I do artistically, and I want to explore watercolor techniques on here. The S Pen is awesome and I think with the right app I will be able to do so much more than with the ole' pen & paper!I've been playing with this thing for hours and I haven't had time to install any games, but I saw test videos online of people playing games and it seems fast with great graphics.If you have any questions let me know!

However, what I wanted to see before I bought mine was a writing sample with a full page of writing so I could gauge how much text I can fit on a page. Unfortunately you can't really write as small as you could on paper, which is analog, but I was pretty satisfied with handwriting performance on my Galaxy Note 10.1. No lag to speak of, although the images were drawn a split second after I had moved on, but it didn't lose any information like my old Windows 7 tablet used to do when it lagged. The text is written using the Papyrus (Beta) app with the default settings. I was writing fairly fast so excuse the sloppy handwriting, but I think you'll agree that it's quite legible (and if it's not legible for you, I imagine that you could definitely write at a similar pace and understand your own handwriting). I was trying to show that you can write fast and still have good results, and I think I did. One thing that you should realize is that with an active digitizer like the one in the Note, you don't have to worry about keeping your hand off the screen as you write.Handwriting sample: (remove the space to open link) minus. com/lFGDz8vQlZUv3I also own a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and I have to say that in terms of looks, this is a definite step back, but I guess it's because they don't want to make something that looks like an iPad. No one (who knows of the existence of Android tablets) will confuse this for an iPad, that's for sure. The grey plastic bezel is pretty ugly, too bad they apparently can't use black or something. Wish they had spent some time on the exterior like they did with the Galaxy S3, which at the least looks unique. This tablet is slightly heavier than the original 10.1 but it's barely noticeable. It's got microSD and an IR blaster over the original but to be honest neither of these makes the device particularly worth upgrading for on its own.The screen's quality is passable. It's as good as you're going to get for a 10.1\" 1280x800 screen (unless Samsung decides to make AMOLED in that size) but we all want 1920x1200. Still, I wouldn't knock it for that. While it's slightly unpleasant that you can definitely make out pixels on the screen if you look not that closely, it's not a dealbreaker. You aren't going to fit more information onto a screen of this size by increasing the resolution.Bottom line is that if you want to do any handwriting/drawing on your tablet, this is *the* tablet to buy. There was a previous Lenovo Thinkpad tablet with an active digitizer, but that one was a first gen Android tablet and not nearly as good as this. If you ever try to use a capacitive stylus (eg. with the iPad or other Android tablets) you'll quickly realize that they're just unusable, if only for the simple fact that you can't rest your hand on the device, and they're never going to be anywhere near as accurate.Lastly I would like to point out that while Samsung has an S Pen SDK, Android 4.0 introduced pen input support natively to the OS so hopefully as these tablets get more common we'll have more and more stylus enabled apps that work across all devices.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing tablet that got a bad rap from tech reviewers.", "Author": "J.

It's actually a much more precise touch sensing that is so much easier to type on and browse because you actually hit the spot you are aiming for.  My typing errors have gone down to nil.  Snap a picture and then draw on it or capture any picture from the internet and use that.  Today I drew a transparent pumpkin over my sons head and made him a pumpkin head, the possibilities are endless.  The app ps touch which is used for drawing is essentially a comic book animators tablet, although about \u00bc the size at 10.1 inches.  I have read where someone was using it in class to write notes.  Make a mistake and press the back button and remove the pen stroke.  Love it.The only lag in this tablet I have noticed is using the app folder organizer because it has to load the fifty some icons I put into one banner folder slowing the main screen.  Not a large enough concern to upset me, you can always use the standard icons and folders and I'm sure this would be a problem with any current tablet.Battery life is great but the charge time could be a little less I have read 5 hours.So if you want a tablet with some added functionality and fun I would definitely consider this my first choice.Update: The speakers in this tablet have good sound the quality is in question now that my left speaker has gone out even though I never go over 3/4 volume.  This will be my third bad experience with Samsung products.  I have a big screen that has a rattle in the left speaker, a galaxy s2 that had circuitry battery drain problems and now this.

The Asus recommended \"Wipe Data\" didn't fix the problems and a TF700 I looked at in a local store also had a flickering screen.Although I really wanted to stay with a high-resolution screen, the available choices (Asus, Acer, Apple) all had shortcomings. The iPad3 had a great screen and long battery life but its permanent tether to iTunes and Apple's locked-down ecosystem placed it dead last on my list of any tablet. The Acer A700 had a great \"feel\" while holding it and a huge battery, but it has a reputation as a hand warmer.There are several tablets with 1280x800 screens and quad-core cpus but the Samsung Note 10.1 stood out for (a) its high price, (b) cpu benchmarks, (c) 2 Gb of memory, (d) better-than-average screen, (e) S Pen, (f) seemingly faultless operation, and (g) \"pro\" reviewers that didn't like it and users that loved it. Those seemed like reasons enough to buy one.Physical CharacteristicsMany don't like the look of the Note and dislike the plastic back even more. I think it looks fine. It's not flimsy, the tablet is solidly made, and the plastic back is probably impervious to dings and dents, unlike aluminum. Generally, I prefer plastic to aluminum for things that can be dropped. If you use water bottles made of both materials, you'll know what I mean. The Note is comfortable to hold with rounded edges but the plastic back could use a rubberized coating for more \"grip.\" Quality control is excellent and it comes with a charger, cable, and extra S pen nibs.ScreenThe 1280x800 screen is bright and sharp and although it isn't comparable to the TF700 screen, it's easy to read, fonts are sharp and clear, and colors are good. The screen doesn't collect fingerprints (is it coated?) and there's no flicker. Auto-brightness is on by default with brightness at 50%. The auto-brightness works well and after a week of use, I haven't even bothered to disable it. At 5% battery life, the screen dimmed considerably and video became too dark to watch although the browser could still be seen--sort of. Consider 5% the cut-off point for using the tablet.Stylus/Pen/FingersThe S pen works well for drawing/writing but a capacitive stylus (small tip) works better for me with everything else. Fingers work well too and no problems were experienced. The S pen doesn't have the heft or feel of a real pen, but after a minute or two using it, its odd size and shape were all but forgotten.Battery LifeWith the default settings--50% auto brightness, GPS and Wifi on, bluetooth off, and power savings mode off, I achieved an amazing 13:56 (hrs:mins) of battery life over three sessions before the Note powered itself off. The screen \"on\" time was 13:31. I did shut the Note off between sessions but at no time was it charged. My normal use includes reading, browsing, arcade games, music, and video, but no cpu/graphic intensive games. Still, I find a fourteen hour battery life hard to believe but I assure you it's real and I used it for every one of those 13.5 hours.ChargingThe Samsung charger is rated 5 volts @2A and the Note can also be charged from a PC USB port using the supplied cable. It charged from my PowerGen Dual Port 2.1A 10W Travel/Wall charger as well. Other 5V 2A chargers may also work. Time to fully recharge a totally drained battery is about 4.5 hours with the tablet turned off.NetworkThe Note worked at 2.4GHz and 5GHz (slightly faster at 5GHz) but at my usual chair, the 2.4GHz connection was good (4 bars) while the 5GHz connection varied from poor to poorer. The signal has to go through a few walls but the results are consistent with other wifi devices I've used here and the Note is no better or worse at 5GHz. Local network operations were free of any glitches and although I didn't measure any file transfer times, they seemed speedy enough. DLNA worked fine but I used Skifta and not the Samsung app.BluetoothAn Apple Mighty Mouse paired easily using Bluetooth and worked about as expected on the Note with its touchy...uh...highly sensitive tiny trackball. The Note also paired easily with a Mac but that's as far as I went since it isn't a configuration I'd use.SoftwareThe usual array of Google and other software is installed but Kindle is not. There's no backup app and that's a serious omission for business users or anyone else who needs to back up apps+data. Unless the tablet is rooted, backing things up could be a big problem depending on where the data resides. The TF700 has a terrific and easy-to-use backup app and Samsung should take \"note\" of that.The Note comes with a couple of book apps, and even if you add Kindle, you'll still be out of luck trying to read books or magazines on an SD card that you plug in, so plan on adding a reader that can find files on an SD card.The Samsung MP3 player works as well as any others and unless you need cover flow, it will be more than adequate. The video player works very well with local video files but I had some trouble with networked files and added another video player as an alternate.The Smart Remote app works at a basic level, has limited capability, and is far less easy to use than a dedicated or universal remote. If you're adding a media player and it isn't a Roku or AppleTV, you're out of luck. All devices have very limited functions in the app and if you like to hold your tablet in portrait mode, this app only works in landscape mode.Although there's no printer app, the Note can print to networked Samsung printers with the stock browser, Polaris Office, S Note, and Gallery--perhaps other apps as well. I turned on my printer (which is hard-wired, not wifi), hit print from the browser, and the pages came out. No configuration necessary....or possible, which is also poor from a user perspective.User ExperienceThe Note works smoothly without stutters, hangs, or glitches. Multiple apps don't seem to slow anything down and there aren't any moments (the TF700 had a few) where you wonder if something is going on behind the scenes that's holding things up. Some claim that the high-resolution screens cause the traffic jams on other tablets but the iPad3 doesn't seem to have that problem.The Note screen is equal to or better than most 1280x800 tablet screens and I have no complaints about it. I will complain that Samsung didn't use a higher resolution screen though. If Samsung had tacked on a high-def screen, they might have had the proverbial iPad killer and, arguably, lay claim to the \"best\" Android tablet on the market. I'm sure that in three months they'll be out with the Note HD model.Still, when comparing the Note to the TF700, the high-resolution screen on the TF700 lost its luster for me when it could only flicker for 6-7 hours at a time on battery. I spent a lot of time watching battery life, turning wifi off and on, and running with a dim screen in low power mode, just to make it last a bit longer. The Note, on the other hand freed me from that and it seems to have power to spare, even if it's not the most glamorous tablet on the market. Make no bones about it, the Note hardware is fast, bug-free, and it works.About those \"pro\" reviews....I wish they would have told readers what tablets they use--the models that meet their exacting requirements--so I could (perhaps) have bought one of those. Users got it right though. The Note is an excellent tablet with its only \"fault\" (in my opinion) being the lack of a higher resolution screen.

What I wanted was an easy-to-use, versatile, sleek tablet, and that's exactly what I got.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a lot of fun to use. It comes loaded with a lot of great features and programs like the Samsung App store and the Android Play store. It also comes loaded with Photoshop Touch, which is a lot of fun to play with!My main selling point with this tablet was the S Pen stylus it comes with. I wanted a tablet I could sketch and draw on, and this stylus really does the job well. It feels like a pencil in your hand, i.e. not bulky or 'alien'. I downloaded the Autodesk Sketchpad Pro program and have been having loads of fun with it. I can sketch something out, color it in, export it to Photoshop to play with it some more, and then I can effortlessly upload it to Instagram or wherever I want.I've just started fooling around with the S Note program, which has a lot of great templates to work with.The battery life is pretty good. I've worked on it almost non-stop all day, and the battery has held up pretty well.

Not surprisingly I'm very happy with it - it has met and exceeded my expectations. In my particular case my netbook had a battery problem and getting a new one represented a decent fraction of the cost of something else. That and I only had one application that still used XP and I found a way around that on another PC.  Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.  So I had some experience with Android, although in the Fire's case it was pretty well wrapped up in the name of \"ease of use\".I'm not an Apple user - no particular reason other than I've been that way over 30 years. When looking for alternatives I can't say I even seriously considered an iPad.  I did look at the new retina display and, honestly, my eyes (older) can't make a case for the differential between the new iPad and the Note 10.1 on that issue. The device seems physically pretty solid to me so I can't see an issue here either. As I have with all portable electronics, I got a case (with a Bluetooth keyboard included - not high speed but it works) and put on a screen protector (just like on my smartphone). To me that's common sense; you have to judge your own risk level and the protections aren't that expensive relative to the device itself.Why Samsung? I've had good luck with their products (TV's, range, etc.) and to be honest, I resent Apple's claims to have \"invented\" things like rounded corners - more the shame of the idiots who granted them patents.But why the Note 10.1?  I had a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 on order but having seen the limits (reasonable I think given the media focus) placed on Android app's in that environment, I was interested in something more open.  I like to use a stylus and the Note appeared to be built around it.  So with the need to replace a laptop and a desire for something with less confining an application set, the Note 10.1 seemed to be the place to go. (I think my existing Kindle Fire will still be good for quite a while, particularly when traveling.)Rather than talk about pro's and con's, I'd rather talk about my experience getting to know the Note 10.1.  First, I'd recommend that you get the Samsung SPSN app which gives you access to a set of videos, some of which focus on the Note 10.1.  Like most devices these days, everything is either \"intuitive\" or buried somewhere on-line if you can find it.  My intuition needs a boost now and then.View the available videos and you'll realize that the S Pen is pretty powerful and potentially useful.  You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it. (As an aside, the S Note application appears to have different capabilities depending on how you invoke it.)  I'd also recommend you try a drawing/art application; in my case I'd simply say the most common wasn't my choice for the best.  With the right app you can do some really neat things fairly easily.  I have yet to make it through the PS Touch tutorials (they've \"intuitive\" sort of - but I've found going to see their videos helps as well).  I think this will be a useful app as well.  As for S Note, I can't say it recognized my writing yet.There are some issues. If I want to print, I need a compatible Samsung printer (I have an HP).  But then again my HP isn't color and maybe I'll go for one for the art as well as photo's in general - Samsung printers get high ratings for color.What's next?  Well first, my wife seems interested - the last time she got interested I received my first Kindle and she took it over in a few weeks.  She tells me she can see better on the Note than on the PC (she had a detached retina a few years ago).  So I may end up with two of these one of these days.I really don't see, in my future, any more laptop/ultrabooks based on what this device can do.  For someone who bought his first PC in 1980 that says something.  I'll have a desktop for the high end stuff, like video editing, but I think the world has changed.  The Note 10.1 may not be everything, but it's enough to be a game changer, for me at least.  If you're thinking about a tablet, I suggest you give this device a careful look.  Check around for comparison videos, they may help you as well.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply the best", "Author": "S. R.", "ReviewID": "R9O86J7EQGJ8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is not intended to be technical. I'm sure you can find technical reviews on other websites or in Youtube. I purchased the galaxy Tab 2 exactly a month ago, but ended up returning it and waited for the Note. Wasn't that a smart move. The Tab just did not have it together. The screen was not very sensitive (compared to iPad and Asus brands), it was laggy, crashed several times, and the camera was laughable at best with no auto focus. PDF annotation was simply horrible. iPad and Asus tablets did a much better job annotating PDFs with the same capacitive pen than Tab.Galaxy Note on the other hand is a solid tablet. The screen is very responsive. The S-Pen is just perfect; although, I still haven't figured out how to use the back eraser. I was afraid that resting my hand on the screen while taking notes would produce artifacts, but it did not. One thing that I hadn't tried with the Tab was the Peel Remote feature. I had a lot of fun controlling my TV and DVR with this app. It's a very interactive and fun way to watch TV. You won't go back to the DVR remote if you give this app a try. I don't know if other tablets have the remote feature, but if they don't, this feature alone is worth getting the galaxy for.The back camera is 5MP, has a flash, and can auto focus. The Adobe Photoshop touch comes with some nice filters and many of the tools found in the actual software (Gradient, Fill & Stroke, Wrap, Camera Fill, Round corners, B&W;, Color Replacement, Curves, Shadows/Highlights, Noise Reduction, etc). The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations. You can write down anything from simple algebra to differential equations and it will solve it by Wolfarm Mathematica in a side window! Pretty amazing. Oh yes, and the side window...is great.Overall, I'm happy with this tablet. If you are deciding between this or the Tab or any other lower priced tablet, you should seriously consider the Note. It's indeed worth the extra $100.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good device....needs a few improvements", "Author": "damien", "ReviewID": "R86O6DAMNQWQD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I got my Note 10.1 a few days ago a I`ve been playing with it, both for work and recreation.  First off, from a hardware perspective, I would have given it 4.5 stars.  For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?  This is NOT a TV and was never intended to be.  We`ve gone from black and white to 12\" color TVs all the way to easily available 60\" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10\" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42\" is for.  As a mobile device, the screen is quite adequate and brings the cost down. I actually see absolutely no problem with the graphics from the few videos I have watched.  Besides which, Samsung MAKES the Retina display, so their not including a similar display on their tab is sending a message.  It`s not needed.Storage-wise, all hail Samsung for the micro-SD slot....one would have thought that this would be a given for any tab, but...Camera-wise, it`s alright. Again, the device is not meant to be a camera...that`s what my Nikon and Sony are for.  For snapping random shots and posting online, it`s excellent.  Also the only tab with a flash!  Video chatting works great as well. So still 4.5 stars at this point.  My main contention hardware-wise is the location of the port, and the fact that it`s a Samsung-proprietary rip off of the iPad port, plus its location.  I love the USB connectivity, but the location is terrible.  This device is meant to be used mainly landscape, which means, either in hand or propped up on a case.  For the connection to be on the bottom is COMPLETELY impractical, as you have to lie the unit down to use any of your connections.  It`s fine if you have a dock, but nobody walks around with their dock...defeats the mobility of the unit.  There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.  So 4.5 stars on hardware  Love the S pen by the way.  Can`t wait for more apps to use its functionality as well as that of the quad core processor.Where the device lost some points with me is from a software perspective, which is from both a Samsung perspective and a Google perspective.  First off, I agree with some of the other reviewers when it comes to the UI....less is really more....don`t need all the widgets, they just slow me down.  A standard android interface would have been fine.  Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device. It locks up and the formatting is ridiculous.  I`ve had to download Firefox for Android. MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.  NO JAVA SUPPORT????  So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.  Also, no Flash for Android???? Google needs to get it`s act together on this one, and either do the development or get the other developers to do it.  All webpages should be functional on mobile devices. So down to 4 stars...not Samsung`s fault entirely, but I`m looking at the whole experience here.Finally, I bought this tab as a mobile alternative to my laptop for light processing, i.e. working on documents, some light graphic editing etc.  The tools available range from ok to really good, but Office replacements are limited in their functionality.  Hopefully as tabs get into the realm of faster, better processors and more storage space, developers will get some better MS-Office analogues going.In conclusion, excellent tab with a need for some improvement.  Can`t wait to see the next iteration...PS.  I forgot....it`s gorgeous!

The supplied software works great, except one thing: the PDFs produced by S Note are not vector based, i.e., when you zoom they get pixelated. If you care about having vector based PDF output, you can get \"Papyrus\" and/or \"Quill\" from the Android market. Both work awesome for note taking!The battery holds up very well, I was using it pretty much constantly between 9am and 4PM and it was only down to 50%. It is very fast and smooth. The only that bothers me a little, is the custom charging cable that needs its own power supply (no computer charge).Edit: it turns out that the note does charge on any USB charger despite the red x that might appear.

At least is better than nothing.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bit of a Mixed Bag", "Author": "James Buchanan", "ReviewID": "R11ZGOF9GXI6AG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought my Note 10.1 about three weeks ago (not from Amazon), and this is what I have found.I was attracted to the Note 10.1 because of the split screen option, which allows two or more programs to be run, used, and viewed simultaneously, and because of the active pen.  I envisioned having a pdf textbook open in Polaris Office on half of the screen while taking notes/ solving math/physics problems in the S-note program on the other half of the screen, all while lying on my back on the couch with the tablet propped on my chest.  Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.  So I went on line and discovered that the pen's sensitivity can be adjusted by popping off the pen's button and adjusting the potentiometer which is located underneath the button.  However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.  Through trial and error, I was able to get the setting to where I wanted it.Next, I discovered that writing with the pen is very different, and considerably more difficult, than writing with a pen on paper.  The screen is slippery, so more control over pen movement is required than when writing on paper.  Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.  Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.  Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.  It's only a fraction of a second, but it's enough to mess up the normal feed-back mechanism in your brain that allows you to control your writing.  Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.  However, while using it for a few days, I was able to adjust my writing style to accommodate the pen's quirks, and I can now write with it at an acceptable level of ease and legibility.  It's not as easy or as neat as writing with a pen on paper, and small, intricate math symbols can be difficult to form, but overall it works.The tablet is advertised as being appropriate for graphic artists.  I'm not artistic, but I can't imagine being able to exert the sort of control that is required to draw with this thing.  I would also mention that the pen doesn't produce different line weights in response to pressure in the s-note program.  This function only seems to work in the sketching program.  It is supposed to be capable of producing somewhere in the vicinity of a thousand different line weights, but when experimenting with the sketch program, I could only produce a few different discernible line weights.  In the s-note program, you can select a single permanent line weight from a sliding menu of different line weights.The S-note program:There are limited templates offered for the note taking program.  The two I use are the yellow lined paper and the graph paper.  There is no blank, white, template offered. Note that the hand-writing-to-text and hand-writing-to-formula utilities aren't offered in the graph paper template for some unknown reason.  In the yellow lined paper template, they don't work very well.  I found that I have to write very carefully and legibly (which is difficult with the s-pen) for the hand-writing-to-text function to work, and once the text has been inserted into the note, it is difficult to edit.  The hand-writing-to-formula function is pretty much worthless.  While it is capable of converting some very advanced symbols, such as those used in general relativity, you have to be so very meticulously careful in forming the symbols for it to convert properly that it just isn't worth the effort.  Also, there is no way to edit the formulas once they have been converted and inserted into the note.  The Wolfram-alpha formula solving function, which works with the Wolfram website via the wifi connection to solve formulas you enter, works ok for simple formulas, for which it will solve the equation and produce a graph, but for any thing that is slightly complicated, like a second order differential equation, it just grinds away endlessly without producing a result.Multi-window:The ability of the Note 10.1 to run multiple apps simultaneously and display them side-by-side on the screen in their own windows is the high light of the device in my opinion.  It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.  Or, you can detach them and move them around, adjust their size, and have a third app running in another window in the background as well.  Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.  Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.  All the ones I use can be tiled - Polaris office, s-note, the internet browser, the video player, and email.  Polaris office, however, is not ideal for pdf viewing since it will not allow you to annotate pdfs, you can't book mark pages, and it doesn't seem to remember your place in a document consistently.  I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC. Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.  When you reopen the app, it will come back up in the window on the same place on the screen, but the document you had open previously (in the case of Polaris) will have to be reopened.Screen:This is, of course, a standard 1280x800 resolution screen.  I haven't seen one of the high resolution screens that similarly priced competitors have, like the Asus transformer infinity, so I can't compare them.  However, I will say that I have no problem reading small text on internet pages or on pdf files. Occasionally, I have to zoom in on a mathematical symbol to be able to read it clearly.  And text does appear slightly blurry around the edges.  I am guessing, from reading comparative reviews of the ASus transformer infinity, that these things would not occur on a high resolution screen.  Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.  It is bright and colors are vibrant.  Pictures look well defined and clear.  Videos, on the other hand, are a different matter.  Animated features and movies with brightly lit scenes are ok.  But movies with dark scenes, which seems to be most movies these days, are difficult to see except in a completely darkened room (all the lights off).  Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.  Not good.  When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.  With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.  With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.  Forget about viewing pictures or movies in broad daylight - the screen is not nearly bright enough.Processor speed:It takes just a few seconds to start an app and load a file, even when running multiple programs.  Saving a file also takes just a few seconds.  Scrolling thru pages of a pdf file is quick and continuous, though there is a slight jerkiness.  Not enough to slow you down, just enough to be visually noticeable.  Boot up and shut down takes about 30 seconds, but there is really no need to do this - you can simply shut the unit down in the sleep mode, in which case it instantly turns off and on.  In the sleep mode, it uses practically no power at all.  If it had 75% of battery remaining when you put it in sleep mode in the evening, it will still have 75% remaining when you turn it on in the morning.  The unit will crash only once in a while - about once a week for regular usage.Wifi:The wifi has longer range than my laptop.  Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.  Weather.com home page takes about 5 seconds to load, Amazon.com home page takes about 15 seconds to fully load.Battery:I timed various usages with a chronometer and this is what I found:1) 1-1/2 hour of video at 100% brightness, 1 hour of internet with wifi on, the rest of the time using polaris office and s-note side-by-side at 60% brightness, power saving mode off - battery only lasted 6-1/2 hours.  Definitely not good.2) Continual looping the movie \"Immortals\" at 50% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 9 hours. Not bad.3) Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours. Pretty good.Thus, as you can see, the battery life seems to depend heavily on how brightly the screen is set.  The screen set at 30% brightness as in entry 3) above was comfortably readable in a poorly lit room.Recharge time - for a completely depleted battery (which registers as 5% left), it took 4-1/2 hours to recharge to 100%.Build Quality:As other reviewers have noted, the note 10.1 does have a bit of a cheap feel to it.  The plastic back does flex a little under your hands, and there is a creaking noise when you push down on the edges of the screen, or apply a slight twisting motion to the tablet.  Other than that, it seems to be put together tightly, and it looks fine, it's just not as good as you would expect from a high end tablet.  However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.  I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.  Also, you have to cover up the speakers with tape when you are spraying down the screen with glass cleaning fluid to keep from getting the fluid in the speakers.Price:Too high.  I payed $550 for mine.  It has since dropped to $500.  That's still $100 higher than the Asus transformer infinity.Final Verdict:Despite my criticisms, I find that I use my note 10.1 quite a bit, including the s-pen, and I'm not unhappy with it.  And, of course, if you need a tablet with an interactive pen and multi-windows capability, it's the only game in town.  I'ld say that if I had to do it again, I would have waited a few more months to see if the price came down.  If it came down to $400 or less, I'ld buy it.  For $500,probably not.  If you don't have a need for the pen or windows, you might be better off with the Asus transformer infinity, which has a high resolution screen, super bright screen, aluminum housing, and costs $100 less.  If you do need a tablet with the pen and windows, and are willing to put up with the pen's deficiencies, you might like the note 10.1, but I'ld wait for the price to come down.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I honestly have nothing bad to say about this", "Author": "Tina Vuotto", "ReviewID": "R36J375T47V6GX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine 5 months ago, and I was waiting to review it once I used it for a while to give a good review, but after 5 months I still have no cons.Battery life - even if you use it a lot, it lasts longer than my current phone. I have used it at school all day and still been able to play on it at home without charging. If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge. (I have nothing on Push settings or the brightness us too high though). I typically charge every night and by the end of the day still have at least 10% and I use it a lot.Durability - I have not dropped it on the ground but I bring it everywhere with me in my bookbag where books and pencil bags knock into it and nothing has happened. Only scratch is the one it was shipped with (it was a refurbished model I bought and the scratch was only noticeable to me because I scoured it, when I asked everyone else no one found it until I pointed it out) I do have a cheap case on it too.Usefulness - I could go on for HOURS talking about how useful it is. The S note can record sound and record writing as you are taking notes. PERFECT for any college student or business person in a meeting. You can scroll through the sound clips after you save to find exactly what you are looking for. The multi-screen thing is BRILLANT! I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much. I used the multi screen for up to 4 things and it still ran fast. I opened everything I could open to test it and it still ran fast (that ran obviously a little slower than usually but still everything was so fast it surprised me I expected it to crash). I think it was like 20 things open with my Chrome having at least 15 tabs inside and it was still functional. Photoshop App that comes with it, totally rocks. You have the best features on the go and the stylus works so well with it. There is a mode that detects your eyes so when you watch a movie, it won't just turn off on you. This also helped while reading textbooks and taking notes because sometimes if you have it to auto turn off too soon it would have turned off by that but it notices your eyes with the front camera.I can't even go into detail about everything, but it is the best tablet on the market if you need it for art or school. Hands down. I saved up so long and I am so happy with it. Everything was taken into account on this tablet, so many small details that you just discover and think wow. The first 3 weeks I learned something more useful every day. There is a auto block feature so your emails won't come through when your sleeping. You can change the standard font. When you are asked in a app how do you want to view this picture (for example it happens differently too) you can click on the gallery and when the app leaves the page it is like the powerpoint slide shows it skews the bottom and scrolls off the page, so fricking cute! So the Jellybean and Note together work so well. Everyone in my family has Ipads, and every single person is jealous of this. I love it. I am always recommending it to everyone. If you have doubt go to a store and try it in stores (that is what I did) and you can see how you like it.Also there is an aftermarket pen that is useful and more comfortable than the small stylus if you have bigger hands that still has pressure sensitivity.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great productivity tool for students", "Author": "Robert A. Schiffman", "ReviewID": "R3M7OHDP08M9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I transitioned from iPad 2 to Galaxy Note 10.1 a few weeks ago. The features I especially like about Galaxy Note are:1. S Note - I can take notes and record lectures at the same time in class - I can export my notes to .pdf format and instantly upload the files to Dropbox - the \"Shape Match\" feature is useful for drawing lines and graphs - the \"Formula Match\" feature is useful for mathematical calculations and visual representation of graphs  (collaboration with Wolfram Alpha)2. Voice typing - It is very convenient to voice-type emails and other notes. We can also use this feature for G-talk as well.3. S voice (like \"Siri\" on iPhone)4. Voice Search - Like Siri on iPhone, we can use this feature to find out the nearest restaurants or gas stations5. Paper Artist - It is fun to play with photos using this feature.There are other cool features like Group Play and PS Touch which I haven't had a chance to play with them yet. Samsung's strength lies in its collaboration with other leading companies such as Wacom (S pen), Wolfram Alpha (Formula Match), Adobe (PS Touch) and Dropbox (50 GB storage space for 2 years). It is very smart of Samsung to target the education sector with its productivity features. Now that Steve Jobs was gone, Apple seems to lack imagination and vision, expecting customers to upgrade their iPads on the virtue of \"retina\" display! Give me a break! If Apple doesn't want to lose out to Samsung in the long term, they need to examine what customers expect from a tablet and what they use it for by looking at most popular apps, and come up with creative \"needs\" which the customers themselves are not even aware of yet.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad bites the dust", "Author": "Wise Guy \"the_engineer\"", "ReviewID": "RCR8RFFTUQGYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of Apple products so far. I also have an iPad, but some of friends switched to Samsung tablets recently and they could hook up their sd cards to the tablet, and watch pictures and movies they recorded right away, no need to go through some stupid iTunes like application, put their mp3's into tablet, hook it up to TV via hdmi seamlessly, watch flash content on web pages, with more flexibility and with an operation system as stable as iOS.. So, I bought this tablet. And then I gave my iPad to my cousin.. It comes with a stylus (which you can store in the tablet itself, it has a nice slot in the bottom right hand corner) you can do a lot of things, and I gave up using my Wacom digitizer, this is way better than that. Resolution is good enough, I can't say I miss my iPad. I bought an SD Card reader for $8 and hdmi adapter for $34 - hooked up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I can use my TV like a smart TV now. I had a Hava streaming box for TV - the app on iPad wasn't working, but it's Android app worked perfect... The apps you can download from Samsung's store or Google App store, I'm sure number of apps will catch up with Apple's apps soon, and most popular apps are already there to download.It has a built in micro card reader also, I use it a lot to transfer files from my pc/mac to the tablet. There are other nice features, it detects if there are other samsung devices in the same room, and you can exchange files right away.

You can see the quick study I did of \"Flaming June\" by Leighton on my user profile as my user photo (Sketchbook Pro app was used)I've been looking for a tablet to use while away from my desktop machine for sketching and jotting down ideas.  I've been carrying around a sketchbook and pencil forever, but it's frustrating to only be able to work in shades of gray (who wants to cart around a case of colored pencils or pastels to all places?) as well as having to scan and re-touch the scans of any sketches I make.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is what I ended up upgrading from a Nook Color.  It's fantastic!  Wacom penabled, the S Pen has \"good enough\" pressure sensitivity (probably on par with a Bamboo based on my own subjective feel/use) and is also great for note taking.  While S Note does a good job of OCRing handwritten text, I actually prefer saving documents in my own handwriting + diagrams.  No more struggling with a laptop to take notes especially when you REALLY want to circle, underline, change the color of, or otherwise add arrows, stars, hearts etc to your writing.Is it as good as the latest Wacom Intuos tablet?  Of course not.  You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.  But it *is good enough* for a daily-driver for sketching/doodling or even retouching images you've created on your desktop+wacom intuos combo.  I've done sketches on this tablet that I've synced to my desktop to finish up there at my leisure.I have not run into any lag issues (where the line you are drawing takes a while to render, or doesn't render correctly because the cpu is chugging to keep up) using Sketchbook Pro and LayerPaint, but I also do not make big sweeping motions on this tablet as I do on my Wacom large tablet + desktop.  You may notice a little lag with *very* large brush sizes.The S Pen comes with a nib remover (metal circle) and extra nibs (default rubber tips + hard plastic white nibs).  I would recommend using the rubber nibbed for better traction if you're using a naked screen.  With a clear screen protector, I prefer the plastic nibs for next-to-no drag.  People who prefer a texture more similar to paper when writing or drawing may want to apply a matte screen protector.People can quibble about the (relatively) low resolution of the 10.1\" screen (1280x800) not being as high as other HD+ tablets.  Yes, you will notice the lower ppi if you look closely (~ half a foot away) at small text, but unless you're into pixel-peeping 90% of the time, you won't notice.  Colors are bright, text is crisp when viewed like you would normally, and 720p (HD) videos look fantastic.  Sure, you won't get the super-high 1080p clarity you might get with a different higher-res tablet, but who wants to waste SD card space on a video twice the size for a display that's not even close to a desktop monitor in size?  Save the 1080p videos for your large widescreen tvs.Plays MKVs natively, which is nice -- no more converting to mp4 because the default player supports container-type formats.The twin speakers are okay. The stereo effect works well (e.g., the old \"car moving from one end of the screen to the other\" surround-sound effect) but the volume could be louder --- at max, there can be some distortion and you'd have a hard time hearing people speaking clearly at anything lower than mid-volume with any normal ambient noise in the room.Build-wise, mine looks pretty sturdy.  I can hear a little creaking in certain parts of the back when pressed firmly on, which is not entirely unexpected since it's plastic.  Thinner and lighter than my old iPad 2, I prefer keeping it in a case to avoid any issues with dropping/dinging it.In terms of peripherals - You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card with this tablet, which is one of the reasons I went with the 16GB instead of 32GB version (check the price difference between the extra GB edition vs microSD pricing).  Not very much yet out there in terms of other accessories, Samsung's previewed a keyboard dock, OTG hub (so you can plug in USB keyboards etc) and a slim magnetic case but it's hard to find them in stock.With regards to using a case, I heard people having issues with strong magnets affecting S pen tracking, so I would recommend not using a magnetic case if you're very particular about how the S Pen functions (e.g., wanting to do a lot of fine detailed digital work)In terms of negatives, mostly software-related:- Samsung's proprietary UI and apps.  Android OS fragmentation aside, I was eyeballing the Nexus 10 before purchasing the Note because I hate most android mods.  This one is no exception.  You cannot delete any apps that come with the tablet unless you decide to root the tablet.  Rooting the tablet, aside from the obvious warranty implications, can also affect DRM-sensing apps from working properly.  I really wish Samsung would let its users decide on whether or not they want apps like Crayon Physics, S Suggest, and Dropbox to remain on their tablet.- Apps can only install on default memory*.  You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.  While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.- Proprietary 30-pin cable and non-removable battery.  The first is annoying but you can buy $6 cables on Amazon as extras (the one that comes with the charging hub is *extremely* short, ~3 feet at most) that work just fine.  If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.  In some cases (depending on the amount of juice it gets from the USB port) it will actually charge, but so slowly that it's practically useless.  The non-removable battery is annoying simply because batteries for these mobile devices just don't last more than a couple of years before losing charging capacity.- Slow OS updating.  Samsung has rolled out Jellybean (which is, from my experience on a rooted Nook Color, a massive upgrade in terms of responsiveness and general UI improvement over Ice Cream Sandwich) updates to other regions but has yet to update US/Canada versions of this tablet (N8013 model).  Not a big issue since the tablet is very responsive even while multi-windowing, but if you absolutely have to have Jellybean the only way to get it on a US model Note right now is by rooting/romming it.Conclusion:Would I have bought this tablet if I didn't need/want the Wacom penabled S Pen?  Probably not, since other tablets out there have nicer screens (ipad with retina display, nexus 10 with high ppi also).  The Nexus 10 was next on my list because of the nice screen plus un-modified Android UI/OS/more regular updates.  I use a moderate selection of apps and am a light tablet gamer.  This has handled 3D games beautifully (see any youtube reviews) because of the powerful processor. I also read a lot, and while the 10.1\" format is a bit clunky for e-reading compared to my 7\" Nook Color (the large size makes it more awkward to hold even though it's actually lighter), it's adequate for the purpose.However, that's the beauty of android tablets -- there's sizes and types for everyone.  I would not, for example, recommend the same tablet for my mom as I would for myself --- it depends on how you want to use it.  Would you buy a Porsche for delivering newspapers?  The same basic idea goes for tablets.For digital art work, there's currently nothing on the market right now that can match this without additional purchases (e.g. the Adonit Jot BT pen for iPad).  When the Surface Pro comes out, those who want full-fledged applications such as Photoshop may want to go that route, but they'll sacrifice for the power with a much smaller battery life. As far as iOS vs. Android, it's your own very personal platform preference -- apples to oranges and I would highly recommend trying out both types of tablets at your local brick-and-mortar if you can't decide which type to get.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The only choice for a professional!

I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab (the first model) when it first came out about a year or 2 ago and I was extremely disappointed.  It was slow, it lagged.  I was done. I was done with android products. I returned it shortly after I bought it.  I went on to buy an iphone 4s and fell in love with the apple system. It was smooth.  It didnt randomly crash. It was great.  I decided to buy a new tablet to do school work on and watch lectures on without having a huge bulky laptop in my bed or at the coffee shop.  Worrying about cords, etc.  I thought about going with the ipad, but I've struggled with them not supporting all of the video feeds I receive from my online courses.  (flash, blackboard, etc).  You also cannot customize your screens.  All you can do is line up the apps in the order you wish and change the background.  Although the new ipad is pretty and shinny, it lacks a lot of features that the Galaxy Note 10.1 has.  First off, I must say Samsung has come a LONG way within the past few years. They really stepped their game up.  I LOVE the pen. It is the best I have ever seen.  The tip has a more defined point as opposed to the old eraser head.  I love that I can open and edit word documents by free writing on the document (without it looking like I let a kindergartener grade my papers), or I can insert text boxes and include text.  I can also highlight documents. I can edit word documents and presentations.  It comes with POLARIS OFFICE pre installed for FREE! It has S Note which is a really cool app that lets you take notes and transform your hand writing to text.  Visually, the screen is beautiful and very appealing.  Although the ipad is just a tad more fluid when scrolling or sliding through apps, there isn't a huge difference.All in all I chose this over the ipad. I feel that the ipad is just a bigger version of my phone.  The tablet is a really nice change and I love love love it. Very happy with my purchase as a student and a mother who lets her 15 month old son watch Netflix on her tablet.

I decided I really did want the larger screen, so it boiled down to choosing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 or SGN 10.1.  What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM. I have a need for speed and thought the additional expense would be worth it. I wasn't really concerned with the S Pen at all, but now that I've had a chance to play with it, I can see how I will use it frequently. The micro-SD expansion slot and volume control buttons were also very important to me. And, I am looking forward to taking my first road trip and using the GPS.This tablet is super fast.

The front 5MP camera (with LED flash!) takes decent photos and videos, especially for social networking apps like Instagram & Twitter. I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet. The Peer IR remote easily synced with my Sony TV and Brighthouse cable box. I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution. I really don't understand.

Some apps, ios is better, but some apps android is better.Overall, I am extremely happy with my decision to switch from ios/ipad to android/Galaxy note 10.1", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "College Student - Note Taking", "Author": "Brickford", "ReviewID": "R3ORN6UXUD36R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this tablet. I was a little nervous about it when reading the reviews, but decided to go with it because of the pen and my primary use would be taking notes in class. It took a good full day of using it to really get past those nerves as it did take some time to configure things how I needed them and how best to understand how it works. But I can say now that I would not trade it for anything.Pros:- Battery time has been great, lasts a full day of school- Multi tasking - I LOVE being able to have multiple apps showing on the screen at the same time, I can have my notes up and ready while at the same time browsing facebook, writing emails browsing the web or texting on google voice. Probably one of the top features of this tablet.- The pen - I thought I would only use it for note taking only (which it is absolutely great for and very responsive). But with the 'swype' style keyboard option I can use the stylus to type faster then I can almost type on a computer or write by hand.- S-Note - great at organizing my notes by class/chapter. It is also easy to share my notes with other students. I love the different options for color/texture. Also the ability to write an equation and have it converted to a nice text of the equation, as well as auto shapes. I can also take my professors powerpoints or pdfs and import them and make notes directly on them which is great.Cons:- S-Note - while it's in my list of pros for its awesome features, I find that it lacks in one major area. You can not select anything that you have already written down so you are unable to move or resize the content. This is a problem when taking notes and you realize you need more room in an area, there is no selecting and moving things around to make it fit. You would have to either erase and rewrite or take a screenshot and then paste it back into the page (quite tedious). This is basically my only gripe and not near enough for me to regret my purchase as I find it so superior to the competition for an in class tablet.All in all, a fantastic choice for any student.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for annotating PDFs and Notes", "Author": "wings", "ReviewID": "R2N5GJO7LD0CFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because I wanted something for:- Taking notes- Reading science papers. I hate printing papers in black and white only to have to go back online to look at colored figures. I also wanted to be able to write notes or make annotations in the margins or on the figures. I wanted to be able to keep all these papers organized in one place instead of carrying a stack wherever I went.I am someone who learns best by physically writing/drawing things; I don't retain as much when I type notes or take pictures of diagrams. I specifically bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because it came with S Pen.Best Apps for my Purposes:SNote - For taking notes during chalktalks and classes, and brainstorming.Adobe PDF - For taking notes on powerpoints.EZPDF - Costs $ but better for writing in the margins, highlighting, underlining than Adobe PDF. You can also write smaller in the margins (can't change the pen thickness for Adobe PDF after a certain point).Kingsoft Office/OfficeSuite - Polaris has \"not saved\" my work a couple of times even after I've clicked \"Save.\" You can see other reviews about the Polaris Bug here [...]. I'm not sure if it's still a problem, but it's the reason I have started using Kingsoft Office (which is free) as well as OfficeSuite (which costs $). I've bought a Bluetooth keyboard (from Logitech http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-920-003390-Tablet-Keyboard-Android/dp/B0054L8N7M). It really allows me to get work done on my tablet even when I don't have a wireless connection (otherwise it's nice to use Google Drive). This way, I can carry around my tablet instead of lugging around my laptop.Basically, my tablet has been able to replace my laptop for taking notes, reading papers, answering emails, writing documents in Word, and even making very basic powerpoints (I can just open it on my laptop later to add the fancy animations and backgrounds).", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT TABLET!", "Author": "Lou", "ReviewID": "RQB5IXA5TESR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the 32 GB Galaxy Note 10.1 for well over a month. I take a lot of notes (I am a therapist in private practice) and I have found the use of the S-Pen to be astounding, saving me a lot of paper. I come from a Motorola Xoom and wanted to upgrade, so it was initially confusing, as I was considering the new iPad (3rd generation) and the Asus Infinity Pad, as I REALLY liked the high resolution displays. Then came the Galaxy Note with the convenience of S-Pen technology. The resolution on the Note, being the same as my Xoom, I thought would push me toward the other competitors, but actually, the S-Pen was the convincing factor in my purchase. The resolution is NOT unpleasant by any means. I am quite comfortable with watching videos, reading all my Kindle books, and of course, writing notes. The colors seem more saturated than on my Xoom, so the resolution is still quite improved over what I had. I just stopped doing side-by-side comparisons with the iPad and the Infinity Pad, because I was driving myself insane, and I would have certainly missed the S-Pen had I decided on one of the other tablets.I wanted the tablet for productivity, NOT primarily for movie-watching. I use the Note mostly for taking notes and reading and I have yet to take advantage of the many other features available. I have tons of music loaded on my iTunes library and LOVE Google Play, which allows me to access all this music from my tablet as well as from my other devices. So I find many uses for the Note that should keep me busy for quite a while. I am not going to fool myself into thinking that this will be the last tablet I ever purchase. Every day something \"new and improved\" comes out, and now with Windows 8 tablets being out, it may be a matter of time (I KNOW it will be a matter of time) before I upgrade again. I will always want the option of writing with a pen in future devices. I cannot see myself upgrading without this feature. For movie-watching, gaming and reading, I'm sure the higher-resolution displays are worth the upgrade. I also added a 64 GB micro sd card (it must be converted to FAT 32 in order for it to work), so I have plenty of storage. I also bought a desk-top dock, 2 longer charging wires (the included wire is way too short), and an S-Pen holder kit, which allows me to use a normal-sized S-Pen (I never use the included pen since getting this one). Now I just need the higher-resolution AND the S-Pen combined. But I am quite pleased with the Galaxy Note and would highly recommend it. For me, for now, this is as good as it gets.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Kens", "ReviewID": "R3CCTRZ9HWZ46B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet.... and i love it. Ive had it for about 2 months now. I always wanted a tablet, however i didnt want to be disappointed when i bought my first tablet. Ive had an ipod touch so i figured an ipad would be the same... and i used my aunts ipad and im glsd to say that i love this more, because it does so much more. Surprisingly i use the stylus often, whether its for online shopping and hovering over image previews, writing notes in class, or writing a note on a screen shot.I actually bought the samsung stylus with an eraser on ebay. Apparently samsung is way behind on its production in america. Like they still dont sell the keyboard dock, even though they have it in england, china, etc.So i bought the stylus pen on ebay and love that too, highly recommend! Its black btw andsold for around 25$. The white one thats $200 or so is the bluetooth stylus which can be used as a phone speaker just hold it up to your ear. I thought that was cool.... however a tad too pricey for me.I recommend getting a tpu case and possibly like a zippered sleeve to cover it. I bought one of the tri fold cases at bestbuy for temporary protection. Although i love having the built in stand on the go, writing with the stylus and bumping into the corners is annoying. I would usually just remove the case anyways because it was annoying. So with the tpu case, the edges are almost the same height as the screen, and plus you have back protection.Its very fast, and i love it because its faster than my infuse 4g in terms of wifi connection and regular speed going through apps and what not... thats to be expected. So i do prefer using my tablet over my phone in that aspect. However i hsve my eye set on the gnii that just came out. I love the note series!I also bought this sd converter on ebay, and i can view, edit, and copy pictures from the sd card. Also because of sandy and havent used a flash drive in a few years... i was stuck without a way to transfer my school essays without internet. So putting them on my sd card and having the converter did help. I am a freelance photographer, so i wouldnt mind showing my clients their pictures onmy tablet in thefuture(havent done so yet.) Usually i use dropbox for school and file sharing.I also recommend the logitech bluetooth android keyboard. I use the built in case/stand to hold up my tablet. The keyboard is nice too, slightly lagged when you backspace and remove words, but its really nice. Im not even sure i want the official keyboard dock because this keyboard does the same exact thing imguessing for much cheaper.however the dock has its pros too.The photoshop app thst came with this tablet is pretty nice, its really like photoshop on the go. However it is slightlymore frustrating to work with, but minor retouches i think come out just as good as the computer program.I do recommend getting lecturenotes because its good for taking down notes. Therss also a paid audio additiom to lecturenotes that lets u record audio. I have bought it but have only used it once as a test. Writing and recording just domt work as you hear the stylus sound. But this is a good app bc there are stylus options like only eriting with the stylus. So i love being able to rest my palm all over the screen and not affect my note taking. The only snnoyance is accidently hitting the notifications time button in the corner. But i love that it only writes with the stylus. And 2 clicks on the side of the stylus turns it into an eraser. Or if you bought the eraser black stylus, just flipping it 180 like a pencil will erase automatically. S notes i use more for like fun drawing or writing some type of diary entries.I use this for my college classes. However i must say that eventhough it is nice to carry less to class, i do like the feel of real paper as it cushions your hand. So i only use this for myhistory class 3hrs a week, because any longer then 1.30 in a day makes ur hand tired with constantly writing notes down.And just today i installed flash because i didnt know how. Just go into the. Adobe android archives for ics 4 and download the latest. I think my flash works now... i havent really tested it, but one of the vids that required flash before now plays so i think its up and working.The tablet is amazingly fast and fun to play with, good for gaming. Im actually looking into getting an android game controller to really make this tablet even more amazing.Also as a side note, its expected that a tablet is not a laptop and shouldnt be a replacement. I do writd my essays on here with the logitech keyboard, however it is slightly frustrating to write papers when you have a backspace problem deleteing more words than just one. And i usually have to edit in word on the computer to fix the errors like thd 1in spacing on the sides and spelling errors, etc. So it is more time consuming than typing things on a laptop or regular computer. But for on the go use its fantastic, and helps me get things done for school.Im always using my tablet watching movies, youtube vids, you name it. I absolutely love this thing. I personally think it does and is worth so much more than an ipad. The battery lasts pretty well in my opinion. However i might not be the best person to talk about batteries since my infuse 4g phone battery lasts like 2 hours and i always carry backups with me. This tablet im guessing lasts like 6 hours, i havent really checked. But i thino thats amazing (compared to my phone lol....)Btw the facebook app can use a lot of work, but using facebook in your app browser fixes a lot of the problems..", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note 10.1 an awesome and useful tool!! Finally on Android.", "Author": "jescobe82", "ReviewID": "R2P2MWV02AKP2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have waited a month before reviewing as I wanted to have plenty of time to wring it out.  I am totally impressed with this tablet.  Do not listen to others about \"build quality\".  So what if it has a plastic back?  It won't dent that way and it's plenty solid.  I have no issues with that and I think the build quality is extremely good.  This is my 3rd Android tablet and is by far the most useful.  I admit, I did mainly get this for the S-pen and it's drawing capabilities.  While that is outstanding, this is a very solid and productive tablet for the casual user to the business minded.  All of the office type apps work flawlessly, wifi through my network and I can print documents, full Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc.  I use this thing all the time for my business and I don't leave the house without it.  Now onto the drawing or S-pen portion.  Once you get the hang of the program's available for this, it's a blast to use!!  I have always liked drawing and doodling and this just works.  My fav app so far is the Sketchbook PRO version.  The Photoshop app works well too but I'm really still learning how to use that.  I love the fact that I can whip this out and start taking notes if needed for a meeting, do voice record, draw up a quick display or graph.  Fantastic.  I use this a lot as well for Netflix and other media consumption apps and that works fantastic as well.  I have read a lot about the people having issues with the screen.  NO, it's not the highest resolution out there but it does work and it's beautiful.  The reason this does not have the latest and greatest screen resolution is due to the WACOM portion not being compatible for that high of resolution....that's what I am told anyway.  If you MUST have the best screen, you may not want this however, I don't see how anyone can have a problem with it.  Did I mention this thing is a speed demon???  After a month, not a stutter, shudder, or squint out of it.  It takes all the apps, movies, music, docs I can throw at it and it doesn't miss a beat.  Very impressed with that after previous Android tabs.  By the way, I am coming from a Toshiba Thrive 16GB and a Kindle Fire.  In summation, if you are looking for a tab that you can actually be productive at and get office type of work done, this is it.  It's great at media consumption but any tablet can do that.  This thing is actually USEFUL!!  Build quality, excellent, screen, excellent, processor, excellent.  And the speakers in FRONT??? Genious!!  This is actually too loud sometimes depending on your surroundings.  WHY no one puts the speakers on the front is beyond me.  Makes total sense.  Once you get the hang of the S-pen, it's awesome and no gimmick.  Very useful tool and the S-pen feels great in the hand---with the one exception of how you hold it.  It will take random screen shots if you don't keep that button on it from under your finger.  Just get used to not putting it under your finger and it's fine.  A++ tablet and I personally think it's the best on the market at this time.  Don't hestitate if you are on the fence, just GO GET IT!!  You will be impressed.

When I touch the screen of my sleeping Galaxy Note, the weather is shown both in the photo (rain today), the temp, and the time....all that in just one swipe....an example of a major difference.....widgets. My Android phone and now my tablet have floating widgets showing my email inbox, USA Today and The Huffington Post's top news stories.  On the iPad, no widgets....you have to click on every app to access it.2.  Organization: My tablet is so organized compared to the iPad....which shows every app ever downloaded.....no folders (I have all my educational games that I downloaded for my nieces tucked in a folder).  The screens have the beautiful live wallpaper in the background where the sun rises and sets with the time of day....shooting stars at night.....gorgeous.3.  Worried about all your music on iTunes?  Dont! Its so easy to set that computer to sync your music to your Android phone or tablet.  I just bought the new Pink album on iTunes and it synced right over.I love the pen!!  Remember how the stylus was so old school?  Well everything old is new again.  It is awesome for signing your name to emails, jotting quick notes, taking handwritten notes in class with the ebook open in the same screen.....the possibilities are endless!!!It is super fast and has an expandable slot for even more memory....which the ipad doesn't...This thing is just awesome....I swear.  Any questions.....I'll answer them!  I will also post some pics soon....the screen shot button on the bottom of the screen is super handy.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R9J6UPFKQ61L0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am happy to see how 'we' aka the users or 'consumers' (hate that term) are driving the evolution of tablets and similar gadgets. The near-complete dominance of the one-size-fits-all, general-purpose tablet is about to end and more of us have the ability to pick something that more closely matches what we want or what we need in the favorite feature set, screen size and level of affordability. And the Note 10.1 is one such example. It's not for everyone but if you are looking for a highly portable tool to not only consume content or shop or play games but also to create media, especially visual media, the Note 10.1 is probably the best choice at this time.SPECSNothing to be shy about when it comes to powerful hardware.- 1.4GHz quad-core CPU (fast)- 2GB of RAM- WXGA display, 1280 x 800 LCD (not the best but good enough)- 16/32GB built-in storage- MicroSD for further storage expansion- USB 2.0- mHL port for directly connecting to HD TVs- Bluetooth 3.0 for connecting any of a number of possible peripherals such as speakers or keyboards- Wi-Fi 802.11N- Wi-Fi Direct (connect to other devices without the need of a wireless access point- 1.9M front camera- 5M rear camera- stereo speakers (impressive)Performance is impressive. Response is almost immediate, the tablet responds well to either finger, stylus or its own pen. As the enumeration above shows, this tablet has almost everything and most of it is top notch. Yes, you can find better displays on other tablets but I am quite content with what the Note provides.THE PENThe difference the pen makes is the difference between finger painting and using a fine paintbrush or pencil. The Note's pen allows for precise control, the tablet responds to its touch instantly and with the proper software you can do more neat things with it than you can possibly imagine before you actually try it. I found the pen to be comfortable to hold and it's the preferred input method for the Note.If you want to do any serious drawing or painting on a tablet, the Note 10.1 is likely to be the number one choice, thanks to its S Pen. It's a lot more than a stylus. Its thin tip allows you to touch the screen with almost pixel-level precision and the the tablet recognizes not only the tip's position but also the amount of pressure you apply. This makes all the difference when it comes to drawing or painting. Additional capabilities are unlocked in S Pen-aware apps trough by pressing a button on the pen's side.SOFTWAREIt's impressive how well integrated Samsung's own apps and customized interface blend with the base Android foundation. Samsung's interface and the 4-core processor allow you to truly multitask - as in have 2 apps sharing the screen - certain compatible apps. For example, you can play a video on one half of the screen and run a browser and do your email on the other half.The Note shines when running Samsung developed or third-party apps that are S Pen compatible. There's quite a few of them including an amazing custom version PhotoShop Touch. Samsung's own S Note allows you to take hand-written notes, can guess many basic shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) that you may try to draw and replace them with perfect outlines. There's a number of S Pen apps on Google Play.One of the more intriguing apps was Kno Textbook aimed at students whose titles come with full multimedia features, from illustration to animations, 3-D models and video and they claim to have thousands of titles available for purchase.WHO SHOULD CONSIDER IT?Anyone who can afford the price and is an artist by profession or by hobby should at least consider the Note 10.1. Students may be interested because of the tablet's note-taking capabilities and the Kno Textbook app. Also, anyone who, like me, doesn't particularly enjoy touching their tablet screen.I will be rating the Note 10.l as a five-star in the context of it providing the specific features and capabilities I described below. As a general-purpose tablet is simply one of many - good quality build if you don't mind all-plastic, powerful specs at the time I write this but may not look so powerful one year from now, likely to get Android upgrades eventually.

I am a lover of technology, however.  That being said, I am always on the look out for bigger and better gadgets/technology.  When I decided to get rid of my paper Franklin Planner, which I've been using for 15 years now, I wanted something that would fit my business needs (this is the only way I can justify buying another tablet since I already owned the Kindle Fire!)  After much research on the net and You Tube, I decided to go with the Samsung Note.  The first reason was that I thought this tablet was geared more towards business than the Ipad, which seemed to be more geared towards multimedia.  (Obviously both tablets are can easily handle work and entertainment demands)  The second reason, I went with Samsung is because it is Android based and I am wanted that freedom/option vs. being forced to get everything from the Apple Store.  Don't get me wrong, the Ipad 3 is AMAZING and an excellent tablet and if money was no object, I would have own both the Samsung Note and the Ipad 3!  I'm just particular about the flexibility of my buying options.What I love about the Note is that you can easily take handwritten notes and have it turned into text immediately and pretty accurately.  Love the S pen!  I also love being able to write formulas that are easily identified by the program.  My husband is a math teacher so this function is great for him.  He is able to write his math tests for his students quickly and neatly on the go while he is waiting for our boys to finish soccer or Taekwondo practice.  We are still learning how to use all the functions and there is a learning curve involved.  If your handwriting is too sloppy, the program will not capture it correctly.  If you have decent penmanship, it works pretty well.The Note is amazingly fast and I notice that it downloads faster than my laptop.  I can surf the net easily and can download and upload anything I need it to in record time.  Very impressed with the speed.  I am sure I am just scratching the surface of all the Tablet has to offer and it has been fun discovering them!I've been using it for two weeks now and have no complaints.

Keep in mind that this is my first tablet and i am new to android.First of all, the S-pen is very accurate and works great. After using a Wacom Bamboo for many years i would say that the s-pen lives up to my expectations. It is precise and the pressure sensitivity works very well. I can't say that i notice all 1024 levels while using it, but it does have a nice range of sensitivity.Pros:- The multitasking is great, and so is the pop-out video player.- Screen looks amazing (even with the lower, 1200x800 resolution)- S-pen is awesome, the tip is small enough to allow you to be really accurate.- Sketching and drawing/painting on this tablet is fantastic, especially after Autodesk SketchBook Pro was updated, amazing app that i highly recommend.- Taking notes on it is a breeze, the only tablets that can even come close to comparing to it are the Windows 8 tablets with Wacom digitizers, but they are much more expensive.- The peel app makes controlling your T.V. or home theater system quite convenient.- Battery life is outstanding.Cons:- The fact that it's made out of plastic doesn't bother me, but some people might care. It looks good and is pretty sturdy either way.- A bit pricey, considering the screen resolution is so much less than other tablets in the same price range, but the S-pen is the trade off.- Does not have a mini HDMI port built-in. After owning the tablet for 5 months this is the one thing i really wish it had. In order to connect this to a HDTV or other TV you have to buy a separate adapter, and you have to have the tablet plugged into a power source: Samsung EPL-3PHPBEGXAR Galaxy Tab HDTV Adapter Very annoying and inconvenient, but the only real downfall of the entire tablet.In Conclusion:I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone, especially if you will make good use of the s-pen with taking notes, drawing, or anything else. The quality of the product is very nice.On a side note, I you need the Full Pro version of Autodesk Sketchbook to be able to use pressure sensitivity, the free version (express) doesn't have this. But the tablet comes with Photoshop PS Touch which has full pressure sensitivity support.The tablet does have a couple downfalls (the screen resolution is a little low, but it still looks nice even with lower resolution). And the android 4.1.2 update increased the amount of apps that you can run in multi-window mode, so that is no longer an issue. The human eye (someone with great vision) can recognize a dpi of up to 300. Apple uses a number very close to this in their Retina displays, but no one is holding the device right up to their face to use it. Having 150 dpi is still on the higher end of things. To put that into perspective, my full HD 21\" 1080p monitor that i am looking at right now has an excellent display at 105 dpi, granted i do sit further away from it than a tablet. A typical laptop (15.6\" at 1366 x 768) only has 75 dpi and no one is complaining.****EDIT:**** I've had the tablet for just over 5 months now and i am still very satisfied with this tablet, even after seeing all the Windows 8 tablets out there i would still buy this one.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Experiencing a major problem after a week.", "Author": "The NC", "ReviewID": "RBIYXX9JLQES8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  9/2/2012-----------------------Based on comments others have left me, it seems my problem was caused by an update that Samsung released over the air(wifi) without me knowing.

The update was pulled, so hopefully no one else will experience this from now on.-------------------------original review below-------------------------I received my Galaxy Note 10.1 last week, and have been playing with it without issue every day since.  This has been a five-star product until...Today, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.  Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.  Re-inserting the pen re-enables the finger touch functionality.Shutting down the tablet and leaving the pen out, then re-testing pen function after turning it on still has no pen function.Great, THE PEN IS NOW USELESS.I know my way around the Android OS having used my Samsung Vibrant(rooted to ICS) phone for the past two years, and also have used an Archos and an Acer Honeycomb tablet both upgraded to ICS.  With that said, none of the settings in the options are able to bring the pen functionality back.I'm now wondering if it's a magnet issue within the pen.  But I'll need to decide if I want to return this thing for a replacement or deal with Samsung Customer Service which I know will not be fun.*EDIT 8/29/12:  Just adding more after a little more testing.I turned on the tablet today, to try again to see if it would resolve itself.  Same problem still.  But now, I notice that after the tablet enters sleep and waking it up with the power button, the touch panel is dead without even pulling the pen out to cause the dilemma.So I force restart now, and go into options to do a factory reset.

I like the fact that this tablet can convert My chicken scratch into text as quickly as I can write it down. I've had this tablet for 2 months so I've had plenty of time to explore it inside out.I've read other reviews that complained about the screen resolution. I'm a graphic artist and it is perfect for me. I've played with the updated 2014 version and while the display is brighter, and the interface is almost identical to the Note 3 (which I also own), this version is still a solid tablet, especially with the new lower price tag. So if you want to save a couple hundred dollars I would not count this tablet out.The S pen is VERY Useful to me. It feels comfortable in my hand and is very responsive. I prefer its position at the bottom of the tablet to the upper right corner where the 2014 version has placed it. The s pen interface for this tablet is like the one Used in the Note 2. So if you own or have owned that phone, it will be very familiar to you.The multi screen feature is ok, but I do prefer the 2014's updates which allows more programs. I have had several windows open at one time and noticed no visible lag. You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it. I love that you can fully customize this device and truly make it your own.This tablet is geared toward people who want to do more with their device than browse the internet and Stream movies. while I would not call this a Computer replacement, it has made my job easier with Polaris Office and PhotoShop preinstalled. It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.One thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player. I have several movies in .avi format and have found an app that plays them perfectly and with the big screen and front facing Speakers with great Sound, it's just a great experience.Bottom line, I give this a glowing review. I have a Samsung Laptop, Note 3, and now the note 10.1. Iexen have a Samsung refrigerator. I'm not a brand loyalist, they just happen to make devices that cater to my needs and are reliable.One thing I do hate to read about in these Reviews is when they compare this tablet to the iPad.

This review details my experience since I could find zero reviews or help (including going to the Samsung store) to find out.  1.  Samsung gives you Kies which lets you transfer all your music to the tablet easily.  Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.  Kies is great and works just as well with photos.  2. Videos were impossible.  The way digital copies transfer to play in ITunes makes it hard to watch on your tablet.  You would need to download and/or pay to convert your files to a readable format.  Luckily, we also have a pc with a windows os so we were able to re download digital copies (from blu-rays) and download an app on the tablet to be able to play videos. So, if you have windows, it will be easy to transfer your videos to the tablet.  The ones that expired I have not converted yet and do not plan on it as I do not need that many movies on the tablet but it was annoying.  In the end, I love this tablet especially as more apps have become available.

This is my first tablet, and as such I did much research to figure out which one would suit my needs and wants the best.Let me start off by saying that the only real worry I had about the tablet was the screen resolution.  I had watched and read many reviews and comparisons and the main concern that always came up was the resolution was not that great.  I have to say that even though it is only 1200x800, it's still VERY beautiful to me.  You will notice a difference if you've used a new iPad or one of the higher end new Android tablets, I'm sure... but the screen isn't as bad as many make it out to be.  It's very overstated.  The other thing that concerned me, not really Samsung's fault, was the fact that Android tablets have few apps that are specifically designed for them.  This is still bothersome as apps like Facebook, twitter, and games all have a smartphone feel.  It's something to consider, but for me it wasn't a deal breaker.I purchased the white version of the tablet, and it looks beautiful.  The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.  This was genius by Samsung, and I bet future tablet makers will follow this trend.  Unless Samsung patents the idea, and says no... which would be quite awesome!  Anyway, I digress.  Beyond the speakers, the tablet is light and plastic.  The feel is nice, but I bought a case due to using it for school.The actual software is now updated to Jellybean, which is great.  The tablet is fast as heck.  I run games, movies, internet browsing, and s-notes all without any issues.  It's lightning quick.  The keyboard is wonderful.  Even better though, and a major reason I decided on this tablet, is the S-pen.  This is what separates this tablet from every other.  The S-pen combined with pressure sensitivity and palm rejection is a dream come true.  I will be using this tablet as my notebook when I return to class.  The idea of being able to take notes and access my textbooks all at the same time was something too wonderful to pass up.As a first time tablet buyer, I'm thrilled with this tablet.

I have 5 Note 10.1 and 3 IPads.  They are all set up on our wireless network.  From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.  There are more ways of adding widgets and customization than the Ipad.  There is also a multi view option that allows you to access web applications while taking notes, tracking wireless signals, email, or anything you could do on a PC that has dual video cards.  It also opens Word, Power Point, or Excel documents with an app that comes standard.  These can be placed in the Dropbox app that the device asks you to sign up for when you first start the device.  I can also set up a VPN or even have it connect to my archive server, sync, and create a backup.  From a non-technical stand point, it is very user friendly and can keep you connected with any social media.  It also has IR that can turn your tablet into a remote for your TV.  This is more than just a remote, it gives you an app that shows you what is on, on each channel your provider has.  You tap the show and your TV changes to it.  My Samsung phone has many apps and what not on it.  When I set up the tablet to my email that I use on my phone it brought all my data over to the tablet.  You can even use the pen that comes with the tablet to take notes or play games.  There is also an Allshare app that lets you transfer media from tablet to TV, to Phone, or PC.

As soon as I exited the video,  it automatically sent back into portrate.The S-Pen does take getting used to, if you haven't used a stylus on a tablet before,  it works great.  S-Note's idea pad is very useful,  allowing you to add images,  video,  as well as audio into the notes.The battery life is great,  I was using it one day, then put it to sleep (one click on the post button), and did open it till the next day, and it was still in the same battery level as before, and yes the wifi was on.The S Calender automatically sync with my Google account as soon as I logged into the tablet.The dual screen experiance works fine.For the keyboard it has the Swype feature,  which I find easier then typing,  it can be turned on our off.The E mail app that comes with it allows you to add different emails from different providers, ie gmail, go daddy, ect. And has a \"combined view\" , that shows you all the emails from all those inboxes. Even the gMail app works great on the tablet.This tablet is very slim too, light, and powerful.It's perfect if your a creative person,  especially some kind of artist or musician,  a note taker, or a student.I would absolutely recommend this over the iPad without a second thought.Enjoy", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 10 inch Tablet!", "Author": "KaTzPJamas", "ReviewID": "R1FKXRPNZXWEVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is kind of biased because I am anti Apple products however Android can be a terrible experience if you don't have the right specs in the tablet itself. I'm a spec stickler when it comes to the internal components of computers and stuff but I think this has all the right specs with its quad core processor and 2gb ram. I actually bought this tablet for $350 from the warehouse deals and received it a couple days later (Amazon Prime). The tablet, was in near perfect condition in the original box with everything its suppose to come with. All the peelable plastic was still on and the screen was blemish/scratch free. I managed to find a teeny tiny scratch in the corner of the gray plastic. Otherwise, near perfect condition as I said.Here are the great things about this tablet.-Samsung released android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) for this tablet which equals better performance and a few extra things here and there.-16gb storage space is sufficient. I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb. Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something. I just stream everything media related via Hulu+, Netflix, Youtube, or Spotify/Pandora. So I don't care much for the space.-The quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly. The tablet runs as smooth as butter. No Hiccups.-The 2 Gb of RAM lets you multitask very well and you will never feel like the tablet is slowing down.-Samsung has their overlay over the stock android interface. Personally I like it a bit better.-Samsung has their own app market and they pre-install some apps on your tablet. The good news is they aren't complete junk. I find them useful because I'm a student.-very responsive. The touch screen is great.-the tablet has an IR blaster so I can control my own TVs and other things with the tablet.-Smart Stay. Samsung has an option called Smart Stay. Normally with a smart phone or tablet you will be looking at something on the screen. Occasionally you have to keep touching it for the screen to remain on without defaulting to off. With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you. It will recognize when you are looking at the screen or when you are not looking at it. If you are looking at the screen the device will remain on and you don't have to do those occasional touches to reassure your tablet that you are still using it and make sure it doesn't automatically turn off.-on screen keyboard is customizable. Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on. The keyboard can be changed in 3 different ways. It can be a big keyboard, a small keyboard that you can drag anywhere on the screen, or a split up keyboard that has half of a keyboard on one side of the screen and the other half on the other side. It works well if you are holding it widescreen so you can type with just your thumbs and still maintain a good hold on the tablet.Something to note is that this tablet can do certain apps side by side on the screen. I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful. However, I do use it for taking notes on the note app. The S pen inserts right into the tablet and blends in seamlessly. You'd never know its there unless you're looking for it. Again, the S pen is a personal opinion. I like having it as an option but I don't use it 95% of the time. Vanity is vanity I will say.-The screen resolution. A lot of phones and tablets nowadays are making a big deal bout ppi (pixels per inch). I will say things like Apples retina display or the amoled screen that samsung is using now on newer phones/tablets and the crazy resolution displays on the nexus tablets will kick this tablet's butt. The 1280x800 resolution looks good but if you are comparing detailed photos or something with those things I mentioned; It will seem lame. Words and pictures can look pixel-ee at times.-Another thing to note about the screen. When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything. I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over. Same in your app drawer. I haven't found an option that can turn that off or whatever but I should let you know that. If it matters you can fit 56 app icons on one home screen. I'm a widget fan so I dont have the Ipad look of pure apps on a screen.-The speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left. This tablet was certainly meant to be used in widescreen which I'm okay with.Overall this is a great tablet. It looks good when I don't have it in the case and I looks good with my cool case too. The side front facing speakers get loud. Honestly I cannot think of a feature that this tablet doesn't have. Besides maybe a super cool high resolution screen there's really nothing other tablets can do that this one cannot. If anything this tablet has more features and more potential. If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen. If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet I would say this is a great one to buy. If not, I would probably point you in the direction of the new 8 inch note tablet that Samsung is releasing or the Nexus 10.

There are lots of answers but it is an important question to ask.  Across the board tablets do not fulfill all the aspects of computing that a laptop or desktop computer might, and for those aspects that they do fulfill, the tend to do so with some caveats.  For me it was the desire for an eReader with some mobile computing capabilities.Next, there are a metric ton of options.  I will not directly compare this tablet to an iPad because the pros and cons for each platform are dizzying.  Apple does a great job of innovating and packaging hardware and software.  They make a fine product that is very usable.  Android is more open and though that comes with its own pain, it is what I like though.  Still there are so many choices that your head can spin.  Size is one factor and a Seven inch tablet proved too small for me to see some diagrams.  Manufacturer is another factor and again, you can find many pros and cons for each.  Samsung alone has several tablet offerings and you may find another fine Samsung tablet that more closely fits your budget if you like Samsung.  I chose this manufacturer in part because of my Samsung phone.  Just trying to find a decent tablet can be taxing with all the options and issues.  If it fits your budget, this is a real nice tablet and it offers some capabilities that others don't.Pros:1.  Build quality is top notch.  It has the look and feel of a top of the line tablet--and at this price it should.  It favorably compares to the iPad in this category.2.  Thin.  That may not sound like much of a pro, but other 10 inch tablets felt harder to hold for very long partly due to their thickness.  Again, it compares favorably to the iPad in this category.3.  Battery life.  Android has lots to learn about managing its battery, but this tablet will run for several days of moderate use on a single charge.  Moderate use would not include near constant video watching and gaming, but reading, web surfing and some rather light gaming.4.  sPen and Photoshop Touch.  As a trained Photoshop user (I know, odd description), I find having a stylus for artwork very useful.  But the sPen's use in other areas may not be what the hype leads you to believe.  With a bit of practice you might just not be able to live without it though.5.  Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.  I've used several tablets and smart phones with different processors and the best in my opinion is a quad core.  Now I would be the first to say that I probably will never truly task a quad core to its max potential.  But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.  Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.  Its thin and uses Gorilla Glass.  You need a case to keep it safe and increase the potential of holding on to it, and the case options are rather poor.  There is at least one tri-fold case I like so far.2.  Build materials collect finger prints as a hobby.  This bugs me a bit and I carry a micro-fiber cloth for the screen wherever I go, but without a case, the back gets as much or more cloth time.3.  Magnets can disturb the sPen and turn on the tablet.  This can limit case choice as well since many of them use magnets.  The one I like does but they are well placed and don't get in the way.  Yet another one I thought would be good had magnets in places where the tablet would turn-on once you closed the flap.In my view, the multitasking is more hype than capability.  Its nice to have, but entirely too limited and it is a bit of a hack.  If the underlying operating system is not designed with the ability to do a thing then you can be assured you will not be completely happy with a hack like this.  Still, it has some uses.I've already said the sPen capability is partly hype, and I may be being a bit unkind toward it.  If you are expecting to use it to take notes, be prepared to be disappointed.  Unless your handwriting is stellar--and since mine is not, I'm guessing here--you will not find its use in this regard very easy.  With a bit of practice though you might learn to love it.  Samsung's sPen enabled applications look nice enough and offer some nice capabilities like text, formula, and shape recognition.Other reviews have complained about the lack of ports, but you can buy an adapter to give you those ports.  I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.  If it is, you may want to factor-in the cost and inconvenience of the adapter.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly useful", "Author": "Mario Garita Brenes \"Mario G.\"", "ReviewID": "R1D51UV1GQGNX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has everything you need to write, read or enjoy multimedia files anywhere you are. I thought the multi-tasking would work with all apps, but it doesn't. Although, this does not seem to affect the productivity of the product, you can still easily switch from one app to another without the tablet getting stuck or becoming slow. It connects to any Wi-Fi network almost immediately and the GPS works even inside closed buildings. The screen does reflect a lot of the surrounding environment, so it is better to use in closed places, the reflection of the sun and the clouds may affect the visibility of the screen when used outdoors. The stylus is amazingly accurate, but easy to lose, so watch out. I live in Costa Rica and some services are not included with the tablet, such as a video apps or Kno Textbooks, but who needs those?

I'm a somewhat savvy computer user but am relatively new to the smartphone world and this is my first tablet, so keep that in mind.Out of the box there were very few instructions so I stumbled my way along and finally downloaded the online manual.  The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast. Pretty easy to customize home screens once I had instructions.I was really glad I purchased screen savers, a carrying case, and a 32 Gig MicroSD chip along with the tablet.  I put the Mini-guard matte anti-glare screen protector on right out of the box so there would be minimal chance for dust and that worked really well.  The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles. Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).  After two years that will cost you...current price for 50 Gig is $10/month.  Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.  If you switch to SugarSync you could get 5 Gig for free. Dropbox also recently had a data breach, so that may be a consideration. I haven't decided yet whether to activate Dropbox or switch to SugarSync.I've had a few issues and was surprised to find Samsung Customer Support not very helpful.  The Accuweather widget was displaying the wrong time and I couldn't figure out why. Samsung didn't know either and could only suggest I reset the tablet and go back to factory specs, which I refused to do (didn't want to lose the apps I'd downloaded).  With some googling I discovered that I'd neglected to set the GMT time field. The main tablet clock display was correct; only the weather app was wrong.  Turns out that once I set the GMT to Eastern Std Time, the weather app sync'ed just fine. Glad I didn't reset.I also want to be able to charge my tablet from my car, and called Samsung to find out what the watt, volt and amp requirments would be for an inverter to charge the tablet. After being on hold for a few minutes I was told that only the design team has that information and they won't release it because they are protecting against someone reverse-engineering their design.  Sigh... I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.  Probably a good learning experience for me, but be forewarned if you're not really tech-savvy and wanting to venture into the tablet world....you won't get much help from Samsung.

It was so easy to use and change colors in a second when doing that. Also I took all my notes on this tablet and converted them to pdf files on tablet itself and mailed them to my friends who could not attend.

Multi-task screens are an important breakthrough.  I enjoy using Polaris office (pre-packaged on my Note) side-by-side with S-Note, or with the Internet browser.  I wish that the Note could place any application in multi-task mode (side-by-side on one screen), but it only works with some of the built-in applications.

I tried multiple Asus models (a total of 8 tablets) but all had defects. I had my eye on the Note 10.1 since it was a high performance tablet, but was ultimately discouraged by the negative professional reviews.I decided to give it a shot anyway, and I'm really glad I did! The display is beautiful. Colors look great and appear to be displayed accurately. A lot of reviews knocked the resolution, but it looks pretty sweet to me. Performance is spectacular! The Exynos processor runs circles around Tegra powered tablets. Everything is very responsive. Sound is pretty solid for a tablet. The front mounted speakers make a huge difference. The build quality is solid in my opinion.I'm not sure if I'll have any practical use for the S-Pen, but it does appear to work rather well. The multi-tasking features are great but only work with a few apps. I'd love to see Samsung expand on that in the future.Battery life is also great. As an example, I've been using it heavily today, including playing games. It has been off of the charger for about 16 hours and I have 70% of the battery remaining.If you're looking for a high performance Android tablet, I'd definitely recommend taking a good look at the Note 10.1!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "So good, I ordered 2 of them.", "Author": "G3o5d", "ReviewID": "R10IEYLEU0RZDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read many reviews about this product on Amazon and other sites.

YesIt is very quick, looks really good, and has many great features.  My only complaints would be the lack of accessories available. . . . anywhere.  And, not being able to charge it from the car.  I've tried four different charge adapters ranging in power output and non of them work.Up time is excellent and as with my phone, always charge while I'm sleeping.

The stylus aspect is responsive and useful, it was the primary reason I was interested in it at all.  The Native S-pen app takes some getting used to- in fact, I'd say the device overall has a fairly steep learning curve.  However, once you settle in, this device has some really powerful features, like multi-screen multitasking, that make it stand out really well.I really wish that the S-pen app itself had more customizability in controls and default views; it may yet have that, some of these functions are slightly well hidden, hence the learning curve.  I still give the device 5/5, though, because it is very powerful and so far, quite useful.  I use it for Lab Meetings and note-taking for college level biology work.The Battery is no slouch, but it does clock in at about 8 hours, which is -just- short of what I'd like it to be.  It's more than adequate, but I used to use an original iPad, and those last two hours (of 10 hours iPad battery life) are a beast to give up. :)I'm already experiencing the joys of Android with things like Tasker, and while I miss the more polished, easy-to-find and easy-to-use nature of the Apple App store, so far the Android Market, Google Play, is doing very well- but as stated previously, with a learning curve.  When I first set out to play games on this machine, I was disappointed in the decline in quality over iPad games- there are tablet optimized apps out there that are every bit as beautiful ans excellent as iPad games, just no easy way to find them (there are even lemons in the 'tablet' section of the google play store.  I went out and got an app called Tablified Market- it isn't perfect either, but it's a start, and sorts out some apps that use characteristic shortcuts in phone apps to make them into tablet compatible apps.)  In the end, the best bet is to find a way to try the apps and figure out whether they're as optimized as they seem- but I'm a average level tech geek, I enjoy trying to bend a device to my will, and was annoyed by the low level to which I could do this with a spouse-shared iPad.So, I'm giving a five star review while airing mostly gripes with the device.  Yep!  I love it, I find it excellent, fun, useful, and usable, but I'm giving the kind of review I like to read- one that addresses not the excellent points that already drew me to the device, but rather the difficult aspects that make me uncertain.  It is my opinion that my 'uncertainties' have been answered excellently so far in this device, although now, if anyone from Samsung ends up reading this: Please, Please make the S-pen app more customizable!  Single finger panning (or at least less zoom sensitivity when panning!), default page-width view in landscape mode, and an 'infinite paper' mode would all be very welcome additions that I'm currently using other apps to achieve- but of course, I HAVE to use S-pen for the multitasking mode sometimes, and I really, really want the S-pen app to have all the necessary features to be my one-and-only note taking app on this device.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing device.

Call me a skinflint, but I can't spend a substantial amount of money on a device that has no practical value. The only tablet I've kept is the Nexus 7, and that's only because it was fully open (unlike the Fire HD) and cheap enough to justify keeping as a toy. After reading the user reviews of the Note 10.1, I bought it because I was convinced that I had found the Holy Grail: the first affordable tablet that aided productivity instead of procrastination.Sorry, nope. The Note is a competent tablet - if it cost a bit less, I would call it a very good one - but it's not the game-changer I was hoping for.Reports of the Note 10.1's ugliness and cheap build quality have been greatly exaggerated. It is far from sleek, and it does feel somewhat flimsy compared to the (much cheaper) Nexus and Kindle Fire lines, but it is not the fragile piece of space junk that many of the professional reviewers have made it out to be. The screen has decent contrast and - much to my surprise - I did not find that it was significantly less clear than the Nexus 7 or even the borderline-Retina Kindle Fire 8.9.As for the basic OS, it's Android, with which I'm already very familiar. I had expected to hate this new version of TouchWiz, Samsung's all-encompassing overlay for Android 4.1, but I was pleasantly surprised;  it's only slightly inferior to stock 4.2 on the Nexus 7, and it is far superior to the crippling \"storefront\" that strangles all practicality out of the Kindle Fire.When I first used the Note's bundled software suite, I was thrilled. The included S Note app initially seems to be a godsend; the Note lives up to its name as a flawless digital notepad. As I tried the more advanced features, the cracks in the facade began to show: handwriting-to-text translations regularly choked on both my cursive and print, and the \"formula match\" math feature inserted random variables and decimals into everything I wrote.Disappointed, I tried to find substitutes for the included apps. I read reviews singing the praises of Papyrus, Lecture Notes, and Write, and tried all of these. In each case, pen support was stellar, but many of their more advanced features were unintuitive. When I was attempting to use the device to take notes in my lectures, I was consistently distracted from my writing rather than feeling that the process was being empowered or enhanced.This is my biggest problem with the Note: nothing \"just works.\" It has brilliant and innovative features that are all usable with minor effort, but that's the issue;  even if it's only for a second, your mind wanders away from your work and onto the tablet. Even after I was past the Note's learning curve, I found that my work was far more easily accomplished with a notebook - spiral-bound or keyboard-equipped.  The Galaxy Note 10.1 has huge potential as a tool for college students or businessmen, but I can't give it points for potential when the reality is much more bleak.As I said earlier, the Note 10.1 is a good tablet - but how good? The pen feels like a beta feature: it's exciting, but not yet fully-formed enough to justify the premium price. Taking the pen out of the equation, the Nexus 10 does virtually everything else better and costs less; why pay more for an inferior product? Heck, if you're willing to deal with a smaller screen or Amazon's overbearing marketing, even the Nexus 7 and Fire HD are just as good for most consumption tasks. If the Note were considerably cheaper, I'd consider giving it four stars without hesitation, but as it stands, I can only give it three.FULL DISCLOSURE: My Note was a minor lemon that had some Wi-Fi issues.

There are already great, very detailed reviews listed, so I am not going to do the same, but I will tell you why this tablet outdoes the Fire.True Android OS- You get the full Google Play store. The Kindle app store is severely lacking in comparison. Additionally, apps in the Kindle store that worked for the older Fire still are not working on the Fire HD.Web Browser- I liked the Fire's Silk browser a lot at first, and then it started closing for no reason at random times. This has not happened once on the Note, and the browser is smooth, and lag free.Speakers- The Fire's speakers are nice, but the Note put the speakers on the front of the device which is much much better considering how and why we use speakers on a tablet.Battery Life- The Note's battery is simply superior.Expandable Memory- The Note has a microSD slot that can be expanded up to 64 GB, Fire does not.Split Screen Option- The Note allows two programs opened side by side simultaneously. For example I can check my email and browse the web at the same time, or browse the web and take (handwritten, thanks to the S Pen) notes at the same time. This is not a capability of the Fire.Size/Weight- Fire is 20 oz, Note is 21 oz and you get a bigger screen.Keyboard- Even my smartphone has Swype mastered, and so does the Note, Fire has the WORST keyboard I have ever encountered, period. It is terrible.I'm sure I will find more things that I like better than the Fire the more I play with the Note. I just hope I can help someone from making the same mistake I did. In a year or so I think the Fire will be greatly improved, but right now it is very glitchy and overall I found the experience disappointing (especially considering my overwhelming love for all things Kindle eReader).

I have downloaded some other keyboards and was even less impressed with them then the stock one.The multitasking is nice but I hardly use it, mostly because the apps I use do not support it.

The word matching in Swype is significantly better.Papyrus over S-Note. The vector based drawing and minimalistic Android-centric interface is excellent. The one thing I would add is in-line photo/video capture. That said, the formula entry capabilities of S-Note are amazing, as is the integration with Wolfram Alpha. If I get to crunching integrals at some point, I could definitely see a nice reason to dive back in to S-Note.Chrome browser over the Samsung provided browser.GMail app over the built in Mail app (provided that you mostly use GMail of course...)The multi-screen apps are only the Samsung native ones, and really, I didn't find the feature to add much to the tablet experience.PROS:Speedy and responsive under normal use.Nice beautifully bright screen.The S-Pen is 100% undiluted awesome and solves the digital lab-notebook problem I've had since forever.The face-tracking to stay awake function is actually quite amazing and a very nice touch.CONS:Tablet would be straight up awesome and amazing if only they had gone for the high resolution screens that Samsung manufactures, as it stands, I know that I'll be purchasing the high-res version as an upgrade once its available.Auto-dimming is fairly idiotic in is response to the environment.A fair amount of the default software is unnecessary fluff.

It is much more responsive when taking handwritten notes, and the larger pen does feel better.My one major qualm with the tablet is that you cannot move apps to the SD card like I am able to with my galaxy note phone.

As there are not many choices at this point in time, I decided to give the Note 10.1 a try. The Note 10.1 is smooth, responsive, and the stylus is very easy to use accurately. I use the stylus about 80% of the time, even when not writing, as it makes navigation far more accurate. I love the productivity increase from the multiscreen feature, and use it daily in class and while doing online math homework. The main requests I have for Samsung are that they make the next device with a metal backplate, and use a higher resolution screen, even at an additional cost. The device is very well made, and the plastic is not low quality, but it doesn't have the feel and heft of an aluminium device that I prefer. If I understand correctly, Samsung was not able to offer this device with a higher resolution screen due to constraints from the Wacom stylus. Hopefully that will be sorted out by the next release.The TV remote feature is just plain cool, and while not extremely useful, does help for those times I've misplaced my remote. The front facing speakers are great, and sound good enough for what they are.I seriously appreciate Samsung's on board memory flexibility. A mere 50 dollar increase between the 16 and 32gb tablets, and a microSD expansion slot, make this a no brainer compared to other tablets which don't have expandable memory. I'd love to see more companies offer stylus based, user memory expandable, multitasking tablets.4.5-5 stars, I will likely purchase the next model unless there is a better competitor, or Samsung if doesn't upgrade either the screen or backplate.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nothing is PERFECT but this one is close....", "Author": "shojus", "ReviewID": "R2XX2TMYWOXFOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me start off by saying that I have been waiting for an iPad alternative (android) and I had ordered (3) different Asus Infinity tablets from Amazon and returned them ALL because of defects...

The photoshop touch app works great and even if you don't consider yourself an artist, you will feel like one. The pen is just amazing, really responsive and is awesome for note taking.The specs are not the best, but I owned an infinity and returned right away i noticed some issues. These consisted of tne following:  -Continuous force closing  -Short battery life  -Light bleeding in various screen areas  -Felt uncomfortable in hands  What filled the cup was that in the lower right part on the screen, i was able to feel and hear a \"click\"  sound when pressing on it. I have read various reviews stating the same issue. And that it is due to bad glueing in the screen.The infinity has the best specs( quad core 1.7 ghz, gorilla glass 2, 1920 x 1200 screen resolution, keyboard dock, etc.), but all that only looks great in a spec sheet. While using the tablet, you are able to notice all those issues and will definetly return it. But let stop talking about the infinity and let's talk about what you want.  The note 10.1 is blazing fast thanks to its quad core 1.4 ghz exynos processor and its 2gb of ram, lag free and full of features. The 2 gigs of ram are great because the upcoming generation of tablet apps are really heavy and take some space while running. The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great. You cqn only notice the pixels if you stick your nose into the screen. The two speaker sound veery loud and the best i've heard in a tablet. The s note app works great with the stylus as well as polaris office. Samsung has done a great job with the user interface,  touchwiz is just great on this device.The only thing it has to envy is the ipad's screen resolution, but in every other aspect it is envied.

The main layout is the full keyboard with numbers on top like I mentioned above. The second one is a split keyboard so half of the keyboard is on the left side of the screen and the other half is on the right side (iPad does this). The split keyboard allows you to hold the tablet with both hands and type with your thumbs. The third option is a small floating keyboard which can be re-positioned anywhere on the screen.

To get the best use of the tablet required going thru settings to customize. Not bad if you know Android, but could be intimidating for novice users. It does allow you to make the machine your own. One of my first decisions involved setting up S pen settings, including pressure sensitivity and tip size.Con:*The built. It creaks if I hold it certain ways. It doesn't have the solidity of other tablets of equal cost. l will trade that for the S pen and just keep it in a case.* Default software needs improvement.. PDF doesn't work well inside S Note if it's large or landscape. Download EZPDF Reader to solve that. S Note is good, but I'm also trying Lecture Notes. The problems can be fixed.I recommend this tablet if you can take the time to learn it. There are lots of tools for the user to customize which may discourage some people.

A few years ago, around 1985, Samsung electronics and appliances started appearing in American retail stores. At the time the stuff was...well....cheap looking. Twenty seven years have passed and Samsung leads the world in consumer electronics. I have a consciousness eye for appliance and gadget performance (I think). In the past few years I have purchased washer/dryers, plasma TVs, cell phones, refrigerators, all Samsung. Never a problem with anything and prompt customer support (I needed one time cause I didn't realize I had not removed the hold down drum bolts to my washer when setting it up...stupid me). My point is that Samsung is winning on all fronts. The design, engineering, and performance of tablets, phones, appliances, is all first rate. I have iPhones and iPads and all that Apple stuff. To me Apple is a niche product. Apple did revolutionize some ways of interacting with products. However, Samsung is not about loosing market share and they are all about performance.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Different tablet then those I things", "Author": "Juan R.

Amazing screen colors and quality as usual from Samsung. I had a Nexus 10 but returned it regardless because it's performance was choppy/glitch and colors on screen were dull! The Note 10.1 is amazing with it's performance and speed. It can multi-task like no other tablet in the world and at the same time have for me minimum 10 Hours battery life which versus the competition(anyone offering usability for work/school/life + media consumption) is at best 5-6 hours. So battery life here is a winner! The multi-tasking feature is awesome and tablet has the power to back it up! I could open multiple DIVX quality videos at the same time with no lag whatsoever! Amazing!!!The handwriting recognition is #1 in my world! Amazing quality and capture with a very natural feel. Because of this tablet I gave up on paper products and going digital all the way + being eco-friendly as well!Overall this is the best tablet on the market for both fun + work! Don't be fooled by the fan boys/girls or critics. You use this product for 5 minutes like it so much as to  trade a kidney for it! I will be a Samsung Note 10.1 Customer for life!This company stands behind it's product and proven it by investing heavily into Wacom technology and it's company. Only company that made this move. This synergy is shown in the design and quality of the tablet. It will only get better from here leading to greatness!Their partnership with Google/Android also worked great resulting in a great performing OS for tablet.Android/Google OS is the Present and Future! Microsoft and it's Metro UI/Surface OS feels like the past!Don't wait around for something better. This is the best! And I will keep my lineage with the Note Family of products.If you don't believe me? Think I'm crazy? Try it yourself! Just prepare yourself because there is a big chance your will never put it back down again! Enjoy your Note product and Congratulations on your purchase! Your life will change forever!Samsung good job thank you for bringing us innovation and a fresh outlook into the future that waits for us.

I have an iPad 2 as well.  I use both but I find the Galaxy Note 10.1 far more fun to use and far more productive.Here are the differences, in my own view / opinion...iPad 2:- Start iPad, and your main screen shows a bunch of shortcuts... BORING!- iPad WiFi model DOES NOT HAVE GPS hardware! Apple did a very good job hiding this info coz not many knows this, even my apple fan friends and co-workers didn't know it. Always tell them to google it. Only the iPad 3g/4g has GPS radio.  So if you tether and drive around, your car icon on the map will not get updated till about every minute or so. So when Navigating, and by the time you need to make a turn, you already passed it when iPad says, Left turn ahead!- The new iPad map SUCKS. Traffic updates are super slow, it SUCKS.  I asked for directions, it wants me to swim the ocean. Bring swimming gear!- No Adobe Flash, so most web sites right now, don't work! Wait for HTML 5 to be adopted more? A lot more?- iPad does indeed look nice, I give it that. I like the metal case. Makes my hands super cold though on winter; need gloves to use it.- I find my self using iPad for Web only, even before I bought the Note 10.1.- Hand me an iPad or iPhone, and I don't know what fun stuff to do with it coz when I start it, all I see are frkn a bunch of Shortcuts. At least my Windows 7 PC has Gadgets... Right???- iPad makes me look hip. Sorry to say, but many people still give that `interested' look if you have an apple device.- iPad 3 does have very nice resolution when I checked demo at best buy. iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy Note 10.1:- Note 10.1 main screen shows stuff that are working and doing something, so it's not boring. The Widgets. Almost all apps comes with Widgets.  If you want to see the boring Shortcuts page, tap the Apps button.- Note 10.1 gives you all kinds of working widgets i.e. weather, turn-on/off led flashlight, music player widget, photo album widgets, several time zone clocks, utility meters, Facebook updates, etc.  I don't need all of them, but I really like the Weather Widget and music player (i can do Next / Prev Song right there in main screen).- Load or take a lot of videos and then start the Video Player app and you'll be amazed.  ALL your videos are in Preview Mode. Not only it really looks nice seeing each box move, but it is DEFINITELY helpful in finding the video you want to view.- Multi-Screen ROCKS!  Very useful.- I was able to install Adobe Flash and now web pages that use Flash works.- WiFi-Direct Transfer functionality is very useful. You can transfer several files from/to another device with WiFi-Direct super fast.  From what I remember, 500 MB of pics and videos in like 1 minute.- Note 10.1 WiFi model HAS GPS radio hardware. So go ahead and tether it and drive around and ask for directions, you won't get lost. No need to wear swimming trunks.- Android released Talking NAVIGATION since like 2 or 4 yrs ago. Apple just now got it! And now all iPhone users say, Oh, my Nav Talks now! What da heck!- Google Maps ROCK. Traffic is fast. Navigation has SATELLITE VIEW option so it shows LANDSCAPE (or BIRDS EYE) SATELLITE View while it's navigating.  AMAZING!- S Pen is so useful for editing Pics, writing stuff, etc.- That pop-up video player ROCKS!- Note 10.1 does not look as nice as iPad. I don't like the plastic. I hope Samsung release metal models. Apple still reign on design, I think.- Note 10.1 Battery seems to run out faster. But then again, I use Note 10.1 a lot more than my iPad 2. And I know GPS radio uses more power (again iPad WiFi model do NOT have GPS radio; bring swimming trunks).Anyways, these are just my own thoughts and opinion. I know i sound like i really love the Note 10.1 a lot more than my iPad 2. I hope I did not offend anyone on this review.

If you are someone who takes a lot of handwritten notes, LectureNotes is a cheap app in the Play Store that was designed to really make use of the stylus, and it is head and shoulders above S-Note--plus absolute palm rejection (a must for us lefties!). I also recommend getting the Galaxy Note Genuine Wacom Touch Pen 8pi Stylus (ET-S200EBEG) - Black or another full-sized stylus rather than using the short one that comes with the tablet as it will make it much more natural and comfortable to write (I added a pencil pillow with a slot cut out for the side button to mine because I grip too hard). I'm a PhD student, and the Note + LectureNotes has completely transformed how I brainstorm and keep notes, both for research and for professional meetings. As someone who \"thinks\" in longhand, this is THE device I had been waiting for.In terms of other features:Multi-screen: Multi-screen functionality is very useful, and I can't imagine trying to really use a tablet for work purposes without being able to multi-screen.Space: The 50 gigs of Dropbox space makes file sharing across devices and offices a breeze. Even though I only have the 16gig, I haven't even needed to add a microSD card for extra space since everything is kept in the cloud.Battery: With casual use, the battery lasts two-three days on a single charge.

Berry", "ReviewID": "R3REXZALNXFPQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really a 4.5 star rating. I've had this tablet for over a year, so it's gotten a full workout. The primary uses for me are keeping a hand-written journal and use as a portable art pad, so having a wacom pen, the same technology I use at my desktop for professional graphics work, was a must. Then Wacom came out with their own pen for the Galaxy Note, the Bamboo Feel. It's full size, more responsive, looks and feels great in the hand, and I use it most of the time.I started the journal using Samsung's S-note app but had problems saving files--some files disappeared for reasons I still have not discovered, and I lost about six weeks of journal, hence the half star deduction from the rating. I solved that issue by exporting every day's entries to Dropbox as both .snb and PDF files. Eventually, I switched to using Papyrus, a vector based app that allows for a thinner pen line than S-note's thinnest .5mm. Papyrus also allows export to PDF, but because it's vector-based, it's a cleaner file that prints more crisply than S-note's jpg PDF export. I can also open a Papyrus PDF page in Adobe Illustrator on my desktop for further modification of the vectors beyond what can be done in Papyrus.For artwork I like the Sketchbook Pro app best. It has an abundance of brushes and allows layers. It also can export a PSD file that keeps the layers intact so further work can be done in PhotoShop or Painter on my desktop.At first I was concerned about the screen resolution, but it's very sharp and bright and has not been an issue. It's good to see that the new model has doubled the resolution, but this will do fine for a few years before upgrading.All in all, I'm very pleased with this tablet.

Now I got a 32gb memory stick that can hold all my music and movies I want to carry with. The pen is such a cool stuff for taking notes, It helps u take out your creative side and play with it.I was a little bit worried about what people said about the screen, because everybody cries saying that 1200x800 px isn't good enough and that u can't see anything and that your eyes are gonna get hurt with that screen resolution. I say all that is ****. I lock at the screen closely and I can't find a single detail blurry or otherwise different that I would see it on my 1900x1200 laptop. Its all about marketing.I was between this and the nexus 10 which is a great tablet with a gorgeous screen but I decided to buy this one because It can do so muuch more than any other tablet in the market right now and that is much more important to me than a beautiful screen. Starting with the multitasking that is awesome for checking email and web browsing, looking at a youtube video or a video of your gallery. You can take notes and screenshots and easily edit them for sending to a friend.

It is also not innovating as much now and not giving people what they want - bigger screens and meaningful upgrades.So I switched and got the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because it was on sale for $50 off and I got it in 1 day shipping thanks to Amazon.The unit is beautiful - light and the white is nice. It is actually too slick. So I bought a Poetic cover as well. There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card. I also upgraded the OS to 4.1.2 as of now (one thing to note is if you get an error - firmware was modified outside and so no updates will be possible, then you need to remove the SD card and retry and it will be fine. Bug in HW check coding).The screen resolution is lower and it sometimes shows but it is more than adequate. The unit came charged thankfully. With moderate use, I lost about 24% a day - one netflix movie, browsing, emails etc. about 3 hours used.On standby it seems to lose about 15% a day. So the battery life is more than adequate. We may need charging every 3 days or so.The unit is blazing fast. The quad core really shows here. Everything is super zippy. With 2GB memory, you can easily launch like 10 apps at a time and also it can truly multitask (only approved apps) so you can have more apps running at same time if you choose.The swype keyboard is brilliant as is the S-Voice. However, some output seems wrong. I asked \"how far is Canada from United States\" and it said \"1530 miles\" or something which is a head scratcher.The S-pen is just brilliant. Handwriting to sketching to jotting notes. Simply brilliant. You will need to buy more apps to fully leverage its power though. The samsung store/play store is good as well.The screen is crisp and clear but I can tell the iPad is sharper and crispier and seems more \"vibrant\" and HD sharp than this one.Overall, this seems like a much better buy than an iPad. However, if people would want an iPad, I would say it is still worth it for its better screen resolution and intuitiveness.

I'm commented on the Asus Transformer Prime, Tab, Tab 2, etc.  Well, I was quite disappointed with all of them, even this Note 10.1.  I had some issues where I was going to return this item soon.  THEN ... notification that the Note 10.1 has a software update to Jelly Bean 4.1x.  I've only had this software update less then a week and I'm enjoying this tablet a lot more.  Autocorrection of text is not overbearing anymore.  Moving the virtual keypad is a lot easier instead of two finger swipes that may or may not accomplish the desired task.  Entering text, sometimes with the former version of Android had the cursor on top of the character which was crazy.  My tablet with the again former version of Android for some reason turned of (standby) the tablet.  I know when I would hit the off button or when it times out, but not within 3 to 5 seconds of using the stylus pen.  Though this tablet is a little heavy, I would still prefer a lighter tablet.  I'm really looking into the Note 8 that's suppose to be announced next week and I would give that a try.  I believe with Jellybean 4.1x that Android has probably stablized though I will continue to monitor the \"turning off\"  thing.  But what if the \"turning off\" thing still occurs after the return policy with Christmas gifts has expired?  I've seen this issue with the Asus.. and they addressed it with a software upgrade.  Things I wish for: Mini HDMI port, USB port.  What also makes a difference is a leather case for this device.  I actually can't wait  for the Note 8.  I hope this helps anyone making a decision.

So no i am not an expert that is going to go into extreme detail about all the technical stuff but i do a lot of research on tablets and a lot of technology so yes im an average person but most people that will buy this are probably like me. So here is what i think:This tablet is amazing at what it can do! I use it for school so ill try to limit it to that.  I use it mainly for notes which is great because the s pen is so precise and it has a lot of writing options: different colors, different writing utensils, different sizes. It is just great. It is also easy to organize notes because they save it in a format similar to a windows computer (folders, files, etc).  They also have a function to draw perfect shapes, to put in text, and others. But what i think is the coolest is the function one, you tap the icon then write a function and hit search and it will bring up multiscreen with the browser and give you all sorts of information on the function.(derivitaves, graphs, alternate forms, and a lot more). So this brings us up to multiscreen.The multiscreen function is also great for school. People arent very fond of the fact that there is only polaris office, email, gallery, video player, s note and browser to use but dont be so greedy because it is great! You can takes notes on something from the internet very quickly, once i get word documents on it i will use that to take notes, so it really comes in handy.I also would like to mention that my teachers sometimes give me printed off notes. This is a problem right?.... Nope! Download the app camscanner (its free!!) And you can take a picture of the paper and you can turn it into something that looks like a word document! It isnt perfect but usuable and readable, i truly am amazed by that app.Something not school related, the smart remote feature is very very easy to set up and helpful, i wont go too far with it but it is definately a plus! Well there isnt much more i need to talk about because i love everything about it... except it does lag a little bit sometimes which i can deal with but  i know that when i get android 4.2 on it that it will be better so im not worried. And also i am making my friends jealous with this and now they want one (they also say its better than an ipad).SUMMARY:This is an extremely productive tablet that could be used for school or a business or anything that involves paper and other places that need to be more productive. I highly recommend it to students for its ability to take notes, both given to you and hand written notes. It has an awesome function ability to help with upper level math.

Was it the end all be all, no but it left not much to complain about.  This holiday season I had the opportunity to upgrade and holy smokes, let me tell you what a great idea it was.  This tablet is sexy and sleek.  The motions are so fluid and I haven't even received the new software update which is suppose to make it even more smoother.  The S Pen is very impressive.  Its lightweight with a small rounded tip that gives you crazy precision. The S Pen tucks away into the bottom right corner of the tablet and it was designed so carefully, you can barely tell it is even supposed to come out. It is by far the most precise pen/stylus I have used so far.  Very happy with that.  It also has a ton of new features I haven't even begun to unravel but the Photoshop Touch app was done smartly and I see myself getting a lot of use out of it.  One of the biggest bonuses is Micro SD slot allows me to never have to worry about running out of space again.  How sweet it is.  Oh I must say that the multiscreen feature was what I had been waiting for from a productivity standpoint for a long time and it delivered pretty well.  Its a little buggy when using Polaris Office and the web browser.  It continues to crash on me but all the other multiscreens work great.  S Note and S Planner are reasons to by the tablet by itself.  Talk about a seriously thought out integration of note taking with calendar planning and synchronization.  I have been able to sync my work, home and Google up with no problem at all.

Been waiting for a tablet to come out that has real artist/designer sensitive drawing capacity. This tablet does, but the drawing pen has so many variable to learn to use I recommend putting aside at least 7 - 10 hours to really learn all it does. You can get very good results with pen. For first 3 days I was disappointing with pen results until I learn to push as hard as I would with a mechanical pencil using a #2 HB lead. Harder than you think you should. After that I got the graduated scales of grey and ability to gain depth of pen stroke that I was hoping to get out of a touch sensitive pen vs the regular tablet interface. Overall, if I work it, I can get very good drawings out of tablet....near artist quality like pen and ink or pencil grey scale. You will not be producing large scale on art on this small tablet screen, but for the doodler/artist it's good enough.Have not used the Photoshop feature much, so will not comment on photo editing. As I stated above, I was most interested in tablet for drawing capacity.As to using the pen as part of the software to annotate photos to attach to email etc.., it's easy to use. Not as much software out yet that takes advantage of drawing capacity, but device comes with enough software to do anything you would want to do. Results are equivalent to a sharpie marker.I find that I would rather type notes than use pen. So for me the pen is not that big of a deal for normal everyday operations.Rest of tablet features are like any Android. Plays back movies better than most and speakers front facing are better than the side ones I had on my Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus or the back ones on my Ipad 2 (which the carrying case covers).Quality of screen resolution is really really nice.I don't know why some reviews talk about flimsy build. Seem very sturdy to me. More than most tablets. Battery life is great.I would buy again.UPDATE 11-7-2012...............GREAT ABILITY TO CORRECT DRAWINGS........ Three things about using tablet for sketching ...1> I use the split screen function of tablet and have photo on one side and draw on other side.Small space but OK as can enlarge specific sections.2> Drawing on glass is strange. No grab like paper does to pen or pencil. I miss that feel.3> With real paper and pen or ink, it's hard to erase and if you work sketch much the paper becomes torn or smudged. WITH TABLET THE ERASING IS SIMPLE AND COMPLETE. I MEAN REALLY COMPLETE. I have produced better finished sketches because of this feature. A lot better. I can go and clean up all the over drawn lines with the erase feature and it erases at the same fine detail that pen draws at. Completely adjustable.  Making the pen and ink drawings flawless. The \"undo\" feature is also great for cleaning up drawing.All I can say is that drawing on tablet is different. I would never have considered that the ease of erasing and correcting would be such a great feature.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "zeeadarling", "ReviewID": "R3VG0GDTST3VL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me: I'm a 22 year old female. I'm an artist and I work 2 jobs where I am on the go a lot.  The note is a big help because I have nice little piece of technology to store ideas & checklists and check important emails with. I have had this tablet for about 4 weeks now.I bought this tablet because I was looking for a digital graphics tablet that was portable.  Originally I was seeing only tablets that were specifically for drawing and worked in addition to a computer. I wanted something thin, portable and easy to use.Main things I like and use it for:-Drawing out ideas with the pen and saving them to different folders to organize-Writing To Do Lists and ideas in my own hand writing. I like having them all in one place and not having to carry around folders and sketch books that will eventually fray and have pages fall out.-Surfing the internet away from home.- Checking balances and paying bills.-It has a nice map & navigation feature but I don't think either can work without internet connection, which is a downfall because if you're on the road and don't have it then it's useless.-I like planning with my calendar that comes with it, but I may try to find a different calendar app that let's me write with the pen and put little pictures on it to spruce it up.-Taking webcam pics daily and using the back camera to take pictures of my home cooked meals or quick snaps of things I made.-Reading. It comes with Nook. But what I am disappointed about with that is that it doesn't have every book that I want to read! You would think they would have everything. Kindle has a lending library that I wish Nook had something similar so I could check that out.A note about surfing the internet- It has a mobile view that has the more simplistic layout of websites for faster surfing, but you can also switch to desktop view to see the page in full like on a regular computer which is a great feature!So far it has served its purpose with very few glitches.  Lately I have been experiencing a glitch where the internet won't close out when I hit the x. Hopefully that will go away, it's not that big of an issue.The biggest issue I realized with it, is that flash is not supported on it.  This means that if there are games you want to play on a website or anything that supports flash and even videos you try to watch (not through the youtube app), you will be unable to see it.  The Note does come with a youtube & Netflix app so you can watch anything through it.  I would like for this device to support the Direct tv for mobile devices so I can watch normal programs through it too. That would be perfect!I really hope that in the future there will be drawing apps specifically for this tablet.  I have drawn a few things now with it on Snote [which is really just for ideas and sketches] and I am adjusting to its features.  What I am really hoping for is maybe a Photoshop type of app that you can do different layers with your artwork and add on masks and filters etc.  The ideal app would have what I just mentioned plus an array of brushes and tools where you can adjust pressure/lightness, smudge, sharpen and lighten/darken tools, and the feature where only your pen reacts to it. Because it's an issue when you're trying to draw but it's also registering your hand at the same time and the page will try to scroll or zoom.So far this has worked really great for my needs and I hope that there will be some advances that I can benefit from in the future. I want this product to take artwork a little more seriously and be able to run apps that have in depth drawing features.The Note becomes really comfortable and easy to use once you have a case for it.

Apple does a heck of a good job but I am usually an alternative shopper.  I bought the Note after a lot of comparing and some experience with android, I chose android for the common reason of apple users complaint of no internal storage options in the ipad, speaker location (volune and non-stereo), and apples pricing structures.  The Android system is sufficient in their software for my needs and I do like the idea of an open application market.  Now for the Samsung note tablet, I did not want to buy a prodect that was inferior to the new ipad and the price comparisons are both a bit pricey however that is what the market is, the Note is in line for price when compared to other products of this power and features (I looked hard at this).  I have had the Note for three weeks, the installed software meet my needs (impressed with the pri-installed word processer) and added some free apps, the screens are nice and easy to  personalise and make me feel at home, I don't seem to notice the lower resolution (1200 x 800 I think?) other people comment on although you can tell a slight difference if you compare very close but the color and smoothness of the overall display seem to negate the difference.  I have the 32gb version and am glad I went that way although I don't know that the 16gb model would be much of a problem because the 32gb micro sd card I have installed works flawlessly.  \"Overall\" I see no down side with this unit (wifi only), its quick, I like the processor and 2gb on board processer setup which is probably why its so quick.  Battery life is what they say it is, the 10.1\" screen makes it bulky compared to a 7\" (I also have a 7\" kindle fire) but the extra bulk soon makes up for its size in ease of use along with easy on the eye.  I like having a 7\" and 10\" option but the premium experience is the 10\" Note.  The Note does not hang up or act wierd, the good sound and speaker position is the plus they say it is, the kindle fire HD has a bit better sound and volume but the Note is a reasonable second and a no contest in head to head features of the note.  I agree with the more common view that the kindle fire is very good a streaming media experience but its use stops there, if you want to do much more than that the Note has gobs of more potential.  I like my old Kindle Fire and Fire HD, what would I do if stuck with only one? Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Table is my recomendation and I havn't even explored the \"pen\" features.  I play a lot of media on the Note, it does a great job and when I want to do more its all right in my hands.

Hardware: many people complain about the built quality of this tablet, I don't find anything wrong with it, I think its a good plastic (it doesn't bend unless you push it hard) and once you have it, you don't even notice it.2. Software: I also own a transformer prime and the iPad 3 ( I gave the iPad to my nephew after I bought the note 10.1). The transformer crashes all the time even with the official jelly bean. This tablet is the best I've ever had, it's very smooth, not laggy at all and most important apps and browser don't crash. I hope I will get the same features as the galaxy note 2 when it gets jelly bean ( If you don't know what I'm taking about check out some YouTube videos and you will see the awesomeness of the note 2).3. The S pen: To me it feels better than writing on a piece of paper, its very responsive with more than 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity. I'm a college student so I use it in the classroom all the time, I only buy e-books so I dont have to carry around heavy textbooks, ebooks are  by far cheaper than textbooks.

Worth noting also is that I was an owner of the new iPad.To sum up my review ahead: 20 days after my infinity arrived, the results are in: I kept the Note 10.1 and returned the infinity.Granted, the Infinity has a higher resolution screen (as does iPad 3) so it makes everything look sharp, but it loses on every other front. Persistent lag issues, quality control problems (I actually exchanged the Infinity 3 times before finally getting one that was \"okay\"), lag again, light bleeding, etc.The Note has absolutely no hardware problems. The S Pen is fantastic. The interface is the only OEM android skin that I actually like. The tablet is smooth and beautiful - I have come to prefer plastic over metal (both have its (dis)advantages though). The sounds on this thing is fantastic too.

Out of those tablets I've used in the past, the iPad came close to being my main device to manage an infrastructure when I'm away but still wasn't a true \"multi-tasking\" device.And then I saw this device and heard and seen the capabilities and I can see myself connected to my email and having my browser up and running on the other end and managing my servers through the browser. Now I didn't get the Note 10.1 from Amazon but through my Vendor but thought I would share my experience anyways.One thing that was a flaw from the moment I opened and turned it on is that my screen had a pretty decent size of a cluster of dead pixels. So I'll be exchanging it immediately. I did think about getting the Asus Infinity TF700 but was hearing LOTS of flaws and Quality of the design.  So hopefully my Note is just a small flaw and a replacement isn't going to have the same problem, otherwise the device is very speedy and with 2GB of Ram, should be some sort of future proof.I would definitely consider and recommend this product to anyone who are multi-task.

I decided to go to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as I have as of late enjoyed the android interface much more than the simplicity and lack of design Apple puts out.  To be honest, the sanctions against the first tab provoked me to buy it.  I figured it must piss off Apple enough to some degree so I thought it must be pretty good. I couldn't imagine they would go to court over garbage.The tab 2 was nice, but was lacking in hardware so after a few months I upgraded to this one, the Note 10.1I did quickly notice a performance boost as well as improved useability as for the smoothness of the interface.  Things feel less clunky than with the Tab 2.Overall it is very similar; primarily hardware boosted.  I do like the new styllus abilities as well as the opportunity to multi screen.  It doesn't compare to my desktop and 3 large monitors, but it's still nice to have.The device feels a little fragile.  I am terrified of it falling on accident and breaking open.  That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.  The backside of the Note seems to have a slight bump in the middle, as if whatever it is inside was to big for the back panel to go on firmly without resistanct.  Not a big deal in my mind, but not ideal either.My ending conclusiong for my brief review is that the Galaxy Note is a very nice tablet.  My only real complaint is the inability to find a nice case for it; everything I find seems to be cheap and/or garbage.It runs nicely, has a pretty good battery 5+ hours, and is pleasant on the eyes aesthetically and resolution wise.I would recommend this as a very good alternative to the iPad.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great piece of hardware, but lacks software", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "ROUBUMLW1WO2R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The good:I love the S-Pen and the precision with which the software recognizes my handwriting.The Split Screen functionality is cool.Being able to make handwritten notes on PDF's and DOCX files is one of the main reasons I bought the tablet, and the tablet works well for this.  I tested out my friend's IPAD (not sure what version) and his device's ability to recognize my writing doesn't even come close to the accuracy exemplified by the Galaxy Note.The bad:No Flash support.  Thus, I cannot watch Amazon Prime TV/Movies, nor can I access some of the other web pages I frequent.  This was one advantage over the IPAD I greatly looked forward to, but Flash is not available on this device.*Update October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.  I tried downloading a release of flash from the Adobe site that was supposed to work with Ice Cream Sandwich (the factory install) but couldn't install it.  One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).  And, what is worse, in order to keep the flash player working, I had to disable the automatic updates for the device.  I had the unfortunate luck of waking up one morning with the tablet telling me it had updated the software, and after this happened no amount of work I could do would get the flash player working again.  So, I restored to factory settings and have not agreed to the TOS of the software update, and my flash player has continued working.MULTISCREEN:The multiscreen option of the tablet is neat, but it has two major drawbacks.  One:  you can only have one window of each of the compatible programs open at a time (so, you can't have two Polaris office items open at once) and there are relatively few programs that are compatible with the multiscreen.  Being able to have class notes open in one window and e-mail open in another is nice.  I can open a PDF with polaris office (although  the PDF reader doesn't have near the quality of interaction with the Spen as the Document reader) and have a google document open with the web browser, but this isn't ideal.  It would be nice to have Adobe and Polaris going at the same time, but this cannot be done yet.Of course, it is easy to switch between active programs, and both Polaris and Adobe remember where you left off, so once I was used to navigating the android device switching between applications wasn't too bad.  Not as good as Alt+Tab, but a close secondBLUETOOTH KEYBOARDI think a bluetooth keyboard is a must.  I have the logitech keyboard/case which is designed for the galaxy tab w/o the SPEN (This was a buying mistake on my end) and it works great with what I have, even if not the way I had originally envisioned.  Until I discovered the \"Null Keyboard\" app, I wasn't happy with the interaction between the two devices because the on-screen keyboard would pop up whenever I tapped a text box.  Now, I can't see working on the tab w/o the external keyboard.AS IT NOW STANDS I am much happier with the device, but still think that the software could be developed more.  I am close to upgrading my rating to 4 stars, but until the flash issue is worked out (or the sites I use release an android app) I am more inclined to leave my rating where it is.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Totally pleased", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Algomoar\"", "ReviewID": "R1KP5CVCDH8IYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that it is my first tablet, but is totally awesome, is fast, some online reviews talk about the plastic cover (I don't care about it) and about the screen resolution (true is low, but is just like my first laptop), but let's be honest, if I would like to see something on HD, I would have used my TV (not even my laptop).

The sensitivity of the pen continually changes. Some of the time it will select the link you are trying to open in a web browser and the other times it will select another link close to the tip because it's not tracking correctly.

Im pleased with it for the most part but there are things that really irritate me about this tablet. Here they are:1. The microphone for the tablet is located at the bottom where the charging port is. Very annoying. When I skype with friends and family they tell me that my voice sounds \"muffled\". The only way they can hear me clearly is if I hold the tablet, which brings me to my next problem.2. I bought a little case for the tablet which props it up so I dont have to hold it. I really love the case but when the tablet sits up right the microphone is covered. When it lays flat no one can see me. When I turn it sideways so it is in portrait mode the person in which I am skyping cuts in half. I dont know if that is a tablet thing or a skype app thing but the tablet doesnt adjust to the change. When it is upside down (camera at the bottom, microphone at the top) it works but then whoever im skyping with is practically looking up my nose. I dont like it.3. The battery runs down even when Im not using it. When I had my ipad I could turn it off and leave it for a couple of days and the battery would barely go down. This tablet acts more like a computer (I have to shut it down every night or when I'm not using it)4. The tablet comes preloaded with roughly 1GB of apps I DONT WANT!! There is no way to delete them unless you \"root\" your tablet (I looked on YouTube for how to do it and it's a process. Not to mention the damage that could be caused if a mistake is made)5. I specifically wanted this tablet because I thought it would be very useful for school (I'm a junior in college). I really like taking notes my tablet but I'm irritated by the lack of printing options. There aren't any! When I tried to print my boarding pass it gave me an error saying \"Can only print using a Samsung Printer\". Seriously??? This tablet brand new costs almost as much as a new ipad and I'm restricted to only using a Samsung printer? I'm very unhappy about that.6. When watching a review about the tablet I saw that you can hand gesture and the keyboard splits in half. I can't get mine to do it. I have tried over and over. It just doesn't work for me.In the long run I like the tablet. I'm not a very picky person and I can look past these defects since it was a gift.

Prior to that I had played with one for about a week and a half, and I knew this was the tablet for me. I absolutely LOVE it. Writing with the S-Pen is smooth and enjoyable. It's also very enjoyable to use the pen instead of the finger on the touch screen and for typing on the touch-screen keyboard. However, for extended typing, a bluetooth keyboard would probably be better. All in all, I absolutely love this tablet. Google Now is creepily accurate and innovative, and I'm enjoying getting used to the other features. I chose to write this review because when I was considering what tablet to purchase, reviews were a big factor in my decision (then the decision was made for me). I chose to stick with the 10.1\" model rather than the newer 8\" model because I like the bigger screen size, it allows much more room for S-Pen input, and because the 10.1\" model comes with Photoshop Touch pre-installed. The 8\" does not. The 10.1\" also has the same software update as the 8\", so it's essentially the same thing, only bigger. The price is definitely on the high end of tablets, but ultimately you have to consider what it is you're looking for. This is the first tablet I've owned, but I've done a considerable amount of research, and this tablet is the best on the market for stylus input and handwriting recognition.

The Note had good reviews and I liked the fact that it had the stylus so I decided to take a chance on it. BEST DECISION EVER! This tablet is very powerful. I hardly ever use my laptop anymore. I can do everything on the Note. It's great for taking notes, watching Netflix, browsing the web, etc. Streaming Netflix was impossible from my last device and with this one it's no problem. I also have to read a lot of papers for school and it's easy for me to download the PDF and write my notes directly on the PDF and save them, allowing me to skip printing all together.

But then my inner tech-geek started to yearn for one. They're small, they're easy to just stuff in your bag, brining with you loads of entertainment and utilities all the time. Being a university student I used to bring my Macbook to school for taking notes. It was heavy and clumsy.Bringing the Note along is so easy and it doesn't weight anything. In fact, I never leave home without it now.The primary use I had in mind for it was note-taking during lectures and classes. It offers a wide variety for doing so just with with the tools that is already installed on the tablet. You can freehand with the pen, you can have your handwriting translated into text, and you can write as if on a computer.A bonus is that it offers a variety of drawing apps for when I get dead bored in school. Doodling is more fun, and so easy with the tablet!It has become my saviour during my all-in-all 2 hour trip to school and back home. It's easy to just dig it out from your bag and start watching films, the screen is nice with good colours and clarity, or read a book. There is apps out there that's really good both for films and reading. I started to read solely on this tablet, abandoning my Sony e-reader because the tablet had better app-utilities for reading (stuff that the new Kindle Paperwhite have so I'm going to give that one a try now).All in all, I use it far more than I ever thought I would, and to do various tasks and for enjoyment. The battery life is good and quite normal. When using it sparsely it lasts for days. When using it more heavily it can lasts for about 2 days with no problem.It has given me my money's worth and I'm pleased with it.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the features", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2CQK8FDDHAJPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say the features on this are so amazing.I love the Snote feature, the photoshop and overall the performance of this tablet is perfect for a student like me", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "All great, but can't open many e-mails\" not designed for mobile device\"", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2C3GIPRVW4QKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All great, but can't open many e-mails\" not designed for mobile device\"Otherwise works just like my Galaxy phone.

It brings you so many options.  I use it in almost every aspect of my life.  It is my alarm clock, I get the current weather in the mornings.

Besides my 9 to 5 job, I teach bible study on a regular basis and I love the note taking features and varied bible apps.  I am also over a youth group, and an administrator at my local church.  My Samsung tablet allows me to communicate with multiple groups on multipe projects and stay organized and current.  And now that I've started working out, I love my playlist of workout songs I have on my tablet.

In fact I hardly use my laptop except for work. There are so many applications that are available via Android that its hard to decide what to install. Most of the applications are free on Google play, but use caution when downloading and doing so since it will eventually fill up you internal storage capacity. I did purchased an additional 64 sd card for it and it stores so much more now.I strongly recommend the additional 64 Gig memory module, unless your going to get the ATIV which is a whole different concept. Since that has a windows 8 operating system and its not Android. I also recommend that you buy an additional power supply so that you can have a spare is case you misplace or damage the one it comes with also you will need an attachment for reading an external USB device. It does read flash drives with the attachment but it wont read my External Passport 2 Terabyte HDD. I am considering buying a Seagate Bluetooth 1 terabyte HDD since it will detect Bluetooth and not need any USB cord to connect it to the my tab device.I do like the slick lines and design that this Tab has.

I check email, look at pinterest/facebook, and do some reading. I also listen to music quite a bit from amazon cloud and pandora.I probably would've been fine with a cheaper tablet, but my husband and I felt like if we were going to spend the money, we may as well make a good investment the first time. We did a lot of research and chose the galaxy note. I love it. The final selling point fornus was the sd card capability. I can put my kids movies on an sd card instead of having to take up space on the tab. Not a big deal for some, but I liked that.The camera is awesome too. Sound is great.

I'm fine with a plastic body so long as it feels sturdy, but this tablet doesn't. The leather case I bought with it gives me piece of mind about having it in my backpack. I wouldn't trust it without a case. I've had 2 samsung phones and a tablet of theirs, the quality was much higher.It's been great for school. I have to read a ton of pdfs and MS word docs. The general productivity is good. I noticed many apps don't interact well with windowed viewing. They open fine but when you resize them the content won't rescale. I would like if it remembered the resizing for each app.S-pen isn't as functional as I'd like. It is very precise for altering/highlighting document, and I'm sure if I did any graphics it would shine. I do prefer papyrus beta over snote, it's just a more realistic replacement for pen and paper. I do enjoy Snotes formula feature very much.Gaming  wise it's a beast. I've bought and played a few games that have high end tablet graphics and they play great. The only time there is lag is when high detail water is rendered in a game like wild blood.The form factor is top notch. Everything feels like it's where it should be.

Although the display is colorful and vivid, the resolution lags other tablets in this price class like the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the iPad (3rd Gen).  While I like this tablet, there are many pros and cons to consider.Pros:Speakers: Stereo speakers which face the user make this the best sounding tablet by far!Display: Vivid and colorful IPS LCD screen with no light-bleeding at the edgesS-Pen:  Stylus based on WACOM tech is far more accurate and versatile than capacitive based pens on standard touch screens which adds things such as pressure sensitivity and proximity awareness.  The handwriting recognition tech works remarkably well, but you have to be patient and careful in practice.Features and Customization:  Samsung's TouchWiz UX brings a ton of features and customization, including side-by-side windowing and a pop-out video player.Design: The tablet feels very comfortable in the hand with nice rounded edges.  I also like the two-tone white and silver plastics, the white in particular has a nice pearlescent finish.Specs: Some impressive internal specs with 2GBs of RAMCons:Display: Screen resolution is very low compared to the competition which makes this poor for reading text.Construction: All plastic construction which creeks and flexes to a small degree.Performance: Despite it's impressive specs, the tablet is noticeably laggy in all aspects of its operation.  The complexity of TouchWiz and the variety of features contribute to this problem and might be cured with future updates (Jelly Bean).Camera:  The camera records video in 720p instead of 1080p, and takes mediocre stills.  Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "SD card not properly used.", "Author": "Dr.Z", "ReviewID": "R3OSW2EA4QTOX7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Warning...

Quite smooth processing, GPS is very nice. Multitasking is well-thought. But I don't think that the NOTE app that comes with the tablet is useful for people basically looking for advanced note taking features. My main dislike of its note-taking features is caused by the handwriting to text conversion (dis)abilities of the NOTE app.I am a PhD student in History and I take written notes from my readings and archival documents. So I was for a long time looking for a good device that can properly convert what is written into digital text in an organized manner. I watched various videos of Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet in use and it didn't seem bad to me in general. Yet I had some reservations with the general performance of the device so I waited with the hope that stylus technologies and software will improve and a better device will come out soon. When I first heard about Samsung Note 10.1 thought that this would be the one and got excited though it is more expensive than Lenovo. And purchased it immediately. But I am really disappointed with its note-taking capabilities (My wife disliked it more than I did). I am not a well versed person in technical issues and I don't have much information about tablets and note taking technology but I think I know what will be a satisfying device for my needs and for people who are looking for a convenient and user friendly note-taking tablet.So I think the software on Samsung Note 10.1 is really poor except for everyday simple note-taking tasks like preparing to-do lists or taking very quick, casual notes. It even makes your casual notes more casual when it converts them to digital text. Very annoying.I think that Lenovo does a better job in note-taking -especially in converting the handwriting to text- as far as I understand from the videos I watched about Lenovo and from my experience with Samsung Note 10.1.Samsung Note 10.1 recognizes your handwriting well and converts it to text rightly most of the times. (Indeed my wife also complained about the errors in conversion; my handwriting is better, so it performs enough overall with my handwriting). I don't find writing very uncomfortable but not very enjoyable too. You cannot get the feeling of writing on a paper and do get a sense of plasticity. This might be a common situation with note taking on tablets though.It is also a little bit sloppy in displaying what you write. There is sometimes a slight lag in instantly showing what you write. It occasionally cannot respond well to your writing and misses some parts of what you scribe, especially if it is small in size.I mostly get pleasure from writing with a pen on paper. I understand the limits of writing on a tablet and don't set my standards so high and don't expect a similar performance from writing on a tablet with writing on a paper. But I don't feel that writing takes place with ease on this tablet. My handwriting looks worse than it actually is and I cannot write smoothly and small enough. Writing small is important with this device because the converted text ends where your handwriting ends, so I was trying to write smaller to put as much words as possible in one line to get more organized final text. Though I didn't had the best experience when writing, I could bear it if the software had performed satisfactorily.But I think the main problem starts when the NOTE application converts what is written. It is not very easy to correct or delete what is written. First of all, the wait time before conversion when you ceased writing is not long enough - at least for me (I don't know if there is a setting to lag this time). So it gives you little thinking time while writing and puts you into discomfort since you cannot write when it is converting. Sometimes you try to continue writing after a short break for thinking and what you write cannot be displayed. This can be a problem if you are writing fast without looking at the screen; for example in the classroom.The worse thing is when NOTE app converts a second group of words after pausing writing, the first word of what you write anew joins \"without any space\" the last word of what is written before. You have to push the space button first on the top menu before you continue to write. This surely disrupts a continuous writing experience, especially considering its short waiting time before conversion. You cannot immediately start writing where you left as in natural writing.And you have to press \"enter\" to go to the next line when you go on to write after pausing, which nonetheless makes sense.But my main frustration is with its inadequacy of aligning the converted text. It actually creates a box of text when you start writing. If you want to write to somewhere else you have to create another box (paragraph) by pushing a specific button on the top menu. And I didn't like the way these boxes work. Managing them is quite cumbersome.When you are writing in a box, if you start writing in the next line it will convert your writings to the next line. This is good but the biggest issue here is when you arrive at the end of the line with your handwriting and go on to write without pause in the next line, the text will start in the next line although it has a lot of space till the end in digital format. So you won't get formated lines but irregularly short and long lines. It looks like what sometimes happens when you convert a PDF document to Word. And when you stop writing in the selected box the size of the box is determined by the size of the longest line, which means if you write a long set of text your box will extend as a long vertical box. It looks weird and irregular with other boxes with different width. I tried to write smaller so that the box would be wider but my handwriting wasn't small enough to put more words than the preset font of the digital text. And I couldn't find a way to set the font size (maybe there is, I am open to suggestions). I think Lenovo Thinkpad, actually MyScript Notes Mobile app, makes a better job in this respect, because it continues to add words to the digital text until the digital text arrives at the end of the line.So It is a pain to manage converted text in this tables. You have to go to the specific box you want to edit and have to arrange the lines by the left, right, enter, space or back space buttons. You cannot select a word or add one in between two words -which generally happens in the natural flow of writing- by pointing out the location with the pen but you have to scroll to that specific location by using the right and left buttons on the top. You cannot delete a word by selecting it either -or by crossing it out as in Lenovo thinkpad. These are some of the quite inconvenient and clumsy features of the software. There are a lot like these. In sum, you cannot correct mistakes occurred during writing or during conversion to text when you are taking fast notes, for example whilst listening to someone. You cannot immediately interfere in a previously written section of the text. It will also take a lot of time to adjust the lines if you want to do so after you finish writing. So it is weird that it is a lot faster to type with your keyboard on your computer than writing with your hand on this device.Good thing is if you pause and continue writing, you can write anywhere and it will convert the text where you left but you have to put a space before you start as I said.If you want to write to somewhere else you have to open a new box from the top menu. You can change the size of the boxes but the text does not adjust to the new size, so you cannot widen the text as you wish. You have to go to the beginning of each line and press back space button on the top to adjust lines.What is also ridiculous about Note app is that you cannot go back and convert a selected section of handwritten -unconverted- text you wrote on Notes. Adding such an option could save some time and partially compensate for mentioned shortcomings of the Notes app because writing on handwriting mode without instant conversion is more comfortable. This shortcoming finally made me realize that this thing is not intended for well-organized, professional note-taking purposes.In sum, formatting and editing are really bad in this application. It even looks amateurish. I don't know if this device brings a good standard for the current tablets and note-taking software  technology so far but I don't think that the software for note-taking and especially for text conversion in this device will satisfy a common group of users who have expectations other than simple entertainment and very simplistic note-taking tasks.To say the least, this device is far from being user friendly, functional and effective, considering that you spend a lot of time to put it into work and cannot get half the results you get from writing on a paper or even from typing. It doesn't seem that mentioned shortcomings are irremediable. The main issue that annoys me is that it looks like they didn't give much thought to improve program's functionality. The device does give you a clumsy and sketchy feel of use with note taking. With this device you cannot even get close to the ease of taking notes on a paper. I even doubted my ability to use the device after seeing many complimentary reviews which also caused me to purchase it in the first place. But if my experience with this device is correct, it is extremely ironic to name a device Samsung \"NOTE\" although one of the worst things it can do is providing a comfortable and effective note taking experience.Maybe I am expecting too much from this tablet with current technology. And maybe I could not make myself cognizant enough of its features. So I am open to any suggestions about using Note app more efficiently. Or I'd love to learn if the Note app is open to improvement in the short run or if there are other apps that can make better use of the potential of the tablet.I looked for other android applications for note taking and text conversion to give a last chance to this device but couldn't find a better one than MyScript Notes Mobile which I wasn't able download and install on this one.I am very disappointed with the incompetence of the software on this device for converting handwriting to text. I am still wondering if I missed a mark. I would give 2 stars if I only took the note-taking features of the device into consideration.So I will return it unless it surprises me soon for good.Nevertheless this tablet still might be a good choice for the ones who want to take note only in handwriting -without conversion- and the ones who looks mainly for drawing and photoshop features.I think it will be wise to wait for Microsoft Surface Pro, Lenovo Thinkpad 2 and especially for Ipad 4. There are news that Apple applied last year to take patent for a note-taking technology it developed. I am especially hopeful of coming iPad's competency of note-taking if it comes with it considering its retina display and its success in creating user-friendly and convenient apps. From the rumors I understand that they are trying to create a writing experience similar to one in note taking on paper. I am sure that all three will do a better job in this respect than Samsung Note 10.1.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2O1UMLTKMH0JH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I take my Samsung Galaxy Note EVERYWHERE!

I was not disappointed at all.as with most tablets, it came with a ton of pre loaded apps. 90 % of which will never be used, and you can't uninstall pre loaded apps < I hate bloat ware >.This tablet is amazing, It is very fast, and the touch screen is very responsive.The built in speakers sound very nice, I bought her external speakers for it, and she has yet to use them on it due to not needing them.The resolution is crisp, and even though its not as good as the nexus's resolution, I can't tell the difference and I am a tech nerd who pays close attention to that stuff.Movies play well, music plays well, books look very nice on it.The weight of the device is good, and the device has a heavy duty feel to it, but it is light weight at the same time.The only thing that I found annoying about it, was the fact that I can't get flash to work on it < Tried installing an older version adobe flash 11.1 but it was a no go > but this is not the tablets fault, as flash no longer supports droid devices < Thanks microsoft >.Overall, this tablet rocks, I am highly satisfied with it, and so is my mom.By the way, the only reason I was trying to put flash on it was so my mom could play her pogo on it, and pogo does have a droid app so she can play, but the amount of mobile games they have added to it is minimal < 5 games total I think > but she still enjoys the 5 games that are on it. and with it being a driod, she has enough of the market place apps to keep her busy enough.Also, this tablet didn't come with any virus protection < which shocked me because it had about 50 pre loaded apps on it > so when you get it, do yourself a favor and make sure you install one first thing.

I have a Galaxy S3, so I immediately decided a Samsung tablet would be what I purchased. I would not, however, pay $400 for it (I bought it on a lightning deal for around $340) for a few reasons.No home button - I didn't think this would bother me. Turns out, it does, and I'm glad it's something they included with the 2014 edition. If the screen goes dead, you have to press the power button, and since I have a lock on my tablet, I have to go through that again. If an app freezes (which happens occasionally, but not often) you have to use the power button instead of having a button to return you to the home screen. This is my biggest issue with this tablet.S-Pen is lacking a feature I would have liked, which would be to turn off sensing my fingers/hands/skin. I bought this tablet for note taking and drawing, but it's almost a chore because the screen constantly skips around when I try to use the S-Pen with it because my hand or wrist rests on the tablet as well. It's annoying. I know some app's allow you to turn off the sensitivity, but I shouldn't have to pay $4.99 for something to do what my tablet should.No swype. I know, I know. It's a tablet.

Battery life is doing very well. I am using it for all my lesson plans and seating charts. The handwriting input is great once you adjust to it (took me about 5 or 10 minutes), and the translation to text is quite accurate in both cursive and print. You can use OneNote which I love, and you can create a shortcut to almost anything. You can also run several windows side by side or toggle between full screen windows easily, although the installed broswer does not shrink to run side by side (I installed chrome, which does). So far most things are quite intuitive.Two minor flaws: I wish there was an easier way to go back and edit typed text, I.e. a back arrow that does not backspace. Ifyou mess up, you have to click on the place with your finger or stylus, which gets you close, but with small text having that arrow woukd be nice soyou don't have to poke 4 times to get in the precise spot. The other is that I wish it was a bit easier to move around files, pages, books in s-note.

I will also admit that I was hesitant of the purchase.  I was never a laptop person as I was uncomfortable with it on my lap while I watch the kids.This was kind of a desperation purchase as I needed something I could take outside and room to room as the kids roamed.  I looked at the ipad, galaxy 2 and the note.  My eldest daughter has the galaxy phone and I was always impressed by its performance. And knowing how I multi task my destop to the limit, I decided tge extra cas for the quad vore processor the note 10.1 has was the most likely to satisify.Satisify is a huge understatement.  This is a fabulous machine that even 4 mos later I keep finding new uses for.The processor hums along great with multiple browsers and apps running.  Switching between front and rear cameras is great on video skype one you figure out how to do it and the voice recognition software built in is outstanding.  I would easily pay full price for another of these when the time comes.A few hints.  By nature one of the first things I did was install firefox browser.  Dont bother, ff mobike is nowhere near as good as the desktop.  Get Dolphin browser and chrome, each has a few features thst make them almidt mandatory.Dolphin - as many discover,  android discontinued flash support.  If you play browser games use this.  The dolphin browser will support legacy flash plug-in that let you play browser flash games and online apps like espn fantasy football draft software.Chrome - Chrome has a great feature that magnifies smaller links and buttons.

I got the 32GB Deep Grey one.  The battery life is really great on this.I'm assuming most people get this because of the pen, if you aren't I would advise you to get the galaxy tab 2 10.1 inch.  It's pretty much the same tablet from what I understand, just no pen, and a whole lot cheaper.Now for those of you who want it for the pen...There's some pretty good apps out there for drawing and taking notes.  I'll list some of my favorites I've found so far:*Autodesk Sketchbook Pro- (Paid) I just got this app and have been experimenting with drawing in it.  The canvas sizes are preset and each have a certain amount of layers for each one.  The smallest canvas (which is still pretty big) has 18 layers, which is more than I think I will ever need.  It comes with a variety of different brushes.  I'm still exploring the brushes and figuring out everything.  People have made very beautiful art with this app, and I hope that one day I can too.  I'm pretty sure it was $4.99, you can try out the free version first to see if you like it though.*LayerPaint - (Paid) This is a pretty good app.  You can pick the size of your canvas.  It has an option to \"smooth\" your lines which is nice. It has as many layers as it can handle.  I haven't tested it, but I'm sure that's a lot.*Write  - (Free) This is a great app for taking notes. It has different paper options, like lined, grid, and others.  It uses vectors so it is clear no matter how far you scroll in or out.  The back option is really neat because you can hold your pen down on it and then a wheel will pop up and you can rotate your pen around it to go forwards or back, which is really helpful when trying to erase a word or two.  It also has an insert option that lets you make room for a word and will actually push the words down the lines.  It's really neat and I'm not sure if I explained it that well.  You can export your notes to PDF.  You can change your pen color and size and it has highlighter options as well. The only down side is that you cannot import images to your notes.* I can add more apps if anybody likes, I just got tired of typing descriptions out, but if people want to read them I'll write them.If anybody has any questions feel free to ask and I will try my best to answer!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "meesuka", "ReviewID": "R6CQ62586X682", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my Favorite Tab so I'm going to be a little bias but i did buy it and its was new awesome cam with everything, and awesomely ship.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "meesuka", "ReviewID": "R6CQ62586X682", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my Favorite Tab so I'm going to be a little bias but i did buy it and its was new awesome cam with everything, and awesomely ship.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Samantha Belfer", "ReviewID": "RN3OP22J6170C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is easy to use.

For me the two major drawbacks are that it takes very long to recharge the battery, about the same time as getting them empty, and while charging, you cannot use it. Or if you try to use it, it doesn't charge properly. The second drawback for me is (as I only have the Wifi model, so I can only access the internet via the hotspot on my mobile) that there is no USB port for quick download/upload of data for when I do not have a fast internet connection. When I first unwrapped it I could not believe it didn't have a USB port. You can buy an additional adapter but even so sometimes it would not recognize the device when I connected a USB stick.

I hoped I might be able to type formulas direct into the spreadsheet app, but you have to constantly click the formula bar, type, and click it again.

My laptop becomes cumbersome and heavy on long trips through airports and I like the fact that I don't have to get it out through security checks.It starts up quickly from the sleep mode.  Fairly good apps.The screen shot feature is simple to use and has been very helpful in saving info from the web and sharing it with others.What I don't like: The word processor app that came with it is horrible.  Slow, locks up and doesn't do much.  I found another app that works better for me.  For a while it would freeze up a lot while using the note app.  Not only would it freeze up it would lose what I was working on.  Not sure what changed, maybe it was an update from Samsung, but it seems to be working better now.One of my biggest pet peeves is you can't print from this unless you print to a Samsung printer.

Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle. It works but in my opinion, $500bucks wasted.New review:Received my refund and a brand new gorgeous grey tablet. Changed my review to reflect my new opinion. My bro has aniPad3 so wherever I mention it, I base it on my personal experience.1. I would have given this 5 stars if I got a perfect unit in the first place. Keep that in mind.2. The screen is excellent. The iPad3 is barely better. Side by side and careful scrutiny is the only way you would  know. Text is nice and crisp, HD movies look great. There has been much talk about ppi. These devices have more ppi  than most desktop monitors. So don't be bothered about IPS comparisons. The screen is fine.2.5. That said, Try the backlight bleed test from the Play Store and you will notice it does have noticeable bleeding.  Not as bad as the unit I returned, but still bleeding.3. The build quality is fine. No it doesn't feel \"cheap\" at all. I realize most Americans hate plastic. Metal is also  superior IMHO but there is nothing wrong with the plastic back. There is no creaking on this, nor was there any on  the unit I returned. Also some people said if you squeeze the back it would touch the board inside. Not true in my  experience. Bought the case from Poetic and well you can't tell what it's made of in a case...4. It is snappy. I will confess that it did slow down gradually with use. Faster once I got the last OTA update.5. The S-Pen is amazing. Handwriting recognition is >90% for me. My handwriting is fairly good though, so mileage may  vary. Bought the \"7Notes\" app and it is amazing. I also dabble in art (I'm no artist) and the S-Pen is great. I must  say, it does almost feel...comfortable, like the real thing.6. Skype is great but it is and always has been buggy for me. The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason. Skype crashes on any device I use at some point.7. The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo! I still think they could be louder on tablets but this design is a  good start.8. I dislike the proprietary dock. A standard port would have been appreciated for many reasons.9. The camera takes nice pictures. Screen shot function is also good.10. I dislike the screenshot shortcut on the menu bar. Since the last OTA, Power + VolUp also gives screenshot. I want  the option to remove that shortcut.11. Unit takes a long time to charge. Haven't timed it, but I guess maybe 3 hours.12. No issues with Wi-Fi like some people have reported.13. I want Jelly Bean. I have been to xda forums and an UNofficial Jelly Bean update is available for the 3G version.  Dev is also quiet at the moment, they are also probably waiting on JB.With all that I have said here, this is my tablet of choice for a couple reasons:1. It is gorgeous2.

I really didn't like how it didn't talk well to anything outside its snobby \"I\" circle.  However, I must admit, it is well built, feels good in your hands, looks crisp and runs super smooth.  Anyway, I decided to switch to an Android tablet given that all our phones use that OS and we're happy with it.  The choice came between the 10.1 Samsung Note and the Asus T700 Transformer.  Maybe I have more trust in the Samsung brand, I don't know, that was my first choice.  I returned it after 2 days.  It feels like a cheap piece of plastic in your hands.  No wonder BestBuy can get people to pay about 30% more just for a one year warranty addition.  They probably have to replace almost one out of every three sold, they are built so cheaply.It runs ok, but Samsung would do well to educate the potential customers as to why that stylus of theirs is so great.  I didn't have the time and the patience to search the web to find out what sets this apart.  Couldn't find much educational stylus stuff in the tablet itself.The Asus has better screen resolution(1,920 by 1,200 or (224ppi) vs. Samsung with 1,280 by 800 pixels or 149(ppi)), better processing power(1.6GHz vs 1.4GHz in the Ssamsung) and twice the memory right out of the box.  With the keyboard adapter it also has more battery, easy USB hookup and a full size SD card slot.  Not to mention the laptop form factor.  It is also built sturdy and with a nice aluminum back.  The only thing the Samsung has better is a pair of stereo front facing speakers and supposedly the stylus.  The Samsung was disappointing considering the choices at this price point", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "annoying", "Author": "w_s_t", "ReviewID": "R3QY5ELINNJ0IB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was eager to receive what was among the highest-rated Android tablets to-date (early October 2012). Within a day of use, I was reminded of why I dumped my Galaxy phone a couple years ago for a Nexus. Manufacturers crippled the OS, and load the device up with apps they think you should have. Time after time, I would go to the app store and receive a message that the app is incompatible with my device. I even had to mess around just to install the Amazon app store. Who knows when/if they will ever get around to upgrading to the current version of Android, and what additional incompatibility issues that will introduce.Perhaps I would have been more satisfied (or at least looked past the limitations of this expensive tablet) if I used the S Pen, which some indicate is a legitimate differentiator, but I did not. So, I dumped this on eBay for a $80 loss, and look forward to getting a \"pure Google\" tablet - Nexus.

So a real PEN matters to me and Ipad lacks this ability.Note taking: The hardware is great and pen is accurate enough but the S NOTE app in not as easy to use as it should be. But it is good overall.Annotating PDF:  Here is the first problem,  S NOTE does not allow to opn PDF s and edit them. Therefore you need some other app, the best I found is ezPDF which is still not perfect, for example it does not have eraser.  The NOTABILITY app on Ipad is much better than that.Surfing Web: I often listen to embedded audios and talks in websites and meanwhile I want to do other things on my laptop\\tablet (This is called multitasking). This works on Ipad, but it does not work on Android !! A big disappointment.Reading PDFs: Resolution and pdf reading experience is not even comparable with Ipad. There is an annoying back light which does not let you raed Pdfs easily. You can see the Pixels and thats not good. After returning the device, I checked (the new) Ipad again,  readying PDF on that was really nice.Beside all these there some more (important) things you may want to know:-- Although processor is powerful but I don't feel any difference even with ipad 2, I can even say that the Ipad is smoother. I should mention that I never do gaming so I don't know about the difference in that area.-- If you occasionally visit websites in other languages (than English), for example Arabic, Farsi,... the fonts are horrible and You need another KeyBoard app to handle writing. Ipad does this job excellent.Conclusion: Although I am not fan of any particular company, but if you don't need PEN then this device does not even come close to Ipad, so don't waste your Money. If you need a gaming device, I don't know.

I had grand visions of using it to replace pen and paper/printouts for my university classes. It's definitely lacking in functionality that a student and even an average person would need in order to operate the tablet well. For example, converting .pdf files into the s-note application takes about 10 seconds per page. If you are converting a large file in order to write on it (say a .pdf deck of slides for class), then S-note takes 10-20 minutes easily just so you can use the fabled s-pen in an efficient way (not many apps take advantage of palm rejection, have smoothing, etc, only S-note does)In my opinion (as an owner), poor functionality as anything other than a notepad/sketchpad (aka difficult to write on lecture slides, word docs, etc.) leads to a tablet that should have been, but isn't, great. There you go folks. Go buy something else!EDIT: The Note actually charges using more power than micro-USB provides. So it does seem reasonable to have a proprietary charger. I've edited the review and added a star accordingly.EDIT 2: The major problem with the Note now is that when you write in S-note with the palm on the screen, it thinks you are trying to resize the screen. So while palm reject effectively works, the resizing the screen problem is an extreme annoyance that happens every time you lift your palm to move down a line (which is often because the Note's screen isn't nearly as wide as a sheet of paper). Also, if you are writing on a flat surface (Which most of us are), your arm will hit the menu which will pop up again, when you move your palm. It's easy to close and resize, but after doing it a million times, you'd rather just use paper and scan it in. Serious design flaw that many users are having. Curious if anyone has found a fix for this issue.EDIT 3: LectureNotes by Acadoid does what S-note is supposed to do for students. Highly recommended, it will make the Note 10.1 functional enough to take high-quality notes in certain classes.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow, what a mess", "Author": "Noneofyour \"Noneofyour\"", "ReviewID": "R1K41S264IDMZ7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is a nightmare.
