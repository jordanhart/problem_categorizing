Its exterior is attractive. Screen is more than brilliant. I also own a LG G2 so we didn't have any issues with the settings. Thumbs up LG!The only thing I wish for is to have the Kit Kat update on the unit", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Tablet!", "Author": "Tommy O", "ReviewID": "R25CT0FMPVJUWN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been on a \"quest\" for a perfect tablet for a LONG time, i don't want an iPad although i had an iPad Air and it was a stunning device.  I really wanted something Android based so i immediately bought the Nexus 7 (newest model) from Verizon.  The colors were all washed and and very light looking.  I looked at just about every tablet then noticed the LG G Pad 8.3 with LTE in black.  I went home and started reading reviews which all were fantastic,i couldn't find anything negative, so i went back to the Verizon store and purchased it.  I've had it about a week now and really like it alot.  The colors are great, the UI is nice, a little different obviously coming from a Nexus device and the battery seems to be very good.  Alot of tablets don't sleep correctly and the battery drains even when in \"sleep\" mode but this one actually sleeps and preserves the battery.My only gripes are the email formatting and graphics quality during games.  When i view emails in the native email client (not GMAIL) the formatting is not automatically adjusting so i have to \"pinch\" and move around to read the email correctly, this also happens with many web pages even when using Chrome.  I tried playing a few games and they game were very choppy, the resolution automatically gets turned down which had me wondering a bit but these are the only negatives.  I think the average person that needs a nice tablet that feels solid and conserves battery will enjoy this tablet very much.  It comes with Android 4.2.2, was hoping for KitKat but not yet.  Again, i have the Verizon LTE version of this tablet so thats probably why there is a delay in the OS upgrade.  I would recommend this tablet!", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG G Pad 8.3", "Author": "M. Sigler", "ReviewID": "R2SSVX6YVRA9P7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "04/15/14 - Recieved the 4.4.2 (KitKat) software upgrade today. \ufffdAfter reviewing several other tablets of about the same size, I decided on purchasing the G Pad 8.3.  I had the 2012 Nexus 7 then the 2013 Nexus 7.  With the multiple random reboots of the 2013 Nexus 7, it was time for it to be replaced.  In the running besides the G Pad was the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and the iPad Mini w/retina display.After viewing many You Tube videos (especially the DetroitBorg and MobileTechReview reviews) I decided on the LG.  I was undecided as to whether to purchase the regular G Pad or the Google Edition.  I decided on the LG version because of price.This tablet is quite amazing.  It is much easier to view than the Nexus 7 (due to the increased screen size).  There are a lot of LG apps pre-installed and I have yet to explore them all but so far I can find no faults with the tablet.  Well, maybe one, it is still running Jellybean.Screen color and brightness are excellent.  Navigating through some of the Google apps is different due to the LG skin so it's a bit of a learning curve coming from pure Google.  I've only noticed the tablet lagging once as I was quickly scrolling through \"all apps\".  Other than that, this tablet is fast at processing commands.  I have disabled a few apps and will probably disable a few more and hope that this will add RAM and more speed.  The notification tones on the tablet are pretty good too compared to regular Google sounds (I like the Vienna Boys Choir ones though I've heard many do not).  The dual speakers on the back can be quite loud too.Considering the price paid for the tablet, I consider it a very good deal and have not been disappointed by the LG G Pad 8.3.  I would recommend purchasing the LG.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "best tablet ive ever had", "Author": "Andrey", "ReviewID": "R2AWZQAWUVPGVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm having a really good experience with this tablet.

The form and size hit the sweet spot for me personally. Build is great. Love the aluminum. Screen is sharp and has good colors though could be brighter. I'll get straight to it though. The software included is awful. Adds a couple useful features but overall slows the tablet down considerably. If you're up to it, rooting and installing the latest version of cyanogenmod  improve the experience tenfold. It's fast anything and so much more user friendly. If not, the stock software is passable, but not ideal. The best thing this tablet has going for it is the form factor. Gives much needed screen space over, say, the nexus 7 which I always felt was too small. Yet the g pad is still quite portable and can fit in jacket pockets and such. I would very much recommend this tablet to anyone.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Premium tablet", "Author": "R. Chung", "ReviewID": "R60T56HB4V06D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also have a Nexus 7 (gen 2) tablet, and this LG tablet is much nicer. It wakes up with a double tap, on the Nexus I always have to look for the power button. It also plays videos better than the Nexus 7, there are videos that play with occasional distortion on the Nexus but play perfectly on the LG tablet. Although more expensive than the Nexus 7, it never reboots, and it keeps it charge better in sleep mode. About the only minor negatives are that it is a little bigger than the Nexus 7 so it doesn't fit as well in a jacket pocket, and the back is slick rather than non-slip.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very impressed", "Author": "Alberto Lopez", "ReviewID": "R3AHY4VCRFYR15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the LG G Pad 8.3 Tablet after having owned the Asus Memo Pad 8 for about 4 months (after which the Memo quit powering on).  I decided to spend the extra $100 dollars this time around since the specs on the LG G Pad 8.3 are clearly superior.After having used this product for a short while, it is clearly evident that I made the right decision.  Size, weight, processor speed, memory, display quality, etc... are all significantly better than the Memo Pad 8, which becomes clearly evident as soon as you start to use it.Long story short: the LG G Pad 8.3 tablet is worth the price.

I already have a 10.1in tablet and was in the market for something a little smaller. The 7in tablets seemed kind of small and then I saw this one. I'm not a huge fan of LG's UI, but I don't really mind it. The display is absolutely stunning. Movies and videos are very clear and crisp. I was surprised as to how light it is. It almost feels too light. Then again, I am used to carrying around a huge 10in tablet. It is also surprisingly loud. I was expecting the sound to not be as clear being that the speakers are in the rear. I was very surprised by the sound.

So, I naturally wanted to follow-up the phone with an LG tablet. The G Pad is a really nice sized tablet and can be held in one hand as opposed to the bigger and heavier iPad. And it can also be stashed relatively easy into jacket pocket.As soon as I unboxed the tablet, there was an apparent color issue. As I used the tablet, the yellow/dingy tint on the screen was getting very frustrating to look at .
