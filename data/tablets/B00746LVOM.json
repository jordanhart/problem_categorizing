{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Predictably Remarkable. The best tablet in its 10\" class.", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R3IQD3SQXBM5AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to secure the new iPad at our local Apple store, but I also got to spend some time with a review model beforehand. In any case, I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share my experience from my past two years of iPad ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own. I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad review on Amazon!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My review tends to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to make it more helpful for those just looking for specific info. For example, see the heading \"Downloading Apps and Games\" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's quickly cover what's new, and what each means for you:+ Retina Display - twice the resolution of the iPad 2, at 2048 x 1536 pixels (264px/in)+ 5 megapixel rear-facing camera - take photos with over 8x higher resolution and quality than the iPad 2 (but still no flash)+ Dual-core 1GHz A5X processor with quad-core graphics - better multitasking and flawless high-res graphics performance+ 4G LTE capable - faster mobile connections on AT&T; and Verizon when in 4G-LTE-covered network areaIf you're considering the now-cheaper iPad 2, here's a quick recap of what was new last year:+ Dual-core 1GHz A5 Processor - better multitasking, 9-times faster graphics+ 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures+ Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through with Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately)+ Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos+ Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)+ Verizon 3G model now available - no longer limited to just AT&T; for the WiFi+3G model+ Thinner, lighter and smoother with contoured back - feels more comfortable in your handsThe iPad 2 brought a lot more new features to the iPad lineup, but the 3rd generation iPad still brings us some welcome new features. First, it sports the new A5X processor. Don't be confused though, it's not really that much better than the iPad 2's, and it's not technically a quad-core processor. The CPU itself remains dual-core, but the graphics processor built-into the CPU chip can compute 4 streams of graphics information, thus making the graphics aspect of the A5X processor quad-core. It's confusing, I know. To be honest, there was no noticeable improvement in performance over the iPad 2, except maybe behind the scenes where it handles 4x more pixels. In general, everything on the new iPad runs just as smooth as it always has, which is as to be expected from Apple! But I imagine the new processor has particularly been used to speed up image processing for the new 5 megapixel camera, making photography just about as snappy as it is on the iPhone 4S, which I own as well. 4G support was also a nice surprise that had been rumored.On the other hand, other rumors didn't exactly pan-out, including an SD card slot for photos and file storage, nor the possibility of a smaller, more manageable 7\" iPad model, but I'm still holding out hope for one in the future (UPDATE: a 7.9\" iPad Mini has now been released, and you can now read my review of it too: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8). Thankfully, the price stays the same for these new models, but that is as to be expected. As a boon for those who don't really plan to use the new high-res camera nor need the Retina display or 4G speed, the iPad 2 is going to stick around for a while longer, with a new lower price for those in the market!===== My Background =====I'm a website and mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for iOS devices, including the iPad. I also develop websites, so I like to ensure that those sites look and perform well on the device too, since it's continually growing in popularity for surfing the Web with over the past two years. I've spent lots of time with both the iPad and various Android-based tablets, and I have to be honest... apps are what make the iPad (and other iDevices) so great. Android tablets have the benefit of price and size, but Android apps available for tablets are terribly mediocre! They're also not as responsive as the iPad, at least not after you load them up with apps, games and other junk.I'm no Apple fanboy, but I can recognize quality hardware and software when I see it, and as far as 10\" tablets are concerned, the new iPad simply can't be beat, but that's mostly due to Apple's knack for high-end hardware, plus the ridiculously huge following of quality app developers that Apple can boast about. With over 200,000 apps just for the iPad alone, there's more than enough to keep you busy!===== First Impression =====Unboxing any new device certainly has its appeal, but the iPad has an allure all its own, and the new model is just as touch-worthy as its older siblings, especially when it's fresh out of the box and accompanied by that scent synonymous with new electronics. But when you turn it on for the first time it becomes clear: there's something different about this new model, especially if you've been using the iPad 2 for a while. There's a rich, vibrant crispness to the image that wasn't there before. It's almost like the screen isn't there at all, as if the silky-smooth graphics are just floating there.===== Interaction Experience =====Thanks to the powerful processor, animations and transitions remain smooth on the new iPad, even on a Retina screen with 4-times more pixels! Plus, text on the new model is crisper than ever, even in apps that haven't been retweeked for the new Retina display. Meanwhile, where the iPad really shines is with its continuation of a phenomenal multi-touch interface that is second to none, seriously. Android tablets and other devices may tout \"multi-touch\" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. The iPad touch-screen, on the other hand, supports up to ten simultaneous touches. Nothing new here, but still worth mentioning, especially for tablet newcomers. So if an iPad app ever needs to support that many touches, the iPad is ready. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.===== So What Can the iPad Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos to your iPad via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube and watch your favorite videos via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music via the iTunes app. Another popular iPad app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat with other Apple-device users via FaceTime (over WiFi only). Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with the iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.You can also download two additional Apple-made apps: iBooks, which lets you download and read ebooks easily on your device, and iWork, Apple's office-document editing suite, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages (for editing word processing documents), Numbers (for editing spreadsheets) and Keynote (for editing PowerPoint-like slideshows); Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well, but I'll explain a few typing techniques below. Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want from the App Store, tap the button at the top with the app's price, then tap again to confirm. Enter your password (once per session), and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple charges your card for the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new app. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad itself. I prefer to use an app called \"AppShopper\" that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the \"popular\" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad =====Typing on the iPad can be annoying at times, but I mostly chalk that up to it being 10-inches. Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, with the added potential that you'll be using it to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First, realize that the iPad's no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content. Alternately, thanks to iOS 5, thumb-typing in landscape mode has now become painless. Normally, the keyboard is still docked to the bottom of the screen, and can be hard to reach the center of the keyboard with thumbs. However, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. You can then choose to split the keyboard, with makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys, when the iPad is in landscape mode. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom.Typing Method #2: Full FingersI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. I find it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method. Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextNow, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing. You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen' and more. At times though, network congestion does hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, so hopefully that will improve over time.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, but content on the Web is often best viewed vertically, and the new Retina display's 2048x1536 resolution renders that content more crisply than ever, especially in portrait orientation (vertical). Working within the Safari Web-browsing app, the interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). However, regardless of whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons, but they don't seem to care anyway. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others though. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in some cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities. Alternately, you can jailbreak your iPad (when a jailbreak is released for the new model), which would allow you to circumvent the Flash limitation.Granted, I don't often actually find myself surfing the web with the iPad for a few reasons. First of all, I prefer the display to be parallel with my face, but for the iPad that means craning my neck downwards and after a while that gets tiring. I also tend to do a lot of typing on the sites I use, and typing a lot on the iPad isn't really an enjoyable experience. There are however some keyboard alternatives if you decide that on-screen typing isn't for you. I just find it easier to work from a laptop when I'm on the go, and the 11\" MacBook Air fits that bill simply enough for me. Finally, when I browse the Web (on my computer), I typically have more than 9 tabs open at any given time. I say that because the iPad's browser limits you to 9 tabs. If you rarely use more than 9 tabs when browsing the Web though, the iPad may be right for you.===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photography and Video =====The new iPad brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple (for five bucks) that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad!As if that's not enough, there's built-in Picture Frame mode that lets you use the iPad's gorgeous Retina display to showcase your favorite photos, using clever transition effects like \"Dissolve\" with \"Zoom in on Faces\", or the nifty multi-photo \"Origami\" effect. In this review's comments, I'll include a helpful link to an article that shows you how to set up and use this mode.Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, in you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad (or even the iPhone 4S), you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths because of its one-app-seen-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and they're naturally located under the category titled \"productivity\" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of us with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are also perfect for the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad is really hit-or-miss. The ability to print documents right from your iPad came along last year, with the iOS 4 update, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support \"AirPrint\" or, if yours doesn't, you might have some success working with some software called Printopia (if you have a Mac with a shared printer). Google AirPrint or Printopia for more info and device compatibility. From there, printing is easy. The iPad will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options the first time around. For more information about printing with your iPad, I'll linked to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Praise =====+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close+ The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPad as well as the iPhone and iPod touch+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the powerful dual-core central processor+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do 1080p HD video (up from 720p)+ 4G LTE option - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi===== Dissappointments =====+ The 10\" model is not very portable, it's often just too bulky and heavy to tote around or hold up for long durations\u00bb UPDATE: a 7.9\" iPad Mini has now been released, see my in-depth review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8+ No true GPS - IP-based location just doesn't cut it, and GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use like assisted (cellular) GPS does+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos that look great on the Retina display, or hold more of those huge 1080p videos+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, importing pics from your external camera to the new iPhoto app+ Front facing camera - great for FaceTime communication, but it only works over WiFi, Apple isn't even letting it work over 4G!===== The Bottom Line =====If you already have an iPad 2, perhaps there isn't enough new to warrant purchasing the new model, unless you really want the Retina display. If you have the original iPad, it's probably worth getting though, seeing all the new additions that have carried over from the iPad 2.Overall, the iPad still sets the pace for most other tablets in its 10\" class, but I personally find all 10\" tablets to be a bit bulky and somewhat unwieldy. Particularly, I find it awkward to use the iPad where I want to use it most: lying in bed, or sitting on the couch with it in my lap. On the couch, where a laptop is comfortable resting on your lap, with the screen parallel to your face, whereas the iPad needs to be angled up, and your head angled downward. This can be tiring after a while. In bed, it's just too heavy and bulky, and I've dropped the thing square on my face several times.The solution? I started bugging Apple for a 7\" model since the iPad was first released in 2010. Jobs said no, but, with all due respect, he's no longer calling the shots. UPDATE: Thankfully, Tim Cook saw the light and cooked up the iPad mini! The iPad mini is on par with other 7\" tablets in size, but uses screen real estate more efficiently and thus sports a screen that's closer to 8\" than 7\". If 10\" is comfortable for you, then the 3rd-gen iPad is definitely worth 5 stars. Personally though, I've found the iPad mini more to my liking. I've posted a more in-depth review of the iPad mini: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8 so feel free to browse on over to it and have a read. Some content from this review applies to the other, and vice versa, but there are plenty of differences.In all honesty, the iPad really is the best 10\" tablet around, and I would give no other tablet more than 3 stars. I'll continue to keep mine around simply because it does have it's uses, especially for Web and app development, and when not in use, it still makes a great digital picture frame with the aforementioned Picture Frame mode! (See the Photography and Video section)However, for reading, surfing and all other entertainment and gaming uses, I've now transitioned over to using the iPad mini most of the time.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but ...", "Author": "Bookenz", "ReviewID": "R2Z4YKL3AP05RB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a big iPad fan and was waiting anxiously for the third generation to come out.  I bought the original iPad, and when the 2 came out, I happily sold the 1 and upgraded.  I was thrilled with the thinner, lighter and improved iPad 2.  So naturally, when word came out that the third one was about to be released in March 2012, I was right on board to buy one.  Sold my 2 and preordered the 3 from Apple the day it was released.I was hoping the third gen wouldn't be noticibly thicker and heavier than the 2, but unfortunately it was.  I could definitely tell the difference when reading ebooks, which I do a lot.  I couldn't really tell any difference between the speed and clarity of the 3, but to be fair, I didn't compare the two models side  by side.  I've no doubt the 3 is superior in this regard.  I don't use the cameras, so don't care about this since I have a very nice digital camera for that.The one thing about the third generation iPad that concerned me was the heat issue.  Shortly after receiving it, I was reading an ebook and noticed the left side was warm.  Not hot, but definitely warm enough for me to notice it.  This reminded me of laptops I've had that have overheated and shut down, and here I was only reading a book.  My iPad 2 never had this problem and I used it a lot.  I also had some difficulty backing up the 3 to the cloud, again, something that wasn't ever a problem with the 2.After reading some reviews of others experiencing the heating problem with the latest iPad, and really missing the thinner and lighter iPad 2 , I decided to return the iPad 3 to my local Apple store and buy a new iPad 2.  They had no problem taking it back and I was glad to see the 2 had come down in price. When the sales associate asked me why I was returning the 3, I told him about the heat problem.  He didn't seem surprised and said it was because the 3 has a larger battery.The third gen has a faster CPU and retina dsplay, but I never thought the 2 had any problems with speed, and the clarity of the display has always seemed fine to me.  But I'm certainly no expert.  I'm very happy I made the exchange and enjoying using my iPad 2 again.  For my uses--books, internet, email and games, the cooler, thinner and lighter iPad 2 is a better choice for me.By the way, I just want to add that I think it's unfair to compare the Kindle Fire and Nook to the iPad.  These devices are just ebook readers and they're fine for that--I've tried them both.  Rather like saying, okay, you can buy this Mercedes or you can get the Volkswagen. Once you've used an iPad, you're totally spoiled and trying to browse the Internet with a Kindle or Nook is an exercise in frustration after using an iPad.Update January 7, 2014 - since writing this review for the iPad 3, which I ended up returning, I've moved on to the iPad Air, which is noticeably lighter and faster than the iPad 2.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead?", "Author": "Ron Cronovich \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R1CZFLUXXQIC7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10\" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are \"post-paid\" and \"pre-paid.\"  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can \"suspend\" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perspective from an Android and Windows User", "Author": "J. Anderson", "ReviewID": "RUYOPTD4UA08T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I realize I must have been living under a rock for the past few years since I've never owned an Apple product.  I've been using PCs since I was a kid in the early 90s and Android on my smartphone for three years (Blackberry before that).  So it was not an easy decision for me to take the plunge on the New iPad.  Below are my findings thus far, some of which I knew before buying and some that I've learned since.  I won't spend time reviewing technical details or comparisons to the iPad 2.  There are dozens of professional reviews out there that have done as much.  Instead, this is my perspective in using the iPad after so many years with non iOS products.Positives:+ Beautiful design, form, fit, etc.  Always seems to be the case for Apple products (sometimes to the point of diminished functionality as noted below)+ Best screen.  I've always worked with large, high resolution monitors (current is 1440 27\").  This screen is gorgeous as everyone has called out.+ Best battery life at 10 or so hours; I've only had it 6 days but nothing leads me to believe 10 hours is overstated+ Best selection of tablet-specific apps.  There's really no comparison here and it will likely take years for Android and eventually Win 8 to catch up+ Tons of 3rd party products such as cases in every possible style+ Easy to use content via iTunes+ Compared to laptop, instant on and long battery life are ideal for videos and entertainment on the go, quick surfing, etc.  Touch of course is very intuitive (love to watch my five year old use it on her own)Negatives:- Big Brother In Charge:  Locked factory home screen, really?  I guess I've been spoiled with all the freedoms that Android includes (no iron curtain there).  But if I want to get rid of an Apple factory icon, I can't.  Instead, only secondary screens are up to me.  In general, there is very limited ability to tweak settings.  Way too controlling for a $700 device in my opinion.- No guided turn by turn navigation and GPS struggles to get location where my Android phone picks it up instantly;  standard on even $50 Android phones- Having used the Android Market (now Play) for years, I am accustomed to trying out ad-supported apps for free, and then buying ad-free versions of the ones I find the most useful.  Now I'm still early into iOS, but I am finding a lot more paid only apps and far fewer ad-supported free apps.  I'll keep looking but this is my initial impression.- No SD and overpriced memory upgrade only available at time of purchase- No USB to connect camera and other accessories to, and Apple OEM only camera kit for a high price for what it is.- Occasional stutter or delayed response.  Generally very smooth as reviewers have said, but both my wife and I have seen this happen once or twice an hour.I'll do a follow-up in a couple weeks when I've had more time with it.  I still wouldn't consider an iPhone over Android.  But for tablets, Apple is the game in town right now both for hardware and ecosystem.  If Android/Win 8 tablets approached the hardware quality of the new iPad (screen, battery life, etc), and their respective app stores built up a good base of available apps, I probably would choose one of them over iOS due to above negatives.  I realize some of the reasons Apple has been so successful is that they lock their products down fairly tight.  But they also clearly are gaming the customer to drive additional purchases, expensive upgrades or future product replacements, etc.In summary, I think the new iPad is an amazing product that I wouldn't have imagined only a few years ago.  For that, I'm willing to part with my hard earned dollars and enjoy it.  But I'd also gladly swap it for an Android/Win 8 tablet in a couple years when those markets mature.Update 1 Month In:+ Battery life continues to be amazing+ Form/weight/screen all a delight+ Compared to using laptop, find that we use more including short-bursts; instant on is great+ Awesome as a digital photo frame for sharing photos- 10 Watt power supply is somewhat ridiculous considering iPad contains laptop size battery; charges take about 6-8 hours, depending on how far one lets it run down;  for comparison, typical laptop comes with 40-60 watt power supply and charge in 1.5-2.5 hours- Lack of Flash is bigger drawback than I anticipated; Kids sites/games especially depend on Flash- Wi-Fi is considerably slower than on laptop and even Android phones;  SpeedTest confirms speeds 50-60% slower", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The New ipad, to be or not to be?", "Author": "LionKing \"bas\"", "ReviewID": "R2YMNHE7JHO3UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review is divided in to 2 parts. The pre purchase and the post purchase review.The prepurchase review:The release of the new iPad has left many of us in a state of indecisiveness. People who own, and those who have never owned an iPad are facing the same dilemma, to be or not to be. Most of us had high hopes that the new iPad would put an end to our life-long quest for an ideal tablet. Unfortunately, it did not. It now seems that the new iPad is more of an option rather than an upgrade to its predecessor. The market for iPad 2 therefore has not closed. In fact, even before the release of their 3rd generation tablet, apple had already announced that they will continue to manufacture iPad 2 and sell it at a reduced price.The purpose of this article is to help you decide whether you should buy the new iPad or stick with its predecessor. So, let us take a look at different scenarios where one version may be preferred over the other and vice versa. But first let's summarize all the important issues that have made the new iPad center of criticism.In the order of preference:1. overheating: it is now a common knowledge that the new iPad is running 13 degrees hotter than its predecessor. There can be two important implications of this issue. First, many people have pointed that they feel uncomfortable when holding the warm tablet for prolonged lengths of time. This feeling might become worse in the hot weather, especially when there is no AC to cool you and your iPad down. Imagine holding a sick child who has a fever of 102 degrees, but this baby is running a temperature of 116 degrees. Second, many have raise concerns over the effects of the high temperature on iPad's delicate hardware.2. Wifi connectivity: there are enough whiners on apple forum complaining about the new iPad's noticeably inferior wifi reception. For some this problem is more annoying than the heating issue.3. Battery: it takes twice the time to charge the new iPad to full than iPad 2. It has also been seen that the new iPad is falsely displaying a 100% charge figure when in fact it is continuing to load its battery for at least another hour after the percentage is displayed. Another, even bigger disappointment is the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy duty' app, such as games, videos or multitasking.4. Voracious appetite for data: being an HD model, understandably it needs more fuel to run than the previous models. I wish there was some kind of 'standard mode' that people could switch to inorder to conserve data, unfortunately, there isn't.5. Higher demand for memory: since most of its apps must be HD, and therefore 'heavy', the need for both static as well as Random Access Memory is naturally higher. Unfortunately, this entire HD concept has transcribed in to rendering the cheapest member of its family, the 16GB, more or less dysfunctional, at least for the aggressive tablet users. So if you want to buy anything 'functional' you must pick 32 GB or higher version.7. Few more ounces: This is not really a major issue but people who are used to holding the previous versions argue that the additional ounces further decrease the number of hours they could support the tablet on their palm. I personally believe that the heating factor would have kicked in way before you felt the strain from those few extra ounces.8. Same old dorky front camera: even though the rare camera has been upgraded the most functional camera of the iPad, the front camera, has been ignored. I completely fail to understand the logic behind this idea.9. Lack of Siri: most people were expecting to receive this iPhone 4S feature in their new iPad. But all they got was disappointment. Some people think that apple might have intentionally saved Siri for their next launch. However, apple has added a brand new feature to the new ipad, the dictation, and it may offset the disappointment to some extent. It is noteworthy to mention that both Siri and dictation need Internet connectivity to function.With this basic information about the new iPad it will now be easier for me to recommend the edition of the iPad that will suit your needs.So who should buy the new iPad?The biggest and perhaps the only visible plus of the new iPad thus far seems to be its display. All other features are more or less subdued by its lack of basic luxuries. For instance, the higher RAM feature is neutralized by the higher demand for memory, so on and so forth.So, if you are a digital photographer, the new iPad is the tablet of choice for you. No other display will give you even the closest visualization of the pixels that you captured.if you are a low to medium level surfer and like to read books and magazines with colorful graphics and display, the 3rd generation is the way to go.Game lovers who have extremely sensitive senses for sensing the speed, the new iPad is your gadget.If you are a big fan of shooting pictures and videos with your tablet (which is kind of odd, though), the new iPad is your tool. But you have to give me a genuinely convincing reason for choosing a tablet over a digital camera or even an iPhone to shoot quality photos and videos.Beyond this I would seriously recommend to meticulously outweigh risks verses benefits of buying the 3rd over 2nd generation iPad.And, who should buy the iPad 2? Well, everybody else who does not meet the above criterion. If you are an aggressive tablet user and must hold it for an infinite number of hours without having to bear the discomfort due to its higher temperature or weight or strain to your `retina', you are an born to use iPad 2.For intense ipad users a sluggish charge time is definitely going to be a deal breaker when purchasing the new iPad. Additionally, the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy' apps will add to its disability.For Navigation lovers, iPad 2 will certainly have an edge because of its quick charge time while you are on the go.People who live in wifi unfriendly homes should think twice before buying the new iPad.iPad 2 is light on your pocket if you are a big time GSM user. Since there are no unlimited data plans for iPad so one must use the data prudently to avoid being billed multiple times in a month. Both Verizon and AT&T; offer no more than 5 GB of data per charge for iPad. Here again the classification of aggressive vs low to medium user should help you decide between iPad 2 and the new iPad.If you are low on budget you could save a some money by choosing iPad 2. This is not only because of the recent price slash of iPad 2 but also due to the fact that the new iPad's higher memory requirement has only left you with the choice of purchasing its pricier version that has more memory.if you are a big time video chatter buying the new iPad will not make your experience any better than ipad 2 since no change has been made to the front camera of the tablet. Second, if you are chatting on a GSM plan you will now be burning more Mb/minute that you would with the previous version.Conclusion: Consider the New iPad if you are a big time digital photographer (professional or hobbyist) and if you are a low to medium tablet user. For everybody else, there is iPad 2.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The post-purchase review:I did eventually end up buying the new ipad. I took a chance and bought the least expensive third generation. I placed an order on the apple website and the item was shipped straight from China. The neat thing about this deal was the free personalized text engraving. I wrote 'Made for ...our names' and added my address to it as well.So, what is the deal with the New iPad? Well, to be honest, the heating issue was barely discernable but I really did not hag it to the limits so I am probably not the best person to pass the final verdict on the heating issue. But the real issue here was the display. Yes, 'issue'. I was quite disappointed to see how the pictures on various Internet sites appeared on the new ipad. Most of the facebook avatars appear fuzzy and ugly. People say that this effect is similar to the one we noticed when HD cameras first became available. They would magnify even the slightest wrinkle on your face and make you look darn ugly. But I am not the expert here, all I can say is I prefer my ipad 2 over the new ipad for facebook and picture surfing. Another important mention that I would like to make is about YouTube videos. Contrary to what one (me included) would have expected the new ipad is no better than ipad 2 in displaying even the highest resolution videos on YouTube. Infact the colors appear slightly distorted as compared to more natural looking ones on ipad 2. The new ipad does however have a slight edge over the ipad 2 when it comes to displaying high resolution pictures downloaded straight from high pixil DSLR camera.The next thing that I would definitely like to mention about the new ipad is its dictation feature. I must say that this is a great achievement. The transcription is more accurate than most other dictation apps. The best part is that this feature is integrated in to the keyboard so you do not have to open a seperate app to use it. You can use it almost anywhere where the keyboard pops up. But the question really is how many people will actually use this feature to make it a must-have option, I would say, not too many.I did not come across any issue with wifi connectivity. And, the thickness and heaviness was completely beyond my perception levels. With your eyes closed you can barely tell whether you are holding an ipad 2 or the new ipad. It even fit into the tragus leather case that is made for ipad 2 without ANY problems.And now I am sure most of you would like to ask me whether my opinion about the new ipad changed after I purchased it. My answer would be NO. I still think that all the 'yummy' features that the new ipad has been stuffed with are 'optional' and do not justify the release of a brand new version. People could have comfortably lived with the iPad 2 for another 2-3 years.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Retina Display", "Author": "Simon", "ReviewID": "R3P5S7NHNE0Z0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40\" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins.

Some quick pros and cons:PROS vs Android/Asus:*Retina Display: The screen is very good, but coming from the Asus, which has a higher resolution than the iPad 2, I was not blown away by it. It feels like a larger version of the Retina display on the iPod Touch, a device which I also use frequently. Coming from these two quality screens, the new iPad display was not a massive step up in quality, but I suspect many people who have been using different devices will be pleasantly surprised. Where this display shines is in color saturation and text quality. Images pop off of the screen and reading is the best I have seen on any handheld device.*App Selection: Many have made this point, but it is worth mentioning again. The App selection on iPad blows Android out of the water. There really is no comparison here. Even the free apps seem to be of higher quality than on Android.* UI: The smoothness of the UI on the iPad is second to none. The screen registers every swipe and gesture, and pages flip seamlessly and with high quality animation. The ASUS Transformer features the much discussed 2 second \"Android lag,\" which is not a deal breaker, but feels less sophisticated compared to the iPad (although this seems less of an issue in ICS).s* Build Quality: The solidity of the iPad is a major plus compared to the Transformer. The iPad is heavy, solid, and the tactile transition from glass to brushed metal is appealing and borderline luxurious. The Asus simply feels like a sheet of plastic (which it is). The Asus also suffers from noticeable light bleeding, the charger also died within a year and the keyboard dock had to be RMA'd and repaired. I don't think these things will be an issue with the iPad.CONS vs Android/Asus:* OS: I may be in the minority here, but I find Android to be a more feature rich and deep OS. I like having some degree of control over my devices, and I appreciate the fact that Android lets me get \"under the hood\" a bit more than iOS. It doesn't trap me within a proprietary \"ecosystem\" of content, it allows me to use the device as an external hard drive to transfer media, and I can expand the storage via MicroUSB as I see fit (This has been beaten to death, but Apple really needs to allow users to expand storage-even on a proprietary basis). And there are also little touches that I think are well done, such as Android's ability to run many programs at once and allow the user to flip through them- a feature that I miss in iOS.  Its Gmail widget is an invaluable and quick way to check email, and its placement of the back button is far superior to iOS. This last point may seem minor, but the Android back button at the bottom of the screen is more convenient as you do not have to remove your hands from the device to go back to a previous screen.*Weight: I prefer a heavier device but I know this is an issue for some people. The iPad is noticeably heavier than the Transformer (but lighter than other Android tablets, such as the Acer Iconia).*Keyboard Dock: This is a wonderful, albeit expensive, add-on for the Asus Transformer. The keyboard dock/charger is incredibly useful as it extends battery life, expands storage, and enhances usability. I know that you can use Apple's bluetooth mouse and keyboard with the iPad, but the all-in-one solution from Asus is more appealing as it basically affords you the convenience of a netbook and a tablet. I suspect this will be the future of mobile computing. As I noted above, however, my keyboard was defective out of the box and reviews suggest that the build quality of these units is quite poor.OVERALL: If you are new to tablets and want the best UI and great ease of use, go for the iPad. If you are technically inclined and want more control over your device, go with a high-end Android tablet. The iPad has the best tablet hardware on the market, but Android as an OS is closing the gap.  That having been said, Apple's iPad, while not revolutionizing the act of computing, is instead changing how we consume the internet, and the newest iteration of the iPad is the most convincing example of this vision.**UPDATE**I just wanted to confirm that I too have experienced the extremely long recharge times reported various internet outlets (about 5 and a half hours in my case). It by no means detracts from my enjoyment of the product, but planning recharges and making sure to top off the charge at appropriate times does reduce the device's mobility.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Desktop Replacement?  Almost there!", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "RQOIJ6LERWJ60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the pleasure of trying out most of the new Apple products for the last few years.  If you have any questions or requests for clarifications you can leave a comment, and I'll be emailed, or you can email me directly by clicking on my name and looking for the link.I mostly use an iPad 1, but I have the opportunity to use an iPad 2 often.A lot has changed since the iPad came out, and I wrote my original review (located here:Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi) titled with a quote from Woz, saying \"Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing\" and its still very true.  Tablets aren't like PCs, you don't need to maintain them or worry about software requirements at all.  Its wonderful for people who hate that.  My friend can tell you exactly what processor his last laptop had, but what processor does his iPad have?  He'll say \"Don't know, don't care\".  If you are wondering why to get a tablet at all, I would recommend that you read that review. Its the second review on that page.So I bought the new iPad, the 2.5, or whatever you want to call it.  I'm not going to go into the tech specs, because, they are posted everywhere and unless you are a geek you will also fall into the \"don't know/don't care\" category.  I'm going to try to focus on just telling you what I would want to know before I bought it.  This review will be about real use.I chose a 32GB version.  Why?1) The new apps that will support the retina display are supposed to take more memory, so you should expect that whatever you had on your older iPad will take more space on this new one.2) I feel that the days of 16GB being enough may soon be passing.  With my 16GB iPad I was actually having to start managing my memory.  I had to start leaving things off it.3) The more powerful the iPad becomes, the more I expect to use it.  And this means, more memory will be needed.  The iPad has never been my primary \"computer\", but with this iteration it might be there:  I can plug an HD screen into it via HDMI now, and use a nice bluetooth keyboard.  However, you have to use the iPad itself as a gigantic touchpad, as you can't use a pointing device.  It mirrors whats on the screen, so, its clumsy-but-possible.  Still, we are getting so close to throwing the ipad down on the desk at work and just... working.So for the first time I plunked down my hard earned money for the 32GB version.  I think the 16GB version will be like having a 4GB iPhone 2G.I'd also like to point out that despite the improvements and upgrades, Apple is maintaining the same starting price that it did for the iPad 1 and the iPad 2.  This is very nice.The main new things -for me- in order of importance are:1)  The 4G LTE network (I have the AT&T; version).  We'll skip the cell phone enthusiast argument over whether this is really a 4G device, because 4G was actually supposed to be (clears throat) even better.  Because in spite of that, the 4G LTE may be the primary reason I plunked down my change and bought it.  I want to be able to do my work remotely without problems.I ran some tests on the new iPad.--In my office, which has a 6mbps DSL and wifi, I saw a 3.6Mbps upload and a  512k upload.  You might say \"who cares?\"  Ah but wait.--I signed up for the 3GB Data Plan at $30/mo, and when using the 4g LTE network, I saw a 17Mbps connection.--And at home, where we have the fiber optic connection, I only saw an 11Mbps connection.--And finally, my iPhone 4s got a lousy 2.5Mbps on the AT&T; 4G non-LTE network.So there you have the relative speeds.  All calculated using the Speed Test app.So here's the point... the new 4G service is a major upgrade.  On the LTE network it is very fast - however, I did experience some latency when just checking emails traveling in a car driving 70 mph.  This is typical for this technology, it seems to have problem switching from tower to tower.  But if you are sitting at a park downtown then I don't think you'll see those problems.  What does this mean?  You should see a movie download in 1/2 to 1/4 of the time. And the iPad will be able to act as a wifi hub for all your devices.  In other words, I will be able to use the iPad for internet for my laptop too.  Now, at the time of this writing, it should be noted that you cannot use your iPad as a wifi hotspot with AT&T.;  At this time only Verizon supports that feature.  (Maybe you want to pick the Verizon version if this is important to you).Now, I live in a metro area in one of the biggest cities in the USA, so, your 4g service may vary.  And they are charging a super premium price:  $10 per GB.  A full length movie on iTunes is 2GB or 3GB, so it can't replace my home connection, but its great for work and casual use.Back to the countdown:2) The \"resolutionary\" screen.  It is true that this screen is amazing and a pleasure to look at.  You can't see the pixels, and I love that.  I love that on my iPhone 4 too.  It will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent, so I don't think you need to got all excited and upgrade tomorrow.3) The faster processor.  I actually did not have a problem with my old iPad processor, but soon my old iPad will be like using a 2G iPhone.  But it will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent.  Once again, I don't think you need to upgrade tomorrow, but, a few months after release it should be a lock (I happen to know that many iPad developers wait until they can actually get their hands on a retail unit before upgrading their existing apps, although once they get the retail unit its like a race to finish).4) Dictation.  I have used this with success.  However, like most voice recognition software its usefulness is reduced by the fact that I'm seldom in a quiet place. Still, I like it.  I think its a valuable addition, and I typically use it when I only would have to type a few words.  I don't use it to type long letters, as its not completely accurate and I think editing out all the mistakes would take longer than typing it out.  (I do use an Apple brand bluetooth keyboard for serious typing: Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B [NEWEST VERSION] I have also tried a chicklet style one but it didn't work well for me: Kensington iPad 2 Case with Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad 2 3G Tablet, WIFI Model K39521US.5) The camera.  I don't think I'll use this much.  Mostly when taking pictures of things that I'm writing about, which isn't that often.  Maybe for some FaceTime.  But I don't think this makes it worth it to upgrade from the Original Ipad.  (the iPad 2 had a camera, so you can ignore this if you have an iPad 2)Other usage changes since iPad 1:1) I bought an HP envy (HP Envy 110 e-All-in-One Printer for the wireless printing from iPad and iPhone.  This has worked out VERY well.  I think the AirPrint implementation has worked nicely.2) One thing I was disappointed with the original iPad for was the inability to see what was on the iPad screen on a TV.  Since then I have purchased an Apple TV Apple TV MC572LL/A (2010) [OLD VERSION] which is now the old version.  And Apple has made it possible to see whatever is on the screen of the iPad on a bigger screen, and you can buy HDMI adapters now: Apple Digital AV Adapter (MC953ZM/A)3) On my first review I talked about the ability to put your iPhone sim card into your iPad and share your existing data service.  I tried this out, putting my iPhone microsim in the new iPad and I was invited to purchase a new data plan.  So apparently that little moneysaver has been eliminated.Other things that stay the same:You still won't be able to use Flash, a website programming language that allows websites to act more like computer programs.  I've read that the reason that Apple won't allow this is that Flash is often the gateway to getting viruses and other nasties.  As a result, there is no need to have antivirus software on your iPad, its very very safe.  The iPad is rock solid reliable.  In fact, the only virus I've heard of for the iPad is where someone had to send you a Pdf via email and get you to open it.  And of course, thats threat was removed before I even heard about it.On my last review, I talked about usage.  Apps I use a lot now:1) Logmein: to do anything on my computer that I can't do on an iPad.  This would include Flash based software.  I connect to a computer THROUGH my iPad, and control the computer to go to flash sites.  Ordinarily I would say this is not worth it, but the computer also runs engineering programs and other programs that don't really exist for the iPad.2) Gopayment to accept credit cards, although Quickbooks Online usage is hampered by the fact that Quickbooks makes you use a stripped down version through the safari web browser.  Once again, use LogMein Ignition.3) I find the spreadsheet program (numbers) to be highly annoying.  However, there was recently an announcement that MS Office programs Excel Word and Powerpoint will soon be available for the iPad with an interface similar to MS OneNote.  I'll be buying a copy of Excel and hoping that it doesn't suck.4) Find my Friends: I see where people are without having to call them and say \"where are you?\" which is nice.  Because I can see where my wife is without calling her, I get less honeydos.  Wipe that smirk off your face >:(  But also if you know they are driving you don't have to worry about distracted driving causing an accident.5) I don't end up playing many games on the iPad.  I play a lot of games on the iPhone.  But thats just my usage experience.  Maybe that will change with the new screen.You can read my original iPad review (linked above) for more usage ideas, if you are new to tablets.A bit more about usage, someone pointed out in a comment that you don't need the HDMI adapter if you intend to use AirPlay.  Airplay includes the ability to wirelessly stream audio and video from your iPad to a TV.  Typically this is only from apps that share music and movies, which is the functionality of Airplay (You PLAY things over the air).  There are Airplay adapters, including the AppleTV.  However, the HDMI connector does more than the Airplay allows: You can share the actual screen of your iPad, no matter what it shows, to a TV as a mirror image.  If you were to want to use the iPad as your primary \"computer\", you would probably want an HDMI adapter for big screen use.  I meet more people each month who do use a Tablet as their primary computer, so I felt this was an important point to clarify.  I own the AppleTV and the HDMI adapter, and use them in different ways at different times.Will this Ipad 2.5 make my original iPad as useless as a 4GB iPhone 2G?  For the first 6 months, no.  But after that, its likely.  Overall I am happy I bought it, mostly for the native 4G LTE internet.  Followed by the beautiful screen.  The faster processor is the 3rd reason, and as soon as the app developers start utilizing it to greater advantage, it will likely become the #1 reason.  And I think I'll feel that that has happened in about 6 months.After MS Excel comes out I may make an attempt to make the iPad my primary computing device, using the HDMI out and a bluetooth keyboard.  Wish me luck.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Verizon (and AT&T;)  iPad Buyer Beware", "Author": "RSaunders", "ReviewID": "R31QU3JV3F46BU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I want to preface my review by stating that the iPad is a remarkable product that is worthy of a five star rating. My one star valuation is specific to the new Verizon iPad which in my opinion contains a major flaw detrimental to all consumers unwary of Verizon's tactics.The Verizon iPad is equipped with a sim card that permits cell data usage by subscription. With my AT&T; iPad 2 I am able to subscribe and unsubscribe at-will one month at a time. This is the way a cell data subscription should work. The Verizon iPad does not permit this type of usage. If you cancel a monthly subscription for cell data with Verizon that cancellation permanently inactivates the Verizon sim card. The only remedy is to go to the Verizon store to obtain a new card. I have had to do that twice since I purchased the Verizon iPad and each time it is a major time consuming inconvenience and problem.My first stop at the Verizon store took an hour while the customer service representative insisted that I could not replace the sim card without signing up then and there for a monthly plan. After some argument and consultation with others he recanted but insisted that he could not install the sim card without obtaining from me full personal identifying information (telephone number, e-mail address, home address).The next time I needed a sim card the Verizon store representative insisted she had to charge $10 for the card. She didn't require any personal information and she didn't make any effort to link the sim card with my iPad. She simply insisted on $10 for the sim card and handed it to me.It seems as if Verizon is using the expense and inconvenience of forced sim card inactivation in order to discourage a la carte usage of cell data and to encourage people to pay $20 or $30 dollars a month whether or not they need data service.Had I know about this policy I would never have purchased the Verizon iPad.  The Apple Store saleswoman who sold me the iPad was not aware of this flaw and did not advise me that it was an issue. Surprisingly, none of the Apple Store sales persons I have spoken to since then were aware of this issue.Unless you enjoy spending time at the Verizon Store or unless you intend to use a cellular data plan without interruption, you should stay away from the Verizon iPad.Update on February 4, 2013: I just left my local AT&T; store after speaking with the AT&T; store manager about this issue. He confirmed that AT&T; has adopted the Verizon policy and their new iPads also discourage a la carte usage by requiring the customer to purchase a new sim card if the customer cancels a la carte cell data service. It is clear that both major companies want to discourage at-will cell data usage and promote the more lucrative monthly subscription. What a shame and what a rip-off.  They will probably continue to do this until the customers rebel and refuse to purchase the higher priced iPad and/or the monthly cell data service plan.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "All that sizzle and no steak", "Author": "YS Sheu \"ss\"", "ReviewID": "R1LAYFDEKV7AE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I own an Apple Mac Air, iPod touch, and work on a Mac Pro at school, and I have to say, the iPad is my least like Apple product.  iPad is essentially a bigger and more expensive version of iPod touch plus the optional cellular function, which you have to pay at least $20 each month for the service, so that you can use the navigation function (cheaper just to get a GPS with antiglare screen).  First, my biggest complaint is the lack of flash function.  It is true that I know about that limit before my purchase, but it is only when I started to use iPad, I realized how many things it couldn't do without flash, such as watching Amazon online stream movies.  It is really stupid that an iPad, which is targeted as a tablet, could not do flash.  Second, I thought it could at least play DVD if I have the right USB adapter, since I have an external DVD drive, but after searching online, I realized it could not do that either, because some format issues.  It really drives me nuts, because what is good about retina display if you can't watch movies, and I am not about to pay extra money for movies on iTune.  Then, it is the multi-tasking function, I really thought that was a joke. Originally, I thought multitasking means that you can open two apps and have them side-by-side on the screen, and I was dead wrong.  First, there is no side-by-side, and second, once you switch to another app, the previous app (such as safari) stops.  For example, if I am watching a dateline story streaming on CBS, I cannot have it play in the background and use other apps.  There are also small things like I can't use the Apple magic track pad with iPad (wireless keyboard works fine).  Overall, the new iPad sucks compares to other Apple device.  I feel for the price I paid, I am getting a mediocre device with multiple restrictions (mostly for business reasons such as no flash so that you have to stick with iTuen for movies) and no special talent other than the retina display.  Anyhow, I hope my love for iPad could increase a bit after Siri being available on new iPad in OS6.*UPDATE*:  another disappointment about new iPad - it takes ages to recharge.  I use the 10W USB power adapter and I closed the smart cover (sleep mode) when I was charging the new iPad.  I tested the battery at 3 different times, and it is roughly 10% increase per 35 minutes, which means it will take roughly 5 hours and 50 minutes to charge from 0% to 100% full, which is very close to PC world's report.  On another note, the techs at Apple store told me that apps and bluetooth draw a lot of power, so that I should close them if I want to save battery.*UPDATE 2*: on the postive side - I downloaded the GPS drive app and it actually works without data plan.  The catch is that you have to get the direction while you have internet access, and then it will take you to your destination without continuous 3G/4G or wireless connections.  However, you won't be able to get another direction to a new place unless you have internet, nor can you find the nearby restaurants, gas station, etc without internet connection.*UPDATE 3\"(8/2/12): Amazon Prime videos are now available on iPad!!  The video quality is pretty good, but I don't think it is HD quality.*UPDATE 4*(9/27/2012): I updated my iOS to version 6, and I like it so far!  Siri is now incorporated to my iPad 3, and I've been talking to her ever since.  Youtube app is gone from my iPad, Apple says their contract with YouTube is expired.  So for now, I have to use Safari to watch youtube.  Google maps is gone and replaced with Apple's new map system.  It does voice turn-by-turn direction, but I haven't really tested it out yet.  As for other newly released apps, for some strange reason, iPad 3 owners did not get to have passbook app.  I guess Apple figures that I won't be carrying my iPad around to the airports, concerts, or watching a movie, or going to a ballgame, which I do....*UPDATE 5*(10/28/2012): Apple just announced few days ago that they have a new iPad (for convenience, let's call it iPad 4) - by looking into the technical specs, I think the only two changes are: the chip (upgraded to A6 from A5), and the power adapter (from the 30-pin to lightening connector).  In the future, someone has to comment on whether the lightening power adapter is able to charge the iPad faster than the 30-pin adapter. Otherwise, I don't see any benefit of changing power adapter, as the the lightening charger won't work with previous versions of power docks.  People who are interested in buying the mini iPad should also know that the mini iPad does not have retina display (it is 163 ppi), and thus no HD.  On a separate note, I've been testing the Apple's new map system recently, and the results are so far so good! I think in some ways it is better than Motion X HD (a paid third party GPS app).  To summarize: First, the color system in Apple's map only has four to five colors, but that is not a issue to me, as it looks plain but clear.  Second, you can only get one voice: the voice of Siri, but it sounds great, so no complain.  Third, Apple's map gives much earlier warning compares to Motion X in terms of the next direction.  I had many experience that Motion X was late on telling me to take an exist or make a turn.  So kudos to Apple's map.  Overall, I don't know why there are so much criticism against Apple's map (most complaint is that the map system is not as mature as Google's).  I mean, it is possible that Apple's map won't work for you if you are going to somewhere remote, but you can always double check on Google's map using Safari.  I think if you mainly use Apple's map in places other than country side, then you should be fine!  After all, you don't need to pay extra (Motion X is $10/year) for voice navigation.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lamen terms please!!!", "Author": "D. Young", "ReviewID": "R2AFF3T31DXVP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, first of all I have read through about 10 customer reviews of this new iPad 3rd Gen. I must say that I am very impressed at some of these \"editorial like reviews\". Well after all of the technical stuff, I'd like to just keep it plain and simple.I never owned an iPad before last week. I was always saying that Apple was overrated and actually they're not. I have owned all kinds of \"other\" cellphones, smartphone and tablets. Well, last month I finally brokedown and purchased an iPhone 4S and now this cool looking iPad 3rd gen 32GB. I will just say that it makes my Samsung Galaxy Tab look pretty lame and boring. I had ordered mine online and could not wait for it to arrive earlier this week. Well anyway, I opened it up registered it on iTunes and began to sync it to my account. Well after that I began to mess around with everything and had so much fun doing so, that I didn't go to bed until really late. I was impressed that it was fully charged up when I turned it on for the first time. The graphics are second to nothing elso out. I purchased some Beats by Dre Studio headphones so I could listen to music and movies in quiet places. I love everything about the new iPad...I really don't even need a regular desktop anymore. I have considered buying an iMac desktop maybe later on down the road. I heard that some people complained about the iPad getting hotter than normal on one side, well mine has not so far, I assume Apple fixed the problem with that.Now, on the flip-side of the coin, I must say this new iPad is really heavy and dense like, I am turned off from that aspect, especially since a lot of reviews say the iPad 2 is much lighter, why is this one so heavy!? Secondly, I think this model should have an sD card reader and at least one USB 2.0 port. Lastly, I think they should have added Siri to this new iPad since she's such a hit with the iPhone 4S.Well hopefully this review is pretty simple to absorb and can be really helpful to someone. All and all, I really enjoy my \"new iPad\", but the last things I mentioned above is the reason why I gave it an 8/10 or equally 4/5 stars rating.**Forgot to mention**, iTunes is really cool and now they have the iCloud feature. So what ever you decide to download it will automatically appear in other Apple devices that you have registered. I currently own 2 other devices and it's nice not to have to download everything via the computer, with iCloud it's already there.**UPDATE**  9/22/12 A few days ago, I was able to update my iPad 3rd Generation to iOS 6 (so this means \"Ms. Siri\" is now available on this generation of iPads).

It does absolutely everything I need.  I love having the built in full size USB port, MicroSD card and true dolby stereo speakers.  So you are probably asking, why did you buy an Ipad then.I wanted to check out some new technology and I already know Apple makes some great products for graphic/audio and Education.  Well I like the interface and ability to truly close out programs.  But you know what?  The Apple bogs down when truly multitasking.  The android puts apps in a suspended state, so you can have dozens of apps open.  Android \"claims\" it is ok, but the performance does start to hurt.  The iPad simply gets hot and bogs down if you do the same things.The iPad has a better and more solid feel, it is a snappier interface, but it is locked down.  The Android is semi-locked down, but easy to change.  You don't have to have a face full of icons.If I had to start over again, I wouldn't buy either at this date and time.

Don't fall for either an Android or iPad at this particular time.  They are all over priced and the limitations are frustrating.

This product is advertised as allowing you to sign-up for service one month, drop the service when you don't need it, and then reactivate the service when you want it again.  DON'T BELIEVE IT!I used the Verizon service for one month, deactivated and received the message that my sim card is associated with another account or is no longer supported.  When I updated to the new IOS 6, the sim card was magically reactivated (!) and I could use the service again.  I signed up for a month's service again and at the end of that month's service, I deactivated and received the same non-service alert.All Apple forums on this problem have the same complaints.  Consumers need a new sim card and are hassled at the Verizon store to change service.  As far as I am concerned, this is false advertising so I have filed a complaint with the FCC as recommended in the Apple forum.  I am waiting for a call from Verizon before proceeding with replacing the sim card.  If I need to constantly replace a sim card then that should be stated in the advertising.The reason I purchased the new iPad was to be able to use it and pay for ONLY the months I WANTED and NEEDED, not for what Verizon wanted to sell me.

I'm giving this one star because of the ordering problems, not the product (I hope that folks are more likely to read this if I put it down as a negative review rather than a positive one).The fist seller, \"IMG Direct\", sent me an obviously used 3rd generation iPad in the box of a 4th generation iPad.  The order was fulfilled by Amazon.  Amazingly, Amazon took the blame for this as a \"packaging error\" and voided my 2 star rating for the IMG Direct on the grounds that it was Amazon's fault(!).  I strongly suspect it was IMG Direct that supplied Amazon with the re-marked product.The second seller, \"Wirelessnow\", sent me a new 3rd generation iPad with the box relabelled to appear to be a 4th generation iPad.  At least it was a *new* 3rd generation iPad! (I'm planning to upload a picture of the remarked box.)I'm going to make my third attempt to order a 4th generation iPad, but this time the order will be direct with Apple!Looking through the reviews of a number of sellers, including \"IMG Direct\" and \"Wirelessnow\", i see a pattern where customers complain that they were shipped the wrong item and give a 1 star review.  Amazon then apologizes for the mistake and voids the review (the review remains readable but the 1 star score doesn't seem to count against the seller's rating!).This behavior is not limited to my two sellers -- its true of some other sellers as well!I'm going to speculate that Amazon actually pays the seller the ~$600 price for the mis-labelled item based on their \"failure to fulfill it properly\", so that this is a win-win situation for the seller.If the customer doesn't notice they've been shipped a cheaper product, the seller pockets the profits.  If the seller does notice and complains, Amazon takes the blame as a \"fulfillment error\" and gives the seller most or all of the original list price.If my speculation is correct and you're a seller, this is great!  Its a win-win situation.  Either the customer misses the substitution and you collect $100 or $200 more than the shipped product is worth, or the customer catches the substitution and Amazon takes the blame -- and you're still laughing all the way to the bank!

Howes", "ReviewID": "R9GHM1VDIAW18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an iOS developer, I've owned all 3 generations of iPads. I also own a couple other tablets: a Kindle Fire and an HP Touchpad, so I have some perspective about usability.  In terms of general usability in the most situations, an iPad is the way to go, it has the most and best tablet apps, and the best hardware. This release took the solid base of the iPad 2, and added the best screen I have ever seen, a very nice camera and real 4G networking. This review is about whether you should switch from an iPad 2 or possibly even buy the still available iPad 2.First, the negatives. The new screen with 4x the pixels, the 4 core GPU to draw into it, the LTE radio, all three conspired to make Apple put in a much bigger battery, making it heavier--yes you can actually feel the difference--and longer to charge. Because Apple uses an extension of USB to charge at 2.1 Amps, which is unchanged from previous editions, it took me 5 hours 57 minutes to go from 0% to 100% charged using the Apple provided charger, compared to 4 hours 14 minutes with last year's model. As a consequence of using more energy in the same 10+ hour usage, the device can get mildly warmer.While the front facing FaceTime camera is unchanged in quality, it's still dismal especially in low light, you know the kind of light you're likely to have when you are inside thinking about video chatting over Wi-Fi.Because developers will need to replace their bitmap graphics with additional copies that are 4 times the resolution, a Retina display updated app could potentially be 5x larger in the worst case, although that would be unusual. Still, apps will take up more room. This isn't an advantage over the iPad 2, as the iPad 2 will be laden with the same bulked up apps, with no advantage given.Now, on with the positives.Great screen. Really you have to see text on this thing. It's like you are typing into a laser printer. Not only that, but better color reproduction. I did a side by side comparison with my iPad 2, watching a synced up copy of Puss n Boots, the iTunes 1080p copy and the older device had a bit of too much orange in it, just a bit which you wouldn't likely notice without the side by side but glaringly obvious if you did. And 1080p content is spectacular on this display where all 2.1 megapixels can be shown without scaling down.I purchased the Verizon LTE model. This has the advantage that Verizon is allowing personal hotspot tethering, while AT&T; is not. I've had tethering on my iPhone and when I've needed it, such as taking my family on vacation with a laptop, the Fire, an iPod Touch and an iPad 2, it's been a Godsend in a Wi-Fi scarce world.  The LTE is zippy fast when you can get it, unfortunately that doesn't include my house, where it drops down to Verizon's inferior CDMA network, which is noticeably slower than AT&T;'s GSM network, but I wasn't going to use it from my house.  Put it this way, an iTunes 1080p movie is 2GB max; Verizon charges you $30 for the first 2GB. If you still have an AT&T; unlimited plan from your iPad 2, I think you can move it to a new AT&T; model, but be careful.This release reputedly comes with double the RAM at 1GB which mainly shows up in the much larger number of tabs you can quickly switch between in Safari, a nice sweetener.The backfacing isight camera is about the specs of the one in the iPhone 4S, excepting being 5 instead of 8 megapixels, which is fantastic, excepting the part about using a 10 inch tablet to take pictures or shoot video. Why couldn't they have put this camera on the front?\"Audio to text about comes with this release this is a bit hit or miss and you might be lucky to have a clear and constant voice which allows you to text at your text\". As you can see, it doesn't like my voice, but it is a potentially cool feature.So, in the end, I think choosing this over an iPad 2 comes down to whether you love clean text and demand the most beautiful video. If you need faster charging times and want to save money stay with the 2. Next year there will be a new new iPad, with a faster processor, a more efficient LTE chipset, Siri, a decent front facing camera, and whatever else they can think of to part you with your money,", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Who's Ipad is it????", "Author": "IronmanFX", "ReviewID": "R2GIWZQB7E66J1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered my Ipad on July 25th of 2012.

While loyal Apple fans or people who want to use the basic apps but appreciate its design you'll likely give it a 5-star.  So I had to go with the 4-star to be fair.Where the iPad 3 shines:- Gorgeous screen; not much complaint here as watching HD movies including Netflix and YouTube video is amazing- Thin & lightweight; for its size, it's not too big of a hassle to carry around- Beautiful design overall; Apple pretty much set a standard for today's tablets and they still keep simplicity in a beautiful design- Simple; you don't need to know how to use Apple products, great for kids and adults that aren't exactly tech savvy- Amazing battery life; I could play Minecraft for hours and don't eat up batteries like other tablets do- Very responsive; for the most part depending on the app.  Rarely freezes (yes, it still does freeze from time to time) and is fast enough to run any HD games and apps.Where iPad 3 doesn't impress:- No flash.  Flash enabled sites either need a flash compatible browser if not you cannot view the content.- No GPS for the Wifi version; this would annoy you if you're looking to use it for navigation (you'll need separate GPS module made by another company that cost at least $100)- Slow charging; with the wall charger it comes, it does charge very slow.  The only negative side of the longer lasting tablet- Keyboard is not intuitive; difficult to type in landscape mode, no swype or other after-market keyboard like Android has- Expensive; for the money you'd think you'll get more out of the unit- Screen size icons; for the massive screen, you don't have a way to cram more icons forcing you to either create folders within or use multiple screens.- Many apps that are free on Android market often times are not free on Apple Stores.- Proprietary plugs; when will Apple learn?  No HDMI, mini-USB, etc.I personally recommend the iPad Wifi version for:- General entertainment for games, movies and news reading + where Wifi is available- Children; easy to navigate and use- Don't care about GPS navigation or use it for related purpose- Are not tech savvy or don't mind not having flash options- Want something simple and reliable- Want long battery lifeI don't recommend the iPad Wifi version if you:- Want to use this in the car, boat or wherever you need a GPS for navigation and plotting- Want to do any sort of modification including custom ROM's- Need flexibility in terms of the O/S- Are looking for cost savings and best bang for your moneyPersonally I'm more of an Android guy than Apple guy but it doesn't mean Apple's products are bad either.  It's one beautiful tablet I've ever played around with (it's my wife's) and aside from it not having GPS and other features available on Android, it's a solid performer.On a personal note, if they come out with a 7\" tablet I wouldn't mind owning one.  Especially if it had GPS even on the Wifi version I'd buy one in a heartbeat.  To me, the pro's outweigh the con's for the iPad 3.  For as long as I can remember I've been a PC-guy where I didn't care for Apple but ever since iPod's came out, they've really changed the computer industry.You won't regret your purchase either way.

So, like anyone else who had ordered the new iPad on the same day Apple announced it, I snatched my package up and ran into my room, closed the blinds, slit the package open, and turned the slate on. And the rest is history.Actually, most of that is a lie. I waited in shifts with my fianc\u00e9 to sign off on our packages, and then let the iPad sit in its shipping box for a few hours while I tried to sort out a racial conflict in Mass Effect 3. Anyhow, I did eventually open it, and now that I've spent nearly half a week using my iPad to do a variety of different tasks, I feel comfortable writing a brief little review of the device, to follow up my review of the Acer Iconia A500 tablet that I reviewed late last year.The first thing a user will notice when picking up the iPad is that it looks identical to the iPad 2. However, this third iteration is also slightly heavier, has a wider camera lens on the back, and, apparently, has slightly more tapered edges. I don't know about that, but to be totally frank, I couldn't have told the physical form factor apart from the iPad 2 if you'd held them in front of me. And that's OK with me, to be frank. The iPad, like all high-quality tablets, has a simple and understated look that stays out of the user's way. Like previous iterations, the 3rd generation iPad comes in two flavors (black and white), with a variety of storage (16, 32, 64 gigs) and connection arrangements (Wi-Fi and LTE (4g)). Whether you care to pay for the extra space or connectivity is a matter of personal preference, I opted for just the 16 gig Wi-Fi only model. So my review is based on that.Once you turn your new toy on, you'll notice the retina display. It's impossible not to. The screen on the iPad has effectively 4 times the number of pixels as previous generations, despite remaining the same size. Text on the screen is as crisp as print, and colors are more vibrant and defined. If you've spent any time with a laptop, desktop, tablet or Smartphone, you'll be able to see the difference immediately. It's gorgeous, and as near to life-like as we're like to get (for a few more years, anyway...). A lot of people are saying the retina screen is worth upgrading for alone. I don't know if that's totally true, but it is certainly a good argument.Despite the massive increase in pixel density, the iPad doesn't slow down at all. It packs an enhanced A5X processor chip inside, which runs a quad-core processor (basically as fast as most laptops and computers now, if not faster), and since it runs a smaller screen without all of the hardware attachments, the extra speed is put into driving the display with fluid speed. It's a lot of fun to just flip the pages back and forth. The quad-core processor also enables more advanced graphics for games; expect to see a few envelope-pushers coming out soon, like Epic/Chair's Infinity Blade: Dungeons here soon. With a quad-core, we might even see some more console games debut on the iPad, like GTA III did last year, to major success. The speed of the machine, plus the mobility, and the glorious retina display make for a beautiful, fun gaming experience. While there are very few retina-ready games out, most still up-scale well and look quite purdy. I use my iPad primarily for web-surfing and gaming, and I'm very glad I waited for the retina display.Oh, yeah. Web surfing. There's something so much more appealing about surfing the web on a tablet as compared to doing it on a laptop or other dedicated computing device. The tactile scrolling, the literal pointing and clicking, the meandering finger-tracing through websites and wiki-safaris--it makes for a great experience that leaves the user loathe to return to their old machines (I've taken to calling my laptop the \"diesel rig\"). While RSS-readers are available through most major browsers, the iPad (and other mobile devices) make a show of formatting a user's plethora of feeds and headlines into magazine forms. With my Acer tab, I used Google Reader to do just that, but on the iPad, there is a better alternative: FlipBoard. Most of my news, I read through FlipBoard, and on the retina display, the text is just as crisp, smooth, and black as it would be on a high-quality magazine print. Except that I can poke an image and start a high-resolution video, or ride a hyperlink out in half a second to the host site. It's a lot of fun to flip through my FlipBoard and read disparate articles from the wild range of feeds I subscribe to. I can sit there all day reading and flipping, poking and reading. The retina-ready FlipBoard app is the epitome of mobile media consumption: beautiful, simple, yours. That experience is worth buying the iPad for, let alone the bevy of excellent games, software, and the retina-display.I want to comment on battery life real quick: It's the same as the last iPad. Excellent. Ten hours with heavy usage, but I've gotten a lot more than that out of it already. I ran the thing down once after watching about three and a half hours of video, playing about four hours of games, surfing for five or six hours, and letting it standby for about twenty over two nights. It's a far cry better than the competition, but, here's a bit of a catch: it takes forever to charge. And the battery gets warm while you use it. This might lead to a heating problem in some models, so beware of that, but as far as I know, there haven't been any major complaints about the heating.There have been some complaints about the camera(s), though I don't know why. The camera is gorgeous, a five-megapixel beauty on the back and a decent one megapixel on the front. The two-way deal allows for backwards and forwards video calls, like the Acer tab did, which is a nice touch, especially with Apple's Facetime videoconferencing software. At the bottom, I've included a few sample shots I took with my iPad camera. It's a nice piece of hardware. Not the best, but by all means perfectly acceptable for shooting anything a normal human would be pointing a camera at. If you're a camera dork, the lack of a flash LED might be a turn-off, but deal with it. Light a match or something.I'm going to wrap this up here: if you have the money, indulge yourself. When I was a kid, my father had a big, cream-colored PC with a monitor that weighed as much as I do. When I was in high school, schools and houses started to convert to flat-screen LCDs, and cell phones became common-place. Now I have a computer that is very probably more powerful, with a display twice as clear, and many times more vibrant than the one you're reading on. It's an incredible leap in technology, and a beautiful one, too.

The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 \"disappears\" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.

Some people recommend iPad cases with a built-in keyboard but the two I have tried have been too bulky reducing the fun of using it. These all in one keyboards are too small causing the keys to be unreliable for typing. Instead get a light bluetooth keyboard that you can use while propped up in bed or on a desk. Apple's keyboard that I got my wife works well but its on/off is clugey and it's too big & heavy. A better alternative is Amazon's Basics bluetooth keyboard for the iPhone and iPad. It works well and is very light, which is great while traveling.I haven't found a case I am crazy about. The challenge is that the case needs to provide protection without interfering with its operation- holding it, taking photos, etc. Make sure you get one with an adjustable angle so that you can use it in bed or on a desk. The Apple flip is nice but I feel it doesn't provide enough protection.Take care.Update 12-09-06: I've gotten Apple's latest case- iPad Smart Case, which is almost perfect, providing good protection.

WIth iPods, in contrast, they charge significantly lower prices. _Also be aware that Amazon Market vendor return policies are set by vendors INDIVIDUALLY not by Amazon._ Amazon generally has the most liberal return policies in the industry except for Costco, while individual retailers are generally much more strict.Here is my usage history with iDevices:I fell in love with the iPod Touch, 3rd generation, in 2009 when I bought it to see if it could really replace a netbook on my trips. I was dubious that a 3.5\" screen would \"work\" but the emergence of mobile-optimized websites coupled with \"double tap to perfectly zoom to full column size\" feature made it workable for reading the NY TImes and practically everything else. I read several novels on this during my trips, even though the 3rd gen did NOT have the current high resolution Retina feature.When the \"Retina Display\" 4th generation iPod Touch came out in 2010, it was a revelation in terms of reduced eyestrain. With my contact lenses out, or with high diopter (2.75) reading glasses, I could read comfortably for hours, and the built-in illumination was wonderful, no need for a miners headlamp when going to bed, no screen glare.I wasn't sure about the iPad when it came out, and skipped the first generation. I personally even skipped the second generation (iPad2) but bought one for my wife. She has a specific, limited consumption need - she watches foreign language videos on YouTube and on a foreign language subscription website. For those two purposes, the iPad2 screen was superb, and like the iPhone and iPod Touches it has a wide viewing angle, IPS screen - compared to my laptops and netbooks, viewing angles were a breeze. With my laptops and netbooks, I couldn't shift my head up or down, I had to find the perfect \"tilt\" angle so the bottom and top of the screen were evenly bright and not washed out or black. With i-devices,  viewing angles are superb, colors are great - and this is true for all of them to date (with the latest \"new\" iPad being rated by one monitor-specific site as approaching professional quality for accuracy of colors and illumination levels). My wife could watch her iPad2 from almost any angle.But guess what? I was expecting to start to glom onto her iPad2 until it would be like a fight over the tv remote, but that never happened. I watched large video on my desktop, I read blogs and news and books on my iPod Touch! When I tried reading on the iPad2, I found the resolution was too low - it was like sliding back to a 3rd generation iPod Touch in terms of quality. Not easy on the eyes. Good compared to a netbook screen, but not as good as a Kindle e-reader (not the Fire) or as good as a 4th gen iPod Touch.When the \"new\" iPad came out, I knew it would be game-changing, with a ultra sharp \"type.\" Now that I've had it for several months, I believe it is. But is it essential?I have been switching back and forth between my \"new\" iPad and my wife's iPad2 over the past few months, and undoubtedly the new iPad is a MUCH more pleasant \"reading\" experience. THIS is the best e-reader on the market - do the math - it is in COLOR so highlight colors, chapter headings, book covers, illustrations, all POP, while the text is as easy to read as on an e-ink reader, PLUS illumination is BUILT-IN. THIS is the wave of e-readers of the future.Reading email and Facebook is easier too.All icons are sharper.VIDEO IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. Remember, the iPad2 could already display 720p. Bumping up to 1080p on the new iPad doesn't provide significantly better video. GAMING IS BETTER because the smarter game programmers are using the extra video horsepower for better action and shading NOT for higher resolution per se. The new video chip in the new iPad is simply head and shoulders better than in the prior iPad2 even if the actual processor is the same speed (the cpu vs. the gpu).So why do I find my self using my iPod Touch and desktop MUCH more than the new iPad or the iPad2?Simply, size. 10.1\" is a little heavy to hold. When I am reading a book where the book design is important, the new iPad is terrific. But that is rare. Most of my reading is \"just text\" and the 3.5\" screen of the iPod Touch is more than adequate for that - long ago I got used to frequent page flipping, it doesn't bother me anymore.So what is my shopping recommendation?If you aren't satisfied with your \"smartphone\" (it's too small, but that is in the process of changing, already in the Android market and soon in the iPhone world) you may well be happy with an iPad. If you are mainly watching video, the iPad2, still in production, has much better battery life (they just improved the battery life by moving to a smaller \"die size\" for the processor/gpu - check Anandtech for the details) and fine video. If you mainly read email, blogs, and browse the web, and ESPECIALLY if you plan on reading a lot of books, don't think twice, buy the new iPad.But be forewarned that rumors are flying that Apple is releasing a 7.85\" tablet soon, probably with the same resolution as the iPad2 (which means sharper letters since the screen is smaller), and that may be the \"sweet spot\" in terms of size that a lot of us have been waiting for. Also, rumors are flying that Apple intends to \"upsize\" the iPod Touch and also the iPhone to a 3.95\"/4.01' screen, which will make it easier to read while still being light and comfortable in the hand.Finally, Apple devices have done remarkably well at holding their value, and Amazon has an excellent re-purchase program for small electronics, and pays some of the industries highest prices for used i-devices. There probably isn't a more significant \"game changing\" electronic gizmo in the last decade than the iPhone and iPad. You won't go wrong or regret an iPad purchase, and except for slightly shorter battery life there is no _negative_ to purchasing the latest and greatest - the price didn't even go up this round (although the iPad2 in 16gb only was retained).16gb is enough for photos and books. 32gb or larger is recommended if you intend to load up a lot of games, download movies or a lot of music, or take a lot of videos.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good purchase", "Author": "Ah Pui", "ReviewID": "R3R2O5CP6OICN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "as a first time tablet user, I am simply blown away by the new stunning ipad. The screen is simply gorgeous and the clarity and crispness of the text is literally like reading a paper in hand. Can't really describe it as you have to see it to believe it. I feel like I can touch the text itself instead of reading them through a screen. If you use ipad as a book reader, I highly recommend you to get it. The text quality do improve a whole lot. But I think regular gallery pictures and videos will look the same in your regular non-retina devices.I couldn't seem to find too many retina-ipad3 specific apps out there in the wild that I am interested in. I am not a big gamer so I will have to wait to see how other productivity apps will look in this stunning new screen. Flipboard and Pulse do look absolutely amazing and the browsing experience is even more elevated here.After lots of research, I believe the only sure smartcover for ipad that is guaranteed to work is the Apple Smartcover. So I purchased one with it and so far happy with my decision. I did get some minor scratches on the back already so I am rushing to get a Smartcover partner to protect the backcase. I am the kind of guy who aren't usually careful with gadgets but this ipad just have the magic draw to get pamper.Can't comment too much on the battery life, but it still hasn't drained out after days of playing. So it looks good! Wish there is a wireless wifi charger for this baby like the rumored Samsung S3 has. then it would be perfect! Since ipad does not have any usb ports, it comes along with a wall charger. But I didn't find it as a hindrance at all given its long battery life. My overall interaction with my new ipad is an absolute joy as everything is so easy to use and very intuitive. Kudos to Apple for making such a gorgeous, simple and clean, and absolutely intuitive product.Before settling on the new ipad, I have been debating whether to go for android tablet or not. I am a very happy android smartphone user so is not allergic to the android ecosystem. But the android tablet world is a different beast. Most of the android apps seem to tailor more to the smartphone so won't look as good on the tablet. Hard to find Android 4.0 Ice-cream sandwich even on the latest android tablets so the current bunch look dated. Granted there are a lot more hardware options to choose from and specs maybe more powerful, but none match the quality, ease of use and overall look and feel of ipad. The other factor that seal the deal for me is that the resale value of ipad is so overwhelming strong that I can safely buy it now and upgrade it later in the future, knowing that my current device will still fetch a pretty penny.For would be first-time tablet/ipad users, I highly recommend going for it. It is going to be a wonderful experience that you have to own it to believe it. Given the high resale value of the currently existing ipad2 and how the new ipad costs pretty much the same as before, upgrading it is not a bad idea at all. For those people on the fence about getting an ipad or android tablets either existing, or the upcoming Samsung Note or tab tablet, or even the highly anticipated Asus transformer infinity, you own it to yourself to give the new ipad a try.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "3 Generations in and Still No Equal", "Author": "Vincent E.

The tablet has become and extension of my arm!My Apple iPad.  What started out as a nice to have toy, has become the virtually indispensable tool for making sense of my increasingly hectic life.  There isn't a day that goes by when I am not on the device; from checking my e-mail, to sending and receiving text messages; from checking my calendar to playing games with friends and family; from posting to Facebook or Twitter to listening to NPR's morning edition; reading the latest news from the AP, New York Times, Politico, NPR, or The Daily, to listening to music on-line or stored on my hard drive; from logging into my business network via VPN, to talking to me daughter via FaceTime, almost everything I need to get done on my laptop I can now do on my iPad.Now Apple has released the iPad 3 and those of us who use the iPad 2 are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  I was satisfied with the iPad 2, but never wanting to be behind the technology curve I decided to order the newest offering from Apple in the exact same configuration as the last; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi+4G\" version.The iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G FactsOn the surface the iPad 3 is not demonstratively different from the iPad 2.  Featuring an Apple designed Dual-core A5X, low power, high performance processor, the 1.44 pound (1.46 pounds for the Wi-Fi + 4G) iPad 3 is a tad thinner than the iPad 2, though the screen size stays the same.  Other than that, there are no physical changes to the tablet.  Under the skin however, Apple has included a Retina display that offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch.  The other notable change concerns the front and rear facing cameras, which now offer 5MP autofocus resolution and HD video recording.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 4G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.37\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The iPad 3 (available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 4G LTE: UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+/DC -HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 3 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (1080p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.Re-syncing with iTunes or iCloudThe iPad 3 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 3 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 2 showed up on my iPad 3, since the last time I \"physically\" backed up the tablet via iTunes, right before I started using iCloud to perform back-ups.So I finished the restore via iCloud which took close to three hours to complete.  No big deal; I plugged the tablet into A/C, started the restore and went to bed. I did restore all of my music (15GB) via iTunes however, and that took considerably longer than 3 hours to accomplish; again another overnight chore.  I suppose if I purchase more iCloud storage I could back up everything including my music, but I see no need to pay for additional storage; 10GB would set me back $20.00 a year; 20GB = $40.00/year, and; 50GB = $100.00/year.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account; I also have my iPhone 4S and iPod 3rd Generation synced.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"VPN AccessThe iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G VPN can be togged on and off at will.Personal HotspotNew to the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is the Personal Hotspot, which allows you to share the tablets' cellular data connection in order to connect computers and other devices to the Internet.  Nice!!!First ImpressionsLike the iPad's that have come before it, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, play a game, post to social networks, log into my business network and access my workstation, read e-mail, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business as well as personal e-mail.Today while typing out this review on my iMac, I fired up my iPad 3 and I played Hanging with Friends with an old friend in Maryland, held a text conversation with a friend visiting Vegas and another in downstate Illinois, read e-mails from 3 separate accounts, posted to Facebook & Twitter, while listening to music via Pandora! Last night while grilling BBQ chicken on the patio I streamed music from my iPad to a portable Bose speaker via Bluetooth!Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I started using the iPad I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 4G and, instance access.Heat & NoiseThere has been much to do about the heat the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G gives off, and while I have noted that the tablet gets a little warmer than its predecessor, the degree of change is in no way uncomfortable.  So, I have to ask what all the fuss is about!?ConclusionsI like the iPad; it is the must have device of the decade, period for anyone who wants to stay connected!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99), or an increasing number of similar applications.  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office, though again via Apps that is changing.  For instance I purchased an App last week that allows me to access our Microsoft SharePoint 2007 environment and manipulate documents contained in Lists and Document Libraries.  This is a big deal as more and more business content is shared and or stored on SharePoint in a number of businesses.  The availability of VPN on the iPad makes this possible.There are also a number of very good RDP applications available in the App Store that will allow me to log into my workstation at the office and manipulate date via VPN. As the number of Apps that mimic , and or reproduce the business environment increase so too with the iPad's usefulness as a business tool!Hands down, the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! The new Retina display has made considerable difference in the reading of text on the tablet.  Whereas before my eyes would start to hurt after just 15 minutes of book reading on the older iPads, not I can read continually without discomfort, the text acuity has improved that much!Yes, the entrance fee ($829.00 for iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great display for text and graphics", "Author": "Stan Gibilisco", "ReviewID": "R2EXRAYX55HXHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this device mainly because of its high-resolution display (2048 x 1536 pixels). To me, clear text and graphics matter more than anything else. I need a device that can do simple Web browsing on Wi-Fi, but I don't need the high-powered features such as 4G LTE or great video (yet). The display lives up to my best expectations. I've never seen anything else like it. It's as clear as the finest printed book pages ever were.I'm conducting experiments in \"dynamic book publishing\" right now, and I want readers to see the text and simple graphics (grayscale technical drawings) clearly. This device is perfect for that application, although at times I feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini at 20 miles an hour because I have not come close to utilizing all the capabilities of the device. The new iPad can play movies just like a TV set, and I'm looking at plain text and line drawings. But oh, what crisp letters and numbers and equations and pictures they are!I've read some complaints in the blogosphere about poor Wi-Fi sensitivity and slow, hot battery charging in the new iPad. I have a Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire, and the new iPad works better on Wi-Fi than either of those devices. I took the iPad to several local establishments and tested it on Wi-Fi, and never got any result other than all three bars lit (strong signal). The new iPad also has better range with my router than an old laptop computer with a PC card wireless modem has. It does take awhile to change the battery, about 6 hours from minimum to a full charge, but I expected this result because the new iPad's battery has greater capacity than the one in previous versions. (It takes longer to fill up a big \"electricity tank\" than it takes to fill a smaller one at the same power level.) I didn't notice excessive heat during the charging process, as some people have complained about.I've heard one limitation that I take quite seriously: Don't drop this thing from shoulder height and expect it to work afterwards. The display will likely shatter.For my purposes, an iPad 2 would have done well enough. But I wanted something that would do better than well enough, and this thing does. It's my first Apple since I had an old \"II Plus\" back in 1982. With this new toy in hand, I'm getting tempted to buy an iMac so I can produce iBooks on it, and in general enjoy Apple's world!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet still, but not better enough than the iPad 2", "Author": "William B. Partridge", "ReviewID": "RUAHDQH0PLB6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is, without a doubt, the best tablet on the market. It's what's all other tablets aspire to be, hands down. The problem is that while it's better than the iPad 2, the difference might not be enough.So what's different?  The screen is now 4 times the resolution.  It's the best screen on a tablet, by miles. If you were to display a picture of icecream on the screen you'd be tempted to even lick it. RAM is also now doubled which leads, most notably so far, to less reloading of pages when you use multiple tabs in browsing.  The graphics processor is also better, while the main processor it self remains at the same speeds.  The differences in this, so far, aren't perceivable.  The back camera is also improved but I'm not really sure who's taking pictures with their iPad.  If you go with the LTE option, well that's going to clean the floor with the 3G versions, but that's up to you. On the downside the tablet is now also a little heavier (it is noticeable, but you'll forget about it) and runs warmer with long use (this is also noticeable and you won't be able to ignore it unless you're using a case).  Also Apple changed the polarity of the sleep/wake magnets so now nearly all 3rd party cases that you have from the iPad 2 won't work that way.What's not different? iOS. All the pros and cons are still there. The front camera is also still VGA. While the graphics processor got a nice bump the CPU itself is still the same dual-core.I'm really disappointed Apple didn't improve the front camera.  A VGA camera on a screen this good is just a joke.  The rear camera, a camera I used maybe a dozen times in my ownership of my iPad 2 gets a massive upgrade but the camera I've used for hours of video chat is left where it was (even a year ago the VGA camera was terrible).  I can only assume it was left off to provide some feature for the next iPad.  What this product ultimately highlights now are the shortcomings with iOS. Aside from putting a better front camera in the device and addressing some of the backwards steps with the iPad 3 (temp, weight) there's really nothing else Apple can do with this device.  The main hold over from the iPad 2 was the screen and that's been solved now.  Apple needs to, and appears to be doing (but slowly), work on the OS itself.  It's somewhat troubling that by and large iOS 5.1 looks and operates the same as iOS3 and 4.  The most notable of improvements has been the addition of the multitouch gestures and the addition of the notification system.  All nice additions but they don't really represent 2 years worth of changes.In comparison to the iPad 2 this is a nice upgrade, but ultimately it's not enough.  I'm not sure anything could have been enough to be honest though, but the fact that it runs hotter and is heavier don't help it in comparison.  While the screen is appreciable, the screen on the iPad 2 is still amazing in it's own right. If anything it's not a comment on poor quality of the new iPad but rather just that the iPad 2 was already so good.  The new iPad is a worthwhile upgrade from the original iPad or great for a first time buyer.Pros:++Screen++Extra RAM+iPhone and iPod touch based games now use their retina display apps for upscaling on the iPad (this is a REALLY nice improvement when you do use it).Cons:--Front facing camera is still the same-no new OS version = same old same old (e.g. no Siri)In addition, I'd like to compare this to Android tablets in general as I own both.  Android itself represents a better operating system.  Notifications are better, multitasking is better, and just the general usability of the device is better - especially with regard to the home screen.  What Android tablets fail to deliver, however, is the smoothness and richness that iOS offers.  Scrolling on a webpage in iOS versus in Android is just effortless.  It really shows off the imperfections of Android in general, much like how Android shows off the short comings of iOS.  The other issue is app selection.  Android doesn't have the heavy media hitters.  No Hulu Plus, no Xfinity, no HBO Go, no EA games, and just a general lack of quality applications (Android 2.2/2.3 based tablets and the Kindle Fire are exceptions but I'm focused on iOS 5 versus Honeycomb or ICS).  While the Google apps are hands down better on the Android side, they don't make up for the lack of entertainment on the iPad.  Also to note, a lot of the Android apps really don't feel like they take any advantage of the screen size difference, many of the apps feel just like scaled up phone applications where as iPad apps seem to have more thought put in to them for the extra size.While Android often times offers better and more features in it's core implementation, none of that matters when there's so little in comparison to do.  And nearly none of the things they both do are done as well on Android or as smoothly.  Yes, I miss widgets, GTalk integration, and a variety of other things when I use my iPad, but I ultimately use it a lot more because there's more to do.  If you own an Android phone (I do) there's not much really the tablet can do that my phone can't do already, so ultimately it just feels pointless.And I think that's a good point to consider.  Unless you hate Apple/iTunes, if you own an Android phone you'd probably be better off with an iPad to complement the phone.  Likewise might hold true for people who own an iPhone, an Android tablet might be better than the iPad.In the end, if you're looking for a tablet, get the new iPad.  Android may do more things on the front, but there's just less to do on it in most cases.  If you already own an original iPad or an Android tablet - this is worth the upgrade.  However, if you own an iPad 2, unless you really need LTE (and you won't tether your phone) this is a pass.  I made the change to get more storage space primarily (32GB wasn't cutting it anymore) but if not for that I'd have kept the iPad 2 instead.

By it's overwhelming usability. I'm so impressed by the versatility of the New iPad 4G Verizon LTE. I thought I would only use it to consume media. It does that and much more. In the first few days of ownership, I've used it as a portal into the world. I find it more comfortable than a PC to read Wikipedia, see amazing photos, and watch instructional videos. The display is the first mobile device to use XHD resolution -- much higher resolution and better fidelity than today's desktop monitors. When I travel, I no longer have to pack a wireless router, GPS (via cellular radio), Kindle, iPod, extra rechargers or cables. The iPad becomes a big battery WiFi hotspot via its cellular modem. I've loaded Windows 8 Consumer Preview on several notebooks. With the use of SplashTop server and iPad app called \"Win8 Metro Testbed\", I'm able to use the iPad as a Windows 8 tablet. Works well. This one device has both simplified and amplified my life. The device's primary negative is some screen glare and complete washout in bright sunlight. eInk is much superior in that environment.Update 17-Apr-2012: In Paris, both my New iPad and iPhone are working with Free.fr SIM cards. Free.fr's SIM is 20 Euros per month, prepaid, and includes 3GB data usage. If the device has a phone (iPhone) it includes unlimited voice and SMS. The iPhone needs no special settings. iPhone and iPad both work with Personal Hotspots feature on free.fr. For data use, the iPad requires an APN setting of \"free\" in Cellular Data settings, and again in Personal Hotspot if that feature is desired. Free.fr uses the Orange.fr 3G network -- France's largest. Using Speedtest.net, I usually get > 1Mbps download speeds and as high as 10Mbps sometimes.

This isn't the X brand tablet that will sit and sit like so many others.......2. Yes, its for consuming content. 90% of what I do is consume text/video/game with this device. Its replaced my newspaper and all of mags but I prefer my ol' black and white Kindle for long form reading. This is the greatest screen ever made ---but its bright. And that can be a hinderance for long reading session. And it flat out sucks to use outside i.e. poolside or at the beach etc. If you want a reader, this isn't for you.

Being able to fit 4x as much information on the screen is fantastic. Text remains sharp even when very small. SpeedTest on LTE from AT&T; topped out at 27 Mbps down and 14 Mbps up. Wish the data plans weren't so stingy, because at this rate you can blow through your month's allotment of 2GB in 10 minutes of downloading... but that's really AT&T;'s fault, not Apple's.Usability is second to none. I'm a pure Windows guy and even I concede defeat here. The iPad is intuitive and easy to use. It's also very responsive. Snappy when it switches back and forth between apps. Pinch/zoom and flipping motions are fluid. Android tablets are getting better all the time, but the iPad is still king here.Battery life is pretty good. With light use, I charge it probably every 2-3 days.With more apps being updated to take advantage of the high resolution display, I find more and more of my storage space being stealthily consumed. With 75 apps, 100 songs, 3 videos, and about 150 pictures, my 16GB iPad has about 5GB of free storage. If you're someone who feels the need to carry more of your music or video collection with you, you'll probably want the 32GB version.The iPad is locked down, so you're limited to the Apple-approved apps you can install through the App Store. This has always been a curse and a blessing. The experience is refined, but power users can feel confined. You can always jailbreak it, though at the expense of your warranty.The worst part about the iPad is having to use iTunes. It's got an outdated feel. It poorly manages media folders.

I don't need the 3G/Wi-Fi version so I purchased the 16GB Wi-Fi only version. Nothing changed on the design compared to the iPad 2 but the New iPad is a hairline thicker. What's great with The New iPad is the new faster processor (A5x), Improved Camera and the Retina Display.The new Apple A5x chip is awesome. It runs at a 1GHz dual core processor and a Quad Core GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) with 1GB of RAM which delivers a very great responsive experience.  It is very quick on opening applications, watching videos or playing games.The Retina display resolution is 2048 x 1536 which doubles the resolution of the iPad2.  Has a bright contrast and great viewing angles.  No problems using it outdoors, great for reading and watching movies.  You also get Video Out (using the charger slot on the buttom) on the New iPad but you need to get an optional digital AV adapter to get that feature to work.Love the Camera: The new improve 5MP iSight Camera which features an F2.4 lens sensor with back side lumination. The shutter button is now position on the right side for easy access compared from the previous one which is located on the buttom. Another improvement is the 1080p High Definition Video Recorder which moves at 29 frames per second.  It also has an Anti-Shake features to help capture that great video even if you have that shaky hands.Voice Dictation Service is another new feature if you don't want to type your messages, great for that long email replies.If you get the AT&T; or Verizon version, the micro sim slot card is on the left side of the tablet.Another great aspect that I love with the new iPad is Battery Life.

The 4:3 display format is a huge disadvantage compared to the Andoid tablets. My wife has an iPad 2 and for watching movies/videos I don't notice a quality difference between the two iPad's. So if you mostly watch movies save your money and don't bother with this tablet.Second - the lack of a microSD slot is inexcusable. The only way to interface with this device is with a computer & iTunes (it's Apples way or it's the wrong way - I guess they think their customers is too stupid to use this device without iTunes). So if you're like me and travel a lot you have to carry your laptop loaded with iTunes so you can add your media - very frustrating. Yes, I know you can buy a camera connection kit (another $30) and if you set it up correctly (8 character file names in a folder named DCIM) you can transfer your movies and photos (no music or anything else). But the SD Card must be FAT32 formatted which means a 4 gb file size limit - no good if you have lots of HD videos.

This review is not so much about the technical abilities of the iPad (which are well covered elsewhere), but more about the difficult-to-define allure of the product.People I know who also own an iPad, or who are considering buying one, often seem to spend some time coming up with justifications for the purchase: it'll help with their work, it will be great to watch movies on the train, it will keep the kids amused. After all, no-one *needs* an iPad; we can all get along quite adequately without one and at the back of our minds we are well aware of this. The iPad is expensive and for most of us it's a lot of money to fork out on what is essentially a luxury item. Deciding what you want to get out of the iPad, and whether there's a cheaper alternative available might be questions worth considering before committing.Having thought through the sensible stuff though, I, like many others was seduced, and parted quite happily with \u00a3500 odd in the expectation of...what exactly? You often see the words \"Apple\" and \"magic\" in the same sentence, and this ability to produce products which go beyond one's expectations are at the core of the company's success. Having bought an iMac a year or so ago, I was confident that I would again have my investment in an Apple product repaid several times over in the sheer enjoyment which goes with an amazement at the uncanny perfection of the product's capabilities.So, there I was in the Apple store, seated at a table, an attendant at the quasi-mystical ceremony at which my own iPad was removed from its packaging and prepared for set up. As this was the first day on sale, various people gathered to watch in awe. I was required to do the unboxing and unveiling, instructed in every move by the assistant. After removing the protective sleeve it was time to flick the button and bring life to the screen. A hush descended. As smooth as silk, the interface appeared in all its cool beauty. This truly was a work of art.Six months on and it's almost always in constant use, whether by me or another member of the family. Interestingly, different aspects seem to appeal to different people.For me it's the mail which is probably the singularly most useful feature. I have my work email as well as private email accounts all in the mail application. The messages are clearly laid out, and writing and responding I find is easy enough on the keyboard, though I know a lot of people don't find it so; it takes a while to adapt your hand shape to the keyboard, but the predictive text ensures that even if you hit the wrong key the word will probably still appear as you intended. Somehow Apple have made even such a mundane program as mail glamorous, and Excel, Word and pdf documents look spectacularly clear and professional on the retina display.Kids love the apps, particularly the gaming ones of course, and there's always a new one coming along in this seemingly inexhaustible supply of the new and extraordinary.Photos look a million dollars on the new screen and iPhoto ensures that albums can be easily organised. The iPad cleverly syncs with your PC so not just photos, but music moves seamlessly between the two.iTunes, YouTube and the BBC app mean you could be entertained for hours, if you should so choose. Whatever you watch you'll be treated to pin-sharp definition. The sound is fine on the basic headphones.All these things, in my opinion, make this a luxury worth having. However, the iPad is somehow more than the sum of its parts, and the robustness of its manufacture (I can attest to this as it's been dropped from a height on more than one occasion) together with the absolute lack of any indication whatsoever that there are actually processors whirring and chips buzzing below that crystalline surface, instil a confidence that this is somehow more than just a mass-market device.

I needed to justify a tablet purchase, so I narrowed the research between Asus Prime 300 (not the Transformer one with the WiFi issues), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and the new iPad.  I thoroughly researched and tested each tablet online and in-store and decided to take a bite out of Apple.  I've only owned for 3 days with heavy use, but will update should my experience change in the coming weeks.Hardware:  Although I thought Apple was more style than substance, I must admit that iPad is a pretty looking device.1. It is minimalistic in it's design, sleek, and seems easy for both my wife and I to hold and control.  It does seem to get warm after long use though.  As I'm sure many others have already mentioned, the retina display is gorgeous.  I've never owned a tablet before, but did test the Asus and Samsung and this one is definitely ahead.  It makes browsing the web, looking at photos, and just about everything else you do with a tablet a more enjoyable experience.  I imagine that if I never saw the iPad display I would have never missed it, but boy, after you see this thing it makes looking at other screens harder.2. I also thoroughly enjoy using the camera.  I initially thought a 5 megapixel camera (compared to my 8 MP camera on my EVO) would be a disappointment, but I was surprised by the quality.  Although it doesn't have a flash, it still takes quality pictures in decent light.  I've also learned that camera sensor quality and arpeture (sic) play a huge role in picture quality and not the megapixel count, so my guess these are at play here.3. I really haven't used the speakers or headphone jack, so I can't speak to those, but overall, I think Apple did a great job with the tabgible aspects of this tablet, especially compared to others I tested.Operating System:  Again, I was accustomed to the flexibility of using Android with my smartphone and thought it was an ingenious concept to allow the user more control.  I'm a thirty-something and technologically sophisticated, so I wasn't intimidated by setting up an Android device.  I had always heard that Apple took a simpler approach with their devices, so I was curious to see this in action.1. Obviously, more tech savy users will prefer Android over Apple (performance aside) because it is extremely customizable.  Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is probably ahead in this category for users like myself, but for those users that won't demand this flexibility, I think iOS is fine.  Besides, I have become discouraged by the amount of time it takes Android to deploy their operating system updates to the various devices.  And of course, yesterday Apple announced iOS 6 by this fall.  I've heard that several Android tablets still don't have the latest ICS operating system even though it's been out for several months.  In the end, if you prefer flexibility over simplicity, then stick with an Android tablet.  If you don't care or won't use the flexilbity to its fullest potential, then Apple is just fine.2. I actually found the Apple  to be more flexible than I thought based on research before I bought the tablet.  I heard many Android fans complain about it.  Sure, not as flexible as Android, but I imagine that many tablet users over the age of 40-45 probably won't care or even notice.  And those under 40, most probably won't even explore the benefits of Android (just like when people overpaid for 1080P tv sets and didn't even use Blu-ray that much).  I haven't seen any hangups or crashes that I had become used to with my Android device.  I know I comparing a smartphone to a tablet, but I know operating system issues when I see them.  I can't tell you how many times my smartphone has crashed and needed to be restarted after doing simple tasks.  I've run my new tablet through the mud and it continues to come through without any hitches.3. The performance is very crisp compared to the Android tablets I tested.  I know this can be hardware and operating system related, but I feel like this tablet just outperforms the others and delivers rapid response without any lag.  I almost started to cry when I double tapped a picture and it zoomed right away.  With my Android phone, I have to pray when I double tap that it won't crash and kick me out of my picture gallery.  I get frustrated when I tap on something and nothing happens.  And then get in more trouble when I tap again only to find out that it was just hung up trying to start.  I haven't experienced this yet with my tablet.  And before you criticize, I did experience some lag and crashes when testing the Android tablets too.Software (Apps):  Apple's library of apps is far superior to Android ,and they are even organized better to separate tablet apps from phone apps.  Although Apple doesn't offer as many free apps, they all seem to work well within the tablet and never crash.1. They also seem to have more apps optimized for the screen resolution.  I actually downloaded about 25 free apps the other day and they only used about 1 GB, so it seems that buying the low memory tablet won't stop me from enjoying dozens or hundreds of apps as long as I don't store too many photos, music, and video............and even then, iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage that can sync to your Mac or PC.2. The apps that come with the tablet aren't much to speak of, but the App store has too many nice ones to name............and surprisingly there are several good ones that are still free.Overall:  I never thought I could be convinced to buy an Apple product.  I used to make fun of relatives that bought their Apple laptops at prices greater than $1,000 for something I bought like a 17 inch Acer for $400 (still not sure what this big difference is for the Apple laptops).  But I must admit this tablet is worth the premium you pay compared to Android tablets, especially given the way that my family will use it.  Sure, it doesn't have USB output, expandable memory, standard HDMI output, etc, but I'm not sure that I would use those anyway.  And even if I did, there are some workarounds based on my network setup at home that are pretty easy to implement.  My wife and I will use this primarily for mobile web browsing, picture and video, game, news, finance, and productivity apps, and even offline news reading to/from work.  I might even hook up my nice Bose headphones to it once in awhile.  But based on that usage, I think we made the right decision.  I still think the Android tablets are nice too (especially the Asus brands), but iPad is a bit better for how I will be using it and for the things I think are important.  So am I a new Apple Fan Boy convert?  Only time will tell since this is my first Apple experience.  I don't think I will be buying their Macs or Macbook Pros anytime soon because I think they are way overpriced, but I really like what they have done with this tablet even though it's about $100 more than the competition at $499.  It suits my needs and I hit the lottery in that it will be updated with more features through iOS 6 this fall.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I-pad 3", "Author": "kens amazon", "ReviewID": "R386LKVBQUHLVH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it for my wife, she loves it see her playing with it all the time!!! dont know much about it myself but as long as she is happy, you know the rest!", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my iPad!", "Author": "OC shopper", "ReviewID": "R37B6TTV3X6YAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my iPad for use in my MBA program, which uses all eBooks.

I'm familiar with Apple products ranging from the iMac, Macbook, iPhone(s), iPod(s) and iPad(s).  I owned the first gen iPad while my wife owns the second gen.  After all of this time I knew it was time to upgrade.  My 1st gen. iPad was slowing down and the laggy moments were really starting to get to me.  I don't like to wait....I admit it, Im impatient!So after getting irritated with some lag I ordered the iPad 3.  Immediately there is a huge speed increase compared to the 1st gen.  Compared to the 2nd gen, you won't notice much of anything.  What you will notice of course is the screen.  It looks absolutely amazing.  Very clear.  Perfect.So what else is there to say?  It's light (compared to the 1s gen, almost the same as the 2nd) an roughly the same size.  I'm using the Apple case from the 1st gen for this one even though it is a bit loose.  I had to punch a small hole in the back for the camera but that was easy enough.  The camera works great and takes good photos in 'house' lighting.  No flash but that's ok with me.  I usually taking random photos and not counting on this as my primary camera.  All in all, it's better than the 2nd gen, worse than a point and shoot.  Video is good quality though.  Not bad at all.Battery life is like the other iPads.....AWESOME!  No issues with it being hot (it does get luke-warm).For me this is the king of the tablets.  I have android tablets and they are good but not great.  When it comes to having something that simply works and works very well, then you can't beat Apple and the iPad.  You can do the same with other tablets but not as easily or as seamless.  That I assure you.I'll update in the future.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for Reading", "Author": "Ghazali", "ReviewID": "R27BG1981LZWXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy the first and second generation iPads because I didn't like the resolution. I opted for the Kindle DX instead which is more suitable for reading.

The only issue is the screen glaring which is not comfortable if sitting nearby the light source.IMHO it's worth to upgrade from iPad two if you read a lot of text and watch HD videos on netflix. For other uses like occasional browsing, reading emails and gaming: The iPad 2 is a good option for a lower price.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used!", "Author": "jjceo", "ReviewID": "R1UQGTAYSMPCIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, \"There is an app for that!\" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7\" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41\" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware!", "Author": "Donald Vining \"DV2\"", "ReviewID": "R1T21H3UN311B9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Some dealers are selling iPad 3s through Amazon.

It is processor intensive use after all.I find it very comfortable to hold, especially in the leather folio I purchased to carry it in.  It's like carrying around a fairly normal weight book, which is pretty astounding in it's own right.But I daily experience awe at the power this thing has.  From business applications to photo editing to games, this does almost everything I use my computer for.

Still a Great Product!", "Author": "Irineo Placido-Lopez", "ReviewID": "RIAXYJW0WQHAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This  is a review of the Apple iPad 3 or the \"New\" iPad as Apple likes to call it. The main question is, should I buy this? The answer will vary from person to person, but I can help you decide to see if it's worth it. First of all, let's take a look at what is new in this version of the iPad. Please note this review will be long so only read the parts that interest you. If you are truely curious, feel free to read the entire thing.Top Things in the NEW iPad: The A5X chip with quad-core graphics drives four times the pixels of iPad 2. The A5X chip is the main thing in the New iPad. It is what delivers the New Stunning Retina Display! With a 2048-by-1536 resolution you can't argue that the New iPad obviously has a way better screen than any other iDevice. With an amazing 10 hours of battery, the new display is really going to get noticed. Due to the fact it now has the A5X chip, the iPad is a lot faster and has really amazing graphics! The new 5MP Eye Sight camera is also something that is really enjoyed on the new iPad. Even though most people aren't really used to taking pictures with a 9.7 inch display tablet this update might encourage people to do so.Now, Let's get into detail. I will break up the review in segments in order to make it more convinient for you all.==== The A5X Chip ====You might be asking, \" Is the new chip really such a difference?\" The answer to this question is, yes. The new A5X chip, although not seen, is what makes the new iPad so great. It is the source behind the improved graphics, faster responces, and even the really improved Retina Display! Trust me, the new iPad is something truely amazing!==== 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight Camera ====The new rear camera on the iPad is now a 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight camera! What is Eye sight ? Let me put it this way. It is similar to professional DSLR Cameras with Autofocus. That's right, the new iPad has similar features to professional DSLR's. With really good Macro Focus and all-around high quaity pictures. Although 5 Mega Pixels is not that high, the pictures still look really nice on the iPad's Retina Display. MegaPixels matter, but there are other things like Aperature and shutter speed that have a dramatic effect on pictures. This is what is new on the iPad's camera. There is stilll room for improvement in the cameara. They could add a Flash which would make the camera truely spectacular. For now though, the camera is definitely a great improvement from the iPad 2.==== The Battery Life ====Now the battery life on the new iPad can vary from user to user. If you are those types of people that enjoy having the Best Display at all times the battery life is going to be reduced drastically. You can get more life by changing the screen brightness. The iPad has a nice feature to it called Auto-Brightness. This enables the iPad to automatically turn the brightness of the screen higher when you are outdoors and when you are indoors it automatially lowers the brightness to the point where it is just right. On auto-brightness the battery can still last a good 10 continuous hours. This means using it 10 hours non stop. Of course most people don't do this. They leave it on standby. If you only use it a couple of times per day the life can range to maybe 2 full days. Since the battery is larger and it lasts longer it takes more time to charge than an iPod or an iPhone.==== The Display ====As I mentioned before, the display is amazing on the new iPad; however, it is something so great that I can't cover in a review. The best way to decide is seeing it for yourself. I would recommend seeing one in person for you can truely observe the new display with your own eyes.With all of this said, What can an iPad Really do? I will answer this in the sections below...An iPad is basically a computer in some words. It can really be a computer with the right accessories. Some required things to take full advantage of an iPad are:* A wireless printer that supports Apple's Air Print.* An Apple TV to stream with Air Play.* A Bluetooth wireless keyboard that is supported with the iPad* A good case to protect your iPad.Let's take a look at what an iPad can truely do...==== Air Play ====If you have an Apple TV you can stream wirelessly to your HDTV. For Example, If you want to share some pictures with your family, now you can with Air Play. You can wirelessly send infromation to Your HDTV in which you will be able to see pretty much everything you see on your iPad. From Youtube videos to Photos to even Netflix.==== Air Print ====If you have a wireless printer that supports Air Print you can now print straight from your iDevice. For example, you have a PDF file that you just edited or a really great Picture that you just took. With Air Print you can print this from basically anywhere in the world. Even if you are in another county you can send an e-mail to your printer and your printer will wirelessly & Automatically start printing out whatever you sent it! This is someething truely amazing!==== Games & Apps ====With an iPad you have a wide variety of applications and games that you can install on it. With Apple's App sotre there are literally hundreds of apps to choose from with most ranging from FREE to around $5. There are two types of applications on iPads. There are normal apps that were meant for use with an iPod Touch or an iPhone and then there are HD Apps. The High Definition apps were meant for iPad only and they look a lot better than iPhone Apps; however, both are fully functional. The Games will look a lot better on the new iPad as it now has the A5X chip.==== Dictation ====Dictation is a new feature on the iPad. It allows you to speak text. An example would be writing a note in the notes section of the iPad. Instead of typing it out slowly, you can now just say it and the iPad will turn it into text! Save time by literally talking to your iPad. This is also very helpful when sending e-mails.==== Siri ? ====Apple has released to us that in its new update that is coming soon it will allow the new iPad to be used with Siri! The main feature that made the iPhone 4S such a big hit is now going to be integrated into the iPad. Just another great reason to buy an iPad 3.==== iOS ====iOS is the magic behind the  iPad. It lets you see and do everything using Multi-Touch. Apple likes to boast about it being the worlds most advanced mobile oberating system. With every update making it even better, this is a true reason to buy an Apple Device.==== iCloud ====iCloud is new in ios 5 allowing your iPad to update its self with the \"cloud\" wirelessly of course! You no longer need to own a computer to own an iPad because of this amazing new feature! It also allows you to store all of your apps, music, and movies in the cloud! With this said, it automatically pushes all of your pictures, apps, etc to all of your other iDevices wirelessly! It also allows you to restore an iPad and get all of your contacts and information automatically if you ever have to restore an iPad.Overall:This is a truely outstanding product that is just amazing. The only reason why this is not a 5 Star product is because it tends to be hot! Literally it gets really hot if you use it for around 2 hours. This and the fact that it can still be improved in some areas. Overall though it is a great product that I would not hesitate to buy. I recommend this product for everyone who is looking for a Tablet. I hope that this review helped you guys out. If it did please feel free to say that it helped you out in the buttons below.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R1SRUTWOQOHYBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "The screen is so much more noticeable /clearer compared to the iPad 2. Apps are now made specifically for this iPad 3 HD.", "Author": "M. J. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1JK70QRWY58PM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The two most important features as compared to the iPad 2 and the new iPad are the amazing resolution and this speech to text dictation.I am now using the dictation to write this review and it seems so much better than Nuance Dragon Natural Speaking. Combined with the new resolution, which is much noticeably better than the iPad 2, it seems worth the upgrade. If you sell your iPad 2 you are only lose about $150; Apple products hold their value. Apple has created a system for apps, which makes which makes the new iPad available to download your current apps in four times the resolution; Web browsing and Kindle texts looks so much clearer on the new iPad. If you are a blogger or WordPress, Joomla or just an every day emailer there is no point in having a external keyboard for the new iPad. The voice to text dictation is a huge bonus.Cons:Although the front facing camera is adequate for Skype and FaceTime the resolution is not as good as other cameras for taking clear pictures. Another con compared to the iPad 2 is that the battery takes very long to charge. Although the backward facing 1080P camera may seem good on paper it is not as good as one would think. Like me, not many people use their iPad for recording videos anyway.Also, like the iPad 2 the Wi-Fi antenna is not nearly as good as a laptop or desktop computer.16 GB is really all you need, most people don't even use half of the space. Streaming music or videos does not require any extra GBs, however if you use it as your main camcorder, download video/music directly to your iPad consider getting more space or more than 16GB. If you are a big traveler and have the money go with the LTE version, otherwise the Wi-Fi version is all you need.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kind of a dissapointment", "Author": "Serpentiz", "ReviewID": "R1WTV6KJW1IU0E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the new iPad because of the retina display, it is my first Apple device. The retina display is beautiful, but I found more cons about the device then I found pros. They say once you go mac, you never go back, but I have to admit, I miss my Android tablet. First, let me say that this tablet seems to be built nicely, I have no qualms about the build quality of the device, other than the WiFi seems to be a bit slow. My complaints are about functionality and overall cosmetics. I was surprised to find out that I am unable to add widgets to my home screens without jail-breaking the device, really? This is something that Android users can do, and have been able to do since the dawn of time. Okay, fine, I can get past that. Next, my main email address is a Gmail address. I use my Gmail account to backup all my contacts, as well as send/receive emails. There is a setting on iOS 6 (which I updated to immediately upon turning the device on) that allows you to add a Gmail account. Taking into consideration that the two companies always seem to be at each others' throats, I was happy to see this was possible, however, then I found out that, while I can add my Gmail address and receive emails from my account to the iPad, I can't sync my contacts. May I ask why? In order to sync my Gmail contacts, I had to set up my Gmail account as a Microsoft Exchange account, this is stupid, why can't I just set it up as a Gmail account and automatically sync my contacts without the extra hassle? Now, I haven't really looked, but I assume Apple offers the same kind of service, where you can receive emails, and backup contacts, etc. that I can just switch to, but why should I have to? This device is supposed to be the best tablet available, why can't it do something as simple as syncing my contacts without having to use a work-around? Next, I have an Amazon account, and tons of books I've downloaded through Kindle. I found the Kindle app on the app store, and it works great for reading, then I found out you can't buy books through the app. Really? I have to go to the amazon website through Safari. Well, Apple has iBooks ... okay so to be able to do something as simple as purchasing and downloading e-books through the app itself, I have to re-purchase my entire library? This is ridiculous, in the Android Kindle app, you can do this, so it has to be Apple that for some reason decided they wouldn't allow this functionality with the app available to iOS devices. So, okay, I can get past all that as long as it reliably works right? Wrong. One of the biggest aspects this tablet is built for is gaming. There are great games on the app store, and the iPad is supposed to play them without a problem. So I go to try a game and start playing, after about 15 minutes, the device over-heated and the game crashed. There are other aspects about the iPad that I don't like, there's no HDMI out without having to buy a separate adapter, there's no SD card input (should be available on every tablet ever), I would've like to see an I/R blaster, but it seems only Samsung and Sony think that's a good idea, but these are my main complaints about the device. So, here I am, I like the iPad, but I find myself more often wishing I'd gone with a new Android tablet, and that's why I can't give the iPad 5 stars. And if you're an Android user looking to give the iPad a shot, like I was, all I can say is buyer beware.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Janie Dills", "ReviewID": "R28QD8JHKVIAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second purchase of this particular product from this Amazon Marketplace seller.

Which wouldn't be so bad, if all the web was ipad-compatible.For popular and cutting-edge websites, the iPad works like a dream. But any site that doesn't have a team of programmers, (or better yet, an app) can be rather touch and go. I just wasn't able to log onto my university email, for instance. I spent time finding elaborate solutions to problems that just don't exist for a laptop.At the end of the day, I must say that the iPad is a great product for light work, like networking, googling, or just killing time.

NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps.

Chung", "ReviewID": "R17BAOS6YCY4Z6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since there are many reviews out there with specs and user review, I will take a different approach by telling you why I chose the iPad over other tablets (even with the latest Asus Transformer Infinity).Yes, the iPad doesn't support Flash, it has a less powerful processor than some tablets (at least the Asus Transformer Infinity), it may be heavier, etc. But here are my three major determining factors to settle with the iPad:- App experience- OS performance- Full synchronization with the iPhone** App Experience **If you are gamer on your mobile device, you won't grow tired of the unending list of games on the iOS platform. According to a PC Magazine article, as of March 2012, the iOS has more than twice the number of games on Android from the \"top 10 mobile game publishers as judged by Mark Fidelman of Technorati\". Tom's Hardware also interviewed four mobile game developers and it seems the iOS is still the best platform for game (and other apps) developers which means many great games will still only be available on the iOS platform. I will post links in the comment section.Even if apps are available on the Android platform, the experience on the iOS is still superior. I have played the same games and used the same apps but they are not the same. I did some research and I found out it's because there are \"fragmentation issues\" in the development process on the Android platform.** OS Experience **The Android OS is more flexible than the iOS when it comes to customization or widgets. I have an Android phone and I enjoy the ability to use the power control widget to quickly turn on/off 3G, Wi-Fi, Hotspot, Bluetooth, GPS, etc. But to me, the iPhone and iPad simply trump other platforms in terms of smooth handling and responsiveness. I constantly experience some type of lag with Android phones and tablets. Even with the Asus Transformer Infinity, I see lag in video playback in some of the YouTube review. With the iOS, these lags are significantly less. So I am not saying the iOS is perfect but it is certainly the best in class.The CEO of Microsoft recently said that their new tablet called Surface will compete against the iPad in a way that will \"leave no stone unturned\" in their battle with Apple. Google also has been focusing their attention on mobile products. Competition is great for us consumers but it seems like Apple still have a significant edge as the first mover.** Full synchronization with the iPhone **My wife has an iPhone 4 and and iPad 2. I spent some time with the two devices for a couple weeks and I was fascinated with the synchronization between them. When you download an app on one device that's compatible with both the iPhone and iPad, it appears automatically on the other device. Notes, photos, videos can also be sync. I haven't tried this with a combination of Android phone and tablet but my assumption is that it won't be as effortless. With the iOS, I feel like I have two of the same device but in different size and form factor.** Conclusion **This is my take after using both the iOS and Android systems and I prefer the iOS even if some of the devices out there may outperform the iPhone or iPad. The general consensus is that the new Asus Transformer Infinity does outperform the iPad in terms of processing and battery performance. It's in wide screen, it has an expansion slot, and it has HDMI out. But it's the iOS ecosystem that swayed me toward it. Yes, Asus or HTC can come up with a more powerful device but they can't create another app/developer ecosystem as with Apple. The Android is the second best to me, at least for now.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good toy!", "Author": "Jesus D Maldonado C \"Jesus D.\"", "ReviewID": "R1C1QTSZ3BUIFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelent!!, smooth and snapy, great power and graphics... but if you want use adobe flash or browse page on it, you most use another browser, java also, a lot of apps...

I bought the original iPad, and when the 2 came out, I happily sold the 1 and upgraded. I was thrilled with the thinner, lighter and improved iPad 2. So naturally, when word came out that the third one was about to be released in March 2012, I was right on board to buy one. Sold my 2 and preordered the 3 from Apple the day it was released.I was hoping the third gen wouldn't be noticibly thicker and heavier than the 2, but unfortunately it was. I could definitely tell the difference when reading ebooks, which I do a lot. I couldn't really tell any difference between the speed and clarity of the 3, but to be fair, I didn't compare the two models side by side. I've no doubt the 3 is superior in this regard. I don't use the cameras, so don't care about this since I have a very nice digital camera for that.The one thing about the third generation iPad that concerned me was the heat issue. Shortly after receiving it, I was reading an ebook and noticed the left side was warm. Not hot, but definitely warm enough for me to notice it. This reminded me of laptops I've had that have overheated and shut down, and here I was only reading a book. My iPad 2 never had this problem and I used it a lot. I also had some difficulty backing up the 3 to the cloud, again, something that wasn't ever a problem with the 2.After reading some reviews of others experiencing the heating problem with the latest iPad, and really missing the thinner and lighter iPad 2 , I decided to return the iPad 3 to my local Apple store and buy a new iPad 2. They had no problem taking it back and I was glad to see the 2 had come down in price. When the sales associate asked me why I was returning the 3, I told him about the heat problem. He didn't seem surprised and said it was because the 3 has a larger battery.The third gen has a faster CPU and retina dsplay, but I never thought the 2 had any problems with speed, and the clarity of the display has always seemed fine to me. But I'm certainly no expert. I'm very happy I made the exchange and enjoying using my iPad 2 again. For my uses--books, internet, email and games, the cooler, thinner and lighter iPad 2 is a better choice for me.By the way, I just want to add that I think it's unfair to compare the Kindle Fire and Nook to the iPad. These devices are just ebook readers and they're fine for that--I've tried them both. Rather like saying, okay, you can buy this Mercedes or you can get the Volkswagen. Once you've used an iPad, you're totally spoiled and trying to browse the Internet with a Kindle or Nook is an exercise in frustration after using an iPad.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "New Ipad", "Author": "Judy Raley", "ReviewID": "R37S24STD9ATHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the generation 1 Ipad and just wanted to upgrade....It is great, the camera will be a plus also.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ipad 3 wifi+ cellular", "Author": "ricardyd", "ReviewID": "R1Z4J9CBPVPODD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect tabletLight and  tin  good Battery performance, Good os  (IOS 6.1.3)Smooth and fastgreat product Solid StateIt's that you should buy", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's good", "Author": "Muiz awan", "ReviewID": "R2QT5OPXZ3OFVC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good tablet.

Breda \"L.\"", "ReviewID": "R2N8WTDOF4GM92", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would first like to say I DID NOT purchase this item on amazon because the markup is silly high. I have read allot of the amazon reviews and feel that some reviewers are very unfair on the product. So with that said please read my review if you are considering buying.I bought the 32GB wifi and Verizon 4G in whiteI currently own the retina display iPad in whiteIn the past I have owned the galaxy tab 10.1, the Samsung ativ pc pro, galaxy note, and kindle 8.9 HDI love the iPad mini. I think it is very practical for everyday use. It is easy to hold, battery life is excellent, typing is easy, equipped with a few movies, a few games, and the kindle AP you always have entertainment wherever you go in a small and beautiful form factor.Many people are raising a fuss about the non-retina display... This does not bother me even though my primary device before the mini has been the retina iPad. You can see pixels, it's not so beautifully crisp as the retina but it is still above adequate for reading, gaming, etc. after an hour or so of using this device I don't even notice the difference. I owned the kindle fire, and while the screen was HD and looked great I couldn't stand how tied to Amazon I was with it (sorry amazon I love you)  and well... I had other issues with it as well.Some people are claiming the device is slow especially when buffering utube. I have not seen any difference in speed from my iPad 3. As far as gaming goes words with friends is the only game I play and it works flawlessly on the mini. Perhaps if your buying the iPad for gaming you would be happier with the iPad 4 ( or whatever they are calling it) because it has more RAM and a faster processor.The form factor of theMini is simply amazing, I honestly can't complain about the lack of retina because I think that's too much to ask right now for any manufacturer to get into such a slim and light package. You honestly can't truly understand how amazing this thing is until you have used an iPad 3 for a significant amount of time, the weight and bulk gets to you. The iPad mini fits so well into my purse and I can hold it easily for hours with one hand. I can read and rock my child to sleep at the same time now!You should only get the wifi version unless you have a share everything plan as my husband and I do, then you can ad your tablet on for a low fee to your existing plan. I would never pay 30 dollars a month for a separate plan. I love that you can use FaceTime over the 3G or 4G, I tuck this into my purse and if my son is doing something particularly cute on the playground during daddies lunch break we can call him and say \"hi\".As far as cases go, I am a minimalist so I love the Smart Cover paired with a clear plastic back so I don't cover up the beauty of my mini. The Smart Cover is different from my iPad 3 smart over, the hinge does to have any metal showing and it snaps on tighter and looks much nicer. I tried the Griffin thin case folio (I think that was what it's called) it was really nice looking but when the mini was in it it didn't lie flat hindering some of my key presses on the outer edge of the device. I recently read a review on this product and the man raved about it, so maybe I just got a faulty case.Apple care+ feels like a must on this device. Because I will be carrying this wherever I go and because its so slim I want to cover my a** if I drop this beautiful piece of equipment. If I bought the 16GB wifi only version I might not pay the extra dough for AppleCare +.The speakers really surprised me on this little device, they are loud and clear! I still wish Apple would include headphones in every package as well as an adapter for the new power connector (we all know Apple is stingy) but they don't.I am really excited about this device, I could have saved money and purchased a google nexus 7 or any one of the other 7 inch devices but their battery life, build quality, and battery life are inferior to the mini. (Yes I am sure someone will send a nasty comment when they read this about me being an isheep) I don't stand behind a product simply because it is made by a certain company, I stand behind a product when it is a damn good product. I recognize the mini has some shortcomings but they far outweigh the greatness of this beautiful product.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sealed in original box indeed", "Author": "BobT", "ReviewID": "R17HNSJR7YTSPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent delivery as promised and ALL arrived in original SEALED box as advertised.

This is substantial in weight compared to the Kindle, but not so heavy that it's annoying. It can slip into a tote purse easily.I highly suggest getting a protective cover for it. I have the magnetic one from the Apple store which is nice for the front, but does nothing for the back.  So be careful when carrying it around or maybe check out the Targus cover.DH has the Kindle which is a good size for him just reading \"books\" and he has the Targus cover which is so nice.Back to iPad - it's my first and I love the display - it's gorgeous. Fingerprints do show up, so I got the cleaning kit from the Apple store to keep it looking nice (solution and cloth).I simply use this for browsing or reading in bed and I love how you can size and resize the text instantly by pinching open or closed and moving down/up the page quickly.Get a stylus. We have the Targus which is like a little pen with a small \"balloon\" on the end for tapping/selecting. I wish the stylus was a bit more pointy or small, because sometimes I have to resize the text before using the stylus for selecting.

This is substantial in weight compared to the Kindle, but not so heavy that it's annoying. It can slip into a tote purse easily.I highly suggest getting a protective cover for it.

So be careful when carrying it around or maybe check out the Targus cover.DH has the Kindle which is a good size for him just reading \"books\" and he has the Targus cover which is so nice.Back to iPad - it's my first and I love the display - it's gorgeous. Fingerprints do show up, so I got the cleaning kit from the Apple store to keep it looking nice (solution and cloth).I simply use this for browsing or reading in bed and I love how you can size and resize the text instantly by pinching open or closed and moving down/up the page quickly.Get a stylus. We have the Targus which is like a little pen with a small \"balloon\" on the end for tapping/selecting.

The backspace \"key\" is the only way to move the cursor and it erases characters. The touch screen allows you to place the cursor where you want it, but it isn't always responsive to my attempts to place the cursor where I want it; so this too can be awkward for making corrections etc. I ordered a stylus.

Personally, I will not be using the iPad to take pictures as I laugh at people who use their tablets to take pictures, they look ridiculous.Good feel and size - I'm one of the rare few that likes their items to have a good weight to them because it proves that they have value to them, like pick up a Walmart watch then a Michael Kors watch and you'll know what I'm talking aboutDictation - It's nice and accurate, old technology, nothing to see here folks.Elegant looks - Of course it looks breathtaking compared to any tablet out there, it is sleek and simple.Cons:Still no smaller model, this is not a personal concern but yeah for all the whiners out thereStill no headphones - is it that hard to include them apple? Come on...A5X processor - You would think being a 1gb dual core with quad core graphics processor that it would blow the A5 out of the water? It actually got a point lower than the iPad 2 ( 720 vs 721) disappointing.To sum it up really, if you have an iPad 2, do not upgrade, if you have the original PLEASE do.

It sports a 5 megapixal camera and video camera capability with the beautiful retina display (which I have on my iPhone 4).  The design and curves are the same as the 2nd generation iPad, so iPad 2 cases should fit this iPad without a hitch.  I purchased the rooCASE Convertible Premium Leather (Red) Case Cover with 24 Angle Adjustable Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad and it's been a nice protector although I am a fan of the Otterbox iPad 2 Defender Case - Black.Overall, if you are a fan of iPad (or Apple in general) and have the iPad first Generation, you will notice a nice change.  If you have the iPad 2 and were thinking of upgrading to the latest model ... you may want to just hold off.  The differences are in the chip and the camera quality and display.  Depending on how you use your iPad (power user like me or casual user), that will help you to judge.I think the switch from first Generation to third Generation iPad is definitely a great and worthy leap.  I would question the switch from 2nd Gen to 3rd Gen if you are just a casual user.  Truth is, from the outside ... you won't really know the difference.

It was definitely a good deal, considering the device had minimal damage and a newly replaced screen. I was set on getting the 3rd generation since it included the Retina Display without having the infamous lightning dock connector found on the newer iPad. All in all, I was very pleased with the item I received, now on to the actual device:Screen:I didn't believe all the hype at first about the Retina display, but in fact it is all true. The display is definitely stunning and features probably the best screen on any tablet, although I think the Google Nexus 10 still wins in terms of pure sharpness.Build:As stated in the review's title, you can definitely feel the premium material that was used to put this device together. I wouldn't go so far as to call it durable though, which is why I recommend you get a case and screen protector.OS:Here is where the iPad falls short. At least for now, Apple's iOS 6 is the iPad's most visible weakness. It looks and feels stale, despite the iPad's beautiful screen. The static icons just don't cut it anymore, especially if you have used Android 4.0 or above on a tablet. Hopefully iOS 7 will improve upon the software, but from the initial previews it seems to be more or less the same.Battery Life:This is where the iPad excels most notably. The 10 hour reported battery life proves to be all but true, even with the brightness and high levels. The fact that iOS is extremely simple with little to no graphical animations is what optimizes the iPad's great battery life.Productivity:I know that most people buy tablets for recreational use, but sometimes people choose to integrate it with their work life through e-mail and word processing. Unfortunately, the iPad isn't really great for either, considering that the keyboard accessories from most manufacturers are overpriced and Apple's own iWork suite is far too minimal at a high price. Also, true multitasking with multi-window support is just not present and further shows iOS' limitations.Overall, the Apple iPad is a great device for media consumption while delivering excellent battery life. If you are not able to fork up the heavy price, there are definitely cheaper options available such as the Google Nexus 10 but they arguably don't offer the same 'premium' look and feel as the iPad does.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "New iPad 32 that is a 64!", "Author": "Mary T.", "ReviewID": "R3DRI8W80DNFOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You sent a 64 gbs instead of a 32 Wewant to keep it but how much do we owe for the difference?", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and more space for itune downloads", "Author": "Lorance", "ReviewID": "R1QV5DANAPHFWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The touch Screen is clear and colors are bright with no issue of any hick ups or stalling.Easy to download applications where eve your can find a wifi connection and its light weight and easy to move around with.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good condition", "Author": "Kenneth J.

The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them.

I find it to be much more useful than any laptop out there for many reasons, including portability, application availability, and ease of use.One reason why the iPad is so fast compared to laptops is due to the fact that it uses flash storage memory, or in other words, there are no moving parts inside the device, like a laptop would have with a typical moving hard drive that would eventually die after X number of years.I am not an Apple fanboy. I do see where they have some flaws. But if you're wondering if the iPad is worth the money, it absolutely is. You get what you pay for, and the iPad is a perfect example of it.I skipped the iPad 2 because they did not come out with the retina display, which makes everything, most notably text, much more sharp then it has been previously. If you do any fair amount of reading on the device, you need to get the third generation iPad, and don't look at the previous models. It will be entirely worth it, and you will not look back or regret your decision.And for the people who are confused why Apple chose not to name this device the iPad 3, I would like to help with a brief explanation. Apple currently has many products where they do not have a numbering system in the official title of the device, like the iPod, iPod touch, MacBook, MacBook Pro, Apple TV, and so on. It's simply labeled just with the title of the device, and the way people distinguish it from previous models is to simply refer to it as the first, second or third generation, etc. Evidently they are going to do this with the iPad now as well, and you can count on the fact that the next iPhone that will be released will not be called the iPhone 5. :-) I partially digress, but for the people who are wondering about this with any possible confusion, I hope this clears some of it up.I could get into all of the features that it has, but if you're looking for an overall device that does everything extremely well and fast, look no more and get this third generation iPad. It's easy to use and fast, but most importantly, it is fun and productive.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "A comparision with Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9", "Author": "L. Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R3HH4893BPGUYP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 and love it.  Decided to try the new iPad and would like to offer some comparisons.Display - The iPad's display is certainly sharper than the Tab, but not by much.Display size - I prefer the 8.9 size to the iPad's larger screen. Simply easier to carry around.  iPad better for reading magazines but prefer the Tab for almost everything else. Really a matter of preference.Speed - iPad is faster.Heat - I live in a warm climate and find the iPad runs hot at times.  No problem with the Galaxy Tab.Build quality - About the same.  iPad may be a bit better but Galaxy Tab is also well made.Weight - The Tab is feather light, being less than a pound.  The iPad feels like a tank in comparison, a major disadvantage.Apps - Although the iPad has significantly more apps, the Android system is starting to catch up. So far, I have found everything I need on the Android app  stores.Interface - A matter of preference.  I appreciate the tightness of the IOS but prefer the openness and flexibility of the Android operating system.Bottom line.  Most people flock to the iPad because it is the best known and best integrated of the tablets.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 offers some advantages in size, weight and flexibility.
