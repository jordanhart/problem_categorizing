It comes in weighing a little over 1lb.I upgraded from the iPad 3 and you can defiantly feel the difference. When reading with the iPad 3, after a few minutes my arms would be tired of holding the iPad up. With the new iPad Air, that is not the case anymore. I can read for much longer now and my arms don't feel tired. The unit is also easier to hold (much thinner than previous versions of the iPad)It\u2019s built of high quality aluminum just like every other iPad is and constructed to last.PerformanceThe new iPad air is fast! It has an A7 processor in it which is defiantly an upgrade from the previous iPads. The Wi-Fi is even quicker to connect and I notice I can achieve more of my potential in bandwidth speed using this iPad. The new front facing camera makes video chatting much better and the M7 chip makes editing and slow motion shooting fun and a breeze.StorageI upgraded from a 16 GB iPad 3 to a 128 GB iPad Air. Why you ask? Well because I do a lot of traveling for work and Apple is notorious for sneaking in extra stuff on your hard drive that takes up space. My iPad 3 came with only 13.8 GB useable space and after a month I had 3 or 4 GB of \u201cother\u201d storage that no one could figure out how to remove or clear.I mentioned earlier I travel a lot for work so I enjoy watching movies on the plane rides. With my old iPad I never had room for all my movies I had to use a wireless hard drive  (Seagate Wireless Built In Streaming STCK1000100Just to watch my movies. Now with this new 128 GB hard drive I can fit tons of movies on it and I no longer need the old wireless hard drive. (One less thing to lose on travel)Final thought:For people who have an older iPad (like I did) then this is a no brainer buy this new iPad you won\u2019t be disappointed! It is much lighter than previous versions. Wayyy faster! And still sleek and built to last as every other iPad is. The new storage options give you the ability to carry more pictures, movies, books , games with you and the battery life is superb coming in at 10+hours. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It might be a little expensive, but if you buy smart you'll have this tablet for a long time with no problems.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad crashing problems, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY Major Fiasco", "Author": "P.

By Apple. If you go in their forums, there are plenty of (new users) people reporting crashing problems. Then you have the level 6 and up users denying there is a problem. Many posts are being censored and deleted by Apple.The 64 bit processor needs more memory than a 32 bit CPU - so in effect, the ipad air has LESS memory than the ipad 4.Do yourself a favor and dont buy the ipad air. It is already obsolete. If you must have an ipad, buy the 4th generation one, or wait until the next one comes out.

The specs are about the same as the New Ipad (iPad 3) and iPad 4. I would definitely get an iPad Air over an iPad Mini, even with the Retina Display, as what made the Mini desirable was the smaller weight and size. The Air is really light, more manageable for someone who uses it continuously.All in all, if you can afford it, it is a great gift, to yourself or seomone else (you really like :)).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Review from an Android user!", "Author": "Jason Wang", "ReviewID": "R3MRBK7OU4EGHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased as a long time android user because I needed something for textbooks and the 4:3 aspect ratio works a lot better for text books than 16:9 (I tired the Nexus 10 for a week as well)..Here is my review after  a week:The first thing I noticed was how light and compact it was, coming from the Nexus 10 I was surprised how easy it was to hold with one hand (although you still wouldn't for long periods of time) and how compact it was for a 10in tablet. The tablet is as fast as anything out right now, to be honest I don't play games but in terms of everyday use everything was fine...but at the same time every iPad that I've used before felt fast as well, I have heard of some issues with tablet optimization for iOS7 but I haven't encountered any. The screen is bright and sharp, text is really easy to read vs a higher PPI tablet (nexus 10) I really couldnt tell a difference with the extra pixels. The color on the iPad is very good once again this is to be expected as Apple always makes high quality devices.The only Cons I can't think of is the speaker placement and feel of the glass (as mentioned in other reviews). The iPad has \"stereo speakers\" which are located on the bottom, I really wish they would have put one on each side instead of both on one side. Watching youtube or netflix in landscape is kind of weird since all the side comes from the right side, kind of defeats the purpose of stereo speakers imo since I never watch fullscreen videos in portrait mode. The nexus 7and 10  have  really good desigsn for speakers that I wish Apple would've adopted.The other con is the feel of the screen, to be honest it feels a bit cheap...compared to previous iPads and the nexus devices the feel of the screen on the iPad air is the worst. It feels like plastic and it just doesnt feel solid when you push down. I'm sure this is a sacrifice that Apple had to make in order to reduce the weight to me the benefits of having a lighter, smaller device outweigh the feel of the screen (something that I'll eventually get used to).Other notes: I haven't used the camera, sorry but I never use the camera on a tablet to take pictures but from what I hear from reviews it takes pretty much what you would expect from a camera on a tablet. I probably wouldn't upgrade if I had an iPad 3 or iPad 4 unless your someone who has to have the newest tech or is absolutely miserable with the weight.If you do want to purchase it you can get it for 479.99 + Tax, go to Walmart's website or you can have any other retailer price match it.All in all this is an excellent tablet besides the minor gripes...the only Android tablet I can see competing with the iPad is the Nexus 10 v2 if it ever comes out...and while I preferred the Nexus 10 for media viewing, real stereo speakers and OS, reading textbooks felt a little cramped and since I'm using this tablet primarily for \"school\" the 4:3 factor fit my needs better.So there it is proof that you can be a fan of both Android and iOS :)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R3RZ0F8IARVY1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Nexus 7, and while I enjoyed it immenseilly I was ultimately disappointed in how slow it eventually got (speedy at Christmas, snail slow come April despite factory reset and other attempts to speed it up. Bought my brother a new nexus 7 that summer only to discover its speed was on par with the Nexus I currently owned. Very bizarre). I was skeptical whether or not I would enjoy a tablet experience, so the Nexus 7 was none the less a great first tablet. It could do anything any other tablet could without putting a dent in your pocket.I decided to get the iPad Air this season, specifically the wifi 32gb space gray version.Never owned an iPad before, so I can't really tell you how the models compare,However some things I note, the screen is rather large (duh) which does make typing with the onscreen keyboard difficult. However the screen real estate and quality is stunning, and if typing is a huge issue for you there is the iPad mini and other tablets. That's the trade off, and this is always a choice you have to make between 10 inch vs. 7inch tablets, no matter what brand you're looking at.The glass does feel rather thin, and I am concerned about its durability. I have read that the screen is durable however, and this perception is due to the lightening of the device causing the screen to sound thinner. Supposedly I will be able to confirm this with a case, as the addition of the case will give the tapping of the screen a deeper sound. Apparently it all comes down to acoustics - though a specification on glass thickness versus previous models would be nice.The design of the tablet is exquisite, definitely some top of the line material choices. The tablet has a VERY sturdy feel.Lots of free apps come with this tablet, which all work excellently and efficiently. There is no hesitation between tasks, and the speed is phenomenal.Overall I noticed the quality of apps and how they work on the operating system is MUCH better with apple than it was with android. However, the apple App Store isn't very easy to navigate. Google store is much more user friendly.No widgets, makes customizabibility limited.Multitasking is an ease with this tablet due to gestures. I love how well the gestures work. You can swipe between apps.Battery lasts insanely long, mine averages 12 hours of use.Hasn't overheated (vague warmth can be felt), even with gameplay.Sound from speakers at bottom of iPad sound full. Other tablets I've played with have a tin-metal quality sound emit from them, as though the speakers strain to emit a hearable noise.All iPad Airs, according to Apple's website, come with a complimentary one year limited warranty.Cool front AND back microphones work together to cancel out noise when using skype and FaceTime. Sounds very clear and crisp, I recommend you check out some videos on it.Overall I would say an A+ tablet. I mainly listed some concerns and observations, but that aside this thing is amazing! I love and, it from what I've heard of previous models, I'll hopefully be using this tablet for years to come (number one selling point for me is that apple devices function excellently passed a year).Update December 3, 2013:I've noticed a bizarre memory leak that occurs whenever I watch videos using Apple's video app (love them digital copies). I was testing the video streaming and after I noticed entire GBs were gone! After shutting down the app and fiddling around I realized that the iPad stores memory it buffers and keeps it hostage. However, after going back to the app and quickly loading the same movie and exiting before it begins to buffer the memory reappears. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised that if you watched movies completely through your memory would be restored each time. Still this is a rather large flaw on Apple's part, and I'm not sure if it occurs with any of the other video streaming apps. I'll be sending them a message to see if they're working on a patch for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet just got better", "Author": "G.

Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T; 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T; cellular data.Until this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?The iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.Beyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that  every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.Over 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file.  I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that  I could bring  either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.My weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet.

For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab 2 and right away I noticed the weight of the iPad Air. It felt like a feather compared to my tablet. The display is crisp and VERY sharp, I was amazed by that. The only thing she had an issue with compared to my tablet, was that the speakers on the iPad are placed at the bottom and not on the front facing you, like it is on the Galaxy Tab. We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience.

I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad.  Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for.  I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible.  When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet.  The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised.  Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case.  Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great.  Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats.  Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star.  First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory.  I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet.  Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in.  The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised.  Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful.  You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem.  You wait, and you wait, and you wait.  Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifes Toy", "Author": "victor a. quaranta jr", "ReviewID": "RMRD11B7V8WY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is very thrifty and seldom ask for anything.

Figuring what you want to know is, \"Is it worth the upgrade?\"Well yes and no.If you are already using an iPad with a retina display (and the display IS pant-wettingly gorgeous), you're going to get a sleeker, lighter, faster version of the same thing. Sure, the camera is a bit improved, but don't you think that people look odd trying to take photos on an iPad? For me, that's not what this is designed for.The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is how sleek and light it is compared to previous models. It really is a beautifully designed and built tablet. It' also noticeably (but not hugely with the apps I tested) faster. iOS 7 looks fab on the thing.Still, the bottom line is, if you are running a pre-retina iPad and you got the cash, yes, it's worth it (and I use 'worth' as a loose term here, they are bloody expensive). If you are running a newer iPad, sure, this is sleeker and shinier, but I'm afraid it's not going to change your life.To conclude, this thing is beautiful, extremely useful in my life, and I love it like the child I never had :-) Just don't expect it to change your whole life!", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Air was a great buy!

I have both the HDX 8.9 and the Air even though the HDX 8.9 has a better screen, I prefer reading books and magazines on the iPad Air because of the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I also am happy that I got it because it is apparently the only tablet that works on my company's internal network.The HDX 8.9 is better for video watching, particularly if you're watching without headphones.  The speakers on it are amazing.  However, the speakers on the Air aren't bad, they're  just too close together to practically be stereo.That said, both the HDX 8.9 and the Air are 5-star tablets.

M. Kahn \"Gizmo Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3QIG90IQFIVZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had first purchased the iPad when it first came out, wasn't impressed and returned it.  Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since.  When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2.  Ditto when they came out with the next version.  But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself.  I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def).  Beautiful sharp, clear colors.  So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.)  I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.)  I do love this iPad.  It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful.  I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.)  Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier.  On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games.  In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!)  I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.)  But with Apple you just attach it to your computer  and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway.  On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.)  Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.)  I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games.  Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air.  I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful. Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3W2AOZWQH82BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, even for an Android fan.", "Author": "Xachary Dinsmore", "ReviewID": "RSJSN0GPTVMU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have historically been an Android person, However, this time I decided to give Apple a whirl. In comparison to an Android device it is far less customizable. You don't get to install different keyboards, or load widgets onto 8 different home screens, or install a completely different launcher all together, but this doesn't mean it's all bad. The user interface is very simplistic, but that actually works fairly well on a screen this size. The only thing that really sucks about it is that you can't hide the infrequently used apps quietly off to the side in the app screen like you can with Android. You are staring at all the apps at once from the home screen mo matter what. Even all neatly organized in folders it can still be a little hard to find what you are looking for. This coupled with the lack of information on the home screen(such as you get from a widget) would make me really dislike this on a small phone screen. It does work fairly well with the 10\" screen though, and the multi touch gestures make switching between apps and multi tasking a breeze.  This thing is extremely fast as well, you really can't slow it down. 10 browser tabs open, streaming music, playing a game, and checking your email, all while jumping back and forth between them is completely seamless. It literally feels like you can't feed it input fast enough to make it even stumble a little.  The battery life is also excellent. You will be hard pressed to kill it in a day. You would have to be gaming on it for hours to accomplish a dead battery I would think. I think the battery life is the perfect balance, to increase it any would in my opinion probably mean a sacrifice to either performance or weight and size. I typically get about 2 days of moderate use out of it.  For those of you on the edge between this and an Android device(or the constantly improving world of Windows mobile), the App Store selection is about the same. For the types of apps I use there seems to be very little difference, the are both excellent for social media, media consumption, email, and browsing the web. I do somewhat prefer the BaconReader reddit client app for android over what I have found here, but that is a very minor complaint. There are a few apps that are paid on iOS that you can get for free on Android, but at the same time there are more tablet specific apps on iOS, so I think it's a fair trade off.As far as day to day use goes it has been impeccable and I would recommend it to anyone. It has been reliable, fast, and had great battery life, any complaints are minor and subjective. In case Amazon rolls my review in with all the iPad Air models, which they probably will, I have the 32GB white version. I would also recommend avoiding the 16GB, after everything is all updated and the included free apps installed, you will only have a couple GB left for apps and media.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for normal people.", "Author": "T.

One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a \"premium\" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.  Once a former galaxy tablet loyalist - now firmly in the iPads corner.

In my case, Verizon had to scan the IMEI of one of their own devices in order to activate one of their own SIMs to use in this Air so that it could be added to my existing account and used on their network.

My eye doctor told me if I didn't stop being ridiculous and using my itouch as an ereader (I know, I know but it was so portable!) I could kiss my 20-20 vision goodbye. Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size. It fits in a normal size bag or purse and makes me feel like I'm carrying around a pad of paper rather than a small laptop.I've had several people ask me why I bought a ipad instead of a kindle fire or the like. As I said, we have a lot of iproducts at my house and I'm very happy with itunes. This way I can easily swap movies, tv shows, ebooks, various apps I need on a daily basis around and basically this has turned into a backup laptop for me. The functionality was absolutely worth it to me.I guess if I were to say anything negative it would be 1) I'm never going to live down finally having bought one after saying I wouldn't for so many years and 2) my iphone and itouch now seem incredibly small.

Nothing else compares to the bright screen on the iPad Air, or the way that it feel resting ever so lightly in your hands.  It just feels right.And that is what Apple has done so right.  It never wavered or varied based on the negative opinions of other companies.  It never even responded to them.

However, after a couple weeks of (light) use it developed a blue line across the screen. I am sending it back. I wont buy another iPad from amazon though because what I have come to realize is that the warranty starts from the date the seller purchased the product meaning that I only have a few months left on this warranty. I'm just glad I figured this out sooner rather than later. Excellent product overall and great customer service from amazon in sorting out the issue.-Update- I have since received my refund and purchased a new iPad from Apple. What I realized immediately was how differently this one was packaged. The one I ordered on amazon did not come sealed and did not have plastic on either the screen or the back.

And if you are using this for the sole purpose of creating, sharing, and presenting documents, maintaining your schedule, and taking a few photos. That's great. However, I  tend to watch a few movies, but considering that I only actually have 12 GB of memory after software, large apps like pages and keynote, books, and few photos (less than 100) are taken into account, I can only put one on at a time, which gets a little old after awhile. The fact that apply doesn't allow expanded memory like memory cards still frustrates me to this day because you never know what you may want to put on your tablet in the future, and this leaves you no room to breathe. I hate the restrictions and the only real reason why I decided to get the IPad over the Samsung Note series is because the app store is incredible and much more versatile. I will certainly NEVER get another IPhone after having a Samsung galaxy unless Apple introduces the expanded memory.Anyway, moral of the story: Ipad Air is sleek, light, fast, functions well, has a great display and app store (that just being Apple in general).

The available memory is more like 11-12 gb because the OS takes up the rest of the space.

Let's hope that those who are coming here for 'guidance' are also reading professional reviews from trusted media sources .. and .. talking to actual users of the product.My review: After trying several of the latest high resolution tablets on the market I returned all but one, the iPad Air. I can't find a thing about it to complain about (except the price). It's just outstanding in every way (display, size, weight, available apps, and operating system). It also addressed certain niggling complaints I had with my earlier iPads. With regard to other devices I tried, the latest Kindle Fires were excellent (great displays - and the price was right) but not sufficiently versatile to meet all my needs. The LG 8.3 was another excellent Android tablet but it didn't seem like a truly finished product (couldn't, for instance, lock it in landscape mode - very frustrating when trying to use it while lying in bed). It also seemed a bit pricy for what it was at nearly the price of an iPad Mini Retina (a tablet I was seriously considering for its portability). For what it's worth, the only tablets I tried, or even wanted to try, were those with very high pixel density displays. Later I also ruled out the true 7 inch devices with their 22 square inch displays (the iPad Mini's is 30 square inches, the LG 8.3's is 31, while the iPad Air's is 45). In other words, most of what else was out there had screens that were either too small or displays that were not sufficiently retina like.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Receive a used one when pay for new", "Author": "Tommy Le", "ReviewID": "RNMMX58FSREJA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought iPad air 128GB.

Even though it didn't have a front or back camera. I didn't mind.It's pretty heavy so, i just layed it down on a tablemost of the time. It was all fun and games, until the ios7 update came out a few months ago. After the new update,I could barely do anything on it. All of my favorite apps were no longer useable and, I had to delete them all because theyrequired the new update. After ios7, the first gen ipad suddenly became useless and, I felt cheated out on the amount ofmoney that was spent on that ipad. I'm very surprised that the ipad 1 only costs 200 hundred dollars less than the new one.Even though generation one is a discontinued model. In my opinion, it should be off the market completely. Why bothergetting this outdated device, when you can buy the newest one for $200 more? The ipad air has a completely different feel to it. It's a hundred times lighter.The iPad air has so much new things like Siri. Some people may think asking a electronic device to do something for you might be a bit lazy but, you can make a reminder within 5 seconds without leaving your current app. Siri has better results when searching for something specific. It's also helpful if you're slow at texting or, if your hands are full. Browsing the web is a lot faster but, downloading an app may take a while depending on your Internet connection.

I no longer need to use my ipad stand. Typing and holding it in portrait mode are much easier. People with larger hands will be able to hold the ipad with one hand very easily. Performance is also much improved with new A7 processor. Apps open, close and switch faster than on the ipad 4. Wifi is now double the speed with the double mimo antenna. For those who have supporting routers loading web pages, downloading apps, books, videos, music is much faster. The new stereo speakers are much loader and have more bass than on the previous ipad. The stereo affect will only be noticed when holding the iPad in portrait mode. This is a shame since you wont enjoy the stereo affect when watching a video or playing a game in landscape mode. Also the speakers are very easy to muffle if you cover one or both of them on the right side in landscape mode. The main flaw of the ipad air is its lack of 2GB of ram. When browsing and having more than a few tabs open this is very noticeable. The tabs have to reload when switching back and forth. This also becomes an issue when switching between apps that are open. Both the ipad 3 and 4 had 2GB of RAM. The only reason I can think of why apple decided not the upgrade the RAM is to make customers upgrade to the next ipad. The other downside to the ipad air is the fact that its running ios 7. ios 7 for the most part is in improvement over ios 6. It is faster and has more features, but, it also has many bugs that still need to be fixed. Even with 7.04 installed I still experience rotation issues. The ipad doesnt auto rotate when switching between portarit and landscape mode. This issue occurs atleast once a day. Mainly when the multitasking gestures is enabled and auto rotation. There are many threads on apple discussions forums about this issue. I thought at first my ipad was deffective even made an appointment to see a genius. I was told there was no way to test the hardware but was offered a warranty replacment. I decided instead to exchange the ipad and the replacement also had the same issue. I have to add also my ipad 4 had the same issue also when I updated it to ios 7. I hope apple fixes this issue in 7.1. This is very annoying and not something I expected from apple. The ipad air also doesnot have the ability to run 2 or more apps at one time which both the new samsung note 10.1 2014 and Microsoft surface tablet can do. I did try the samsung tablet briefly and found the screen and speakers much better than the ipad air's. The ipad still is the best larger tablet on the market because it has a huge selection of tablet apps and it gets the apps first before any other platform. I also love the battery life on my ipad air. I was getting about 15 hours of usage on my ipad 4 with the brightness at 35% and about 5 notifications with browsing and email. Now with the ipad air I am gettting more than 15 hours. Anywhere from 16-18 hours of battery life depending on my usage. The new ipad air is must have for gamers, power users and people who take the ipad on the go. If you can wait the next ipad will defeintly have 2GB of RAM and wont have as many bugs. There is also a good chance a new ipad will be released in the next 1-2 years which will be larger in screen size and more powerful named the ipad pro.Update after owning for more than 4 months: Apple just released the 7.1 update. My iPad Air is finally stable, this is what ios 7 should have been from the start. There are no more crashes, reboots and the auto rotation issue is fixed. I am still giving this ipad 4 stars since it took apple more than 4 months to fix these issues. Also the ipad lacks 2gb of ram, there are no widgets, thrid party keyboards, expandable storage or way to run 2 apps at once side by side. The iPad Air is till the best 10 inch tablet on the market. It beats any android or microsoft tabelt currently on the market in the 10 inch category. Also it has the most tablet apps.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "Diane Allen", "ReviewID": "R95SPR015HRY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing ipad!

In hindsight, I\u2019m glad I did otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bought this tablet.Before deciding on the iPad Air I considered the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The Microsoft Surface wasn\u2019t an option since I really don\u2019t like the operating system or customer service and I wanted my tablet to last longer than a year. Samsung wasn\u2019t an option after the torture my Galaxy S3 put me through, which also ruled out Android, which then ruled out the Nexus 7. Some people are a fan of Android but I find it to be slow, unreliable and choppy. The aesthetic design isn\u2019t my favorite either. But these are all a matter of personal opinion and experience. :)The Kindle Fire HDX looked great at first, but in the end I decided it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m a writer and a student so being able to edit documents on the go is my main concern. I have an iMac so this unfortunately made using the Kindle for these purposes a little more difficult for me. While I can edit and share most documents on my iMac, including Microsoft Office, I primarily use Pages which isn\u2019t available on the Kindle. I just don\u2019t care for either Microsoft Word or Google Docs enough to use them all the time. Also, I never use the Amazon store to watch movies or shows or download music so that feature wasn\u2019t appealing to me. I took a trip to Best Buy to try it out just in case that made me change my mind. This actually solidified my decision against it. While the Kindle Fire did feel surprisingly solid, I didn\u2019t like the position of the buttons, smaller screen size (although the screen quality was pretty awesome) or the thick boarders around the screen. Again, all of these are a matter of preference.When I went to try out the iPad Air I was surprised by how much lighter it felt than the previous model iPad. I also liked the flat back and thinner edges on the side. It made using it easier for small handed people like me. The larger screen size made typing on the tablet much easier in those rare instances I might not have my keyboard. Keeping my documents in one place is amazingly simple and I like the applications I use for writing and classes. Also, iTunes U is just awesome!The only drawback for me is the price: I paid $300 more than I would have with the Kindle Fire HDX. I don\u2019t think this is outrageously expensive, considering the larger screen, better hardware, operating system and customer service-- not to mention iTunes U-- but I do think the price could be lower.While there are other great tablets out there, I really enjoy my iPad Air. Electronics are all a matter of personal preference anymore anyway. If you don\u2019t like a device, don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s that simple. :)", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Heavy Apple user, this not up to snuff", "Author": "JustAGuy", "ReviewID": "R13PZL77MK3WNV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the ipad 1 to the ipad air mainly because of constant crashes with the ipad 1.The Air still crashes.

Jo", "ReviewID": "R14O4T9NDREA0U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not happy with this tablet but I got a good deal on it from one of the retail stores, $100 off, and it fits my needs best compared to what's currently being offered.The iPad Mini 2 is lighter but the screen is smaller and can't display as many colors, less gamut display. I've noticed this with my \"old\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus, but this may not matter to some people.The Kindle HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) are, in that order, reported to have better screens- ppi and gamut display. However I'm not interested in buying too much into the Amazon App Store because I'm already in the plain Android ecosystem. The Samsung tablet line is not in consideration because I got burned by how the copy and paste function just stops working- a reset would fix it and soon after it would stop working. This issue first showed itself months after I got the device. I also wasn't interested in taking the time to jailbreak the Samsung tablet for that reason alone.I recently got a deal on the Nexus 7 (2013) and I'm getting it this week. I may keep it as a backup tablet and it's a plus that I'm already in the Android ecosystem. It has 2GB of RAM instead of Apple's current 1GB of RAM standard. It also comes with stock Android and the operating system can be easily upgraded without relying on mods. I'm hoping it will last 5 years but I've learned from the Amazon customer reviews that hardware quality control is an issue.Now back to the iPad Air. Aside from the screen I wanted the \"Apple Experience\" of \"It just works.\" I like using a tablet for browsing and reading books. I also liked the idea of having access to apps that are exclusive to Apple. I've had the iPad Air for a little over a week and I'm really enjoying the bigger screen. I'm not sure I can really switch back to a smaller screen. I've downloaded a few apps, cooking related, that are exclusive to iOS and they're nice to have. Multitouch gesture is ok but the Android way of switching between apps and viewing running apps are more elegant.Why I took off three stars is because the iPad Air crashes a lot. It got to the point that I'd add a tab on Safari and it would crash even though I only had two other tabs open. I installed Chrome and the crashes happened less but they did not disappear. Search for iOS 7 crashes and low memory and you'll see this is a problem with a lot of iOS devices since the iOS 7 was introduced. I noticed other apps doing the same thing but maybe because I use them less I don't see them crashing as often.I had set up a phone appointment with Apple Support on Sunday and was told that upgrading to iOS 7.0.4 via WiFi might have caused the iOS to not fully update. I couldn't stay on the phone for too long so yesterday I did reset my tablet and set the iPad as New. I didn't buy their reasoning but I did like the Customer Support experience- setting up an appointment online etc.I really like the bigger screen and it's probably better for my eyes so I'm keeping the device. I'm also counting on Apple to fix the issue sooner rather than later- in various forums you'll read about people resetting their iOS device and doing multiple exchanges with no relief from the crashing. I will sign up for Apple Care+ which includes 2 Years of Tech Support and Accidental Damage so I can exchange the device if needed.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "GTJ3D_shopper", "ReviewID": "R2VDMUVOAX7XI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great quality, light, fast, easy to use.

He loved it so much that we got one for him. We bought the Apple cases for both of them and my husband bought the stylus, as well.We  are both very pleased with these tablets. My husband has a neurological condition and the accessibility features and stylus have been wonderful for him. He stopped using his laptop for portability, because the iPad Air does everything he wants. We were afraid it would be too heavy for him to hold, but he has found it to be lightweight and comfortable, and it does weigh less than earlier iPads. Anyone with vision and fine motor skills problems is almost certain to love the iPad Air, especially when combined with the stylus.I dropped my iPad twice when in parking lots, both times from low heights, but on hard surfaces. The case protected it and I have had no problems resulting from the drops.We use our iPad Airs primarily for reading Kindle books. Our joint account has a huge archive and our other devices were not handling it. The K4iPad app and this unit work beautifully together and we have had no problems accessing our books. This iPad is powerful.We were worried about how comfortable it would be to read for long periods because we kept hearing that tablet screens bothered one's eyes. We found it easy to use the settings to adjust the screen lighting, and found an adjustment that has caused no eye problems, even when reading for several hours. It has been very comfortable. We have also read in fairly bright sun with no problems. However, when the sun was actually hitting the screen, it was impossible to read on it.We do use the iPad Air for many other functions. Games, surfing the web, eMail, videos, music, photos, YouTube, social networking sites, and so on, work as well as on a computer. The battery lasts a long time and the 3G is a real bonus when wi-fi is not available.I have seen some negative reviews of the iPad Air, and I don't doubt that some people have had bad experiences. All I can say is that we have had good experiences with Apple. Our iMac was out of warranty and still working when Apple notified us they were replacing the hard drive on all iMacs like ours, because the hard drives had an unacceptable failure rate. When we took it in to the Apple store, I asked them to also check my iPod Touch, which was two years out of warranty and had become very temperamental and glitchy. They found a corrupted file on the iPod Touch and got it set up and working for me, and didn't charge anything.

Even now, I get annoyed at some Apple-isms, the way Apple does some things, and try to stay away from it for the most part.  But I do believe it's typically more stable than it's technological counterparts, and easier to use for newbies.  Which is why we bought an IPAD 2 for our 8 yr old a couple years ago.  He took to it right away, it's intuitive enough.  There have been some slight issues, but it's still going strong.  Now 10, we just bought him this IPAD AIR... his 2 yr old brother gets the \"old\" IPAD 2.  And yes, the IPAD is intuitive enough for even a 2 yr old!  The screen on the AIR is so much better, clearer, sharper, and not just because it's \"new\".  Its resolution is just that much better.  Bought a cheap full body case until I could find a better one... trying to decide between the Otterbox (love the protection, not so much the hard cover design and that it doubles as a stand)... the Griffin Survivor (flimsy stand, landscape mode only)... or the Pelican Vault (no integrated screen protector, but I can put a protector on, and it is rated against water splash)... Lifeproof too expensive for what it offers... The 16G in the IPAD 2 was ultimately not enough after a year or so of use... Even with no \"movies\" or \"music\", games are much larger now, a few big games, and there is little left in a 16G device.  Without removing games, we didn't have enough memory left to upgrade the OS... so we opted for 64G this time...

The mini is actually not showing the whole color spectrum like the Air and it is very obvious.  The mini looks like the brightness has been switched down considerably.  So if you are like me and are trying to decide, do your research and go somewhere where you can compare them side by side and the choice will be quite clear.

Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note.

Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R99F4BEOZO0JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple does it again", "Author": "Robert Garner", "ReviewID": "R2A8NVDAH0DGG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first iPad.

Mainly they just felt a bit like a luxury item I didn't have much use for and they weighed just enough to be uncomfortable to hold for a long period.The weight is now a complete non-issue. I fall back in love with it every time I pick it up because it just feels so perfectly designed for being held and interacted with. It also feels like much more than a luxury because of how much usability it now has. There are so dang many things I can do on my iPad, things I used to need my pc to complete. This is partly because of improvements by Apple but its also the simple benefit of web and app developers designing their services with mobile in mind.I can only imagine this comes off as a completely biased review but know I didn't get this device expecting to be so happy with it.

When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!Having used several tablets, I like the hardware weight and screen resolution of iPAD Air. It takes 3-4 years for a tablet maker to reach an acceptable level. All previous full size iPADs were heavy for me. I won't go into details of iOS7 itself. I am also disappointed Apple has GPS only on 4G models. The apps and security of iOS platform is generally good. What I don't like is the iTunes way of syncing up. Not a USB drap and drop. This is the primary reason for me giving a 4 stars. Android trumps in this regard.Overall being a geek, I like all makers. I don't bias and want Apple to succeed. Success of Apple will propel Google and other makers of tablets. My wishlist is to try a a Windows tablet once they get through a iteration cycle in late 2014.Overall iPAD is a delightful tablet as long as you accept its limitations.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "They Sent me a used iPad......WTF????", "Author": "Marcus Scott-Morgan", "ReviewID": "RUZ0K3ME024YE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cant believe these guys had the nerve to send me an iPad air with no factory seal around the unit.I then proceeded to charge the iPad for the first time.

You even loses page numbers when transferring Microsoft Office docs--a pretty basic function. The ironny is that MSOffice is designed for MAC! There are third party workarounds that are very cumbersome. So much for MACs elegant design brags.  The alternative is the Cloud which also only syncs docs made in iWork.

First, try to buy the product through Amazon.  If you get lucky you will avoid 38+ dollars in taxes.  In my state I get charged that anyway.  I bought mine a few weeks ago and I now regret my decision.The ipad Air, full size not the mini, is expensive for what you get.  The much talked about retina display really isn\u2019t much better than Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s normal display.  I take a lot of photos and even at full zoom I can\u2019t make out much difference.  The Apple ipad Air does NOT come with an SD card slot, and if you want to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb you will be looking at over $100 additional dollars.  Many of Apple\u2019s competitors have the SD slot and cost less.Apple sells an SD card \u201creader.\u201d  You can download from the card to the ipad but NOT the other way.  And the ipad SD card reader will run you $30 plus dollars.  You must buy other $30+ dollar accessories if you want to use a USB memory stick for example.  I purchased a non- Apple SD card triple reader (USB and SD for example) for about $9 dollars.  The machine complains at me but it still works (but, once again, it only loads to the machine not from the ipad as a normal SD slot does).An SD card reader would have been easy to install as part of the iPad, and this gives their competitors an edge, especially when one is taking photographs and trying to download them immediately to examine on something other than a 2 inch screen.  As I shoot RAW (large files) photos with my Canon this inability to use an SD card is a real pain.Downloading music from Amazon to iTunes isn\u2019t any picnic either.  My wife has an android device from Dell running Jellybean and she downloads everything with zero problems.  Plus, she has an SD card slot which really helps.  Her screen is as sharp as mine.Finally, the OS systems.  Jellybean has about a million apps written for it while I have about 200 - or that is how it seems to me.  Her system is faster than mine AND her system is intuitive and mine is not.  I\u2019ve had to read over the Apple manual for ipad three times trying to get things done.  Maybe my largest gripe is I bought the Apple thinking several Apple machines could sync up and trade information easily including photographs and music and documents.  Wrong.  I\u2019ve tried numerous syncing ideas and none of them work.  I started using Pages (an Apple word processing program) instead to Word to get it to transfer.  Finally, I saved it to the cloud and managed to get the document to the other machine.  Photographs that are in the photo stream do transfer; however, getting the photograph into the stream when it was not automatically placed there by the ipad doesn\u2019t work.  And finding photos to look at in the ipad, when the ipad did not take the photo and the photo is on another machine (with the photo stream on and home sharing on) the photo still does not come up.  Very frustrating.After using the ipad and watching and using Jellybean and Android in action I think the Android devices are a much better deal.  Get one with an SD card slot.  I am certain Apple has designed their machine so the user cannot get extra storage on the machine (as an SD slot would allow) and must buy a more expensive machine if they handle large files.  If you like buying music at Amazon good luck getting it to iTunes onto your machine if it is an Apple (Yes, I have Amazon cloud player).  My wife got her music downloaded in about a minute.  It took me an hour to get one of Mozart\u2019s songs I had purchased downloaded to my computer.In retrospect, since the programs do NOT sync up as advertised, the machine has little storage unless you pay an enormous additional price, the retina display is not revolutionary, and the number of programs are minimal compared to Android I wish I had purchased an Android.  Samsung seems to be on the cutting edge there, although my wife\u2019s Dell is performing just fine.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad Air", "Author": "Oscar Crumby", "ReviewID": "R1LFVGKI48DRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a tablet.

It's tv quality display unlike the laptop or regular computer screen that is not visible if you are standing off to the side or too far away.I still hate touch screen tablets preferring the keyboard control of laptops but I have no regrets about this family purchase.  It does load internet pages faster and it does have the best display I have ever seen (but we are not a high tech wares household).  You can see the images from different angles from distances unlike how you need to position yourself to view a laptop screen.  So basically the high price can be somewhat justified in that for the price of a really good laptop - you can get a tv quality screen.  If the iphone had come out with a bigger screen like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I wouldn't have supported the purchase of this device and I would have been wrong about that but my brother has been sick and this makes him happy every day when he holds it - he smiles to himself.  After a few weeks of holding it carefully in a plastic bag!, we finally got the nearest perfect case for it: the i-Blason Apple iPad Air / iPad 5 ArmorBox Kido Series Light Weight Super Protection Convertable Stand Cover Case (Black).  I wanted the Speck handyshell of the Tylt stand but I as wrong.  The iblason folds under making it sturdier and better especially on a bed.We have screen protectors on front and back because this looks like the iphone 5s in that it is prone to scratches.We went with 64 gb after deciding on the 32 gb because nevermind Apple's profit margins, it was worth a hundred dollars more to prolong the life of this device.  Hopefully, this will be the only ipad we ever own.  We know people who still have their one and only ipad 2.This is another nonremovable battery so don't overcharge it.  You need to break out the included adapter because it's designed to be powerful enough to charge this ipad.  Iphone adapters will probably give you the message that the device is \"not charging\" after lighting up for a few seconds with the charging symbol when you first plug it in.It is thin but it is like a hard wafer - so it still FEELS thick in some ways - but it turns out one pound FEELS heavy to us so we didn't mind putting a fat case on it and ruin the thinness of it.  For the first few weeks without a cover, it didn't feel like that comfortable in the hand but then neither did the iphone 5s without a case.Holding something thin like the Air or the 5S does not make the device feel grounded but I definitely do not prefer the ungrabbability of the laptop - it is always a chore to haul a laptop.I don't doubt after living with the Air that Apple will be putting out much bigger Ipads in the future - it's the grab and go quality that is the selling point and we need bigger screens - this will then cut into Roku's competitiveness because Apple WILL put out an Ipad that is just large enough to make owning a tv set nonessential - it just needs to be bigger enough to be a few feet from the eyes.  Apple TV has real competition in the Roku but a bigger Ipad would not only be a laptop killer but it could make flat screen tvs less important.***********you can stop reading if you just need to decide if this is a good device - it is.  It also happens to be exponentially more expensive than Android and Windows tablets.The Apple walled garden feels BIG - it doesn't feel like the Android one which makes you feel like you went the a la carte route - you got a removable battery and removable memory with your device and you're feeling clever about saving money but the trade off is that you always have to scramble and you are NEVER SURE that you got everything covered (think of Apple as frustrating and expensive American citizenship as opposed to being a citizen of the European Union - Apple SUX!)  Android is missing apps and you notice when shopping at apps that it doesn't feel like the Apple App Store on the device - it doesn't feel like you have almost internet-size reach within the Apple universe.  It doesn't give you the feeling that you are receiving the goods first.  Android updates can be wonky and there is no accountability there - Samsung just apologizes if bad code screws up their phones that you now own and those updates with the unappetizing names that only sound good in theory but are all frankly, DREADFUL foods are never guaranteed for your particular device.  It feels like there is no recourse, no genius bar, nothing if there is malware or some other software problem.I'm not happy at all with Apple because of the nonremovable battery and the tough luck attitude if you plunk down way too much money BUT I can't trust the Android products at all BY THEIR VERY NATURE.  Google themselves won't refund their own branded devices after 14 days.  Am I supposed to head out to their California headquarters and beg for some customer service?  It doesn't matter if Apple stores don't make the majority of the sales  - they indicate a commitment to the customer.I'm always afraid Samsung is going to fold when it is no longer profitable for them - chaebols do do that.  I honestly don't think Google and Motorola are seriously interested in taking away from the Appleverse.  The Appleverse is the alternative, the break time from working on Microsoft computers.I would think the Android devices after they stopped getting updates would be as useful as the gameboy or nintendo ds toys in the back of the drawer somewhere.I'm not an Apple fan but I don't think Android has a shot despite offering removable batteries and memory sometimes which are extremely important especially for work-related data.*****************************The Apple Store lets you buy gift cards or coinstar receipts to pay.  Sony wants your credit card information even after they \"got\" hacked and released all the credit card information of its accounts.  Microsoft is only slightly better.  It's arrogant to force us to lose our financial privacy and security to access a device that we paid for.****************Who do you want to have access to too much of your personal information?I don't want ANY Of my stuff on ANY cloud especially if it is work related.  The internet-enabled devices are getting way more myserious, inaccessible and way slicker in the way they are not providing a description of what they do, how they do it, what is entailed, etc.  It's all ... hazy like a CLOUD.The internet access and the access of the apps to the owner's information makes me very uncomfortable which is why I see this as an entertainment device and not a work one  - it is impossible to look under the hood and control this thing - it takes the user for the ride - we are NOT in the driver's seat with these devices but that is also another reason to go American (that means Windows, Android Motorola/Google or Apple) and Apple and Windows are the ones with more closed systems but they're not perfectly secure.I think Siri indicates that not only are they recording our voices but they digitized them and broke down our voices into code not for recognizing our COMMANDS - but that means Siri could probably say something you never uttered in your voice.  The touchscreen could have been a fingerprint collector all along and the camera - well, I'm sure it is always on.**************Apple's litigation against Samsung is big news this week and if Samsung has been allowed to make money (it may be the only competitor who has something to show for its efforts) then it may have been in on it which means it can shut off the lights on their android devices and just sell big appliances because Apple's legal wins have huge implications.  It let competitors (usually foreign) copy (mostly for android - the name \"android\" doesn't really invite confidence thanks to Blade Runner and I, Robot) and if Apple is now suing Samsung successfully for copying - that means Apple didn't strike until there was something they could get back financially and it also means that Apple can damage you enough so that all your years of efforts will be for naught.  Those sunk costs - that's the poison.So I wonder - what if Apple sues in the home countries - the ban is for Samsung sold in the US.  What would Korean courts do about a lawsuit by Apple in Korea?  Does that make Sony Experias vulnerable in Japan?  What about Nokia now owned by Microsoft in Finland and in Italy one of Nokia's strongest markets?  What about the touchpad controller on the Playstation 4?Three days from the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Comedy Central is reairing South Park episodes on 12/4/13 in this order:HumancentiPad - not only about the actual war crimes committed upon civilians and POWs by Mengele and Unit 731 but also about Apple's originality AND their dominant attitude towards their rightsfollowed byA Song of Ass and Fire which reiterates the claim made in Black Friday that the selling point of the Playstation 4 is the touchpad interface.Apple can pull the litigation trigger at ANY TIME and because they already won with Samsung, Sony's attorneys are not going to be able to drag out much of the issues of the lawsuit so that the Playstation 4 can sell for as many years as its predecessors.Holy Moses.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive but built cheap.", "Author": "Timothy M.

Hdmi port7. Flash support so you are not limited browsing the web.8. Built in two position kickstand.9. Thin keyboards that double as covers. Can get them background lit, flat, with real keys, and a new one coming out with built in battery to recharge your Surface at the same time on a charge. Battery in tablet is good already though. Some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the Surface and adds to the cost. Ridiculous. You do not. It will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document. With an ipad you don't need one because what use would it be for? Sure there are apps. but they are limited to what you can create or edit. You have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it.10. Hook up to your t.v. or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen.11. Do a split screen on the tablet.12. Run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music, watching a video and doing something else like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode.13. Wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t.v, stream videos, pictures, etc.14. Drag and drop files.15. Can set up individual separate accounts on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet.Now these are not all the Surface 2 offers. I am finding new things still.The ipad Air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks. It's faster and lighter. Still does the same thing as before, nothing new.ipad Air1. Powerful processor. For doing nothing new. Future fingerprint scanner? Tablet will still only run apps. as before.2. Lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard.3. Upgraded camera. Put it down, your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play. Use a real camera.4. No USB or sd slot. Need adapters for just about everything. And with the Surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables. On an ipad you can't do both. You either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something. And if it is dead, you have to wait until you charge it first. Also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the Surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable. And the cover/keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight. And justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not valid. It is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not support mouse functions. You are stuck with third party hardware that is Apple specific whereas with the Surface you can use anything that supports micro SD or USB. And having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad.will not be cheap. People gripe about the Suface cover/keyboard costs too much. Well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost $40.00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost $100.00 that you have to carry seperatley.5. Having to convert simple files with Apple software a hassle.5. Tons of apps. Android not far behind. And Microsoft growing. How much apps. does one need?6. What good is the Reina display if it isn't widescreen? Picture is actually smaller than 9.7 with the black bars.7. Only compatible with Apple products i.e. cant print unless it is an AirPrint printer or stream to t.v. unless Apple t.v.8. Slightly upgraded camera. Put it away! Your blocking my view! And people with a 4.8 inch phone look ridiculous? At least they are not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9.6 tablet that takes two hands. Kind of contradicting.The ipad Air has more negatives than positives, so how can it be better? Android tablets have more features even than the ipads. I guess if you want one just for games and apps, then an ipad or a higher end Android tablet might suit your needs. People are not weighing in that the Surface 2 can do more than just play games.Now back to the Surface 2. There was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do. It didn't take long though. Look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of. There different ways to open, close, move, split screen, multitask, etc.The tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it I admit. But the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as I didn't think it would. I don't have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also. And even if I put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle.The boot up time takes a little while when completely off, but remember it is opening real office programs. When in sleep mode it opens up quickly.I went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge.The tiles are nice because it is real time data so I can glance at them without opening up an app. for email, weather, etc. On Apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up, Android you can use widgets.With a real browser and Flash I can use full websites rather than a mobile version. And also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs.As I mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn't be.The only two cons I find on the Surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long. You have to be really close to an outlet of some sort.And the main con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don't have the full gigs of memory stated. So might have to get an sd card. Yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs, but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can't do what the Surface 2 can do.If you are waiting for a ipad Air Pro to come out. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come with a Retina display, finger print scanner, nice camera, etc. You will have to wait for the Pro S, Pro S1, etc. to get one feature at a time and not several at once. I mean come on, cant even throw in a simple camera flash. The ipads shouldn't even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run Office software. There should be a category for Dumb Tablets that only run apps, a category for Smart Tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not just limited mobile versions, and Extreme Tablets for ones that can run full blown Office suites.If your a die hard Apple fan, please back up your arguments with something valid other than ipad rocks or a childish angry comment.

First of all, it took over six hours just to set up the iPad Air, because it wouldn't receive the information that was being inputed. Very frustrating. After three calls to Apple tech support, we finally got the set up finished and were able to use the unit. Next, we were told that the SIM card from our cellular data provider would work with the iPad Air. It did not. So, my only option was to pay AT&T; or any of the other three providers $50 per month for cellular. That's a rip off. It's no coincidence that all four of the cellular providers available for the iPad Air charge virtually the same high price for coverage. So, the IPad Air is very pricey for a tablet, it's very time consuming to set up, the cellular coverage is very expensive. So, we returned it and got our money back. That was the best decision I made in regards to the Apple iPad Air.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ordered the wrong one", "Author": "Don from VA", "ReviewID": "R3UR5Z6N0MZDOZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife.

I will review it later.  I rated this model 3-stars simply based on their past history with other iPads (we have an earlier version and we are extremely pleased with it).

I assumed I'd like their products as I had a high opinion of them as a company. Most of these reviews are full of how great they are and tech data. I'm 52, I'm not dumb, I can work a PC, I've got a BMW, a Bang and Olufsen system, a couple of homes and the rest.Well it's an education; we're all used to be expected to work stuff right out of the box, but if you're an apple novice, if you don't have a smart 'phone (I know that's putting me in a minority but why would I need one when I've been out the workplace for ten years?), if you still use CD's for music and DVD's / blu ray for films, well take my advice and don't bother. A nightmare to set up, impossible to put right if you get it wrong; mines back in the box three hours after delivery and there it will stay. I'll put up with windows instead.For all you guys who want to do loads of stuff, well good luck to you. I just wanted Amazon, Google search and my mail live on a screen next to my seat in the living room and was prepared to spend $500 to have that in a nice package. It didn't deliver, and no I don't want to have to go around to my local Apple store and ask some guy pursuing an alterative lifestyle how to do it. Much easier to make do with the $150 Acer notebook, even if it does need to be on a mains lead most of the time.Farewell Apple; if it had worked I'd have bought a pricey Mac, but that ship's sailed and I'm $2000 ahead.Phil", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "A joy to use!", "Author": "Sandra E.
