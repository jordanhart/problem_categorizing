I called the seller for the information and they never responded. The extended warranty I also bought is only good after the original warranty expires but since I don't know who to contact ? It was a waste of money, a Kindle would have been a better choice.This seller has no email contact information available, only a phone number, don't buy from them!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C5MT318"}}
