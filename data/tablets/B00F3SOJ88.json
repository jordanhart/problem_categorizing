{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better Than Expected", "Author": "Anfro", "ReviewID": "R3T4NP8MHRA7T6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this Tablet for over a week now and have to say that I am blown out of the water by its performance and what you can do with it! To be fair, there were a few laggy areas when I first got it (day after launch) but those have since been cleaned up by 2 samsung updates. This thing is smokin fast now. I don't really use the \"My Magazine\" app that people are complaining about so I don't have an opinion on that one. But everything else that I use it for is amazing. I really enjoy the web browser that came with it too. I never use chrome or dolphin now.So far what has really blown me away is the split screen where you can have two apps open at the same time side by side. I really love this and do it often. Normally when I split, I have the tablet in portrait mode and have youtube in the top windowpane and the internet browser in the bottom windowpane. But on top of that in each windowpane can have multiple apps that you can switch with independently. I also love the fact you can have a windowed app (select few) that you can move around on the screen while you do others things. For example, I have my bank app up and want to figure out my finances for the next 2 weeks so I use the Spen to open a windowed version of the calculator and just start crankin away. It's awesome!Honestly I don't use the Spen that much for drawing and didn't really buy it for that. I bought it for the beefy specs, build quality, and high resolution screen and have not been disappointed one bit. It is nice to take a screen capture and be able to write notes directly on it though.One thing I think a lot of people are not taking advantage of is an app that comes pre-installed called \"WatchON\". It is a samsung app that uses the IR blaster as a universal remote control for all your devices that use a remote. In the tutorial you set up your tv model the cable you use, the make of the cable box, and voila you have a powerhouse remote experience. Let me tell you I use this every day now. So I open the app to the \"guide\" section and it shows everything that is on tv like your cable box guide. You then select what you want and it changes it on your tv! It's just nice to have a channel on and just peruse though the guide and select what you want without dealing with the cable box guide. You can star your favorite channels and switch between them with ease.  Volume up,down, source, and many other options at your fingertips. I also have my AV receiver that I use for sound set up and it knows to use that for the volume, the channel for the cable box, and the power for the tv. Brilliant! On top of all of that, if you have a newer tv with WIFI direct you can click a button to connect the tablet with the tv and choose to watch whatever is on the tv on the tablet! I was blown away when I stumbled upon that feature! Alert: this app is awesome on football days when you want to switch through the many games that are on at the same time!I'm rambling on here but also you can mirror your tablet to your tv (with wifi direct) and it shows what you see on your tablet on your tv. I played the new Madden game on it and it was flawless.All in all this is a great tablet and I am very happy with my decision even though it was about $100 more than I wanted to spend. It is worth it though. The software you get with this compared to a clean android experience makes it worth it.  I really think if i went to a nexus device from this I would miss all the features and Spen abilities. That is how I know the extras are worth it.I will update this review as things change for the better or worse but right now I am thrilled :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 1: Well, I have had this tablet for just over 3 weeks now and it has successfully integrated itself in my daily life :) I thought it would be odd for a while considering I came from the HP Touchpad with android installed. The HP touch pad has a more square aspect ratio (like the ipads) whereas the Note 2014 is more \"Wide Screen\". I am happy to say that I am totally comfortable with the Note 2014 after just 3 weeks. :) I even use it in portrait mode mostly and it feels natural and great. Over all I still love this tablet and it is performing very well.I've been through 3 over-the-air updates from Samsung and it gets faster and faster with each one. The only problem I had with the tablet was that it took a second or two to wake from sleep via the power button. The 3rd update seems to have fixed this mostly but there still are times where it will take a second...one Mississippi...there we go :) But honestly its not that bad. I use the MoKo case for it that I got on Amazon. It has the smart cover that wakes it upon opening so I don't notice a delay that much if there is one. Other than that I am still very happy with this tablet. I'm glad i did my research and waited for this one.Something I didn't really touch on in the original review are the speakers. They are very nice and I love that there are two of them for stereo. They sound very good as well. The HP Touchpad had some pretty good speakers (shockingly) and I feel this tablet is on par which is good and above average in my opinion.In conclusion, I am still very happy with my purchase even taking in account its price. I knew I needed at least 32GB internal storage so it was $600 or nothing :) Keep the questions coming and I will try to answer them as quickly as possible. Later!", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This tablet is not for everyone, but those it is for will be blown away", "Author": "J. Bush", "ReviewID": "R3G0A2Q146EVPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has entirely streamlined my educational, professional, and personal productivity.  I will preface this by saying I chose this tablet (as my very first tablet of any kind) after 5 WEEKS of research and hours and hours of reading the manual, watching video of reviews, unboxing, customization, how-to's, tips and tricks, and specific software guides. I had the nexus 10 in my amazon shopping cart when I first came across this tablet.  I will nowhere in this review compare this to an apple device- I have never and will never own one- personal preference, I wholeheartedly believe iOS is sufficient or ideal for a lot of people's use, just not ever going to be for mine.  As background, I am in an international DVM program whose laptop just crashed and all 600+gigs of my life were backed up but now only floating in cyberspace so my requirements were a little heady for a tablet-a) deal with extensive editing and review of PDFs, PPTs, DOCs,  XLXS, etc  14-17hrs a day (terms range from 21-24 credits, 4-5hrs of lecture straight, 3-4 hrs of lab with no access to outlet in many labs).  Also when I say edit I don't just mean take notes on I also mean incorporate text, figures, etc from textbooks, websites, and other documents.b) Be a textbook reader and rarely a e-book reader (novels for fun!)  Need to access my extensive kindle library, plus some google books and a few Elsevier/pageburst textbooks. Also this needs to be something I am comfortable and accepting of to literally study off of, enough to give up my previous preferring to only study off of paper/actual printed out notesc) Allow for flawless email, web chat, skype video and text, some web browsing, and file transfer... all on an absolutely horrible school wireless and LAN setup, unpredictable power availability, etc.d) Streaming and downloading of podcasts, video, MRI, CT, radiographs, and ECG'se) Be portable to the clinic and the farms for patient-side transcription, recording, etcf) Get me through the 5-6hr flight and all the airport time!g) Occasionally watch videos/listen to things for funh) Most importantly, due to a dominant hand injury, multiple surgeries, and continued required hand therapy/rehab, I am currently able to write again but not to type with that hand.  I therefore wanted a tablet that was stylus intensive- not just for notes, but for navigation, etc.  THIS is what made me give up that wonderful squeaky clean android OS of the nexus 10! (I still thing that is probably the best thing for people that want an android tablet but don't NEED a stylus) So my tablet arrived flawless and flawlessly.  The display is beautiful, if anything the screen is too bright- I'm aware my eyes are light sensitive so this won't match with the majority of people but if I do turn my brightness on at all I don't believe I've ever gone above 15%, though I'm sure there will be some case videos poorly and darkly shot that I may need to in the future.i) at least temporarily, replace my laptop and download and have as much of my backed up laptop files as possibleThe tablet was quickly populated with the apps from my HTC phone and google account.  The account set up for everything was quick and easy.  The initial 2 updates were completed with no adverse signs. Navigation was great, no lag, and I quickly cleared out the stock widgets, set up my panes, and then went into settings.... I activated Developer options and did some customization and disabling there, but most of the disabling I did in app manager, device, and controls.  There are very helpful guides out there if you're not sure which apps are safe to disable as well as a \"Guide: Longer Battery Life- How You're Being Robbed on XDA that takes you step by step in maximizing your tablet.  It was not created at the time when I cleaned up mine but it would've helped greatly!Here is the gist.  The tablet comes crammed full of software and capabilities that I don't need or want.  The My Magazine app, a lot of the touchwiz stuff, the eye movement sensors(smart screen), the hand gesture stuff, reading mode, voice control, motions/palm motions, all of that is just a constant battery drain and I will never use them.  They were disabled and the vibration feedback for everything was also turned off.Battery Report:  This tablet was shipped within the US twice, and was brought internationally on a plan 4 days later.  It was accidently left on the ENTIRE time for about 8 days with six apps up on standby.  It arrived with 18% battery left.  I use it for 15-17hours a day and end up having to charge it 2-3hrs per about ever 24hr period to get it back to 100.  I can use it while it is charging and it will still positively charge during use.USE FOR A STUDENT:  It has replaced textbooks, laptop, printer, scanner, and painstakenly editing and customizing notes and making documents for me.  Disclaimer: as someone who used to be able to type 130+ words per minute, I'll make perfectly clear, if you prefer to type and plan on typing a LOT tablet touchscreen keyboards SUCK.  This is a fact of life.  You can get used to them, you can get proficient at them, but you'll still probably hate it and you're going to need a physical keyboard case/add on if you do a lot of typing of documents or emails.  Now, this tablet is made for a stylus.  This is not just a peculiarly edged simple piece of plastic that you can buy for just about any touchscreen device and kind of use as a writing device.  This is the s-pen, a WACOM and this device and stylus is designed to maximize the experience so you are writing or drawing digitally with an experience just like on paper.  Examples- the harder you press the more solid and thicker your pencil/pen/brush/highlighter/calligraphy/etc line.  The button on the stylus brings up air command which can be super helpful and it also allows quick screen shots. The stylus allows for fine website navigation that allows you to open drop down windows etc as mouse would.  It also offers things a real pen/pencil cant- selective erasing, and selection for drag/drop/copy/paste of ANYTHING to ANYWHERE.  You're typing notes and see a great figure and text on a website, you can freehand or rectangular circle what you want and put it into your document. Then you can resize/edit.  It's great.  I've been using the Snote app for everything thus far, I have made short futile attempts with Lecture Notes and Evernote but I couldn't really get anywhere.  I'm not going to give up on then, I just need to research them more to see if I can eventually get them to do what I want and then I can compare them to Snote.USE FOR A PROFESSIONAL: So far, this has been wonderful.  I can seamlessly take notes, look up references, voice record my exam findings, and awkwardly as only a tablet is, take video and pictures of patient's during an exam for later review. (Extremely helpful during lameness and neuro exams for the file).  Collaborative documents through Polaris office and google drive is exceptional- as fast as a laptop and more portable, and better screen size than a smartphone. It runs better than the school computers for running presentations off of onto projectors.  I can also have students I tutor digitally sign- literally our weekly sheets and submit them via email with one step- completely negating the awesome printer and scanner I brought down here.USE FOR A CONSUMER:  I find this tablet beautiful for watching movies and videos and the sound is great.  In a classroom of 50 people chatting between classes I have no problem hearing the speakers among the hub but there are completely valid reports that even cranked the sound might get lost a little if you're in a very loud close crowd.  Sound improves with earbuds but the initial audio set up app (basically a hearing test and then a customized audio scheme for you) was startling when it compared the stock/base line settings to what it came up with for ME.USE FOR AN ARTIST: I'm still learning and adapting, I'll never turn to this instead of actual physical art supplies and paper but it is fun and I can really see myself doing more digital than before.  It has been especially nice for graphic design, photoshopping, etc.USE AS A LEFTY: no issues except see below for one thing that affects both right and left handers...ISSUES:  1) One day after about a week of ownership, my battery was in the upper 80's, I was taking some notes and about 2hrs later I looked at the status bar and it was 29%.  I went into Battery in Settings, and the s-pen interface was responsible for 80% of the battery use.  I shut down and then restarted and it's never happened again.  Similarly the Android OS did the same thing at a later instance but again it was a one time thing and in both cases the battery recharged speedily after and stayed charged.2) Snote- I have had weird episodes where an import fails, or it force closes itself repeatedly when I try to rename or change the cover of one particular document.  After this erratic behavior occurred twice in three days and completely clearing and restarting Snote from scratch (everything backed up and replaced on my Samsung account) to no avail, I did a factory reset.  The last \u00be of my ownership have seen no such problems any more.  I will warn you that if you wipe out S note and you start from scratch in it and re-transfer all your SNote files back in, if you have a lot of really big files, it can take a really long time to re-populate.3) The menu/return and physical home button- occasionally based on the desk I'm at, if my arm isn't supported and my wrist is resting fully on the edge of the tablet, these buttons will get pressed while I'm writing.  Its purely an annoyance and doesn't affect the writing or do anything but I definitely have to reposition if I find I'm getting lazy on holding my wrist up at these desks.Wrap up: I only use in landscape, it's just like writing on a portrait piece of paper except you can also zoom.  I got used to writing on the tablet and the tiny stylus very quickly but there are compatible Samsung styli of various widths and sizes out there as well. I thought about waiting for the new 12.2 whose screen is literally a full piece of paper landscape, but I realized this is perfect for me and more portable than the 12.2 will be (this thing can just squeeze into one of the pockets on one of my lab coats.  I was planning on having to use the Nova launcher to avoid any lag but truly, this tablet was a speed demon already and I eventually got Nova solely for the customization ability and cleaner interface.  It allows me to avoid more things I don't use and I didn't lose ANY of the software I do.Bottom line, RESEARCH! PREPARE! And there will STILL BE A LEARNING CURVE! But it will be based on discovering unexpected cool features instead of on frustration).  If you won't heavily use the stylus, don't spend the money on this tablet.  If you're just curious if you could \"get into a stylus\" try one out first but prepare first so you can use it to the full advantage while you're there.  Also, I came from NO tablet and no Samsung/Note experience and there are changes between the previous model and this.  You don't actually lose much but things are moved around and different.  Don't be scared to optimize it, I'm not talking rooting, though adventurous forays into that terrain have finally arrived as well. In conclusion I love it, it has made things so much more efficient for me, I get a lot DONE with it and it's basically all I have to carry around.  I purchased the 32gig tablet plus a 64gig Sandisk XC which installed and worked like a charm. There are annoyances that come up but any issue I have had I have been able to fix. I have everything safely backed up on Carbonite and there's a million ways to sync all of your accounts if you chose (note some of this may be unnecessary or frequency can be dialed back too)It performs and looks beautiful and I am still learning.EDIT: FLASH PLAYER: This tablet absolutely supports flash. Youtube and embedded flash worked right out of the box, however, to watch my amazon video's etc, I just downloaded the following file- I cannot post the actual link but it's a drop box file. Install this and make sure flash is enabled in your browser settings/plugins and it will work in the stock browser, Dolphin, and Mozilla. Some people also recommend having your browser set to View Desktop site.Edit 12/15/2014: Please see my comment under product question- \"Can you use amazon prime video on the galaxy 10.1 2014 ed? asked by Judith C.

I just wanna say that this now support multiple users!! This is awesome and I'm so glad Samsung came through with this feature.Pros--Screen- Wonderful color representation and clarity, Eye candy.-S-pen- such a nice stylus, works like a pen, a tablet and stylus really belong together like this!-Speakers- Beautiful sound, surprisingly clear and crisp, just a pleasure to listen to. (watched the avengers a couple clicks below highest volume and it was definitely adequate)-Speed- One of the quickest tablets I've used, it has recently gotten an update that increases the speed of touch-wiz getting rid of any previous stuttering. The gpu in this is a beast capable of a lot of things that some of the next gen chips can't do like directx 11 and full Gpu computation.-Sturdiness- Feels very well built, haven't had any problem, although plastic it is very sturdy and doesn't \"feel\" plastic. The faux leather back is quite nice, and a welcome change of pace however it is just molded plastic I'll say so you don't get mislead.-Battery Life- This will have enough juice to power a heavy user through the whole day. I have done a test on 25% brightness with WiFi on continuously. In this condition it lasts 10hrs and 43minutes approximately. This was under heavy network usage, and the usage was about 4hrs of video, 1hr of gaming, 2hrs of drawing, 2hrs of web surfing and about the last 2 hours buying and installing stuff. This was with power-saving mode on I believe.S-pen air command functions:-Action memo- take a quick note and link the information your wrote to something.-Pen Window- Basically, an overlaying window that is surprisingly reminiscent of windows on, well..., windows. (Works with only seven apps currently though)-Screen write- Take a screen shot and write on it, not sure what it's good for. Maybe to annotate a website or an E book.-S Finder- Search your content, and the web for whatever your looking for. (draw a symbol and search it, or an equation, although it might not always know what kind of equation you want it to be.)-Scrapbooker- Basically collect content from the web, or anywhere and throw it all in one place for you to have easy access to.Cons--Touch-wiz is definitely not as easy to use as stock Android, once you get used to it though it isn't at all bad.(edit: I have really begun to like this version of touch-wiz, it has some things reminiscent of stock android but gives it a new spin, but it might not be for everyone)-Expensive, but worth it if you are going to use the features.-Cannot record 4k video, honestly 4k isn't going to be mainstream for awhile and it's not something that is missed as this can record 1080P which is very high quality.-The packaging was weird hah, was very secure though.-Not sure what else to put as i can't honestly think of anything else that is troublesome.(i will update though as i have further use of the tablet)If you have any questions please comment.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it!  Here's a few tips... (Follow-up)", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"richlife\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3LTQOYH9KQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 1/11/2014:  I just want to add a tip that someone gave me in a comment to another Note 10.1 2014 review. In the review that follows, I complain that Android is not really conducive to developing and editing spreadsheets, That's true ( .for me at least), but the tip was to work spreadsheets with the tablet in portrait position rather than landscape. That really does help.Update 12/3/2013:  First of all, I've downgraded my rating to 4 stars -- for the same reasons many have commented on.  I just don't find the problems to be as large or as tedious of some do and I get a lot more benefits from my Note 10.1 than I have issues, so I would really say a 4+.The biggest issue is that the Note hand writing translation is not anywhere near perfect and does actually have a few naughty problems that will at times slow you down.  I find you need to learn how to \"write\" on the note.  For example, it has difficulty between my \"i\", \"l\", \"/\", and even \"'\" or \",\".  As I get more meticulous the better the result.  My \"tt\" is done with three strokes, not four.  The Note seems to have learned how to handle that.  (Good!)  Stray spaces or overwrites tend to happen and mostly surprise me and require correction.  But at times the Note just correctly interprets the same input.  (Strange!)So for me who uses the Note to communicate with others (not just to take notes for myself) and who tends to perfectionism on spelling and punctuation, there IS a certain amount of frustration and correction that I shouldn't have to do.  (I should point out that 45 years ago in college, I learned to print FAST because I couldn't read my own writing when it came time to review/study.  I haven't tested Note with my writing, but frankly, I shudder.)So why a 4-star review?  I love it.  With some minimal correcting, I generally get what I want properly entered with the s-pen and I feel no need for a real keyboard despite being an excellent typist.  I MUCH prefer the s-pen over poking the screen keyboard.  Those who complain about lag, even with TouchWiz, clearly are not getting all the Samsung updates or may have other issues.  (Incidently, as a new Samsung user, I LIKE TouchWiz and have not felt a need to replace it.  I also just got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 and naturally there is almost no learning curve.)  Despite TouchWiz, Android 4.3 is simple Android 4.3.  Don't bother me with complaints otherwise.The screen is great, the size is perfect for me (where the Nexus 7 was just too small), the feel is good and after 3 weeks I still don't understand why people complain so vehemently about accidentally pressing fixed button or soft keys.  Some adaptability in life is a good thing.  I won't say that accidental key presses have not happened, but no more than using my 6 year old laptop (still getting occasional use).The speakers puke, but that's why I bought a Logitech Bluetooth Speaker for my Nexus 7.  I use my devices for music access, not for quality sound.  You need to find your own sound quality.  A photographer or a smartphone owner may not want to use the onboard camera, but it is definitely useful at times with reasonable results.My other use for a Note is for woodworking design.  The is no replacement for Sketchup -- that's the only software for which I need to find an Adroid option.  However, some limited use of the S-note and Sketchpad have been very promising and hand drawings are basically how I start everything and sometimes the only thing I use.I'm a retired programmer/project manager and now have only an irregular need for a full computer system though I have been dependent on a PC and then a laptop for more than 30 years until 3 weeks ago.  My laptop still suffices when needed, but I've hardly used it at all since getting the Note.  My biggest issue is with the extensive spreadsheets that I would like to be able to use, edit and update on the Note.  Spreadsheets in general are not well supported by the Note software (or any other Android software that I have found). Spreadsheets are not pure text input and Samsung or someone else should provide a \"Cell Based\" input means that doesn't cover half the visible spreadsheet with an input area.  So there is some spreadsheet utility, but at this point, I still must go to the laptop for major updates.I don't see that as particularly a Samsung problem although they could (and should) certainly provide the solution.  The Android spreadsheet software is just lacking for advanced work.  Most of the FUNCTION is there, but as I said, the interface is weak.  This typically would only affect me about 3 - 4 times a year.  My spreadsheets have 10 years of development and use in them for budget management.  I can still see my results (including the graphical analysis) and do limited inputs with what is available on Android.So this spreadsheet limitation is the ONE item that prevents ME from COMPLETELY replacing a Windows based computer with the Note 10.1.  It may not work for others, others may feel more limited, it may be necessary to adapt to new software and techniques (cloud usage) but I am very satisfied with the Note.  Improved S-pen software and a good spreadsheet interface, would complete my requirements.I've never been an Apple user though in my technical days did involve early Macs.  I'm in the camp that the the iPad bigots should \"get over it\".  If you like your device, fine.  It's not better than mine for my purposes -- I like to be able to manage my own device.(It suddenly strikes me to say that MY usage has almost NOTHING to do with media entertainment.  Interesting!)(Begin original thoughts:)It's hard to add any to the good reviews that have already been made, so mostly I'll first recommend that you read the first 5 - 8 reviews under the default \"Most Helpful First\" sort.  At the end of this preliminary review, I'll add the many suggestions I collected from reading ALL the reviews and comments -- that should help some of you who are new or still trying to learn.  And I strongly recommend that anyone watch the 48 minute YouTube review that I have posted as a comment.  There is more good information and orientation in that video than you'll find in maybe any other.Despite some dissenters on this idea, I'm using the Note 10.1 as a replacement for my venerable Win7 on Sony VAIO laptop.  The laptop is beginning to show it's age and wear after 6 years.  Still runs better than my wife's new Lenovo Twist with Win8.  I've been using a Nexus 7 for the past year and this Note is much nicer.So related to this laptop replacement, one question I have up front is whether any of those who rate this tablet at 5 or 4 either have or plan to get a bluetooth keyboard to use with it.  At this point, I'm not in a rush, but as a typist, a keyboard CAN be nice.  For me, the keyboard would stay in my living room like my laptop does -- I definitely will use the Note and stylus for portability and convenience. (Edit:  You can get a keyboard, but I now don't think it is necessary.)The most difficult concern with this tablet is it's complexity (I've commented about this in a number of other reviews).  After that concern, there is a nice \"feature\" that got in the way -- once you follow the introductory setup, if you already have had a tablet, the Note will go out to Google and/or Samsung and start downloading your configuration and apps.  Nice (it took several hours to get all mine from my Nexus 7) but interferes with getting the new updates from Samsung.As others said, there are currently three updates which eliminate the lag and add multi-tasking.  If your new Note is clean, you will have no issues with doing a factory reset after getting those updates as some recommend.  But if you spent hours getting your apps in place, you probably won't want to start again from scratch after a factory reset.  Despite that (wanting to be sure I had the best possible performance) I decided to do the factory reset -- after all it was just a matter or waiting for all those downloads again as I hadn't really done any special customization.In the end, I found that doing the factory reset didn't seem to provide any better performance for me -- it was great before and after with no lag.  I suspect that those who did get an improvement had not downloaded all 3 updates before they did a reset.  Can anyone confirm or deny that?  (Edit:  Max posted agreement with this.  Thanks, Max.)So now I'm into seriously configuring this thing.  Since the Nexus 7 doesn't have a memory card slot, all my apps were downloaded into the Note main storage.  Any suggestions on what and how to best transfer stuff to the 64 Gig microchip?  I assume some apps will run better from main storage?  I plan to put all my data, music and pics on the microchip.I'm not having problems or lag with Touchwiz, but I'll try another launcher and post about that later.  (Edit:  Not sure now that I will actually bother -- TouchWiz is fine for me.)So that's my preliminary rating based on the fact that everything I've done and tried out has gone well and the device itself appears to be in perfect condition.  I'll edit this in a couple of weeks to update my experience, but up front, I TOTALLY disagree with the review that complained extensively about the poor build quality.  Sure it's plastic, but the fit and finish is great.  NOTHING appears to be loose or vibrates.I also want to comment about the experience I had with Amazon on the shipping.  UPS completely screwed it up and reported the tablet as delivered on time even though I never saw it.  The first Amazon CSR seemed to get things all taken care up, but I didn't get any followup.  After I called back AGAIN, the support team worked together to first of all ensure I got to someone who would take care of the problem and each person involved took responsibility to see that the handoffs were completed properly.  Not ideal, but I got my Note 10.1 with only a small delay.___________Ok, these are the suggestions I gleaned from the reviews and comments of others.  Feel free to use or not as you choose -- these items are copied as found from different people so they are a bit disjointed and redundant:NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues. Go to Settings/General/About Device/Software Update to get it. Mine did not automatically update.If you continue to have issues, you should do a factory reset after installing the newest update for the device. To check for updates manually, go to about device in options.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.If you are still complaining about lag, I would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like Nova Launcher.NOVA is good, but I've always liked Apex better.  With Apex, I turned on \"Tablet UI\" mode, which makes it look like stock Android (no bottom bar, no dock, app drawer icon in upper right, square-outline tablet animation for panning desktop, etc). I love stock Android so for me, Apex in tablet-UI mode is great.After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great.Cons: Samsung overlays android with their system touchwiz. It has its good but it has its bad like major Memory hog. I'd recommend using one of the launchers such as nova launcher for a more customization of an experienceUSB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome.Google Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities. To allow the Dolphin Browser to have its Flash option work, you must download an Android 4.0's version of flash on the tablet, anyone version will do. Google Android flash player archives and proceed to the Adobe site. Flash has no longer made anymore updates for android devices, therefore you must do it this way. Go to dolphin browser, hit menu, hit settings, turn on flash. And now you have flash capabilities on your Dolphin browser, no other browser has flash capability as of now. I must tell you it is a pleasure to watch Amazon prime videos using the dolphin browser, and at the same time multi-task with another browser like chrome to read stuff on the internet or use S Note on the right side while watching a video for class on the left side.LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:  -------------Turn on developer options by tapping \"build number\" found in the \"about\" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice. Once in S voice, hit the menu button which is located left of the home button. Choose the option to \"not initiate S voice by double tapping the home button\". You will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen, however it won't be snappy until there is an update.In addition, the more apps you have on your device, the more cache data your device will accumulate. Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master.  -------------Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location.-The Touchwiz gallery app is TERRIBLE, it draws thumbnails every time you open the app, so if you have lots of photos, it hangs/lags sot bad that it can render the device unusable.[I use QuickPic and it handles everything fine](For people that dont have 4K+ photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging, dropbox photo displaying, Google+ photo syncing/displaying, Facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery)??? If you have the Galaxy Note phone, transitioning to this tablet is super easy in that the user interface is practically the same. And once you link your Google account, it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you. You'll still need to download Amazon apps individually- but you'll need to allow downloads from \"unknown sources\" to get them.I will say there are some things you won't discover right away; settings that are buried in other menus and menus that you discover in apps after days of using them.Many application features are difficult to discover. Always press the menu button, just in case!Turn off the news/home button association by pressing the menu button while the news is on screen. You'll see the option to turn it off there.The S-Note can go into what I'd call \"Note-Only\" mode, meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows, only the 100% pure note, so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(After going into the edit mode) With 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release, and it will go into that note-only mode, and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button, and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode (back to the regular edit mode).I've only had it a few days and the first thing I did was download Nova Launcher, program it to \"remote\" my TV and to prevent possible lag went into \"Settings\", \"General\", \"About Device\", tapped \"Build Number\" 7 x's. This opens the \"Developer Options\" tab, then under \"Drawing\" turned OFF \"Transition Animation Scale\". You can go to YouTube and watch this tutorial presented by TheDigitalDigest. Great series of helpful tutorials for tablet neophytesTo learn more about the Note 10.1 2014 Edition, here is a link to a YouTube video on Samsung Mobile's page:[...] .  [Even better to me, this is the long, thorough review that shows almost everything there is to know:  [...] .]", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why I returned my Ipad air and purchased the Note 2013 Edition", "Author": "Mark H. Weiss", "ReviewID": "R1UR3PZTN5YPWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was a very difficult decision to return my iPad Air and order the Note 2014 Edition.  There are plenty of reviews that address the functions of the and features of the Note 2014 Edition, what I will address the key areas that  made me move off the Apple platform.For background I have been an iPad user since the beginning, I have loved the design, function and application portfolio of the platform.  What I have not liked was the closed environment of of IOS, I find it frustrating to run all my content thru iTunes and the difficulty and sometimes inability to move content from the iPad to other platforms.(Yes I know about Dropbox and cloud services but that still requires additional steps and still doesn't enable certain content to be easily moved))  It is incredibly easy to sideload content to and from the Android platform enabling me to share my content across all of my android devices.Aspect Ratio - I read a lot of printed materials (newspapers/magazines) on my tablet,  initially I favored the 4:3 aspect ration of the  thinking that it enabled me to read the text of a full page without expanding.  Even though (in landscape) the 16:9 ratio on the Samsung is not is wide it turns out to be wide enough and better fits the length of display required for both newspapers and magazines.Expanded Storage -  In the current release of Android you have the capability of running applications off of the MicroSD card effectively expanding main memory.  Note in early release of android you could only store content on the microsd.  I was always very frustrated at the cost that Apple charged you for storage-  For an additional $45 I have been able to expand my 32gb congfig to 96gb - note- you'll want to use a micro SD card the read/writes ar 30mgps like the Ultra series from SanDisk.Printing - This is a definite strength of the iPAd/IOS platform.  The print function is built into the operating system enabling you to print natively.  Printing on the Note is a bit kluge and requires third party apps like cloud print, HPePrint and others. than on Android Applications -  It is no surprise that more iPad applications are optimized for the larger screen.  Android still seems to be a phone based operating system that works on larger devices.  From the aesthetic perspective this in not a problem for me, video content from Netflix, HBOGO, Xfinity and Youtube look just as good on the Samsung Note and the did the iPad Air.  I get less wowed that my weather widget doesn't jump off the screen.  However one of my favorite magazine applications Newsstand does not run in Android.  This is that app that consolidates electronic versions of the print magazine you subscribe to.  Currently note of the publishers of the magazines I subscribe to have a native android app.  All of the aggregation apps like Plus or Zino would require a second subscription which I am not willing to do.  Big negative for me.S-Pen -  This is a key reason to purchase the Note.  I love to take down phone numbers and have them immediately published to my contacts file or to-do to my to-do list.  Using the S-Pen with the multi-taking capability is incredible, it enables you to asclosely as possible emulate what you can do on a powerful laptop.  Major feature/capabilities advantage for the note.Swift-Key/Swipe - This is the best way to input onto a virtual keyboard.  I hated typing on my iPad after sywping on my Samsung Phone. Swiftkey is an even better implementation along with it allowing you to resize and relocate the keyboard.  Major advantage for the Note.So to net it out, they are both great tablets but the ability to expand storage (cheaply), easily move content to and from the platform, multi tasking, swyping and the S-Pen made the decision easier for me.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "SUBSTANCE and INGENUITY- Not Just \"AIR\"  ---now has MULTI-USER !", "Author": "anzicco", "ReviewID": "RI1ECL1ST763L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the new Galaxy Note10.1- 2014 now for about three weeks ever since I traded in my aging iOS device, an iPad 3.I am blown away by the beautiful Ultra HD display which far exceeds any clarity and color of any tablet I have seen!  Blows retina away!The S Pen let's me be \"naturally\" creative as I would with a pencil on paper, as it responds well and handles almost flawless to transcribe what I write as text into typed text from taking notes, to searching in the URL box, to the new ingenious Twitter application that let's me write or draw tweets! The ability to open multi windows is a great new experience from the decaying stagnant features on my old tablet. Not only can you open two apps and work between them at the same time, but you can also open two windows with the same app such as 2 websites or 2 emails... and you can even draw another window, or 2, or 3 on top of those windows to watch youtube or bring up a calculator and more!The one gripe I have is because of its advanced specs, some of the software, especially touchwiz related items, does not seem to be optimized for these higher specs and tend not to run as smoothly as they do on the S4 or Tab3. There are also some game apps that falter or slow down for some reason (like Simpson's Tapped Out) when they work fine on my other Galaxy products. I don't know if they just haven't been updated for android 4.3 which is standard on this device or if they just can't keep up with the tablet's specs. I hope Samsung releases an update to speed up these issues, and that Kit Kat 4.4 is planned for this monster of a tablet soon!I highly recommend this tablet. Samsung makes it easier to switch from other formats such as Apple's iOS to android than some of the other manufacturers that just give you vanilla android.I made the switch earlier this year when the S4 was released and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be...I did not lose functionality or choices of productive apps, but actually gained a lot more and also can customize my device to reflect my taste, not some hot shot designer in an IvEry tower telling me the way my device should look and function.  You can also expand this device's storage by an additional 64GB with a micro SD card!HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tablet for anyone who likes to be creative or productive and enjoys the freedom to have the additional input that the S Pen provides!********************NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues.

That being said, having an Android device, especially a Note 10.1 2014 has its benefits:-Customization of home screens with android widgets (see google).-Air View, Smart Scroll (leave off when not using to save battery), Smart Stay (leave off when not using to save battery).-Micro SD card for external storage up to 64 gigabytes.-Downloadable music, video, document files right off the internet that gets saved to your device(external or internal) and easily accessible through the general video, gallery and document apps on the device.-Ability to download third party apps not found on the google play store, such as paid apps. (Does not require your device to be \"jailbroken\" like the iPhone/iPad.-much more benefits,Note: If you buy the Note 10.1 2014 you get over $600 in perks. This means $25 google play store money, $50 for Samsung hub to download entertainment, 2 years of 50gb of Dropbox storage free, 3 months of Hulu Plus free, Audible for 3 months free and several more other offers.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.Comparing this tablet to the newly released iPad Air, this tablet is much for capable in terms of multitasking and performance. iPad Air has 1gb of RAM, whereas the Note 10.1 2014 has 3gb of RAM. There is a noticeable difference in better performance speed in running apps and graphic \"smoothness\" compared to other tablets out there like like iPad 4 (not sure about ipad Air). More importantly, this extra RAM allows the Note 10.1 2014 to multi-task very well and I am referring to the \"multi-window option\" which allows split screen between two apps (Apple does not have this on the iPad) so you can operate different apps side by side at the same time. In terms of screen real estate, they are about the same however the note does have much more pixels (see specifications). The note is longer but shorter, while the iPad is taller, but not as long. The reason one may buy this tablet is for the S pen feature and its highly customized interface.No other tablet in the market has an S-pen that is advanced than the normal pens you use for touch screens. The S Pen has a button and when clicked on, it initiates air command which lets to choose options to take notes,save portions of the screen, write on a screen shot taken, etc (read all about air command). The accuracy of the Samsung screens is much more accurate in terms of pointing at words with your finger and especially your S-pen on the Note 10.1 2014 which is shown by research, if you google Samsung screen accuracy.For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities.

I must tell you it is a pleasure to watch Amazon prime videos using the dolphin browser, and at the same time multi-task with another browser like chrome to read stuff on the internet or use S Note on the right side while watching a video for class on the left side.Downfalls for Android for pretty much all Android tablets:less apps than the Apple App Storesome Apps are not fully configured to work and look good on your device because android which runs on the \"google play store\" cannot optimize each app for the hundreds of different android devices out there.less accessories, and more costly OEM device covers.I highly suggest buying the Poetic Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 slim case in Black that is available on Amazon. Great case, with auto sleep/wake when opening or closing flaps and a great feel/look.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Downfall for this tablet (currently), hopefully an update to fix will be out soon.Known issue of slight lag in the interface/home button while browsing around:Touchwiz is known to cause this issue(the interface program for Samsung Galaxy Series).LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:Turn on developer options by tapping \"build number\" found in the \"about\" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice.

Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master. Also I highly suggest you install an anti-virus software like AVG on your Note 10.1 2014.Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location. I suggest if you do get a defective Note 10.1 2014, return it for another one.But hey, for the innovative features you get on this tablet and especially the high customization you get it is worth it in my opinion. iPad's and iPhones have been nearly the same every year after each years new release.A good tablet contender would be the Surface 2 in terms of pricing, which is actually cheaper right now, but does not include a type cover.The pro's to the Surface 2 would be an almost identical Office Suite, the RT version of a windows 8 desktop and tiles, close feel to a laptop and built in flash player.The Con's would be a very limited HD screen, that is about 208 PPI, low market share and only 100,000 Apps on the windows store.In my opinion using the type cover with the Surface 2 would be almost like using a small laptop, which I personally think takes away from the term of what a tablet actually is. I might as well use my small laptop with windows 7 installed to do my office work. I dont plan to replace my laptop with a tablet. However if you rather have a tablet-like experience with something you are very familiar like windows, then the Surface 2 may be the way to go.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, a tablet that thinks with you and not for you.", "Author": "Beantown Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1F623L69UAQEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been holding off on jumping into the tablet game as every tablet out there was just another vehicle for access to entertainment and \"intuitive\" decimation of information (which I think mostly means without human thought or involvement).

A device that combined time - tested methods (handwriting commits things to memory like typing or finger tapping can't) with modern information and productivity.  This tablet is that and so much more.As a researcher, I need something that can handle hours of reading and annotations, mind breaks into magazines and Web searches and space to customize as my needs change.  No other tablet offers that level of flexibility.  This tablet does it beautifully (literally the screen is awesome and the function is unparalleled).  It's worth every penny.  The battery life is great, in the few days I've had it, I've had no problem going 2 days without a charge.  It's very comfortable to use in both viewing orientations.  And,  if you download the manual, you'll realize how unlimited the capabilities are.  The S pen is awesome as well and there has been no learning curve to convert it to text.

Harmony. Imagination. Life.\"", "ReviewID": "R1OL5HSJB8J8QV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased two of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (Wi-Fi only version) on November 27, 2013. One was for myself and one was for my fiancee. We're both digital artists, avid readers, lovers of technology, and were in need of a portable device with a screen larger than 5\".Having compared several tablets, I was intrigued by this version of Samsung's tablets based on a number of things - most notably: familiarity with Samsung products (we both use Galaxy S4 phones), the awesome specs and wacom-powered S-Pen capabilities. Major website reviewers at the time were saying that based on price, this tablet was gimmicky and an unnecessary purchase for those not in need of a stylus. Seeing the powerhouse specs of this device, consistent performance in reviews, and knowing the stylus was exactly what I wanted - I chose this one. I'm glad I did.Having read and watched several reviews online, I knew what to expect with some of the odd physical design choices. I've had several month to adapt to this tablet and by now I feel like it's absolutely worth putting that kind of time into adjusting to it's quirks. I'll first run through the negative aspects, the positive aspects, and how we adjusted to said quirks.THE QUIRKS====================1) HOME KEYNEGATIVE: The tablet seems to expect you to hold it in landscape mode (horizontally), as the physical Home button is located bottom center. Which of course means that if you change the orientation to portrait mode (vertical) the button is generally right where your thumbs is going to land on either side. This is further compounded by the fact that the Settings and Back (capacitive) buttons are to the left and right of the Home button.At first I found this to be very very awkward. I've read other reviewers who were so frustrated they returned theirs because they couldn't stand it. Indeed my fiancee went through the very same feelings, as did I. However, I gave it some time and after a couple weeks of constant use I became quite comfortable with holding the unit and it's not even close to a problem. I think of it now as a learning curve. My fiancee solved her issues with the button by investing in a tablet cover that acts as a stand, but also has a hand-strap at the back... which helps her not to have to hold the unit by the sides.POSITIVE: Now that I'm accustomed to holding this tablet with the Home Key placement. I use the tablet as effectively as any other device I own. I rarely run into any \"accidentals\". My fiancee doesn't use her tablet as often as I do, and thus isn't as studious about holding hers a certain way. Thus she does get some \"accidentals\", but she's getting used to it as the days go on.2) SCREEN GLARENEGATIVE: There's a lot of it. This is a high-gloss, premium glass screen. If you expect to have heavy lighting overhead (especially fluorescent ) you're going to spend a lot of time seeing the lights above you or looking at your own reflection at certain viewing angles. The screen's brightness however is fantastic, so moving it up to full will help some. The best answer however is to just slightly change your viewing angle. You can do this as your holding it, or invest in a tablet cover that has a multiple angle stand. Once I was aware of the glare I worked around it and like, the last issue was a minor learning curve.POSITIVE: The glare may be a bit rough, but the quality of the picture on the screen is beautiful. Online reviews say comparatively the screen is more washed out, but I've not noticed. Watching movies, gaming, drawing, using apps, browsing the web... all of it looks incredible. Because of this it really makes you want to adapt your usage to account for the screen glare just because the payoff is the gorgeous quality of the 10.1 realestate.3) CHARGING SLOTNEGATIVE: The Micro USB charging slot is perhaps the most goofy, senseless design element of all (and one I still find myself wishing was different). It's directly under the physical Home key, on the bottom edge of the device. Holding this while charging becomes an interesting juggle with that cord jutting out. Terribly uncomfortable experience while laying on your back in bed while charging, or even while sitting up to play a game. Add to this the fact that some games force horizontal orientation, and you're going to expect to be irritated when your battery needs a charge. While I haven't found any great solutions to this, it isn't so bad if you're holding it in portrait mode. As an aside, if you're not paying attention in dim lighting it's easy to try to shove your charging cord into the IR Blaster on the exact opposite end. The blasters even in the same shape as the charging slot... but thankfully it does no harm apart from making you feel like an idiot that you weren't paying attention.POSITVE: There isn't anything positive to say about the design placement, sadly. But the slot works well, the tablet charges (albeit slowly) up just like any device. The charger is the same as any other early 2014 Samsung device, so you can use your S4 charger to charge the tablet. and lastly: my fiancee (who is not a power-user) hasn't mentioned this as an issue at all.====================Those quirks sound intense, but remember I'm giving you a very detailed account of my personal thoughts and experiences, and there are a lot of reasons to look past them. We're going to get to those now. I'll take the same format as the above where applicable for the good things, though I'll begin each with a short description on why I like these features.1) S-PEN / STYLUSI use Wacom technology every day to create art for both business and personal art. Wacom is my go-to for all things stylus, and that they paired with Samsung to give you an authentic, high-quality stylus experience is just phenomenal. I both need to take notes and be able to draw on the fly, so this is my second main reason for purchasing this device.NEGATIVE: The stylus is rather short and very, very light. As a man with large hands it's kind of strange to hold something so dainty. The button on the stylus to call up the Air-View features is all-too-easy to press while using it, however this is also a problem with full-size Wacom tablets. Where the Samsung S-Pen fails is that this stylus is rectangular, so there's no option to simply roll the buttons away from your fingers as you can with a normal Wacom art stylus.Suggestions: I've read you can simply get a metal pencil holder to extend the length of the stylus - though I haven't tried this yet. I've also read that the new Note Pro 12.2 has a redesigned stylus - though I haven't looked into compatibility and shape yet.POSTIVE: The stylus works great! There's no leading or drag, it glides smoothly over the screen. The cursor on screen (which can be toggled off an on) is pin-point accurate at virtually every angle and regardless of the above, it gets the job done with seemingly no effort. That the stylus is conveniently stored in the upper right corner (landscape) of the device is awesome. It's easy to access and easy to put away. It snaps in firmly and I never worry about it falling out. The Air-View features are mostly very useful and worth leaving on. See a different review for more on Air-View.PERFORMANCEThis is the first deciding factor for me. I needed a tablet that was going to perform lag-free... partially for preference but also for performing art. You can't draw effectively if your machine is lagging, and I wouldn't have the patience for it. But on paper at least, it looks fantastic.NEGATIVE: None.POSITIVE: The paper was right. I glow with confidence everytime I pick this tablet up because I know it's going to be a champ. I've never once encountered stuttering or lag of any kind no matter how much I run on this thing. I've pushed it with multi-window, overblowing apps in the background while running a heavy one in the foreground, and I've gamed to death with high-resource graphics-intensive games. It's been 5months with this tablet by now... and no issues whatsoever. It's always buttery smooth. Any issues I've run into have been poor internet connection on my end, or software glitches in the app I was using. I do give my tablet an intentional restart every couple of weeks. I don't know that I need to, but it hasn't hurt.SCREEN SIZEHaving never owned a tablet before, I wasn't sure if 10 inches of screen would be too large or too small. I took the gamble if only based on all the other items on my list of \"must haves\".NEGATIVE: It takes getting used to if you've never held something this large before. This was a double issue for my fiancee who has smaller hands. For her, she finds she loves the screen size for some things (reading and shopping especially) but prefers the smaller screen of her phone for others. Much of this has to do with typing - which I might add I agree with her. Coupled with adjusting to holding it, typing is rather laborious. You end up moving your whole hand rather than just your fingers. However, the default Samsung keyboard and Swype both have options to shrink the keyboard (more phone sized), and split the keyboard (to type thumbs only). For me, these actually give quite a bit of typing relief.Alternately you could invest in a compatible Bluetooth keyboard. I purchased a tablet cover which came with one and it was easy to set up, easy to reconnect, and felt very close to a laptop typing experience.POSITIVE: 10 inches of screens has turned out to be the perfect number for me. It's generous for web browsing, a huge blessing for games, excellent for business and personal notes and office documents, and spot on for drawing. It was only just big enough to enjoy watching tv shows, but due to my want for a full cinema experience I would probably not watch a movie on this. For those who enjoy watching movies on their mobile device - you'll love it. If my picky attitude can enjoy a TV show on here you'll probably scoff at me and revel.On art: For my first art experiences with this tablet, I took it with me on a week long cruise and was happy I did. I didn't have to bring the entire backpack of my art supplies I was accustomed - just this one lone very convenient tablet. I completed four impressive works and, short of a Wacom/Windows hybrid tablet, it proved to be nearly everything I need for mobile art needs. Lack of needed software prevents me from performing my business art on this device, but for conceptual work and personal art this is a killer device.For business: As I understand it, this device can be hooked up to projectors old and new and used functionally for lectures and the like. While I haven't personally tested this, I've read a great many reviews from business people explaining how they have and that it was great for it.FEATURESThis tablet actually has a crap-load of features. Not many of them feel like bloat, either. Your usual Samsung line, of course, but also Autodesk Sketchbook, EverNote, and Action Memo to name a few. The Air-View features are also 98% useful for screenshot note taking and editing. I'm going to skip the positive/negative on this one, because there's still several features I haven't used, such as handwriting-to-text translation. However my overall experience with every feature and setting in this app has been wonderful.Your normal slew of Samsung's latest line of misc. features is here. Air-gesture, Smart Stay, Smart Pause, Smart-Scroll, Multi-Window, Screen Mirroring, Power Saving Mode, etc, etc! So many in fact that it may take awhile to remember all of your settings. I'm 5 months in and I'm still finding new things about optimizing my experience.Although it won't ever replace my tried and true TV remote - the IR blaster is cool, and screen sharing with my smart TV makes for a fun experience.This is an optimum device for Chromecasting, thanks to the screensize making the UI so easy to access. I much prefer it for this than my phone.TIP: Make sure you Software Update your tablet as soon as you get it. I did right out of the box and I had nearly 5 updates waiting for me. It's now on auto-update for those and I'm anxiously anticipating Kit-Kat to give even better performance.SOUND QUALITYOVERALL: With the external speakers It's just okay. Speakers are in the back and often get covered up. When using a cover I often have to move the flipped cover away from the back to better hear audio. This is improved when the covers is used as a stand as the sound bounces back... but like any mobile device the speakers aren't as ace as just using headphones.Headphone experience is killer. Samsung's integrated software for improving headphone sound is magnificent. Music and other media sounds superior even with just your included Samsung ear-buds. I highly recommend getting your audio this way - however it's not a complete fail on using the external speakers.BATTERY LIFEOVERALL: Battery life is one of those things every mobile device struggles with. I'm a pretty heavy tablet user, and in just a few hours of drawing, gaming, and movie watching, I'll have the battery down to about 30%. I can assume about and extra hour or so past that depending on what I'm using. But it's just as easy to plug it in and power use, which has become my usage habit when home.My fiancee, who I'd deem a moderate tablet user, gleans a full-day+ out of hers before deciding it needs a charge. On standby alone it will last around a day and half. Considering the size and quality of this screen, and that it's fairly light for it's size, I really think this is good battery life. Power users like myself may want to look into an external battery extender... as this battery cannot be removed.DURABILITYOVERALL: With its size, weight, squarish shape, and glass screen... this is an accident waiting to happen. Don't misunderstand, it feels very durable to hold, but like all mobile devices these days the ever present fear of dropping is most certainly here in this tablet. I definitely recommend a case for drop protection - even at home. Keep in mind that the front is all glass, and while the back does offer some grip for your hands, its back will slide across a tablet or nightstand faster than a hockey puck give the opportunity.There are a lot of great cases out there for this device. My fiancee and I both prefer different cases for different reasons. I'm using the official Samsung Book Cover, because it's slim, protects the corners, offers multiple angle stand, and is very light. She prefers a case with a hand-strap on the back to assist in holding, with a multiple angle stand-cover, and business card/pen holder. We both also have alternate cases with Bluetooth keyboards for travel - though we rarely use them.Have questions? Don't be bashful to ask.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "An excellent productivity tablet", "Author": "A. Garcia", "ReviewID": "RU3IMGOZFOW2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just glad I waited for this tablet and decided to buy it despite the price. I am a graduate student and  I believe the tablet fits my work needs like a glove. I have a good Bluetooth keyboard, but I rarely use it. I take all my notes by hand. You can write in many languages and the handwriting recognition is really impressive, no matter the language.  The split screen is also terribly useful. You can take notes and read a PDF or watch a movie at the same time. The tablet has also other helpful functions, like the search function that recognize even handwriting notes, the action note to make occasional memos, or the possibility of using the S-pen to draw a square and open some useful programs (the calculator among them), so they can stay on top while you are working in Polaris Office. All this makes me think that, right now, this is maybe the best option in the market for an university student, or any person who needs to do some real work with a tablet, specially if they need to take notes on the move, in conferences, meetings or classes.Just some warnings that I believe could be useful. This is an advanced device and the learning curve is much larger than with other tablets. After one month, I am just learning to use many of its functions and possibilities. You need to spend many hours if you want to learn how to optimally use the tablet and, strangely enough, I do not think that the default configuration is the best to work with the S-pen (you have to change some options, specially if you have large hands and you plan to use a S-pen holder).Besides, to obtain the best results with the handwriting recognition you have to use it a lot. In a way, you have to learn to write on the screen because it is not exactly as writing on paper, particularly regarding the \"handwriting rhythm\" (and right out-of-the-box it can be frustrating, specially if you have not practiced your handwriting regularly for a long time), but after a while you probably won't need a keyboard anymore and you will obtain remarkable results.  My backbone is certainly grateful for buying this tablet, since I do not have to carry my laptop anymore.A final warning, DO NOT BUY COVERS WITH MAGNETS. Most covers that are supposedly designed for this device use magnets and they heavily interfere with the S-pen. Many persons are having problems with this and many of them believe they have a defective tablet, when in fact the reason behind the malfunction of the S-pen is just a magnet too close (the S-pen works interacting with an electromagnetic field generated behind the screen, which is the reason why you do not need to charge it). I had to return a cover with a detachable keyboard. Once I replaced it with a neoprene glove, I stopped having issues with the S-pen.So, if you want a productivity tablet and you like to take notes and need to use several apps at the same time, I think this is the best option right now. If you want a media consuming or a gaming device, this tablet could do the job, since it has lots of power and a gorgeous screen, but I believe there are options out there for a better price.If you want to compare justly the Galaxy you have to do it with other productivity focused devices. I think in the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition as an Android equivalent of the Windows 8.1 Surface Pro 2. Both tablets have advantages and disadvantages regarding the other, but both are productivity focused devices. The Surface is designed expressly to be a laptop replacement and there are certainly many advantages in using a Windows 8.1 product (the top being Windows Office compatibility), but with the Galaxy you will have better battery performance, less weight and a handwriting focused device (which I find more comfortable for the size of a tablet) for half the price. To make a good deal even better, if you register it before March 31 you will get also generous perks from Samsung. At the end, I am really happy with my tablet, so happy I decided to write this review. Even when it was beyond my budget to say it frankly, I am working more efficiently now, so I take the tablet purchase as an investment. An excellent investment so far.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really good tablet for everyone, really great tablet for artists", "Author": "Banquero", "ReviewID": "REFIOMYW2YIB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this tablet for a few days now and I love it. I have always been a fan of Samsung products (I have a Samsung Plasma TV and a Samsung Galaxy S4) and this one hasn't disappointed. My previous tablet was an HP Touchpad with android honeycomb and my girlfriends iPad2. This tablet blows away the other 2! Its very lightweight and the texture of the back (leather like) makes it feel good in your hands. Materials feel more quality and sturdy compared to the plasticky feel of some other tablets like the HP Touchpad. The 2014 version of the Note 10.1 also has a higher resolution than the original version. Also pressing the button on the S-Pen brings up a quick options menu, this is a new feature to the 2014 edition that is not found in the original Note 10.1. Many of the apps and features are the same as the S4 (split screen, eye tracking, watchOn, etc). The camera is only 8MP but it includes all the photo features that the S4 has like taking pics with front and back cameras at the same time.I chose to buy the 16GB version (black) instead of getting the 32GB version. I figured I can just use a 64GB micro SD card if I need more space. That way I saved some money (I have plenty of micro SD cards already from old phones and digital cameras).As an artist I love using the S-pen stylus to draw and this was the main reason I bought this tablet over the Surface, Asus or Nexus (never even considered the iPad, the features on the iPad seem to be slow to catch up to the windows and android tablets). The stylus fits neatly in the side of the tablet and it doesn't feel like it will slide out on its own, which is great since if you lose it you'll have to pay $40 if you want to replace it. For daily use I still use my finger, but when I take notes or draw I use the pen. The tablet is lightweight and is perfect for digital sketches on the go.Speaking of drawing, the tablet comes with Sketchbook Galaxy which is a Samsung branded version of Autodesk's Sketchbook Mobile. I purchased sketchbook mobile a few years ago for my android phone and subsequently downloaded it on my HP Touchpad. Since all the apps on touchpad were automatically ported over to the Note when I logged into Google I now have both Sketchbook Mobile AND Sketchbook Galaxy! The Sketchbook Galaxy version is a bit scaled down from the full paid version but it is still a pretty powerful art app. The pen can recognize degrees of sensitivity, so a light stroke shows up as a faint pencil line while a dark stroke shows as a dark line. The app utilizes layers (just like in adobe photoshop) and there are a bunch of brushes to choose from. When using the pen you can set it up so that the screen doesn't sense your palm. You can read my sketchbook mobile review for more info on that app.For those who choose to buy this tablet be sure to go to Samsung's website to register the device. If you do they give you $50 credit for Samsung Hub app store, $25 Google Play credit, 3 free audible books (Audible is Amazon's audiobook company), a 3 month Hulu-plus trial, 3 free months of sirius internet radio, 50Gb of cloud space from dropbox, and a free year of Boingo wifi access.

The first charge only lasted 6hrs of heavy use and set-up before going yellow. After the 2nd and 3rd charges[and adjustments] I am easily getting 10-12 hours of screen time.

I bought Photoshop and a couple movies from the playstore, and several movies and a few font packages from samsung. I didn't know you could change the system fonts without rooting.There are also credits for hulu and others- I haven't messed with them yet.Very thin, very light. The difference between the 2014 and 2013 is more noticeable than I would have thought.Speakers seem to be as good or better than the ones on my 2013 version. I was surprised since they are on the sides and not facing you.Split screen works well and floating apps don't seem to slow it down.Cons:Offscreen buttons. It will take some adjustment for me. I generally hold the tablet in portrait mode to browse the web, read, check email. I usually use my right hand to hold the tablet- so it hasn't been a huge deal. But- when you are filling out forms online entering text and scrolling-be very aware of where you hold the tablet or you can easily hit the back button!The 2013 version- you could download the flashplayer directly from adobe's archives and it worked in the stock browser[not chrome]. This does not work on the 2014 version. You have to use a different browser if you want flash.

Hit the home button twice by accident, or scroll up from the home screen and it opens. Is it the end of the world?No. Just aggravating.Camera is ok. Not fantastic, but if it's all you got it will do in a pinch.Speakers- I miss them on the front. If you are sitting up, with the tablet resting on your ample belly in portrait- 1 speaker is clear the other is muffled. But the speakers are good- for a tablet.A little pricey.

This tablet I bought for a particular purpose , to work with a large volume of PDF files on the go, with the ability to mark the files with handwritten notes in different colors.

I am also bilingual and needed to make my notes in two languages and two alphabets, English and Russian. So far, the tablet has met all of my expectations. I find the stylus very convenient, recognition of my far-from-perfect handwriting in both English and Russian is very good, the added convenience is to use the split screen, so that I can simultaneously work in two windows.I must say that I do not care how my device performs for gaming or watching movies, I do not have time for that. Yet, Skype works well on the device. The front and back cameras are ok, and the software Paper Artist for the Note allows to make nice homemade \"works of art\" out of everyday photos.Overall, the product is functional, perfectly suits my needs and appears to be nice to look at and easy to use.

Let me start off with a brief review of the tablet's physical attributes.The first thing you'll want to know about is the display.  It is very, very good.  It is very high resolution by today's standards at 2560x1600 boasting 299 pixels-per-inch (think about how laser printers were once the same at 300 dots-per-inch).  It is also very bright with great color reproduction and good contrast.  The screen uses IPS technology and it has excellent viewing angles - so you don't have to worry about being perfectly aligned with the screen in order to see it clearly and the contrast stays good even at steep angles.  The screen has an aspect ratio of 16:10, so the Note is ideal for internet browsing, gaming or viewing HD video.  The Note also has very good stereo speakers located along the upper right and left edge (when the tablet held in its native landscape mode) - they produce loud and clear audio and the speaker placement doesn't interfere with your hand placement.  Of course there isn't any bass to speak of, but one cannot expect any bass from speakers of this size.  Still, the audio sounds good when playing games or watching internet videos.  As I previously mentioned, the Note is meant to be held in landscape mode, with the hardware home button closest to you.  Of course, the screen content can rotate to portrait, depending on the program.  Most of what I use it for works in landscape, which is good because I prefer it that way.  Unfortunately, the USB 2.0/power port is located in the center of the bottom edge right under the hardware home button.  This can present an issue if you want to charge the battery when using the tablet at an angle on a stand in landscape mode as a USB plug can interfere with the bottom edge.  I think it would have made much more sense to have the USB 2.0/power port located on either the top or right edge of the tablet.  Located just to the left of the USB/power port on the bottom edge is a microphone.  There is a Micro SDXC slot under a cover along the right edge which can currently accept up to a 64GB Micro SDXC card.  This is useful for storing large amounts of media such as music, photos and video files, which can be quite large.  I highly recommend the Samsung 64GB Pro microSDXC card as it currently the fastest and most reliable 64GB Micro SDXC card available.  Moving on, there is an 8MP rear facing camera with LED flash and a 2MP front facing camera.  I haven't used the cameras very much at all, so I can't really comment on them.  There is an infrared port along the top edge which facilitates the use of the tablet as a smart universal remote control with an integrated program guide (for which the software is included).  I know it works because I tried it with my TiVo HD, but I didn't find it very useful for me so I haven't used it since.  Depending on your home A/V setup, it may be very useful for you.  The power and volume control buttons are located along the top edge on the far left.  I feel that those buttons are too difficult to navigate as they are small with very little feel or button travel.  As a result, I installed a software volume control which resides in the Android notification shade that I like a lot better.  The earphone jack is located on the top left edge.  On the top right edge is the slot for storing the S-Pen (along with the actual S-Pen).  The S-Pen, which is one of the main features of this tablet, allows you to draw and write directly on the screen.  I have used it at times for text input and the tablet will recognize your handwriting (either in block or script!) and translate it into editable text, which is really cool.  The tablet feels really good in the hand.  For me, it's not heavy at all and I can easily hold it with one hand.  The back of the tablet has a grippy, faux leather like finish, which I like, but my tablet lives in an excellent Poetic Slimline case, so I don't get to feel that very often.Although the 2014 Note 10.1 can be used for a wide range of things, what I got this tablet for is gaming!  And boy does this tablet deliver.  With it's 3GB of RAM, the latest generation Samsung Exynos 5420 octa-core processor (which is really a dual quad-core) and a Mali-T628 graphics processor, I get excellent gaming performance!  I regularly play Asphalt 8, which looks amazing on this tablet with it's real time reflections, motion blur, advanced lighting and particle effects.  It looks and plays great!  Since I'm a sucker for good racing games, and racing games are a natural fit on tablets since you can usually steer by rotating/tilting the tablet, I also play GT Racing 2, which again, looks amazing playing in the full 2560x1600 resolution of the tablet.  I also play Armored Aces, which is a great, WWII 3D multiplayer tank game, Heroes of Destiny, which is a great 3D dungeon battle game, and Dead Trigger 2, which is an super fun 3D first-person-shooter which pits you against hordes and hordes of very unreasonable zombies in locations around the world.  These are among the latest and greatest 3D games available and they look and play incredibly well on the 2014 Galaxy Note 10.1.  Not surprisingly, 2D games like Clash of Clans also look amazing and play extremely well on the Note.  It also plays video very well both from the internet and local files you store on the SD card.  This device is a great companion for a trip or flight.  Battery life is stellar for me.  I get over six hours of screen time when 3D gaming the whole time (yes, I really need to get a life).  If I were to use it like a normal person, I could easily see getting over eight hours of screen time on a charge.  One minor issue is that I don't feel that the charger is strong enough as it really doesn't charge the battery very much at all when charging while the tablet is in use.  It will charge a few percent, but it doesn't really charge well at all as long as the screen is on.There is one fairly important issue though which I would like to touch on and that is the some buggy behavior with the touchscreen itself.  At the moment, there is an issue where if you touch and hold any area of the screen for 24 seconds, your touch will be reset and it will not work well again for about five seconds.  Why is this a problem, you ask?  Well, say you're playing a racing game that requires you to push an on-screen gas pedal.  After 24 seconds, you won't be pressing it anymore, even if you are in fact, still pressing it.  If you try to immediately press it again, it will immediately disengage again for about five seconds until it acts normal again for the next 24 seconds, and so on.  That is but one example of the issue, but it could happen with controls for direction in a first-person-shooter or some other type of game.  But really no matter what you're doing, or what software you're running, whether it is a game, productivity software, music, or whatever, if you touch the screen in one area for 24 seconds straight, it will reset your touch and not work well again for about five seconds.  It's a problem.  Through the XDA Developers forum, I verified that this problem likely exists on all of the 2014 Note 10.1 devices (model SM-P600) with firmware MK1.  I believe it is a driver issue.  From what I understand, so far Samsung has not acknowledged the problem.  Hopefully, they will discover and fix this with the next firmware release as it can be a really a major issue depending on what you're doing.  Luckily most of the racing games I play have the option for automatic throttle, but I wish I could use a manual throttle control.  It does affect my Armored Aces gameplay as I have to remember to quickly get off and then back on the throttle prior to 24 seconds in order to avoid a bad situation.  *(4/27/2014: The 24-second-timeout issue with the touchscreen was fixed with new ND2 firmware!)*Overall, it's a great, versatile tablet.  I love it.  In fact, I own two of them and I gave a third to my girlfriend who also loves it.  If it wasn't for the issues with the weak charger and especially the touchscreen, I would give it five stars.***04/27/2014 UPDATE:***Lets say four and a half stars!  In the past week, Samsung released its Android KitKit 4.4.2 firmware update for the US version of the 2014 Note 10.1 (firmware ND2).  I applied it a few days ago and I can tell you along with the update from Jellybean to KitKat, it also fixes the 24-second-timeout issue with the touchscreen.  The KitKat update has made the overall tablet experience faster and smoother.  Samsung made some nice changes to Touchwiz including a better notification shade and a better task manager to name a few.  Unfortunately, the KitKat update also introduces the Google-mandated restriction on which apps can write to the external SD card.  Even though I'm not a fan of this restriction, it doesn't really affect me (yet) and I don't think it will affect most users.  The restriction can be eliminated if you root the tablet.  Overall, I'm very happy with the update so far, and I will report back if I find any issues!***05/17/2014 UPDATE:***One thing I've seen some people complain about is that the speaker grilles either are or get loose and then have a bit of play in them.  Mine were a bit loose from the start, but it wasn't an issue until today.  Today I noticed that the right speaker grille is very loose.  It's not falling out and it doesn't come out, but the top edge of the right grille is literally hanging out.  Just to make sure it couldn't fall out, I tried pulling it off using some masking tape, but it held in place.  The left grille has some play in it but its not nearly as loose as the right grille (yet?).  Since it doesn't snap back into place and the grille is so small and fine, I haven't figured out a way to fix this.  I'm not sure I want to use glue as glue could damage the finish and it may make it difficult to disassemble the tablet, if that is ever necessary.  I'll update if I fix this or if it gets worse.  While this is something to look out for, this is an excellent tablet, and this is not something that should keep you from considering one.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid Piece of Hardware", "Author": "leftcoastwolf", "ReviewID": "R31V1M1V98BI77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned many tablets over the years including the iPad 2, Nexus 7, Amazon Fire HDX 8.9, and now the Samsung Note 10.1 (2014).  For a general tablet that can become an excellent productivity tool, the Samsung can't be beat.  The processor is amazingly fast and the display is top notch.  I noticed overall screen uniformity with rich colors and minimal light bleed.  Upon opening, I installed the Nova Launcher and disabled most of the Samsung built-in apps.  The tabled runs quite smooth with no noticalbe lags or stutters.  I added 64 GB of memory bringing the total to 80 GB.  For me, that's plenty and $150.00 less that an iPad Air.  Samsung has provided support for putting programs on the SD card thus freeing up internal memory.  Because tablet screens are prone to accidental scratches, I installed a screen protector and also have a case for it.A great thing about an Android tablet is that you aren't stuck in a particular ecosystem.  iTunes is great but as in Android there are useless apps.  Sure, the iTunes store and Google Play have over 1,000,000 apps you can download but what good are those apps if they are for show and don't improve your overall experience (I'm thinking of the tipping beer mug in the iTunes store).  And the Amazon Fire?  Well, it's basically all about entertainment and reading.  If that's all you need, great.  In using both iTunes and Android, I feel the Google Play store offers more useful apps and is easier to navigate.A 10\" display is ideal for me.  Not too big and not too small (I'm thinking of the Nexus 7).  My phone has a 5\" display and frankly the move to a 7\" display is meaningless.  The Android system is easy to manipulate and customize to meet your needs.  With the 1.9 GHZ quad-core processor in the Samsung, and 3 GB RAM this tablet can hold it's own against any competitor including the iPad Air.  Sure, it's made of plastic and iPad is made of aluminum.  I really don't care how a tablet looks, it's more about function and user friendly experience.In reading reviews posted by others who've purchased and use(d) the Note 10.1 (2014) I notice that there are virtually no \"in the middle\" scores.  People seem to either really love it or really hate it.  Most of those who dislike this device seem to have received a defective device or one that was damaged in shipping or mis-handling.  Those who fondly recommend the iPad Air note the aluminum construction as the best feature.As always, Amazon takes pride in packaging products in boxes that provide ample protection.  My Samsung arrived without damage and worked when I plugged it in.Likes:Excellent Screen QualitySpeedy ProcessorExpandable RAMFlexibilityComfortable to hold and useAvailability of AccessoriesActually useful for work and pleasure (due in-part to Google Play)Solid buildDislikes:Useless owners manual included with the unit (mostly business size cards arranged in a booklet) but a complete PDF manual is available for download.Samsung \"extras\" programs and servicesI recommend the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) without reservation.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome (assuming they fix a bug)", "Author": "Kaz \"Paying It Forward\"", "ReviewID": "RY11OJE5RSAJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will leave the technical comments to others.

This year I decided to save my Christmas and birthday money to buy one. So I came to this.The tablet came 90% charged, which was really surprising to me. I never had any device come more than 50% charged. Upon using the device I noticed the screen turning on was slow. I believe Samsung made this as design, and I'm sure there is a way around it if you dig deeper into the system after you root it, but I rather not go that deep.Clicking the home button had a delay when exiting apps. This is because of the S-voice and the magazine feature. Disabling them made it a whole lot faster. But I ended up freezing those applications after I rooted the device, which made the tablet even faster in return.After rooting the device and freezing all the bloatware that it comes with the tablet became a lot smoother and faster. There was no more of that unsmooth pattern unlock which made you mess up, no more battery draining, no more random speed drops, etc... It just became the tablet it should be. I considered returning it before I rooted it because of the performance issue. But now it's not a problem. (Did you know Amazon bans for too many returns? I prefer to keep my returns low.)But of course when you root your device you will void your warranty, which is pretty stupid. They should allow rooting since their the ones that slow down the tablets by putting junk software on it that no one uses. Totally worth it though!One problem is if you have a Anker portable charger. The tablet will not charge on the 2A port, only the 1A port. Unsure why. My Android phone works fine on both ports. If you use the tablet on the 2A port then it will start randomly clicking on the screen somehow. Luckily it's not a phone as it tried to make an emergency call on an application!The screen itself is a fingerprint magnet. Prepare to clean it often. Very often. My Galaxy S4 get's less prints than this tablet. However, the screen is very nice and very sharp. For me anyway. My dad has problems seeing it without glasses.Sound is good, you won't have any problems hearing it. I keep it at max most the time and is pretty loud. You will want to turn it down during the night.This is the list of apps you can safely freeze if you root your tablet.AllShare Cast Dongle S/W UpdateAllShare ControlShare ServiceAllShare FileShare ServiceANT HAL Service [ANT is needed for usb devices like Endomondo etc. If you don't have it you can disable it]ANT Radio ServiceANT+ Pluginsb2b.hrs.android.libBackupBlurbCheckoutBusinessWeek+ChatOncom.sec.android.app.wfdbrokercom.sec.enterprise.knox.attestationcom.sec.knox.events.managerFlipBoardGoogle Play MagazinesGroup PlayHelpKLMS AgentKNOX (29.1.1 KB)KNOX (4.18 MB)Knox Notification ManagerKNOX StoreMy MagazineMy Magazine Here & NowPhoneS FinderS TranslatorS VoiceSamsung AccountSamsung AppsSamsung Apps WidgetSamsung Backup ProviderSamsung Calendar Sync AdapterSamsung Cloud Data RelaySamsung Cloud QuotaSamsung Contact Sync AdapterSamsung Content AgentSamsung HubSamsung LinkSamsung SNote3 SyncAdapterSamsung SyncadaptersSamsung VideoSamsung WatchONSamsungAppsUNA2SamsungHub UpdaterScreen SaverShare musicShare VideoStory AlbumStory Album WidgetTouchWiz Home [make sure you have another launcher installed!!!]TripAdvisorVideoEditorVideoPlayerYahooFinance", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Some Comments on the Galaxy Note 10 2014", "Author": "R.

Device was easy to carry around, however the only complaint I had was being able to efficiently, and safely handle the device. In this regards, handling a cell phone, or a tablet that is 7 inches is far less unwieldy.If not sitting down when using this item, handling it while standing up can be a little difficult, especially for people with small hands, such as children and small adults. Other than that, I could see no great disadvantage to purchasing this product. It's my own opinion of course, but I strongly believe there is currently no better tablet on the market at this size than the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 2014. I am well aware of the previous model's drawbacks and I can safely reassure anyone reading this that those shortcomings have all been addressed and resolved. Samsung was listening closely and hard to all its customer's feedback and complaints; and there were a lot because Samsung got it wrong; that being their first generation tablet and all.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect But Close", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RUUPBBX9GQ2M6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would actually give this 4.5 stars. I can't give it 5 because it is not perfect.  I spent 4 months doing research, reading, and watching tons of reviews. I had tried to find reviews that were not biased one way or the other towards Apple or Samsung.  The other tablet I was considering was an IPad Air. If you read a review from a magazine that gets big advertising dollars from either of these guys who are they going to choose? I am familiar with Apple as I own a MacBook Pro, an Ipod touch 5th generation, Apple Tv too, and used to use an IPhone.  I have several Android tablets and a Window 8 tablet too.Which tablet you buy really depends on what you want to use it for.  The IPad Air is a nice tablet.  It has a great display, it is fast, and thin.  Apple apps run very fluid.  Apple has an advantage here since they are the only company who makes their tablet they can more easily optimize the software to hardware. Also developers often design apps with ios in mind first but that is changing. I have noticed that a lot of my ios apps run smoother than the same ones on Android but that gap has really closed.  An IPad is easier to learn than Android.  If you are looking for something to watch videos, browse the Internet,  and check emails it is great. It comes preloaded with Iworks now so you can get a little work done too.Now for the note which is the one I ultimately bought.  I wanted something that I could take notes with and do simple photo edits with. There is more of a learning curve with using the note but it is worth it.  The pen is a great feature.  It is great for note taking, drawing, and comes in handy for photo edits too. I have the 32 gb version with a 64 gb micro sd card installed.  This is not an option with an IPad.  Samsung let's you store apps on the card too.  I loaded photos onto the tablet with a card reader,  did some minor edits, transferred the pics to the external sd card and then copied them to a usb flash drive. You can not do that with an iPad.  Wacom does make a Bluetooth pen for the iPad that works fairly well but not nearly as well as the one on the note. Plus it cost around $100.  A big complaint of the note is there is lag when going from one app to another. It has not been a big deal for me most of the lag is due to the Touchwiz interface that Samsung uses.  However you can make some adjustments like disabling animations or you use a different app launcher like Nova, Apex, or Action which are very straightforward and fast and most of your lag issues will go away. I didn't see that much lag on Touchwiz to be honest but Samsung is trying to do a lot of things with it and a lot of programs run in the background that take up ram. When I loaded another launcher the speed did improve.  I really love the things I am able to do with this thing. You have a lot more freedom using the note vs. an Ipad. Apple IOS is going to be more consistent because Apple is the only company that uses it.  Many companies use Android and they all add there own touches to it that is going make Android less consistent from device to device.It came down to features for the money.  I don't like the Apple gouge factor.  $100 for each increment of storage with no option to add any on your own. A 64 gb card is $37 on Amazon and when they fill up you can just get another one.  I pads will not recognize flash drives and will not let you transfer data to a flash drive or sd card. You can view photos with a card reader but that is all. $100 more for the Bluetooth Wacom pen when a better one is included on the note.  Apple charges a premium price for their tablet and doesn't even offer a camera with a flash.  Then there is the planned obsolescence. I experienced this with my Iphone after 2 years there were a lot of apps that would not run on it. On my MacBook I loaded programs on it and then upgraded to the next os and they no longer worked. I would get messages that power dvd programs were not longer supported. I had to look for updates or redownload programs through the app store. People using the first iPad can't use many of the current apps from the app store. My wife has an Asus transformer several years old that has no problems running most apps. It has been my experience that Apple designs products according to what they think is best for me. For example Apple thinks that I don't need flash so they pretty much ended support for it on many products. They decided I didn't need an optical drive anymore (my MacBook was the last one with a dvd drive included). Of course I can purchase additional storage in ICloud or buy an external drive. Samsung tries to listen to their customers and design products that give them every feature that they want. Maybe even too much so.  If there was a tablet made in the U.S. I would buy it.  At least Samsung does 90% of there work in South Korea rather than shipping 90% of their manufacturing to China and calling themselves an American company. I have a Dell Venue 11 Pro I didn't include it in this review because it is in a different price category and runs a full desktop operating system so I didn't want to compare it with the other two. The Dell can run full desktop apps including Itunes, runs flash,intergrates with office well, and offers many different storage options. The pen is far better on the note and both IOS and Android apps are better than Metro apps. Prices on windows tablets are coming down but they are still a little high.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "As good as it gets for Samsung tablets.", "Author": "Javis Caesear", "ReviewID": "RHC39NQY217SF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Waited to review this tablet, just wanted to having some real world time using it (2 months). As I said, spent about two months with this galaxy note 2014 and haven't been disappointed,  but I do have some nit picking for folks looking to purchase should be aware off. First off, my chief annoyance is with the internal gyroscope.  If you have a flip detachable keyboarded case that have magnetic backplate and strips, there no way to use the drop down menu android users are accustom using as the gyroscope is extremely sensitive to anything magnetic and will lock the drop down menu until the tablet is removed from the case. There's no way to turn this off or disable it, plus I read overtime it can permanently damage the gyroscope so please take this into consideration when purchasing a flip case for this tablet. Next is this Samsung My Magazine app that built into the menu button, when navigating the home screen using the menu button WHICH SHOULD bring up the menu screen only to be redirected the My Magazine app, which I mind you cannot be turned off or disabled. My last annoyance is with a great number of app that can't or won't allow for landscape mode or run on the tablet seeing as they were built for smartphones and the tablet option was an add on. Its the same OS platform built android,  how in the heck an app works for one and not the other mind you this is a developer issue. Google controls the platform,  they need to encourage developers to cross build for the android both smartphone and tablet equally.  Now that this is out of the way,  let's get back to the reason I bought the galaxy note 2014. My computer motherboard was faulty and was in need of repair and if your like me everything is done on your computer. So I toiled through online reviews to find a tablet to replace my computer if only temporary with maybe similar accessible features to get through day to day use and top specs hence the galaxy note 2014 tab. It uses Firefox, Pulse news feed, Skype, YouTube, and a host of other apps I use on my tiny 4.2 inch Samsung nexus and places onto a 10.1 inch screen eliminating the constant eye strain and occasional tapping on in app ad's that have no barring to me whatsoever.  I use all these apps on my PC as well, so this was a win-win-win for me. The interface runs smooth with no hitches or hiccups, all apps open within one second upon tapping on them, and the setup is what you'd expect from an Android device. All the 10.1 screen real state does make a difference when using smartphone apps vs tablet apps. This tablet has handled everything I through at it with relative easy and after a day of moderate use I still have just over a half battery charge left to work with. If you're waiting on the new galaxy note or tab pro 12.1 or 8.7, the galaxy note 2014 has the exact same hardware specs pound for pound,  the only difference is the new tab pro run android 4.4 allowing 4 on screen open apps at once, while the galaxy note 2014 runs android 4.3 allow 2 open apps on screen at once if that a big deal too you. Kitkat 4.4 for the 2014 will be out sometime in April after the Samsung galaxy 5 phone is released,  so unless you really need kitkat 4.4 immediately, I'd say get the 2014 as all these 2014 Samsung tablets are the same. If you don't believe me,  checkout the other written and video reviews on the new Samsung tab pro 12.1. With that said, you can also root the 2014 to run a custom 4.4 unofficial kitkat rom with all the kitkat goodness.

Having been in the computer business for over 30 years, I surf the Web quite a bit.  This has been my biggest frustration with my razor maxx smartphone...constantly sizing/resizing Web pages and then losing the sizing resulting in starting all over.  Installing apps can solve some of these issues...can't install apps for everything and the space for apps is very limited.  I decided that I could use something between the laptop and the phone which I decided was going to be a tablet.

fulfillment arrived in a box full of small paper flakes. They were all over the device, sticking to the protective screen sticker provided by the manufacturer for transport. Not only were they all over the device and sticking to the side stickers, but I found them under the screen's protective sticker as if no one cared there was dust/paper flakes all over it. Part of the Samsung label on the back of the device appears faded due to sliding around in the box during shipping.I chose a white 32 GB Note because I prefer it over black. Right away I noticed the top of my device by the camera has this red blemish. Upon closer inspection I noticed that whomever attached the front bezel of the Note didn't align the stuff under it correctly, so what I'm seeing is the leading lines for placement under the front bezel which is visible if you're looking at the Note from the side or flat on its back.After wiping off all the paper flakes that came with the device and blowing air gently into the power port, the audio port (which has a HUGE hole compared to the Samsung Galaxy S3's audio port), I powered up the device. As with most devices, I figured it'd have a little power to turn on, but this one did not. I plugged it in and went about setting it up. Not thirty minutes out of the box and all the applications start crashing on me. They start to error out, unable to find location, unstable internet (which was fine according to my phone) and that google.services were unable to function.I pulled my hair out for a bit, read some Android forums and figured out how to do a manufacturer's reset. Everything appears to be working now, but that was a headache upon receiving it. Had I been an average user with no experience in computers/devices, I'd have shipped it back up in frustration and returned it. The blemish bothers the heck out of me, but I'd rather not have to receive another box of paper debris and risk getting a scratched screen, just for a cosmetic issue. Going to try it out for a few days, see how it does, then decide if I should return it.Update: Feb 13, 2014: Sitting with Samsung Support trying to get my device to load the Samsung App and Samsung Hub application to no avail. I have the apps on my Galaxy S3 Phone which work, but they aren't loading on my Note. They error out with \"common error on product search\" and \"Service Unavailable (1009). Unable to find your location. Check your network settings and try again.\" Technician had me create a whole new Samsung account just to test the device, but it isn't loading either way.7:57 pm - Amazon is overnight shipping me a new Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) edition after Samsung Technical Support suggested I replace it since it was brand new and malfunctioning. Amazon's customer service is amazing because I thought I'd have to wait a few days for a replacement. I already shipped the defective device back today, so I'm glad to see I'll have a new one in the mail tomorrow without the red blemish and hopefully without any WiFi/GPS connection problems that were messing up the Samsung App/Hub processes. Will update with another review when I receive the new device.Updated: Feb 14, 2014: Straight out of the box I noticed my replacement has a scratch on the bottom left silver bezel. The speaker cover plates are loose and jiggle when you move the Note around. You can tap them gently and they'll wiggle loose. The previous Note 10.1 (2014) did not have loose speaker plates, therefore I can't believe this is \"working as intended\" or was designed like this.Turning the Note on, it went through several updates unlike the previous Note, but still could not connect to Samsung Apps or Samsung Hub. In addition, this Note is hot to the touch unlike the previous one I replaced. I'm about ready to ask for a refund and try my luck with in-store purchases instead. This is ridiculous, the headache has made me reduce this by another star.Bonus Extras FYI: Dropbox will not give you the full 50GB of storage space if you have a pre-existing account. Any GB you earned from Referrals won't matter after you link it with your Bonus offer for Galaxy Perks.Update: Feb 15, 2014: Returned my device to Amazon through the pre-paid label. I asked for a refund to be issued. In the meantime, I went with Samsung's suggestion to purchase the Note from an \"authorized\" vendor, as apparently Amazon.com is not considered by them an authorized dealer (who knew?), and headed to Best Buy. The Samsung employees there hired to work at Best Buy listened to my story, they let me test the device right there with them. No scratches, no blemishes, no paper flakes in the package. Screen's protection sticker was absolutely fine without any debris in it like the first two I purchased from Amazon. Straight out of the package, it had a full charge, no problems getting it signed up on the Samsung account, updated, all the apps worked in the store. Device itself did not get burning hot to the touch like the second replacement I was sent. All the parts on it were in good working order, no loose pieces or otherwise visible defects. S-Pen worked like a charm, quick to respond to the button tap near the screen, worked flawlessly.My only problem with it was once I got home the Samsung Hub had an \"unknown error\" again and crashed. I'm wondering if the Samsung Hub itself isn't working properly and the server is dropping or if there's an issue with my router and the Note because the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone works fine on WiFi with the Samsung Hub application.Why am I so determined I wanted a Note 10.1 (2014) instead of an iPad Air when they're relatively the same price?The expandable memory for the SD card is one. The fact I can plug my Note into the computer via micro USB and retrieve files. It can NFC with my phone among other Samsung things. It has the ability to flawlessly render my handwriting into text format, port it (handwriting and all) to PDF format then send it to Evernote. There's the fact I can not only use the tablet for hand writing my notes, but I can also use it to draw sketches. It's definitely a useful device for someone who spends most of their day sketching, writing, or researching. The S-Pen permits you to take snapshots of whatever you're looking at and save it to a scrapbook backed up on the Samsung account you link your device with. You can also take a screen capture and doodle on it with the S-Pen then send it off to someone or save it.Since the device itself is 10.1 inches of real estate with the capacity of adjusting your stylus width/type you can virtually do whatever you need with S-Note. From using a pen, pencil, brush, various colors, types of lines, etc. I really wanted this without having to buy a stylus, multiple applications, and so forth. Dual window screen is great for someone trying to copy and paste data from an e-mail to another program or even just comparing information.So far I liked the price, the features available, and customization versus the high price and lack of expansion with the iPad.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "IMPRESSIVE TABLET", "Author": "Lou", "ReviewID": "R2YG3IQTM265UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Samsung products and I currently own the Galaxy Note 3 and the original Note 10.1 tablet. When the 2014 edition of the Note came out, I was eager to explore the high resolution screen and the many features that make the Note such a great tablet. Being aware that the Note Pro 12.2 is about to be released, boasting of a larger screen size and a more windows-like display, I seriously thought of waiting to check out this larger tablet. However, trying to be practical, the Note 2014, for me, lighter-weight and slightly smaller in size (not screen size though), the portability of the tablet is really important to me. I bought the tablet a couple of days ago and am quite impressed and very happy with this product. I was able to sync the tablet, through my Samsung account (with MUCH help from my tech-savvy son) and to my surprise, was able to get all my saved S-Notes onto my new tablet. An app called File Manager, a free download from the play store, was needed and well utilized in making this transition possible. And on the Samsung website, an S-Note Reader program can be downloaded for free onto any PC, allowing you to read your S-Notes on your computer. Again, all credit goes to my son, whose patience for this is extraordinary. A lot of trial and error initially, along with some scary (I thought I lost ALL my S-Notes) and frustrating moments, it all worked out well in the end. I have barely begun to explore the many new and improved features of this tablet, and I was quite satisfied with the original Note 10.1 (which I happily passed along to my son). I rely heavily on the S-Note application to take many notes, create many folders, etc., both for business use (primarily) and for personal use as well. I LOVE the S-PEN, which now I cannot live without. While always attracted to the iPad with Retina Display, the lack of note-writing capability on the iPad and most other tablets, is a big disadvantage to me. The Surface Pro was also something I seriously considered, but with enough windows computers and being I am so very comfortable with the Note, I am sticking with this tablet. I also purchased the specially designed Samsung cover/case for this tablet, which I am also very happy with. It is really slick-looking and when you lift the cover open, it wakes up the tablet. All necessary ports are conveniently exposed. The screen resolution is beautiful, text is so easy to read and videos stand out beautifully. I was also able to install Adobe Flash Player from the Adobe website, which, for me, just ,makes life a lot easier. All the apps I had installed on my original Note 10.1 were automatically placed on the new tablet once I set it up. Wi-Fi connections work very well also, so I have no complaints so far. I will update this review if I come across any issues, but so far, so good. If you like Samsung products, I would highly recommend this tablet.

I finally decided I would try out the Note 10.1 2014.

I don't think I'll ever go back to anything but s-pens.  The Samsung apps that utilize the s pen are also good.  I wish there were a setting so whenever the pen is removed, only the pen will touch buttons and not the finger or hand.  They have that partially in some apps.- SD card. In the app options, it says you can move apps to the SD card, but I'm not sure how to verify that it works.  A warning: when I checked out, Amazon recommended a 64GB micro sd card.  The specifications say it only accepts 32GB.  I bought a Samsung 32GB, so I haven't tested whether 64GB works, but I wouldn't risk it.  I bought a Samsung micro SD card because it's faster than SanDisc.- Great speakers.  I'm a musician, and was worried about complaints others made, but I think they're great.  I mean, they're not exactly surround sound, but what do you expect from a tablet?  It's loud enough and clear enough for my purposes.- Good camera.  I'm no photographer, but I thought the camera was a good quality.- Thin and light.  I haven't had much experience with tablets, but I was happy with the size.- Great perks.  I don't know how long they'll offer the perks, but I got good stuff like DropBox space, Google Play credit, credit toward entertainment in the Samsung Hub, etc.- The IR blaster is cool (TV remote), but it's hard to find a good app that uses it.  I finally found one, but it was a long search.- Big screen with good quality.  If you like to watch movies in the dark, you might want to turn the brightness auto adjust off, because in the dark, the screen also goes dark.  For movies, that usually doesn't work too well.  When you turn the brightness to your liking, the quality is great.- I also like that you can have two apps side by side, or mini floating window apps.  Not all apps can do these - actually most can't, but many of the important ones can.Neutral/Maybe:- The pen is small to hold, but that is to be expected.- There are other tablets with 64GB + SD card.  I'm not close to running out of space yet, but I like to have it just to have it.- I'd like to see better power options.  There is a power saving mode you can turn on and off.  My phone has options to keep the screen on when it's plugged in.  I'd like that for the tablet.  I'd also like it to turn power saving mode off when it's plugged in, and perhaps turn power saving mode on when it's not plugged in.  When it's fully charged, it displays a message saying to unplug it from the charger.  From my reading, it's just an odd attempt at being green.- The speed is what I expected.  It hasn't really lagged too much.  You have to change a setting so the screen rotates faster.  Just remember that it is a tablet, not a computer.  In general remember that.  If you want to type, use a keyboard.  A tablet is for portability, but bigger and fancier than a smartphone.Cons:- I haven't been that happy with the Samsung software and apps.  They haven't been what the videos say they are.  I have a Samsung laptop, but I can't stream video to it like I though I could.  Unless you have the right Samsung TV or box, don't plan on streaming movies or pictures to your TV.- Along with the last complaint, there is no HDMI port.  There are adapters for other models, but not for this one.- When you press home when you're already home, it takes you to read the news.  You can't change this option.  I'm sorry to say, I'm not that interested in the news.  I keep pressing it by mistake, and having to go back.  I wish you could choose which app that shortcut would open.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note vs. iPad Air vs. Kindle HDX 8.9 - Galaxy comes closest to PC replacement.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R21PT0IMY13GY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used all three devices - Galaxy Note vs. iPad Air vs. Kindle HDX 8.9 - for several months and each device has it own pros and cons based on how you use the device and what you'd like to do with it. The Samsung Note gives a pretty decent experience overall and excels on many features, and from then on it's a matter of preference.I still prefer my iPad for magazine/text book/newspaper reading due to it's shape that makes it easy. I also find it the best for surfing the internet although Galaxy Note is not far behind. Kindle's silk browser is slooow, and I would never use it. Chrome works fine on all and you can change the settings to use Chrome. iPad is also my tablet of choice for sketching apps. The Galaxy Tab comes with a pen but I don't find it as responsive as iPad for my sketching, although it might just be because I am more used to the iPad with a stylus. I can't even think about the same on Kindle as the interface seems slow and unresponsive, it's improved quite a bit with Kindle HDX but there is still ways to go.For watching movies I prefer Kindle HDX 8.9 as it's the lightest of the three and has the best resolution and streaming is pretty seamless. The sound is perhaps the best of all devices but if you're using headphones it doesn't matter. Galaxy Note and iPad make the Chromecast streaming pretty seamless unlike the Kindle HDX, so if you're using your tablet to watch a movie on another screen keep that in mind.When you're holding the tablet the weight really makes a difference and for this reason I like to read books on my Kindle HDX 8.9. Although, nothing beats the Kindle Paperwhite for reading novels.Another thing about Galaxy Tab is that it's convenient to have a pen right on the tablet. The pen offers many point and click functions, but I just wish they were a little more user friendly and unobstrusive, so far I prefer to use my finger unless I am using a specific app that requires the pen. I was excited about the feature that turns handwriting to typed text but in reality it has a learning curve and is still not very intuitive. Right now I don't see an advantage over iPad if you're using a good stylus.If you're considering how to decide between iPad and Galaxy, the first thing you have to consider is the eco-system. If you've been using an Android phone the transition to Galaxy Note is seamless. But if you're an iPhone owner you may find the Android interface not as user friendly as it's not as simple and intuitive but offers more flexibility. If you have many apps that you love and use on iOS for example the Garage Band or iMovie then you may want to buy the iPad - these apps are now free with iPad Air.The other thing to consider is storage and importing files. The Galaxy Note allows you to put in a mini SD card to expand storage. That makes also it very convenient to access files on the Galaxy. However, with Dropbox and direct streaming from many sites the need for expanded storage is diminished. There are also now many products out there that function that don't need WiFi to create a network expand storage on the iPad.The Kindle HDX has a closed eco-system that does not allow any outside apps like Nook, iBooks in books or music from iTunes. I am especially frustrated by not being able to read my magazines in one place as there are separate apps required for each magazine. iPad's newstand integrates all magazine apps for one seamless experience. Kindle HDX is most useful if you have more content from Amazon. But it's cheaper and has a pretty decent email interface and a free Office app so it can be used as a multi-purpose device. It also has a send to Kindle feature that allows you to \"print\" any doc to your Kindle. I love that feature.Overall, the Galaxy Note is a very useful device with the most features of all three and is the most flexible. However, I use it the least. My main tablet usage is surfing the internet, reading magazines/newspapers, watching movies/TV, editing photos and the iPad is still my go-to device due to it's shape, speed, and app eco-system. Kindle HDX is next for it's video-viewing and all the content I have from Amazon. Samsung Galaxy Note though versatile is not my go-to device for any one thing - so it loses out. However, it comes the closest to a PC replacement if I did more office work on my tablet so I still like having it around especially when I travel.The Galaxy Note came with a ton of freebies like Google Play and Samsung Store credit, expanded Dropbox for 2 years, Boingo membership for one year, Businessweek subscription for a year, Hulu Plus membership for 3 months which was very nice. No other device offered all these freebies so if they're still being offered when you buy the tablet, factor that into the cost.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "another winner", "Author": "Mary F. Hazlett \"mhazlett\"", "ReviewID": "RNWTISJADT3FG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every Samsung Note tablet/phone except the first Note phone.  So you can say i love the Note serries.  I have also owned nearly every Samsung tablet, many  Kindles, Nooks, and have the Ipad 2 and had the ipad mini (first mini).  So, i'm well rounded.  To think i went into technology kicking and screaming in the early 2000's!This tablet is awesome.  I've definitely note explored all of the features yet on it because at the present time i also own the Note 8 and my phone is the Note 3.  I've also for the first time learned how to sync my SNotes with Evernote; that may sound basic, but i didn't know how to do it and now someone at Best Buy spent time with me helping me learn.I own the Note series because I like Android -- for those who say that there are many more choices in the apple app stores i say how many apps does one really need?  Everything i look for is available in the Play store.The multi window function is great, although i don't make use of it as  often as those who work might.  I retired a few years ago. I buy the series because of the S pen.  I keep a journal, and enjoy handwriting it.  I love keeping one on papeer, but when i am traveling without my large backpack/messenger bag, i can handwrite on this.  I also use the SNote function to keep a grocery list on my phone.  I save all kinds of things in Scrapbook, such as tips from a great source called Dripler (in the Google Play store).  I also like the fact that when i do my banking, i can, using the Spen, bring up a calculator on the check page to do my checkbook balancing.This baby comes with a lot of perks.  Off the bat i received a credit for $25 in the Play store, $50 in the Samsung Hub store, free magazines from Zinio (i don't get the crredit because i already have the app -- by the way, many public libraries have Zinio -- magazines -- available for checkout and unlike books, when a magazine is checked out, you keep the magazine), a 3-month Audible trial for audio books in Amazon (again, because i already have an account, i am not eligible), and 50G of free dropbox storage.  And, a free 3month trial of the NYTimes. Samsung says these freebies are worth $600.I'm not wild about the price, but if i held off for a while, the price would come down.  I thought and thought about whether to get this new 10.1 2014 Note since i currently have and use the Note 8, as well as my phone.  I also use my ipad, but because it is in a leather keyboard folio, it is heavy to cart around if i just want to lighten my load.  Yes, i can remove it from the folio.  But an advantage of android is the Swype feature -- being able to slide my fingers from letter to letter on the keyboard.  It is easier than the hunt and peck typing method on the on-screen keyboard of the ipad.  I do have several portable keyboards, but the one i'm currently using when i want a keyboard is an excellent one by Brookstone.  I have the one with the little shelf which can hold a device on it.  But because the keyboard can be removed, i can simply slide this slim full-size keyboard in my bag if i want to.  The whole thing is lighter than my keyboard folio for the ipad.  Many small bluetooth keyboards are weird -- when i type on them foreign symbols pop up and i have to select what i want, slowing down the typing.  I'm a good typist, and the brrokstone is simply a regular but lighthweighth keyboard.I highly recommend this tablet. It is fun, good for professionals, comes with great features and lots of 3-month expensive freebies, and it has -- oh yeah -- an expandable memory, unlike the fruit tablets. That is also a big selling point.  I have all of my music on a micro card and can simply put the card into the Note series.You can't go wrong.

If 1/2 stars were possible, then I'd give it 4.5 because of the high price tag. I work in academia and run my own research lab. I have to attend various meetings and many other functions that require a lot of thoughts to be thrown around, saved, and eventually have to follow-up on them. I've owned a Galaxy Tab 10.1 (first generation), Google Nexus 10, and Apple iPad 3, trying to be patient with the Note series until it matured and wasn't yet sold on the idea of the S-Pen let alone a generic stylus. Well, it has matured and has the muscle behind it. The S-Pen feature is what separates this tablet apart from the aforementioned tablets, as they all were simply media consumption devices and had no further usefulness beyond checking email and watching videos. I'm not a game player, so I really don't care for this aspect. The built-in Samsung apps are very basic and don't offer a great experience. Thus, I felt compelled to look beyond the Sammie ecosystem. Thus, I downloaded a free Android app called, \"Papyrus,\" paid for a few premium features costing around $3 each, and I have never looked back. Note-taking with this app complements the capabilities of the S-Pen very well. The pen is sensitive and responsive enough to feel like natural hand writing -- granted, it is not absolutely perfect, but for what it's worth, it is great. The Papyrus app does what it's supposed to without being too gimmicky and cute like other writing apps.Pros:1. Quickly, easily, and accurately write down important notes and save or convey/share those thoughts to others.2. Mirror my tablet on an HD television screen in a meeting room and write everything so people can collaborate / review in real time.3. Export or share notes in various formats (PDF, PNG, JPG) via email, SMS, and the usual set of sharing mediums.4. With #3 above, I find it very useful to MMS my notes, as it reduces the need for typing a full-blown message. Anyone with a tablet knows that typing stinks, no matter what brand you have. Steve Jobs was completely wrong about the utility of the stylus!5. S-Pen is very accurate and responsive. You can also lay your palm on the screen while writing and there's no \"background\" pickup. It can be accessed easily and stored discretely.6. Tablet has the hardware specs capable of handling what I need to do -- use productivity apps, watch videos/movies on the plane, and a whole lot more!7. Did I mention that the screen resolution is awesome? Well, it's awesome!Cons:PriceBuilt-in Samsung S-Pen apps still weak -- find yourself some other Android appsIf you are serious about being productive at work while also being able to enjoy \"intense\" multimedia, then this device will not let you down.

As a Graphic Design student I cannot express how useful this tablet is. The pen uses a Wacom digitizer. Instead of hauling my Wacom tablet to class every day, I just take the tablet to create digital works, which I can then port to Photoshop, Illustrator, or whatever. The stylus is far superior to those which work with an iPad, and you save money by having a stylus that is built in to this tablet. If you are an artist or an art student looking for a tablet that will increase your productivity I highly suggest the Note over the iPad. I know that Apple computers are the industry standard in the Art world, but this tablet should be the exception to that \"rule\". Art kids, abandon your Apple tablets and get yourself a Note.Speaking of Note! The note taking capabilities of this tablet are amazing. For once, I'm an organized note taker. I have abandoned the lined paper notebook and I use this tablet solely for note taking in my Art History classes. I love how I can drag pictures into my notes, which is absolutely a bonus, and an important feature in helping me learn Art History. Instead of having to download a huge PDF with slides from a lecture on art, and flip through my paper notebook to find the corresponding artworks, I just drag the artworks over into my notes and everything is right there. It's awesome!This tablet is very fast, very snappy, and responsive. I have no issues at all with it's speed. Even when running many apps at once, and while using a custom launcher app, it's still fast.I love this thing. I am incredibly happy with my purchase.

I should do commercials for Samsung. :)", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Top of the Line Tablet, Mediocre Samsung Support", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Sean Holder Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R26C1MQT86V4F1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So here's my take on this tablet:1. The additional items that Samsung is playing up in their advertisement as being $600 of free stuff, is complete garbage. The $50 credit they give you for the Samsung hub is a joke, the bookstore has nothing worth purchasing except garbage books, the App Store that Samsung has is complete joke also. The only added value is the 25 dollar credit with Google Play. Everything else you're going to get a free trial and then they want you to get a subscription with a monthly fee. So it's a complete marketing scam by Samsung to get you to buy this tablet.2. Okay now is the tablet worth $550 for the 32mb version? I would say yes.3. The other reason I do not rate this a five star is because its not running the latest version of Android. You would think, at least I would think, that if this is your flag ship model that research and development would have worked endless hours to give you the latest updated edition since its release last year. But no it's still running Androd Jelly Bean 4.3 which is not a bad thing but when you're spending this kind of money you would expect a and company like Samsung to be at the top of their game.4. Why did I pick Samsung over the iPad? The biggest reason I got this tablet was because of the stylus s-pen verses touch only types of tablet. If Apple had a tablet with a stylus with Wacom technology similar to this one I more than likely I would have gone with the iPad, reason being is their updates seem to come out faster from their R&D; division. For some reason Android products seem to be hit or miss on whether you're going to get an update or not or if you do get the update it takes forever, this tablet was released October 2013 and it still does not have the KitKat update for Android how ridiculous is that.5. So how does the tablet work? After I purchased the tablet I went to the Samsung store and I purchased the Bluetooth keyboard and the USB adapter. I have to say this almost works as good as a laptop with the keyboard and the USB adapter. I am able to plug in my portable 2tb external hard drive by Western Digital, this is a huge plus being a photographer that this little tablet can actually power my external hard drive for when I want to show images to clients. Again the keyboard is an awesome addition if you wanna sit and type something verses using the S-pen or finger typing.Final note, I'm going to give this tablet a chance and hope the updates come out soon and the biggest test is going to see if later this year probably several several months from now when Android 4.5 is released if this tablet gets updated to that version. The last thing I want to do is be spending this type of money every year and a half to two years when a new update for Android comes out and the company doesn't support the upgrades. I have that issue with Toshiba Thrive 10 inch tablet this was a very promising tablet but once they got to Android Ice Cream Sandwich version they stopped. There were no more updates, no more support which was truly disappointing since I really enjoyed the Toshiba company. But when companies do not take care of their clients, the ones that support them they will lose them. Case in point as for me I will never purchase a Toshiba item again, I am currently very very happy with this Samsung tablet.Does this tablet have value that an Apple iPad air does not have? Yes it certainly does the multi task window is a huge feature that Apple would probably need to learn to implement into their tablet. The s-pen is huge the Wacom technology is spot on I've been using a Wacom tablet to edit my photos on my computer for several several years and to have this feature on a tablet is awesome.So again to recap the added value that Samsung is pushing on their advertisement that you get this supposedly $600 in extra stuff is a complete scam in my eyes. To me the value is only really $25 for the Google Play Store other than that everything else is a waste.Will I keep this tablet? Definitely it's a great tablet let's see how soon Samsung can get there research and development team together and get it updated, and keep it updated with the latest versions of the Android software and not take 6 or more months from release date and have you still waiting for the update and at the same time call this their top of the line model when its not even running the most current Android software.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beats iPad", "Author": "C. Steinbrecher \"CWS\"", "ReviewID": "RW9EDYRWOZCAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1\" 2014 edition one week ago.  Intent was to transition my iPad to my wife who is comfortable with her iPhone and me to adopt the Galaxy Note as I really like my Galaxy S3 phone and am looking for maximum compatibility.  I have been exceptionally pleased.  More and more I belive that the Apple products, while they do have some very nice features, just seem to lock you out of too many things.  For example, try transporting your Apple address book somewhere else, good luck with that.  The google address book gives you so much more flexibility and power.The screen on the Galaxy Note is incredible.  The form factor being a little wider is also generally very nice.  Some Aps although do not scale quite as well to this - for example my application to read the San Diego Union Tribune seems to be sized more for the iPad - not a huge deal though.The internet browser on the Galaxy Note seems superior to me.  It just works better and seems to support more websites and particularly video formats that you can not view on the iPad.Love how you can install your own micro SD memory card in the Samsung products.  You can buy a good quality 64Gb microSD for a fraction of what Apple charges you to get 64Gb of memory.EMail Ap provided with the Galaxy Note is very nice and easy to use.GPS Receiver Built In - very nice built-in GPS receiver.  My iPad2 does not have this.  Don't know if the more recent iPads do or not.  Works very well and of course integrates great with hte GoogleMaps and since this is an Android device no problems there.  You do need wireless access for your maps to update as you move around the country but I did find a free Ap that allows you to download maps for free (Navigator) that appears a good option.Dropbox - Samsung gives you 2 years subscription with 50Gb storage to Dropbox.  I am very impressed with the ease of use of Dropbox on the Samsung Galaxy Note as well as my home laptop.  I can even look up files from my work computer network by just logging into my dropbox account.  This is very convenient.In general, I am thrilled with my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014.  It is generally very intuitive and I find it to be more powerful in many ways than the iPad.  Did I mention the ability to open a second application to the side or in a subwindow - very convenient at times.  There are a few drawbacks compared to the Apple iPad which I will list below.  - Ap Support - the application availablity for the Galaxy Note is excellent but not as good as for Apple.  If you have a popula Ap on your Apple device I would estimate an 80% probability the Ap will be available on the Androis as well.  But there have been some supriises.  I have been running an Ap on my iPad and Galaxy S3 Phone to track my NCAA mens basketball bracket and mysteriously it does not seem to be available for the Galaxy Note.  Similarly, my Glo Bible ap is not yet available but they say they are working on it.  Also, can't find an Ap for Amazon Prime  video although there is one to play Amazon prime video on the iPad.  Hopefully Amazon will get one available soon for the Android.  - Music Transferability - this is both a negative and a positive.  If you have all your music in Apple iTunes it will take a little work to transfer into the Android system.  That said, Apple iTunes I find to be too restrictive and I'm trying to move away from them.  There are aps and utilities out there that can do this for you.  - Picture Transferability - Apple does a very nice job with it's iPhoto program and then transfers all of your albums seamlessly to your iPad and/or iPhone.  That said, it appears that Google's Picasa can now import your iPhoto albums.  I will be trying to make that transition but I do have to complement Apple on the ease of use of their iPhoto program between their devices.After one week I am thrilled with the Samsung Galaxy Note and highly recommend it.

I have the original Galaxy Tab 10.1 GT-P7510 that I got two years ago and liked it but it was buggy and slooow and would have to re-boot a lot. I decided I wanted to upgrade and get something I could multi-task with and have good battery life.I read and watched reviews and settled on the Note 2014 32G. I got it the 1st week of January and have used it every day I've had it. I have read some people had lag problems or battery drain problems but I have not any problems with anything. I did install Nova Launcher Prime (I had it on my Tab) and use Chrome browser. My Note is fast and smooth. Very snappy when I swipe and change apps. I'm not a game player so I can't address that but I have watched movies on it and the screen is awesome and movie play is flawless.Typical for me is: I can read a magazine, a few chapters of a book, watch a few YouTubes, play around with the S-Pen while listening to some music, surf the web, surf Amazon and place an order, check email and Facebook and do a couple of lessons of an on-line course and general messing around and still have 1/3 of the battery left at the end of the day. I can easily go a couple of days with a battery charge. I was lucky to get a day on my Tab 10.1 with less use.

I am out and about all day every day for work and school and always have my tablet with me for quick notes, or if I have some extra time, for watching movies. The display was the main reason I got this tablet.I compared and contrasted this display with my iPad 3rd generation which has the retina display, as well as compared it to the old note 10.1. One of the problems that I had with the Note 10.1 2012 was that it always had an awful glare especially when I was outside or in a room with a lot of windows or with lot of light. It killed me because the old note was very powerful but the screen always had a very annoying glare. The screen on the old note 10.1 was also not as sensitive to the touch as my iPad 3 did. The speakers on the old note were not as good as the iPad 3 either. But with the new note 10.1 2014, Samsung really nailed everything right on the head. The screen on the new note 10.1 2014 outperforms the note 10.1 2012 by a long shot. The screen is brighter and way more vivid. It is also a lot more sensitive to the touch. Those annoying glares that I always got with the note 10.1 2012 were gone. I also noticed that the speakers were significantly louder than the ipad 3 and the note 10.1 2012, but the ipad had a lot more bass it it's speakers.One problem that I had with the iPad, as a student, was that it was somewhat difficult to take notes while in class. There really aren't any very good word processors made for the iPad. The note 2014 comes with Polaris Office which is really similar to Microsoft Word. It is a fully functioning word processor. What I like most is that through Polaris Office, you can set it up to save all of your documents straight to google drive so that your documents can be synced to all of your devices. For example: I start an essay in class and save it; when I get home, I can continue working on it on my computer; then when I am on the bus I can read it on my Note 3 cell phone. You can make word, excel, and even powerpoint presentations right there on your tablet. I purchased a keyboard case for it and paired with my Razer Orochi bluetooth mouse, it is nearly a computer!While using a bluetooth mouse and a bluetooth keyboard with the wifi and bluetooth on all the time, this tablet lasts me all day and even into the next day for a little if I forget to charge it. And because it is so small and light, it is very easy to carry around all day rather than having to carry a bulky laptop.Another useful feature is the app Watch-on. Because the note 10.1 2014 has an IR sensor in it, you can pretty much control anything that uses an IR remote. I have it set up with my 42\" TV, my bluray player, my cable box, and my receiver. I did find the app somewhat difficult to use sometimes because you can pretty much only use it when your line of sight is directly above the tablet and since you have to line up to IR sensor to your TV when you want to change the channel, sometimes you don't always hit the right buttons.Another thing I use it for a lot is for music. I am involved in the Millennial Choral Organizations in Mesa, AZ which requires that I memorize a lot of music in a relatively short period of time. I just take a picture of the music using one of the Cam Scan apps and save it as a PDF until the end of the semester when I delete it all. Part of having all of this music is having to write notes on how the conductor wants it to sound. One thing I was a little disappointed in was that it does not have the capability of writing notes on the PDF and then saving them. But what I figured out is that you can select free write after you pull out the s-pen and then I can write my notes on it and it saves it as a screenshot. I wish that it had the capabilities to do write on the PDF, but unfortunately, you cant.Overall it is a great and powerful tablet.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great product that finally stablized in it's update releases.", "Author": "Jeffry J.

I have had a rooted kindle and have had helped others with an iPad, but I really wanted something that was Android and good enough to use many of the features of my phone on a pad (I have a Samsung S4, near enough to the technology in this product to sway the purchase).Snote is working much better since the update. Most of the other technology is working really good. I have not removed the Knox interface as many have threatened (and some have done). The primary reason is update path. I am still waiting for a good bluetooth keyboard case for this and I want the update path so far.

The Spen actually has the detail/resolution to grab the timesheet program interface bar that is buggy on a mobile interface (it gets squashed).The camera has less resolution than my S4, but actually has slightly better light and color response. I have not used the front facing camera and am unlikely to in the near future.

It's nice and light, the battery goes on (figuratively) forever- I use it all day,  and charge it at night.  Can't do that with my phone.  It does LOVE to be hooked to the Internet, tho it functions fine when out of range.  A lot of the built in apps and email functionality will just cease, but books, movies, and music loaded onto the thing work fine. They just pick back up where they left or when you're back in range.  In closing, I'll leave you with this:  I've gotten a digital only subscription to my local news paper with this thing, I read it every day, and it lets me do the cross word puzzle (that took some thought,  but I figured out how! ).  I hadn't read the news in a decade before I got this thing.  I'm writing this review on it now.  One other thought- heavy media hoarders will want to get the 32 gigabyte model, or plan on spending for a SD card.

But the poor screen resolution and the lag issues reported made me reconsider. I decided to wait for the next generation. So, I was excited to see an upgrade appear late last year. It appeared to me that many of the issues I was concerned about had been addressed. So, when my birthday rolled around, I hit my wife up for the 2014 edition.It is EVERYTHING I had hoped and more.I wanted a device with a crisp and vibrant display. Check. I wanted a device that would let me take handwritten notes in my meetings and let me draw/design with decent drawing tools. Check. I wanted a device that was reasonably fast with no serious lag issues. Check. I wanted a device that would let me multitask. Check (with caveats). I wanted cool apps and utility and convenience. Check, check, check.This thing is AWESOME! I have loved it from the moment I opened, and that feeling only grows with time.When I powered it up and logged on with my google account, it automatically uploaded all most of my apps from my Galaxy S III phone. Everything was there, my contacts, my music, my cloud. It has changed how I do many of my daily activities (I have probably cut my PC and smartphone time by more than half), and, with some modest changes, I can easily see how a tablet could eliminate my need for a PC or phone at all (think tablet partnered with and voice controlled communication device the size of a dollar coin - similar to the communicators from ST Next Gen - the technology is nearly there).I'm still learning how to use all the apps and features (it takes me a while to get comfortable with new systems and apps), but I am very pleased with everything. Well, almost everything...Here are the few things I don't care for:1. I hate that the power connection is on the bottom edge of the device. This makes it awkward to use with a case in a vertical or semi-vertical position with the power connected. You basically have to flip it, which puts the power and volume controls on the bottom where they are more difficult to reach. I would have preferred a left/right side power access. I'm also concerned about the durability of that miniUSB port.2. Speaking of power, this device is a hog. A PC UPC connection will not provide enough power to keep you working continuously.  In fact, trying to recharge the Note from a PC with the display and all apps turned off is not really practical (for me, <10% an hour). If you are doing anything active (gaming, video, etc) long term (more than an hour or two), you will have to hook directly to an AC outlet. If you want to recharge in a reasonable amount of time (>%10/hr), you will need direct AC as well.3. Some Samsung app interfaces are not intuitive to me. The SNote app is a prime example. Creating, editing, and organising notes is cumbersome and different than what I'm used to with other systems. It's even different than the note app on my Samsung phone. To me, it is more difficult than it needs to be.My wife purchased this on sale at $470 (I got the 16GB version, as I don't do a lot of video and I knew I was going to add a 64GB miniSD for less than the $50 cost for the extra 16GB internal). But, I would have paid the $500 with no qualms.

The HD screen is the best there is on a tablet to date. I have the 32GB version and am using a 64GB sd-card as well. This will handle anything I will thow at it. The 3GB RAM is a far cry from the 1GB in most tablets. It navigates smoothly from page to page. Being able to have multi pages on screen is a plus. Now I can email with my daughter and surf the web at the same time. Setting this to print was an easy setup, which was a much appreciated surprise. As with most Samsung products there is software that one may never use, if only you could remove it to gain the extra space. Hint, Hint... ;) Polaris 5 is a great Word compatible program that is included that makes anyone needing such a program very happy. Overall, this is extremely fast, has a beautiful display, adequate storage space especially with the extended storage of a 64GB sd-card.  The only downfall with this and any Samsung product is trying to collect the Samsung Perks promised with the purchase. This item comes with a $25.00 Google Play gift card, 2 audiobooks, free Hulu Plus airtime, as well as many others program offers. Problem is getting Samsung to send the email with the Perk code needed to collect them upon registration. I have emailed, then called with no results. I Googled to see if I was the only one experiencing this issue, but no, low and behold many many others are as well. So if you are expecting to go shopping for your favorite apps or sitting down to a good book or tv show don't hold your breath.........UPDATE:4/2/2014  A note to let the people that so kindly responded to my review know where I stand on the above Samsung Perks issue.I have contacted Samsung's customer service a total of 4 times now, still no email containing the perks code.  After the third call I was contacted by the survey department. Following a brief explanation of why I was giving Samsung such low ratings, he told me never talk to a level 1 customer service person. He said the tier goes to a level 4, ask for at least a 3. He stated the 1st level people I spoke with previously probably never escalated the issue like they said they would. Needless to say the survey did not bode well for Samsung. :(  Today I called for the 4th time. Right off I asked for a level 3 rep. She acted as if she did not hear me so I waited for her to finish the sentence she interrupted me with and asked again. She assured me she could definitely help me so after going thru all the same questions of the first 3 calls, and being put on hold 4 times, she again wanted to escalate the ticket. It was then I demanded to speak with a level 3 rep. I told her I had gone thru this 3 times before and am not doing so again. I asked why this issue was so hard to resolve? No answer. Finally she said she would transfer me if a higher level \"was available\". I was transfered to another person who refused tell me what CS level he was. He asked me all the same questions again!! He even asked me if I knew how to check my email, lol!!... I asked \"him\" why the issue has not been addressed,.... I was asked to hold again. When he returned he answered, \"they did not have the model number so they could not continue resolving the issue\". I responded that they certainly did have that info, I had provided all the info the last 3 times I had called. I then asked why they did not contact me if they needed more info to resolve it. He was dumbfounded, studdered a few times, then silence.  When he could talk, he apologized that they had not contacted me. So, here I sit waiting, once again, with the strong asuridness that all my problems will be solved within 48 hours.

I love to draw with the s pen, it is more precise, some drawing apps ( Sketchbook for Galaxy note, pre installed) are designed with special versions to use with the S pen.

But overall, it's a no-deal for me.1) The Simpsons game \"Tapped Out\" ran so slow as to be unusable. The constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the Note. It's a serious defect, considering a two year old model like the ASUS TF300 could run the game 10 times faster, and THAT unit is sluggish. This might be a specific issue with this game, and could be a software fix from EA.

For example, the free year of GoGo Inflight Internet? That's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for. Instead, everytime you want to use it you must connect to GoGo from this tablet, click on a \"Chat Now\" button and request from a CSR a one-time code for that flight.

There is a major change in Android 4.4 that affects how MicroSD card access works. Apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want. Instead, each app will have its own little closed-off area to use, nothing else. This means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a MicroSD card. Photo viewers will be similarly limited. Backup programs will not be able to backup files from a MicroSD card (though they will be able to backup file TO the MicroSD card). Most significantly, you will NOT be able to move apps to the MiroSD to free-up space in the internal memory. This is all being done by Google, not Samsung, but it still impacts this model.

Software needs to be optimized to run faster and more smoothly. Yes, there's lag on this device. The intermittent lag doesn't render it unusable to any extent but it's annoying to say the least. Hopefully a software update eliminates this.4. Battery life could use some improvement (better than the old Note 10.1 though)5.

While this is my first tablet i'm not sure tablets get any better than this, right now. I am completely satisfied with its capabilities.  I wanted something smaller and lighter than a netbook. but it had to be able to produce for work. seems like the majority of tablets on the market are marketed toward the entertainment end - videos, games, net surfing. i needed something i can produce and modify products on. this is it. This machine can handle .docx/.pptx/.xlsx files with ease and even creates them.A couple comments - if bloatware drives you insane, you might want to research which products are out there that don't stack their offerings with bloatware. this thing came with lots of stuff i can't get rid of. with only 16gb of on board memory, 6gb is taken up by the operating system and some of this bloaware. only 10gb are left for internal storage. not all apps can be placed on the SD card. if i had the 32gb i'd still make that complaint. i resolved this with the next comment.This edition (2014) of the Note accepts 64gb SD cards. There is some question out there as to whether or not it does. Mine accepts with no issue a 64gb PNY SDXC micro. No reformatting, no special app, no nothing. not sure if they accept higher than 64gb. if they do, that's even better capability. i'm not a big fan of loading up on apps that get used once a month so keeping 10gb of space available inside with the remainder on the card is more than plenty for the average user. if this isnt enough you might want to rethink what you are storing. do you really listen to 25gb of music. probably not. there are also other wireless storage options out there now that might make for a nice pairing with a tablet if you really need more storage.If you are on the fence about \"useful\" tablets like i have been, this is the tablet to take you off the fence.

The device gets hotter than any tablet I have ever owned.  The battery life doesn't even match my old 1st generation iPad! Which I have had for at least 4 years.  After 2 movies you will be looking for a power cord.  Unacceptable for a \"Top of the line\" tablet.  I have had the tab 2 10.1, I still own the tab 7.7 , arguably the best tab Samsung has ever made and the Note 8.0 which as I have compared, has better clarity and richer brighter colors, with get this, more detail than my 10.1 2014 when watching movies!  The note 8 has comparable battery life too. In other areas the newer note beats out all of my tablets for performance and features.  It's the features that give me mixed feelings about this device.  They are no less than remarkable.  I was strongly considering an iPad air but after using this puppy,  the only reasons I had were longer battery life and some apps with a richer tablet experience with those specific apps. The so called better build quality is overrated since anyone owning a tablet will not use it without a case for long unless they plan on keeping at home never to grace the out doors.  Once in a case its about the use in my book.  However, the ability to multi task, use of the spen, and my long time investment of apps that are comparable to iPad, and the ability to customize my environment at will to how I work and play,  convinced me otherwise. Once you get use to the many dimensions of this tablet other devices become boring to use.

Every time I have used it for school work, it has wildly disappointed.  I've tried really hard to get use to it thinking it was just user error at first but it is clunky and slow if you misspell a word, do any weird capitalization, or do not have excellent penmanship.  I have received compliments for my handwriting and how neatly I write but I still have many issues with writing on it.  When using the equation function, I have to fight with it.  I have almost completely given up on it.  Turns Y's to 4's, X's to any random number, and if you try to write any symbol for multiplication for division you will not end up with a good result.  Additionally, I liked I could upload PowerPoint, Word, or excel onto the tablet and use a dumbed down program to edit these programs!  This did not work at all, it always uploaded it as a PDF.  The screen is a good size but I also found if I try to have two screens up at once, it is almost impossible to use both at the same time.  I find myself having to make one bigger than smaller, then open the other window and do the same,  It becomes a hassle.Not all is lost with the tablet though.  It is fast and has an amazingly clear display.  I upload my photos to it and love to use this as a traveling portfolio!  I have not had any issues with apps except once or twice in which case it was an issue with the app.  It in lightweight and I find it fits perfectly in my hands and lap.

When this unit is functioning the device is awesome. Crystal clear screen.  Fast graphics. Ease of use. Great features.  Its everything I wanted in a tablet.  UPDATE 3/28/2014. Lowered stars from 3 to 2 due to yet another failure (see below). I am still keeping 2 stars because as I say below - when these are working they are awesome.My issue is durability.  I own two of these 2014 Edition models and both have had the same issue. Unit 1 has had the screen die twice and had to go back for repair both times.  Samsung service has been outstanding both times and have repaired the devices quickly. Samsung gets 5 stars from me.  Now my 2nd unit has had the screen die and I am in the process of sending it back.  These devices are only 4 months old and do not get abused. So whats up with the durability on these? What happens once the warranty expires and the screens die again?UPDATE 3/28/2014: The screen on Unit #1 died again, for the 3rd time, less than 1 week after it was replaced.  The fact that it was replaced sort of makes it 3 devices that have now died.  This is a very bad trend and I have lost faith that these devices can withstand the test of time.As I said, when the devices are working they are awesome. But for them to die multiple times with adults using them for web browsing, emails and simple games - seems a bit worrisome.On the first unit, the 2nd time it went back they seemed to have replaced it. I am hopeful that will now last for a long time.  Hopefully, they have learned something and my other unit will be fixed permanently too.Its funny - I bought these to replace a 2.5 year old Xoom that has gotten slow.  Still slow but it still works fine and for the moment is being used again.5 stars for Samsung Support and for the device when it is working (95% of the time).  1 star for the fact that it has failed so much.UPDATE 3/28/2014: The process of sending these back is fairly simple and Samsung Support is great.  But each time is a nearly 3 week process of sending it back and waiting until it comes back.Update 4/2/2014: Unit two is on its way back to me, should be here in a couple days. Nice fast turn around from Samsung support again. Spoke on the phone with Samsung about Unit one, the one that died for a 3rd time. With a mature and constructive conversation they have agreed to refund me the purchase price (minus sales tax though). They did not want to refund me on the 2nd unit because it was a first time failure and they have not even had a chance to repair it yet. Fair enough. I am not too concerned about the future at this point because I really have to say - Samsung support has been outstanding to work with. I have zero complaints about their professionalism, promptness and general ease to work with. Top notch professionals.  I am now hoping that unit two comes back and no longer fails because as I have said, when these have been working they are awesome. There is currently nothing better out there. To replace the first unit we  are looking at the upcoming Sony Xperia Z2, which still does not have the specs that the Samsung does but it looks close.

I mostly use mine for games, drawing, streaming Netflix, and surfing the internet. The S-pen is very comfortable and has a natural flow for me... I find it easier to use for drawing than my bamboo tablet for instance. As far as battery life goes, I have no complaints. The first day I had it, I literally played around with it from about 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening and only went down to 22% battery without being plugged in at all. I played games, drew stuff, downloaded a ton apps, and even watched a few of episodes of my fave shows. The screen is beautifully crisp and clear but audio is a little hollow. I usually use headphones though so it's a non-issue for me. I haven't had any connectivity issues with my wifi (802.11ac) and it's just as fast as my hard wired desktop. The weight is evenly balanced and not cumbersome at all. I also really like the leather look back... it's easier to grip than the super smooth plastics on most tablets/phones.If you're on the fence about it, I really think the big difference between this and other similar tablets available right now is the S-pen which is great for casual artists, writing, and more precise navigation.

Make sure you get the 2014 version of this tablet.  A minor point: I wish the charger port were in a different location as it interferes with fully using my case in all configurations.  Note-taking with S-Note is amazing; it is very functional and can save your notes to picture or PDF format for mailing to others. See my reviews for the case that I really like for this device.  I wish the \"menu\" and \"back\" capacitive \"buttons\" were closer to the outer edges to make them easier to use with my case, but this is only a minor complaint.  The fact that it (and the Note 3 phone) actually have a \"back\" \"button\" is so helpful, unlike the iPhone/iPad which does not have one.  I have no issue with the size or design/build of the stylus.  32G of internal memory, with the ability to add up to a 64Gb microSD card is far better than how an iPad designs their approach to memory. Also, you can configure the closing of an app when you swith to a different display/functionality which helps battery life.  Otherwise, I end up with a zillion apps running in the background, thus draining my battery.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving it!!", "Author": "Sonny delos Santos", "ReviewID": "R2WOBRIMGGOS9S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well it is my first tablet so I can't really compare it to any other tablet.

I have two Alienwares, an all-in-one Gateway touchscreen desktop, a Kindle (Paperwhite edition), and a Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. On top of these, I have a powerful desktop which I built myself with top-of-the-line pieces of hardware. Why should I buy a tablet? That's the question I asked myself over and over before I bought the new Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition) with LTE.I told myself that after buying the tablet, it would be my chief e-reader and I'd have to give away my Kindle. I thought it would make for a great browsing device while lying down in bed. Well, I was wrong. My new tablet CANNOT replace my Kindle. The reading experience with my Kindle is much more better. The Kindle Paperwhite is superb; it feels much like a book and offers more than any physical book can. Holding the Kindle is more comfortable compared to by new tablet. There is no way the table can replace my Kindle.As far as browsing the internet goes, I really do not know where this tablet fits. It's neither as small and easy to hold as my smartphone, nor is it as sophisticated as mt M11x laptop. It cannot render web pages as good as my laptop can; it does not run smoothly as my laptop either. Plus, you really would need a kickstand of some sort if you are going to be viewing an hour-long movie on it; not so with my laptop. For those, who thing this tablet, or any tablet for that matter, for that matter will be great for note-taking in classrooms and board meetings, I'd say good luck to you. You can draw with this tablet, scribble short notes, create scrapbooks, and do some other little things like that. But as far as serious note-taking is concerned, no note-taking on a tablet can compare to writing with a pen on an actual piece of paper. Period!To be fair, the tablet is gorgeous as far as tablet goes and has some impressive specs, but I still do not know what task to assign to this device. What sort of task will be best done on a tablet? That's the answer I am yet to find.Some people have complained of occasional lag and stutter with this tablet. I have noticed it too. It makes my wonder what good the 3GB of RAM does. Why would Samsung tot optimize it's Touchwiz to prevent this sort of thing?With all that said, and this is why I rated the tablet with 4 stars, this appears to be the best Android tablet in the market today.

My biggest complaint about the tablet is that I have Verizon Fios at home as my cable carrier, but I am unable to access the internet with the tablet. There were always \"Network Connection Issues\".  The network would connect for a second, then the connection would drop.  The messages on the Tablet displayed the message, no connection, reconnect.  I called Verizon and Samsung, and we went through the motions, I replaced the Verizon Router with the latest updated firmware, still same issue network connection problems.  I spoke with Samsung, they made me do a couple of factory resets and I had to re-install all my apps, one by one.  After I did the Factory Reset, same issue, Network Connection Problems.  I am returning the Tablet to Best Buy.  I will try to get a replacement to see if this was an issued with the tablet.

Having owned every galaxy series smartphone from samsung (S-SIV), i was expecting some initial problems and bugs like lag and build quality. I previously was an ipad person, having owned an ipad 2 and 4. felt limited by the ecosystem and bought my first android tablet (Note 10.1 2014). I was impressed with the out of box performance of this device. Even with all of the preliminary bloat running on this device, it was very smooth and ready to go. Rooting was not necessary to unlock acceptable performance (as i have done with my samsung phones). after a few days of disabling certain services and installing all of my apps, i was surprised at its build quality (for being made of polycarbonate) and robustness. No issues whatsoever. Screen is just amazing. the LCD display is incredible and the resolution is very complimentary of the LCD display. A few weeks of usage and i found myself using this more than i used my iPad 4. S pen is very convenient for making dimensions while building things, drawing symbols and taking notes. I knew i made the right choice by buying this over the iPad Air.Pros:-Speed-Screen-S pen (probably one of the best features)-expandable sd-buildCons:-speakers a bit dull?-lockscreen wake up lag (maybe by 1-2 seconds)-couldve had a micro hdmi slot (for a $550 tablet these days, should be standard)-shouldve made hardware buttons since portrait orientation of home button and capacitive buttons is kinda awkwardI would definately recommend this to anyone looking to buy a tablet.

I like it better than my previous nexus 7 because of its capability and potential in productivity. If you want productivity (with a stylus too) this is a great option to consider... I love to draw and I like the feel of a pen or a pencil. That's something I wish the nexus had. Taking notes on Evernote is fantastic. Drawing on Sketchbook can also be equally satisfying. The stylus gave me that freedom I wanted as a creative type. The accuracy of the pen is what I was looking for! For me, all that the stylus had to offer and could do had me sold. The tablet is great in that manner.I was also drawn to the Play Store. I'm already invested in the Google play store so my purchased apps could easily sync. I don't want to buy the same apps twice and I don't have to. But one thing grieves me.The Bad:At times it tries to do too much. Samsung seems to want to take the helm with your experience and data. It has apps for everything with the intention of completing the experience. You just need to agree to it. But, I already have Google watching. I don't want another. The consequence? I don't think it responded well to foreign apps (like nova) or apps that I think challenge Samsung's intricate OS... So, at times it feels a bit pushy to my app preference. But, I have a Nexus 5 & had a Nexus 7 before this guy. That might explain my craving for a more relaxed experience.The thing is, I didn't expect to be pulled into so many things Samsung. That's what it is. It is a step into the Samsung experience, or a dive. Samsung has it's own app ecosystem waiting for you. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on you. I already have my Google app ecosystem and I didn't want to jump into another. So my denying Samsung's didn't make it the cleanest experience. Samsung is expecting you to use its apps and its store. They just want you to agree with what they believe is best. If you're up for that then more power to you! Go for it. It's effort to make things simple is there but it's persistence can be messy. There are quite a few agreements to make for app permissions (which bugged me) for apps I could care less about. The good thing is that there's always an explanation to what's going on along with a choice...And My Magazine... I don't know what Samsung was thinking with that.

When she finally spoke to someone they repeatedly asked her to try different chargers to charge the battery.  I guess the first time she told them we did that didn't set in.

The 1600p screen is great especially to show my photography portfolio to potential clients.  Needless to say, managing pictures, documents, files, and movies in an android system is WAYYYYYYYY EASIER than an iPads whole thing with having it go through iTunes and syncing specific folders.

I'll start off with the cons, because most people already know what pros this tablet offers, manufacturers don't advertise their cons.I really wanted to like this tablet, in fact I'm probably going to come back in a few months to see if they flattened out the manufacturer issues. For now, it's unacceptable.|||SUMMARY|||Build quality: 1/5Aesthetics: 4/5Features: 3/5Value: 2/5Reliability: 2/5Overall: 2.4/5_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|||CONS|||-Horrible quality control on Samsung's part. While I mildly welcome the newly redesigned look of the tablet, with the faux leather back, there are many flaws with the casing. The metal speaker grills on the sides of the tablet are loose, if you tap on them, they will rattle and move. I don't think they'll fall off, but it probably would've been a better idea to have the grills cut out from the casing itself. If you apply pressure to the left hand bezel when holding the tablet in horizontal mode, the plastic creaks and depresses slightly, which is cause for concern. In some models, there are scratches and mis-molded plastic on the faux leather back of the tablet. You're probably thinking I just got an unlucky product, but I've actually bought and carefully inspected five Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition tablets. Yes, FIVE, that's how much I wanted to like this tablet. I would dismiss these issues if the tablet were low end, but this tablet is one of the most expensive android tablets on the market currently, and there is absolutely no excuse for such an atrocious level of quality control. It is standard protocol to check a few samples out of every manufacture batch, five minutes with this tablet and it is obvious the manufacturing process should be better tuned. This tablet actually costs $50 more than the iPad Air, which is often considered \"overpriced\", yet the iPad Air has impeccable build quality and Apple nearly always does a perfect job at quality control. If Samsung wants to charge the same prices as Apple, they need to step up the quality control. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is better than the iPad Air in almost every aspect, and it pains me to see such manufacturer defects.-Cheap materials. This is a $550 tablet folks, it should not be made out of plastic. I would much appreciate if Samsung had replaced the faux-chrome accents and replaced it with brushed aluminum, it would complement the faux leather back so much better. To be honest, I'd be happier if they ditched plastic altogether and had an all aluminum build, give it a nice sleek look.-There is a noticeable graphics lag present when flipping through the homescreens, especially if you have a lot of widgets. Not that bad of an issue, this is easily remedied with Nova Launcher.-The S Note app is very laggy and buggy, I attribute that to the software aspect of the app, and not the hardware in the tablet. The S Note app is the main app I use and it's kind of disappointing to see such low-quality coding and software optimization. Sometimes when starting up the S Note app, it doesn't recognize the pen, or it would just crash, which is very embarrassing when in the middle of an important meeting. I'd also like to mention that the Exynos processor in the tablet isn't actually an octacore processor, but two quad core processors. One running at 1.9GHz and the other running at 1.3GHz for power conservation purposes. I suspect the tablet often hiccups when the two processors hand off processes to each other.-Another bone I have to pick with the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is that there is no microusb 3.0, which the galaxy note 3 has. They came out at around the same time, and to be honest, the tablet needs microusb 3.0 much more than the phone does. This tablet has a huge battery and it would be nice to charge faster.|||PROS|||-The sound quality on the built in speakers are phenomenal, they are very loud and the sound is clear. Perfect for watching movies or YouTube videos, or listening to music.-I'd also like to note that having an active digitizer is great, in fact, I don't buy tablets that don't have an active digitizer because I tend to take a lot of notes. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is one of the few android tablets that have an active digitizer and I love it.-The battery life is decent, I can get a full days use and maybe more if I don't put it through heavy use.-The screen is great, the resolution is nice and the quality of the screen is probably better than a retina iPad.-Having dedicated navigation buttons means that there's more screen real estate to be used for media and writing notes.-The reading mode of the tablet adjusts the contrast when reading books or articles so it's easier on your eyes.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible light bleed...", "Author": "blahblahblah", "ReviewID": "R3R8E7FZB68UFQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Build quality is great, not the best but it's better that what I expected.

There are nice things about it and not so nice, too. The screen is very bright and sharp. The color saturation is right on. The sound is loud enough to enjoy a movie, but will get lost in a busy environment.As for the negatives, I would have to start with the web browsing, because that's what these tablets are used for mostly. Pages tend to render in packets. The text will come up first, then the pictures. But, don't be too fast to click on anything just yet. The pages have to then arrange the contents, which takes longer than I experienced on an iPad or Windows tablet. Pictures and text slide around on the screen until everything is situated. Maybe the browsers cannot handle the floating content well. Who knows?As for the power, I have notice that it drops pretty fast from 100% to 30%. It's quicker than an iPad. Let's put it this way, after an evening of using it starting fully charged, I make sure to plug the tablet in before going to sleep. If I don't, it will not have much power left to use the next day. I suppose I am a bit spoiled after using an iPad, which had enough power to see me through two days of heavy usage. Still, I should be getting longer use out of this tablet per charge.The writing functions work nice. The pen produces very sharp lines as it glides smoothly across the display. However, the handwriting recognition is not working. I read that it is a problem Samsung will address shortly.Overall, I am still disappointed with many of the apps that are supposedly made for tablets. Although Google has pushed developers to produce apps specifically for larger screens, many of the apps look as though they are nothing more than stretched-out versions of the smartphone variety. I know there are diehard Android fans out there, but most of them are phone users, therefore they cannot see what I am talking about. In my eyes, even the Windows 8 tablet apps are better formatted for larger screens. Of course, I need not mention the iPad apps. Those are the best.So, I am deliberating whether to keep the Note 10.1 or not. There are too many quarks for me to use the tablet and be satisfied while doing so. I gave it a try because it is supposedly the best Android tablet being sold right now. So much for that. I tried.10/16/2013: Here is another annoyance I found. Samsung placed a couple of capacitive touch buttons in an awkward area on the bezel. One of those buttons is the back button, which is very sensitive. And, since the bezel is smaller with this model, it is more likely that you will touch that button and be taken away from the screen you are currently viewing.

You can make a video of your writing, but it has no sound.  You can make a voice recording, but the notes are then stationary.  For me, without that ability, this is a very expensive organizer with Internet access.  I knew I could do both but did not know you couldn't do them together.In addition, Flash is no longer supported for Android products - so no Flash.I do love watching videos on it.  For that, the screen resolution is a definite plus.The S Pen works well - which is what I would expect from Wacom.

The description stated that there was a 1/4\" by 1/4\" \"cosmetic\" flaw on the front of the device. The description also mentioned that there was no original packaging or user manual. For these reasons alone, the description stated that it was selling the device for approx a 25% discount. There was no mention of any issues with functionality. When I received the tablet, I inspected it to identify where the cosmetic flaw was on the front of the device but could not find it. When I began to use the tablet, I began to notice that the functionality was severely compromised in a variety of ways.Text, buttons and other functional elements were frozen or missing from virtually every application. For example, it was impossible to browse the internet from any browser, it was constantly freezing or rapidly refreshing and chunks of the page would black out. Text would disappear from buttons or windows making it impossible to read and click/tap as needed. In some cases, the functional elements would go missing altogether. This happened whether in a browser or any application I launched. It even happened in the settings menu! The display also began to erode very quickly. Within just one day of use, or trying to use the tablet, white lines began to appear even when resting on the home screen.I understand that I received the item for a 25% discount, but I still paid close to $400 and would expect that the device would be somewhat functional. Given that the seller was Amazon itself, I trusted that the description was accurate. When I called to see what could be done, they offered an apology, a return but no replacement.

In case someone reads those comments considers taking them seriously, a few points:1) Yes, I'm reviewing the 2014 model. Please note \"Amazon verified purchase\" under my name.2) Yes, the relative lack of useability of the pen pushes this to a 2-star rating, which according to Amazon means \"I don't like it\". 3 stars means \"I like it\". Considering the one feature that sets this tablet apart and makes it one of (or the) most expensive Android tablet, is a design failure large enough to cause me to return it, I think I can say I DON'T LIKE IT.3)Of course turning the tablet upside down solves the problem of your palm accidentally hitting the home button. And if you use the device without a case and write with the device resting flat on a table or in your lap, you are good to go. However, I (like most people I would think) use it with a case. That is the only easy way to get the device resting on a flat surface at a 25 degree (or whatever) angle that makes it comfortable for writing. Have you seen the cases that can fold back at that angle? They all have cutouts for the different buttons (volume, power, s-pen, etc.) that only allow you to insert the device into the case one way, which is NOT upside down. So, you cannot use the upside down method if you are using a case.3-a)Even if a solution to the problem listed above (accidental home-button-pushing) is somehow found, it still doesn't solve the problem of that little ruler thing that runs along the bottom of the handwriting keyboard now.4)My problems weren't because I was using S-Note, because I don't use S-note. I was trying to write notes in Evernote. The app being used doesn't matter because it is the SAME handwriting keyboard that comes up for all apps. Really, what a nitwit comment.Yeesh, some the people ripping me a new one for my review don't even know what they are talking about. All I can say to someone reading this review and weighing whether or not buy the Note 10.1 is to go try it if you can somewhere - especially if you are buying it for the hand-writing capabilities with the s-pen.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased the Galaxy Note 8 about 4 months ago and liked it a lot, but quickly realized it was too small. I used it to write take notes in Evernote for all of my meetings and it worked great for that. Connectivity with projectors was a problem, and the screen was too small to use remote desktop to get into my work server when I traveled. So when I heard about the Note 10.1 2014 coming out I planned to upgrade and pass the Note 8 on to one of my staff.Got the Note 10.1 a few days ago and it was like Christmas morning. Went through the standard setup where it downloaded not 1 but 2 updates to the Android operating system, downloaded all of my apps and got it set up just like my Note 8. Of course I wanted to play with it, so I opened up Evernote and started writing a fake note. I immediately realized there was a problem because the physical home button is in the middle of the tablet when you have it landscape mode, which is how I (and most users) would use it propped up at a slight angle (in its case) on a desk/table while in meetings. That home button ends up under your fist as you hand write your text across the screen, and about once every 3-5 times my hand touched the home screen I put enough pressure on the button to cause the Note to exit out of my program and go the home screen.Problem #2 is with the actual hand writing keyboard mode. It is different than the one that comes on the Note 8. It still looks like yellow note paper, but there is a weird little ruler running along the bottom. What happens on the Note 10.1 is that when you write, your hand writing moves to the left and eventually off the screen. You can touch that little ruler along the bottom and drag it to the right side of the screen to bring back previous text you wrote, I assume to be able to change it or something. The problem is that my hand would also catch that ruler and drag the text back towards the middle occasionally, which would cause whatever I am writing at that second to be over-written on a previous word, creating a mess with the text that actually ends up on the screen. It would also occasionally have a word jump over to the right side of the screen (I couldn't figure out why that was happening) and so what I was writing would get out of order.This is very difficult to explain so I'm sorry if I didn't do a good job. I tried recording a video of this but couldn't get my camera set up at a good angle. I suggest if you are considering buying this you call some local stores to see if any have them on display so you can try it. If you are like me and buying this tablet for the pen functionality then you really should try it.Oddly I didn't experience any of the lag that many of the professional reviewers (Engadget, Tech Radar, etc.) have complained about. Great looking and feeling device, and it was very responsive. But it is almost like they didn't do extensive user testing on this when they moved the home button and designed this new handwriting keyboard software. Very strange and disappointing.As an Android user since the first Droid phone came out (currently have a Galaxy S3 phone and still love it) this has been a real kick in the crotch. Since I have seen the benefit of having such a device with me at all times at work, and the benefit of being able to write naturally with a pen, it looks like I am going to have to go to a..a...oh this hurts, a Windows tablet. Have done a lot of research (and watched the youtube videos of handwriting keyboard!) and I'll be ordering the Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A faulty product.", "Author": "Dobees#1 \"dobeelover\"", "ReviewID": "RPJKQ0NRJKD00", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After reading all the positive comments about this tablet here on amazon and having done my research on other sites, I decided to purchase one exactly a month ago at my local Best Buy with a 3 year protection plan. Now they have a 15 day period in which you can get a full refund or exchange if any problems occur. Exactly 1 day after that warranty expired, I started having multiple glitches on my tablet! It turned off abruptly several times while watching videos, playing games, surfing through the net, it wouldn't charge while I was using it, and the icing on the cake was that by the end of the month, for the last 2 days it failed to charge. I finally decided to take it back to the store to see if I could get a full refund or exchange, because after all its still new, only 1 month old, and with minimal use. I'm not one of those people who's glued to my tablet, cell phone, etc, so my world didn't come crashing down, but its still a huge inconvenience. Their rep, which btw was very courteous, tested it, and nothing happened, the tablet was dead. So, anyway, to make a long story short (too late), all Best Buy could do was send it to Geek Squad to have it fixed! I'll get it it back in approx. 2 weeks from today!! YAY!!I sure do hope either a Samsung Rep or Best Buy Manager read this post. I'm just dismayed at the faulty product I purchased from Samsung. It's still new, and its basically just a lemon. I can't believe that after just one month, my tablet had to be sent back for repairs. I'm just utterly amazed at the poor quality of certain products nowadays. Sadly, I've lost confidence in Samsung.So if you plan on purchasing this faulty product, take my comment into account.If you have any recommendations for myself or any other persons who've had this problem, please feel free to message me.My next step is to send a well written letter to Samsung.Oh well, as I like to say, when life throws you lemons, make some hard lemonade!I'll update whenever I get it back.Update!!OK so I finally got my tablet back............ 3 weeks later......Internal battery was changed, I apologize, I'm not a techie, but yes there were some hardware problems with the device, Geek squad took care of it. Best Buy rep admitted they've had several people come in with similar problems, though their tablets being much older. Got it home........would not charge, tested the USB cable on several outlets, and.......... nothing.Went back to Best Buy, purchased another cable, worked fine. So, Samsung, please include working cables with your products.......please?Been using it for about a couple of weeks since then, guess what? It still abruptly turns off, and it still does NOT charge while I'm using it...... ::sigh::But.......it's working.........most of the time. It's just an inconvenience when it turns off in an instant (even when it's fully charged), and you have to log back in and whatnot.
