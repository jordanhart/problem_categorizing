{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfection!", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "RIAA49E9Z6L17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Words fail me on how much I love this tablet. I will say I'm slightly Google-biased, as I've owned Android phones before they were cool (and since), I use all their services (including Google+. Yes, there are people on there), and Google sent me a FREE Chromebook to beta-test it a year or two ago. So, yeah, I'm a little biased... =)BUT, I've waited to buy a tablet. There's 2 iPads (both 3rd gen) in our house, and I do like them, they're worth the $500. However, it's not fun to just play with it. You need apps. Then, apps aren't really fun unless you get the paid version. Then, a $500 tablet becomes $50 dollars more, just to get some basic apps and games! Plus, it's cumbersome and weighty, so if you're playing a game, you'll be sitting it in your lap within 5 minutes.The Nexus 7 has NONE of those problems.1. It's $250. (Yes, I paid $275 for the one here, but I'm a Prime member and I have a store card here, so it made sense to buy from Amazon). It is NOT worth that price. It's worth $400 easy, in quality, look, feel, and performance.2. The wallpapers, widgets, etc. alone can entertain you when you first get it! I customize my screens and change them every week to keep me from getting bored of it, so I gladly welcome how amazing it looks! Jelly Bean is silky smooth and the UI just makes sense, especially compared to Gingerbread, which my phone is stuck with... =(3. Apps. There is enough on the device to get you started (including a copy of Transformers 3. Not that I'd pay for that *particular* title...), and the Play Store has so many naturally free apps that can do almost ANYTHING! Yes, if you get free apps, there will be some with ads, like with iOS devices, but at least you have a choice with almost every app, the prices for paid apps seem MUCH more reasonable, and Google gives you $25 credit just for buying a Nexus 7! $25!4. Size. This was the make-or-break for me. I'm an avid reader. On the iPad, I fell in deep, deep love with iBooks. It was the PERFECTION of e-reader apps. Still is, in my opinion. I can get all my college books online in PDF, and I also have ePubs that I read, mark, highlight in. Owning an Android phone, I've shopped the apps, but nothing came close to the reading experience of iBooks on the iPad's nice 10\" screen, the 5+ highlighting colors, and the shelves to keep my books organized.That being said, I had reservations in buying this, as I doubted it could compete.Even w/o a good reader app, it won. A 7\" screen for a guy like me, who's NEVER at home, was a much better match than I imagined! It LITERALLY fits in a jacket pocket. Now pants, it'll depend on what kind, but the thought is that I can, will, and have taken this with me everywhere! It fits in my glove compartment, messenger bag, suit coat, jacket, you name it. With that alone, it beat the huge iPad, because now I was reading everywhere, instead of just at home. To make things better, I found an e-reader that's a very close 2nd to iBooks, Mantano reader (GET IT NOW!!), so I don't miss the iPad at all!Cons: Hmm. Well, ummmm.... there's, no.... I got nothing. =)Actually, I have a couple.1. No HDMI port. That is a bummer, especially since Google is pushing their movie and TV selections so much, you'd think they'd give you a way to watch it on more than a 7\" screen...2. No 3G model... yet. ;D3. Google Now needs some more work and features if it's going to compete w/ Siri. Not that it's bad, just limited...4. Not many accessories, but how many do you need for a tablet? Phones, sure. But who would honestly dock their cutting-board-sized tablet? More case choices would be nice, though...Basically, I've waited years to buy a tablet, waiting for a decent, GOOD Android tablet. Here it is, finally. It's waay cheaper than iPad, but not in quality AT ALL. It's running pure Android OS, unlike the Kindle Fires. Combining a quad-core processor with Jelly Bean means it's a MUCH better experience than any other Android tablet (I'm looking at you, Xoom), even rivaling/beating(?) an iOS experience!Buy a Nexus 7 if you want a 7\", $400 tablet for only $200 from Google.Buy an iPad if you want a 10\", $500 tablet from Apple.Other than that, there is no difference or advantage.Rate this if this review helped you in the slightest!

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R1MBTT1758G3I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "_______________________________________________NOV 29 UPDATE:Google just announced upgraded Nexus 7 tablets to be available on Nov 13. You will be able to get a 32GB Nexus 7 for the price of the current 16GB model.NOTE:My initial review was a Nexus 7 vs. the first generation Kindle Fire and the Nexus was a clear winner. I have now updated my review for the Fire HD. It's a close call but the Nexus' 4-core CPU and its pure Android, more open makeup make it my preferred 7-incher. However, the rest of my family prefers the Fire HD because it's such a great dedicated (Amazon) media consumption pad._______________________________________________We've been using a Kindle Fire since September 2011 (pre-ordered)  and I am happy we ordered ours. Soon after purchase it was adopted by our daughter. She is using it to draw and paint, she watches Netflix for Kids on it, she learned how to search Youtube for arts and crafts 'how to' videos and she plays (mostly free) games from Amazon's Appstore. The Fire wasn't a full-feature tablet when it launched but we overlooked its hardware shortcomings, its off-mainstream Android and its locking us out Google's much larger app store because the price was right and because the 7\" screen size made it lighter and more portable than the 'full size' 10.1\" alternatives. We are still happy with our Fire but we are happier with Nexus 7, our second 7\" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest (written in July 2012).+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core- 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on bothNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.1 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. It is very likely that it will be upgradeable to future versions. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android 3.x will ever be upgraded. It's possible but not likely.+ Chrome. It happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.1 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android 4.1. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature.PRICE (Fire HD but it's a close call)The Fire HD appears is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration but the difference is not as big as it may seem. Keep in mind that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads on it.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using a Nexus 7 for over a month at the time I'm writing this. I've also been using a Kindle Fire HD for about a week now. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<___________________________________________NOTE ON STORAGE (memory)We are doing just fine with our 8GB Kindle Fire and our Nexus 7 is a 8GB model. I went for the 8GB model for 2 reasons: my year-plus experience with a 8GB Kindle Fire and a 16GB XOOM and, I must admit, a 16GB model wasn't available at the store  when I bought my Nexus.I agree that 16GB is always better than 8GB and a tablet with a SD card slot is better than one without. Objectively, 8GB may be okay for most of us but not all of us. Our 8GB Fire is less than half-full today and I never needed an SD card for our 16GB XOOM because, after more than a year, I have 4.8GB worth of Apps, 1GB worth of pictures and videos (all pics and videos I took with the XOOM) and 0.2GB worth of Audio.Had I decided to download my music library and the family photo albums on a tablet, 16GB might have been barely adequate and I would have used the SD memory expansion but I never felt that need. With videos coming from Youtube or movie streaming services and most of my music streaming from Pandora or cloud storage or our dedicated Media Server, 8GB appear to be okay (barely) and 16GB are quite plenty. Of course this may not be the case 2 years from now.I would buy the 16GB model if I was planning on storing lots of content other than apps on my tablet or simply wanted 'peace of mind' as in not worry about managing my tablet's storage. If not planning to keep lots of photos or videos or music on the Nexus then the 8GB may be just fine.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A few issues, but overall a good intro tablet", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "R3G6IJEAR7LQ1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated News as of April 3rd:Google is set to release the 2nd edition of the Nexus 7 in July 2013. Resolution is expected to be bumped up to 1920 x 1080, new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for increased speed, 2 gigs of RAM, a back camera, and for the cellular plan, LTE. Pricing rumors haven't been released. So, if you can wait a few months, it's probably best to see what Google has in store for the Nexus 7 Second Edition before buying the currently offered Nexus 7.End of Update.Full Disclosure:I own an iPad 3 and an iTouch and a four, going on five year old Motorola dumb phone.I'm not going deep into hardware specs, you can read other reviews for that.[EDIT FOR NEWEST GOOGLE PRESS RELEASE]On October 29th, Google released the updated Nexus 7. The ONLY things that changed was that the 8gb version was discontinued, the 16gb version dropped to $199 and the 32gb version was released for $249 (both available for purchase NOW). The 3G cellular version is on sale starting November 13, 2012. Do not buy the existing Nexus 7 versions at current prices posted on Amazon! You're paying way too much.[/END EDIT]Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8gb and  16gb (the two flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.[SUPER BIG EDIT FOR HIGHLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION]:It's called USB On The Go. Essentially you take a USB OTG cable (like $1 on Ebay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Best $3 in credit I spent.With OTG and flash drives you don't need the cloud. Ever. Seriously, whoever decided to not put in the MicroSD to force cloud should be fired at Google.Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.As of today (10/5/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iTouch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad!2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad. It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not iPad well done, but save yourself $300 well done. It's fairly responsive, not iPad response, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. As for the screen separation, that seems to be more of an issue with the 16gb version than the 8gb. I haven't had any ghosting issues either.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixel is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app.4) Apps. True, the Apple ecosystems has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like skype, facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wifi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.[EDIT]: The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.[/Edit]6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google \"Install Flash On Nexus 7\"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7.If an iPad user like me can figure this out, you can too!Now on to other things:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network deadzones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn't.Jelly Bean isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with).Oh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.EDIT: On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10\" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like \"do I need an umbrella today?\" Ask \"Weather forecast (your location).\"Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.EDIT: Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the \"NAvFree USA\" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying \"in 100 meters, turn right.\" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.One thing: if you are a student planning on using this for notes, don't. The screen is way too small to actually take notes well and you need a blue tooth keyboard as well. Virtual on screen keyboard already eats up too much space. However, there is a speech to text and it might work well recording what your professor says. That said, you're better off with either the iPad or the Asus Transformer w/ keyboard. Or a real laptop.All in all I do like the tablet and often I'll reach for it over the iPad. Except when it comes to shopping online and browsing (and Facebook). The 7\" is simply too small to offer real competition to a 9~10\" screen. The use of keyboard via OTG alleviates this a bit but the screen is still really small.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so. Plus if you buy now you get $25 in Google Play credit and a transformers movie copy. Not the biggest of Michael Bay but $25 brings the actual cost quite down.Word of caution: the 16 GB versions seem to be affected by a poor manufacturing/QC issues. The 8 GB versions seem to have far fewer problems. If you're okay with OTG external storage, go with the 8 GB version as you're likely to have far less chance of getting a defective unit.One more annoying fact: If you root your device and get a custom recovery, you can't install over the air updates. Found this out the hard way. You have to manually install Android updates.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet!", "Author": "Nicole Jamison", "ReviewID": "R899PEC7KRDWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where do I begin?

I ordered mine directly from Google Play a couple of weeks ago. Received it within a few days, and it was defective out of the box - dead pixels. Google was great about getting a replacement out immediately, but in the week of use while waiting for the next one, I also had the glass/screen lifting from the tablet on the left that sooooo many people are having (moves when touched and makes creaking sounds - especially not good for gamers). Received the replacement, which is also defective - gray spots in the display screen (almost like the back-lighting isn't working in those areas or is blocked by some debris, or the pixels are just stuck in that color) and major lifting of the glass/screen on the left side before any use. I hate to give it up, because there are a lot of great things about it that I really like, but I'm going to return this one as well and wait to see if they resolve in future build productions. I would not recommend Nexus 7 until they correct these issues, unless you're okay with accepting them. I do realize the price is much lower than other tablets, but there will be other options coming out in the same price range, so hopefully this will help encourage Google/Asus to improve the quality control on the Nexus 7, if they aren't already interested in doing so. You might want to do a web search on defect issues before purchasing, just so you are aware. These two issues I've had seem to be quite prevalent. Both I received were from the July production run, so they haven't addressed them as of yet.EDIT regarding customer service: Google Play customer service is horrible. There are several nice reps, but almost none of them actually follow through to resolve an issue with a return for refund (even from the \"managers\" that told me they would contact me with a follow up email and didn't, on more than one occasion). It took OVER A MONTH to receive my refund from Google after receiving two defective units and returning both, and that was after MANY phone calls and emails to them before I could get one person who finally truly took responsibility and followed through. If you order this directly from Google and have any issues, you may wait a very long time to get a refund, so you might want to go to a retail outlet to purchase instead, where you can actually get an immediate refund if needed.

Was going to get one for my wife, decided to check my favorite store Amazon only to find that they are increadably overpriced here.  I hope that changes soon.This media tablet is the perfect $200 tablet.  I titled this review that way because most of the negative reviews I read here are due to some of the short comings of this tablet.  People really expect WAY to much these days.  Why complain about something a cheaper tablet doesn't have when you know good and well that it won't have those features?!?!  If this tablet ain't for you, don't buy it and don't bother griping about it either.  That doesn't do anyone any good.  Plus this is technically a \"media tablet\", not a full tablet.  And you'd really need to wait for Windows 8 release to get a REAL full blown, no holds bared tablet anyway.What amazes me about this tablet is...1. Speed.  It's fast, dang fast for an Android based low price tablet.  I've used faster tablets, but those cost well over $500.2. Resolution.  The screen is fantastic!  Bright, clean, great viewing angles, and perfect resolution (16x10 NOT 16x9!  That's perfect!  16x9 stinks on computing devices!)3. Power.  Great battery life.  No, amazing!  I've been able to get a full day of heavy use out of this tablet easily.4. Android 4.1.  Android is finally getting good.  Not perfect, not quite iOS or Windows 8 IMHO but much better than in the past.  Perfect for this tablet/task.5. Lightweight.  This much power and battery with such a light weight device is amazing.6. Google.  Face it, without the full power of Google behind this little guy it wouldn't be 1/2 (or less) of the tablet it is.What doesn't amaze me...1. Fumble!  Yep, I tend to fumble this little guy a lot.  The touch screen is very reactive, which is a good thing.  But I end up accidentally hitting it and changing things a lot when I don't mean to.  Plus the soft touch home button to me should be a double press once the button has faded, to keep you from hitting when you don't want to.  The backing is very nice and soft, but I still find it slippery.  I'm getting a cover for it soon, so hopefully that will help.  P.S. I have carpal tunnel issues which makes this worse.  YMMV.2. Blinding!  Reflective screen glass.  Come on Asus!  NOBODY likes reflective screens, and it is possible to make them anti-reflective without the \"sparkles\"  Apple fixed it on the iPhone 3GS, (then failed on the 4...) so why do companies still do this stupid thing?  It's annoying as all get out!3. Plug it!  Minor, but I don't like the micro USB plug.  Too fragile.  I'd rather see a mini USB plug.  Not that much bigger, but much more robust and stronger, and more available.What doesn't bother me in the least...1. Can you hear me now?  No cellular.  So what.  I'd use my cell phone's hot spot ability if I needed internet on the go with this guy.  Cheaper that way anyway.2. Flashy?  Nope, no Adobe Flash support.  Good.  R.I.P. Flash!3. Expand!  Can't do.  No external memory support.  You can rig it with connectors and rooting.  But Google provides on-line storage, enough to make this problem not a problem.Overall, you really can't get a better media tablet considering the price.

Great screen size, big enough to see but easy to carry.2. Light and thin. Easy to hold. (Easier to hold with Supcase leather case.)3. Very good, intuitive user interface.4. Bright display colors and easy to read text. Works well with Kindle application.The bad:1. No rear facing camera. This makes it difficult or impossible to use some android applications, such as UPC code scanners.2. Extremely fragile screen. Nexus 7 does not use Gorilla glass, just \"fortified glass\" glued on top of the display screen. After having my Nexus for only 2-1/2 days, I placed my Nexus 7 in the front left pocket of my cargo shorts and sat down and the screen shattered, as if it was made of microscope slide cover glass. There were no other objects in my pocket, and my shorts were loose fitting so the Nexus was not in any kind of bind. The cover glass runs right to the edge of the Nexus 7, and the frame is really flimsy. There is no way an uncased Nexus 7 could survive any kind of drop. (In contrast my 9 year old son has dropped my Droid X, which does have Gorilla glass, numerous times with no damage, and I carry my Droid X in the same front pants pocket daily.)Even though the screen was clearly defective, Asus's warranty (Asus makes the Nexus 7) does not cover screen breakage for any reason. Their warranty service is also somewhat difficult to work with, and the cost to replace my screen and ship my Nexus back to me was $164, plus the $15 it cost me to ship it to Asus.About three weeks later I received my repaired Nexus 7. After fully charging the battery, I tried to turn my Nexus on. I had a very difficult time getting it to boot to the home screen. It took about seven times turning the unit off and back on before I could get the touch screen to register any input. For the next two days the touch screen had dead spots and only worked sporadically. Since then it seems to be working normally.I purchased a Supcase leather case for my Nexus, and I highly recommend this product. It fits the Nexus 7 very snuggly, and it looks like it would protect the unit against most bumps and drops. When you close the front cover of the case it puts the Nexus into sleep mode. The cover is held closed with magnets sewn into the leather. Now I feel a lot more comfortable carrying my Nexus around, since the Nexus housing is somewhat slippery and I was constantly worried about bumping or dropping my Nexus and breaking the cover glass again.Summary: The Nexus 7 is a great size, lightweight, and a lot of fun to use; but I only give it 3 stars because of its very fragile cover glass. (See update below.)Update 11/2/12: My Nexus operating system is performing better than ever after two software updates. I am not reading a lot of other reviews of the Nexus where the cover glass was as fragile as mine, so perhaps I got a bad unit, but I am still disappointed that Asus service did not warranty my defect. My wife also has a Nexus, and we have had no issues with her unit. I am now pleased enough with our Nexus 7 tablets that I am revising my rating upwards to four stars.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Crushes the iPad and Galaxy 2", "Author": "Mike F", "ReviewID": "ROEKVJ71FYLMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading extensive reviews of both the iPad, Samsung Galaxy 2, and the Nexus, I figured I would go with the N7. 4 days after buying it,  I can't seem to put it down! I love everything about it, from the vast amount of free (as well as paid) applications available in the Play Store, to the rich, crisp responsive screen.The main reason why I chose the N7 to begin with was the Tegra Quad-Core processor-one of, if not THE best processor in tablets under $500-600 today. Plus flash capability, as well as the latest version of Android OS, 4.1 Jelly Bean. Everything loads super fast, apps download instantly with wifi, and games play flawlessly.One of the major selling points of the Galaxy 2 is the SD memory card slot. Although that is nice, the N7 can support an OTG cable that plugs directly into it, added with a $3 app in the store and you know can plug in a flash drive, or even a 500gb external hard drive if you desire.Even the minute details, such as a face-detection password for unlocking the device, voice-command serching, Netflix capability, Play Books as well as countless other features add to the overall satisfaction of my purchase. It does everything an Ipad does (except cost THREE TIMES as much), AND more. I've seen countless apps that cost anywhere from $1-$7 for FREE on my tablet as opposed to the app store on my iPhone. As well as the ability to use the Firefox Beta web browser to run flash-oriented websites and videos.

The reason? I switched from an iphone to android a while back and rather then buying apps in 2 locations figured it would make more sense to stick with one eco-system, even if apple is trying to kill it off.The tablet arrived after shipping quickly. Was delivered by UPS and left at my front door, something Apple would never allow which was great because I had to work that day and didn't have to take the day off to be home to sign for it. When I got home I opened it up, unboxed it and fired it up. The Nexus 7 had 50% battery charge out of the box and when I signed into it I received the $25 play store credit, it synced up my email and everything else and I was good to go.Initial impressions. This thing is the perfect size. I was a bit worried a 7\" tablet would be too small but it turns out it feels great to hold in one hand, it's not heavy and the round corners make it feel lighter.  The build quality of my Nexus 7 doesn't have the issues others report. I used it for several hours after getting it and the screen never stopped working once.I fired up the copy of transformers that came with the tablet and it started playing, the sound was loud and unexpected. I half thought it would be muffled and too quiet but that was not the case. One question I had was could I get movies from the play store and save them locally for offline watching, the answer is yes! Just hit the little pin button that pops up and it downloads the movie.The tablet overall is great, I won't review google now and everything else as far too many others have. Just search for those reviews. What I will say is everything is working perfectly. I haven't had any issues and this tablet is working great. I love it fits into my back pocket of my jeans, even my Dockers dress pants, sure it sticks up a bit but that's not a problem for me. It's portable and I like that.I would recommend getting one of these if you have a first gen ipad as it blows it out of the water.

This alone increased my productivity tenfold.-Apps, apps, apps!  The Play store has some of the coolest apps.  Few of the apps I've been using are 'Tasks' which syncs well with Google Tasks, 'Splashtop' for remote desktop (super cool and useful), GrooVe IP Lite for free phonecalls over WiFi if you have a Google Voice number, 'Evernote' for quick note taking, and 'FPse' for solid Playstation 1 gaming (60fps in FF9 baby!).-Free $25 in Play Store.

Williams \"Jim Williams\"", "ReviewID": "R1OMTU6D76GF42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried and reviewed several android tablets over the years on Amazon. Most of the tablets I have had a chance to use actually were adequate for the money, especially if you were looking primarily for a \"toy\" or something to play an occasional game of angry birds, check email, or do some casual web browsing.The Nexus 7 however is in a different league.  It is perfectly capable of being a primary means of doing most day to day activities on the web, social media, email and entertainment.  The quad core 1 ghz processor is lightening fast and multi-tasks smoothly. Graphics are very clean and smooth. Battery life is very good, especially if you keep wifi and location services turned off when not needed.I use it often as an E-reader when I want to read in lighting that isn't enough for my Sony reader.  Most low end tablets that I have tried in the past were not sharp enough to use in this manner for any length of time without eye fatigue from the low res background and text, but I can read comfortably for hours on the nexus.I have used it on Netflix and downloaded movies with no problems at all.  One of the more demanding apps I have run on it is an RC helicopter simulator, and it ran just as smoothly as it does on my PC.  I'm not a big gamer, so I have not tried it on any heavy duty games, but I feel confident it would perform well.There are a few things to be aware of with this tablet though.The unit has no external storage directly...in other words no SD or Micro SD slot.  That being the case for the extra $50 I would go with the 16GB unit and not the 8 unless you do not care to store much on your tablet.  The 8 GB unit will only give you around 6GB of free storage.  There is now a program available for about $3.00 however that will allow you to use a usb stick as external storage and to play back media without having to put it on the tablet. The program, called Nexus Media Importer does not require you to root your tablet.  You also have to have a cable for this but these are available for $1 - $5 on Amazon.com. Be careful here though as many of the cheapie ones ship from overseas, and quality could be questionable as well.  I would spend the extra four bucks and get a domestically shipped one from a known manufacturer. It is a micro-usb to female usb adapter.One other minor annoyance is that for some reason, ASUS / Google chose to lock certain functions of the tablet in Portrait mode.  This also is easily fixed with an external program available for a very reasonable cost called \"Rotate\".  Once run and configured the tablet will automatically switch from portrait to landscape mode when  you turn it over.  I think this program is also around two or three dollars on google play.  Keep in mind that currently you get a $25 credit for downloads with the purchase of the tablet, so you have no out of pocket expense for the software.Apparently there were some quality control issues on the early runs of the tablet.  Several problems were possible.  There was a problem with the screen not being mounted properly and appearing to be too high on one side or the other.  There was also a problem with the screen losing touch sensitivity on one side after extended or demanding use like a game that used the quad core processor heavily.There was also an issue with the screws inside the tablet not being tightened properly causing a creak or other noise when the tablet was handled.  There is a fix for this on the internet but you need to be aware that it could void your warranty if you accidentally leave any signs that the tablet has been opened. Search Youtube for detailed videos on how to do this procedure.  There also have been reported issues with the built in microphone and / or speakers not functioning properly.I personally had to return the first 16 GB that I purchased to Walmart for a refund as it was the last one they had at the time I bought it.  It had the screen sensitivity problem mentioned above. I then went to the local Office Depot, which had several 8 and 16 GB models in stock.  I explained the potential problems to the sales person and asked if I could try the unit before I purchased it to avoid a potential return, and she agreed.  The first one she brought out was an 8 GB, Serial number beginning with C60...the video display on it was totally defective...it appeared very washed out.  She then brought me another one, a 16GB model, serial number beginning with C70, (the same serial series btw, as the one I had already returned to Walmart).This one appeared to work perfectly with no physical defects showing.  Once I got it home and had used it a couple of days I noticed a little noise when I put pressure on certain areas so I removed the back and tightened all the screws around the edge of the frame slightly.  Again, do this at your own risk, and be sure not to over-tighten them...just snug them up...these are tiny screws and can probably be stripped very easily. There are several detailed videos on exactly how to remove the back cover available on Youtube...by all means watch one before attempting it yourself.I believe that the manufacturer has been made aware of these problems and probably taken steps to correct them in more recently manufactured units.  If I had the option I would avoid C60 serial number units unless you are absolutely certain you can return the unit if it proves to be defective.  I would advise buying one locally if at all possible in preference to ordering it as it will probably be much easier to get it replaced if necessary.Overall, once I found a good one and downloaded the software mentioned above, I am absolutely thrilled with the tablet.

While there appear to have been quality control problems with early production, this is not unusual (10% of iPads fail in the first 12 months of ownership), and I am sure that ASUS will work out the kinks in their manufacturing process.The integration of Android 4.1 with core Google services, such as Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive, Books, Music and Picasa make a Nexus a great choice for someone already in the Google ecosystem (just as an iPad is a good fit for someone already enmeshed in Apple's ecosystem). Frankly, whether a store has 700,000 apps or 600,000 doesn't really matter as long as the apps you need are there, and so far, I have found everything I need -- and far more, most for free.There have been several pleasant surprises: a great deal of Google content syncs automatically, and is available offline, the predictive soft keyboard works far better than I expected, and the app versions of many things, such as Google books and music are much better than their browser counterparts.The screen is vibrant, clear and sharp -- for color accuracy, I compared the Nexus with a Macbook Air,using a standard color bar reference image. Battery life is very good, especially in\" airplane mode\" which automatically disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Automatic Bluetooth syncing with external speakers is especially noteworthy.The 7\" form factor is both pocketable and convenient to hold for reading books, and the dimpled soft-touch back is very pleasant to the hand.I am still not 100% sold on the tablet concept, but if you find an iPad too big and expensive, the Nexus is best in class at this time.

You can do the things when you have the need for it.5. VERY GOOD SCREEN resolution (216 PPI). Viewable from all angles.6. STOCK ANDROID: BELIEVE ME NOTHING COMPARES TO STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE. With other variations you will most likely be outdated for some duration at least and that too with inferior UI.7. COMPARED TO KINDLE DEVICES: ITS BETTER than those as you can have amazon ecosystem on this but not vice-versa. Kindle ecosystem is very limiting.8. PRETTY DECENT SPEAKERS for its size.9. Very well integrated with Google ecosystem.10. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM IS MORE CONSUMER FRINEDLY IN GENERAL, they have more free, FEATURE RICH applications (almost double). They have recently offered many popular applications free or just for a quarter. I have bought one application @25 cents which otherwise comes for almost 14 dollars. Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI. I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan.

It is thinner and lighter than a Fire HD, more akin to a Kindle Keyboard (same basic dimensions, couple of ounces heavier).  It can easily be held in one hand as an e-reader.  The screen resolution and quality appear to be the same as the Fire HD.Where the Nexus really shines is fivefold:- processor:  It is way faster than the somewhat sluggish Fire HD and closer to the experience of using a snappy desktop computer (although not quite fully there)- Android 4, which is a much more advanced and up to date version of Android than the Android 2 software on the FireHD.  It's smooth, fast, and easy to navigate and customize.  Future updates/improvements to Android will be automatically installed on the Nexus, while Amazon's customized interface may or may not ever get an update as newer models appear.  That is not a trivial difference.- For anyone already plugged into the Google ecosystem (gmail, Google Drive, cloud print, picassa, google docs, calendar, contacts, etc) the integration is phenomenal on the Nexus.  Browser elements (bookmarks, tabs, etc) stay in sync across all devices.  Photo albums and videos stored in Picassa and Google Drive show up in a tidy directory on the Nexus automatically.  Your entire music library can be stored in Google Play for streaming and/or local playback on the Nexus and all your other devices.  Google Cloud Print will print a document from the Nexus to your printer ... from anywhere on Earth.  Paired with a $15 app to open and edit Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint/PDF documents, the cloud print feature converts what would otherwise be an entertainment device into a fairly useful productivity/work enhancer.  Basically, Google has been working on a lot of different stuff in the mobile space, and it all sort of comes together in the Nexus 7.- the app store (Google Play), which is not available to FireHD users, is fairly complete and has thousands of interesting, useful and cool apps.  People whine and moan about how it's so inferior to the Apple store, but I've had lots of Apple products and the app stores seem roughly comparable.  Yelp, Flixter, Netflix, Accuweather, Evernote, Dropbox, news readers, games, shopping apps - it's all there.  It's not \"curated\" like the Apple store, so it has a bit more of a rustic, wild-west feel as small developers put up their stuff, some of which isn't ready for prime time.  But people review the apps like mad, so there's tons of feedback and guidance from other users, which frankly is more useful than some middle manager deciding what can or can't go in the store. Some of the apps have thousands of user reviews.  I've had no problem at all finding the good stuff and avoiding the junk.  It's actually more comparable to the Amazon buying experience, where you look for products with a lot of good reviews and proceed accordingly.- The FREE google navigation software that comes loaded on the machine is the best sat nav software I've used, period.  I use it, and it alone, for all of my sat nav needs now.  I'm telling you, this app is a MUST HAVE.The Kindle for Android app works perfectly and is just as good as reading books on the Fire.  Popular apps like Dropbox and Evernote work flawlessly in Android, just like they do on Apple (though in some cases with fewer features, as the developers are only now getting on board with the \"Android is here to stay\" concept).Google has packed the Nexus with cool Google apps like Google Earth, Maps, and so on, plus a lot of great integration and clever use of Google technologies.  For instance, there's a voice-Google search.  I hit the button and asked, \"How late is the Dunkin Donuts in Herndon Virginia open?\" and it brought up the store hours.  I said \"Map of London\" and up it came, a big Google map filling the screen.  Pretty cool.  Numerous Android apps and widgets now use the voice-search feature.  For instance, I bought Dictionary for a couple of bucks.  Hit the mic button, speak the word I want, and up comes the spelling, full dictionary definition, and thesaurus entries.  Another example: voice-based searching through Wikipedia - outstanding!!!!  There's a browser called Dolphin (it's free) which enables voice-based web surfing and practically eliminates typing for basic web search/navigation/reading.  Man, what a timesaver and convenience.  Makes me wonder how I ever got by hunting-and-pecking on stupid tablet keyboards, when I can just turn the device on and say \"Chinese restaurants in Bethesda\" or \"Battle of Britain\" and get immediate results.Downsides:- Unfortunately the Nexus does not stream Amazon videos.  That is a negative for Prime members.  Hopefully that will change in the future.- There is a bit of app freezing on the Nexus and a tendency for it to get, for lack of a better word, \"clogged\".  After you've been using it for a while (a few days) apps gets sluggish and you start noticing delays.  Doing a full reboot (turning the device off, then turning it back on a few minutes later) gets things re-started and snappy again.  I don't know whether this is Nexus-specific or a characteristic of tablets in general, with their limited RAM (1 gig on the Nexus) and consequent memory swap madness.- Coming over from an Apple platform, the apps obviously won't work in Android, so there's an investment to be made.  A lot of good stuff is free, but some of the good apps and work-related apps do cost money.  So there's some duplication involved.  I probably spent $100 or so re-buying stuff I already had on my Apple devices.- there've been complaints about build quality, although I think that was in the earlier days.  My unit is rock-solid and built like a tank - couldn't be happier.Frankly, it's one of the most fun and useful devices I've purchased.  Big thumbs up for the Nexus 7.  They've really packed a lot of value into this relatively low-priced gadget.  The Sat Nav and voice search alone is worth the cost of admission, in my opinion, and that barely even scratches the surface.  I have over a hundred apps on this thing.UPDATE # 1:  Ifr you buy a Nexus and are into news reading, pick up an app called News USA.  It's free.  It provides complete versions of a hundred or so newspapers and magazines, like the New York Times, Washington Post, Atlantic Magazine, People, Sports Illustrated, Time, etc.  I hate to be a contributor to the downfall of an industry, but we're going to be letting some of our newspaper and magazine subscriptions expire, because all the content is here for free and it's just as easy to read at the breakfast table on the Nexus as it is a newspaper.  The money saved on one newspaper subscription alone (I won't name names) pays for the whole Nexus device.2-MONTH UPDATE, 12/30/12: After writing the above review, my wife actually traded in her Kindle Fire HD for a Nexus 7, and loves it.  Also, more recently, we both traded in our iPhones for Galaxy III's, so that we could use the same platform (Android) for tablets and phones.  We're now 100 % Android.  I continue to really like the Nexus 7, and find myself using it (and the phone) for a vast plethora of tasks and surfing that used to occur on my laptop or desktop computer.  I really like how the Nexus 7 fits into a coat pocket so I can read on the go.

A little background; I'm a advanced user, i own a Samsung Galaxy S3, Iphone 4, Windows PC,  and a few other gadgets. I read a lot about the mobile industry, Android, Apple, Microsoft, etc. This is just to let you know guys, where i'm coming from. So here we go. -_-.Like a lot of you, i was undecided between the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and the Asus Google Nexus 7 (The Kindle Fire HD, wasn't in my options, it's because i live outside the US, so no amazon content for me. Also, i don't like the forked Amazon OS). The reason i choose this, was meanly for this aspects: Screen Resolution, Faster Processor and Graphics Card. One main disadvantage, as all of you may know by now, is the lack of SD-Card. But there are so many options, including attaching a flash drive using a OTG USB Cable. I know that it isn't the ideal solution, but if i found myself needing more space (and trust me, i will) it's nice to know i have options.OS:The first thing i did was root my device and put it a Custom ROM. Yes i know that one of the reason people buy Google \"official\" devices, it's to have the \"pure android experience\" as well regular and fast updates. But for me, i particularly don't like the direction Google it's taking with the OS on the nexus 7, it looks more like a BIG Phone, instead a Small Tablet. That's the reason i put a Custom ROM in it. I want to use my tablet as a tablet and my phone as a phone. I like to have the dual-pane, that categorizes the tablet market, so after a lot of youtube's videos, and homing around the XDA forums, i did just that.Design:It's light, beautiful packaged and nice rubber-ish texture on the back. It's portable, it can fit in a back pocket in your jeans, but if you are going to use it without a cover, i would recommend getting a screen protector at least. Even though, it has corning glass protection, it is best to prevent for any unwanted scratches.I use this also for work. it's a great companion to take notes, record meetings, and show presentations. Also, as a market researcher, in my company we use an android app to conduct our surveys.Miscs:For me, this is the best 7\" tablet around. First, it's cheap. Secondly, top-of-the-line specs. Third, nice looking HD screen, watching movies or just surfing the web it's amazing. Also, playing games in this tablet it's great. I don't care if you are a hardcore gamer, or just some casual gamer that plays from time to time, it is awesome. There are so many reasons to buy this, for some the lack of a back camera may be a deal breaker, but for me, it wasn't. As i usually have my phone around, it doesn't affect me. Besides, you wouldn't look so sexy, holding your tablet in portrait mode to take a picture outside, while you are in the subway or in the street.Here are my two cents. i tried to make a compact and short review. There are so many things you can say about this device, for me it's the perfect size for all the things i just described above. If you are planning on getting one, go ahead, i'm pretty sure you won't regret it.I hope you like this review, i'll be coming with more updates to let you know other aspects of this tablet.Any comments or if you think i can help you with something, put it on the comments section, i'll reply as soon as possible.Update 11/05/2012:I just noticed the screen flickers a little bit when it's on a white page, most commonly on the browser (it's only noticeable if your brightness is set to low) and the WiFi it's getting data. I've search online and found out that is an issue with the WiFi position in the device. Nothing major though, as this only occurs if you have the brightness set to minimum and you are in a dark room. You just move the brightness to 30% - 40%, and it fix the issue.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "More than decent for the price", "Author": "Lisa Brinegar", "ReviewID": "R3565O1BTS8W6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only reason I am not rating this a 5 is lack of an SD slotI purchased this for my husband who is obsessed with Angry Birds - to the point I have to wrestle my phone from him to make a call.

I can't stand when people give this product a low rating because it has no slot for a micro sd card and/or no rear camera! Obviously if you read about this tablet you know that before purchasing so if that's a deal breaker for you, don't buy it! I wasn't concerned about having 16gb of storage, my smartphone has 16gb stroage and I have tons of musc, pics and apps and I still have almost 6gb free.

This makes the marked-up prices on Amazon look a lot more innocent. I strongly recommend you get the 16GB version, because the 8GB version leaves you with just over 5GB of usable storage.I've used MANY other 7\" tablets on the market. I've used tablets as cheap as Coby tablets Coby Kyros 7-Inch Android 4.0 4 GB 16:9 Capacitive Multi-Touchscreen Widescreen Internet Tablet with Built-In Camera, Black MID7042-4 and Idolian tablets Idolian TURBOTAB C8 (TM)- 7 inch, 1.5GHZ CPU, 5 Point Capacitive Touch Screen Tablet PC-Android 4.0, 512MB DDR3, 4GB with Google Market. I've used tablets from bigger names, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus 16GB (Dual Core, Universal Remote, WiFi) and the Acer Iconia A100 Acer Iconia TAB A100-07U08U 7-Inch Tablet (8GB). Of course I have also used the competing red-hot Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet.The Nexus 7 fits right in-between these budget tablets and high-end tablets in terms of price, but in terms of performance, it soars above all of them. As of August 2012, this is the best 7-inch tablet on the market of all of the ones I've used. It's way faster than any of the aforementioned tablets, it's more aesthetically pleasing, it has the best display of all of them, and it has by far the best internal specs. The first of its kind to be running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean, an OS that prioritizes user input to yield smoother animations, transitions, scrolling, and an overall \"buttery\" interface, it also comes with a very capable quad-core processor. You can really feel that the tablet is just quicker than most Android tablets out there, even in doing something as simple as pinching to zoom. It's very hard to go back to one of the older tablets once you've experienced the buttery feeling of Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7. As a point of reference to iOS users out there like me, this is, in my opinion, the first 7-inch tablet to feel as responsive as an iPad, something few tablets rival when it comes to user interface performance. No more hitching and juddering when switching home screens or scrolling through apps, no more laggy zooming and scrolling.The device is very comfortable for me to hold in one hand, and I enjoy reading books on it more than I do on my iPad 3, even with its Retina display. The text is still incredibly crisp on the Nexus 7, even though it's not quite Retina quality, and the white color of the pages is very neutral and easy on the eyes. It doesn't skimp on the beautiful page-turning animations, either! The weight is identical to a paperback book of similar dimensions, and the back makes for a good grip. It also, unlike so many other tablets, shows no fingerprints on the back. The Gorilla glass on the front of the device has not scratched even remotely, even with keys and coins in my cargo pocket. The tablet feels rugged, yet not overly heavy.The one thing I miss from other tablets when using this one is the microSD expansion slots that so many Android tablets have. MicroSD was my preferred method of side-loading content and applications onto my devices because it saved me a USB port. However, this isn't a huge issue, as the Android file manager for Windows and Mac is actually very user-friendly and straight-forward to use. 16GB is enough for me (actual available storage is about 13.4 GB), as I use Google Play Music in the cloud for the vast majority of my listening, stream movies from my laptop using doubleTwist, and mostly read ebooks and surf the web. However, these are only my needs, and they worked out for me. If you are a media content packrat who needs to have all of their media on the go, this tablet is DEFINITELY not for you. If you can consolidate and bring only the stuff you know you need, this is perfect.Do note that this device has no rear-facing camera, and that the front-facing camera cannot take still shots.Google Now is fantastic. I hope this comes to more devices soon, because I would argue that it outdoes Siri in many, many ways.Battery life is a comfortable 8 hours doing a lot of different tasks with WiFi enabled and near-maximum brightness.My only complaint about the device is that when using headphones, a very, very faint buzzing can sometimes be heard when manipulating the screen. Turning off screen sounds in settings made it better, but sometimes it comes back.For the price, you can't go wrong with this tablet. This is, while affordable, in no means a budget tablet like the Coby Kyros or IdolPads. Those tablets have lower-quality displays, bulky designs, and often don't support many applications. Some of them have stretched, distorted pixels, and others aren't as responsive to touch. With the Nexus 7, you don't have to worry about any of that. The out-of-box experience is comparable to that of an Apple product, in which the darn thing \"just works\". Kudos, Google.

Most of that applies to this one as well.Full Disclosure:-----------------Let me state upfront that in the last 3 years, my wife and I have purchased 4 iPhones, 4 iPads, 1 Mac Mini, 1 Apple TV and 2 Macbook Airs for ourselves and extended members of the family. I cannot review this product without comparing it to the iPad 2, which I've been using for the last year and a half.Motivation:------------We have an 18 month old son who needs to be entertained with videos and apps while he's being fed and we have an upcoming trip to India during which we'll need to keep him busy during the flight and transits. Here are our requirements -1) We needed a tablet that is more portable than the 16 GB iPad 2 that we currently have so that it's easy to stuff into my cargo pants or jacket and pull it out quickly when required.2) We needed more than the 16GB storage to store his favorite videos because we may have intermittent access to WiFi, at least 32 GB.3) When he's not using it, I would like a tablet that's easy to grip for long hours of reading.Choice:--------Based on these 3 requirements, I restricted my choice to the iPad Mini, Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 32GB.Here are the reasons I decided to go with the Nexus 7.The 32 GB iPad Mini was almost $195 ((429 - 249) * 1.0825) more than the other 2 when you include CA state taxes. It is at least half an inch wider than the Nexus 7 which makes it slightly harder to grip if you have small hands like me. The areas where it's better - slightly bigger screen, iOS app store, rear camera were not that important to me since we already have an iPad 2 and I don't take photos with tablets.I chose Nexus 7 over Kindle Fire because I use a lot of Google services and wanted a tablet with a more open ecosystem. I can read Kindle e-books and listen to music using the Amazon Cloud Player on the Nexus 7. We have a Netflix subscription so the loss of Amazon Instant Video was not that important.Review:---------Here are the things that I liked about the Nexus 7 -1) Jelly Bean (4.1) is really good. I had played with Android phones and tablets before and they used to lack the smoothness of iOS. I think it's pretty close now.2) The higher resolution HD screen is great for reading and watching videos.3) If you are heavily into the Google ecosystem, it's a breeze to set it up.4) Android in general is more customizable with widgets etc.5) I was able to download most of the iOS apps that I use frequently with some exceptions. More on that later.6) I liked the auto-update feature on Android. It's an option that you can tick while downloading an app. It automatically downloads updates to that app.7) I liked the notification system and realized why iOS decided to replicate it.8) I also liked the shortcut for looking at running apps and a simple flick deletes them.9) It is easier for my son to hold compared to the iPad 2. He also has a habit of pressing the home button and exiting the app on the iPad 2 and then complaining about it (he's only 18 months old) but fortunately he can't do that on the Nexus 7.Here are the things that I thought were missing -1) There are fewer tablet optimized apps on Android. The quality of apps on iOS for iPad is definitely better. Flipboard was good on Nexus 7 but Zite lacked the polish of the iPad app. NYTimes was good. The usual games like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope were more unstable and crashed a few times. I installed Talkatone to make calls through Google Voice and it worked fine. The usual ones - Netflix, Skype, etc. worked fine. I noticed some lag while using Zinio to read the National Geographic.2) I'm still not used to the Chrome browser on a tablet. It seemed to me that accessing bookmarks on the iOS browser is easier. I found all my bookmarks already synced on my Chrome browser but accessing them requires multiple steps.3) It is slightly heavier than the iPad Mini but not by a lot. The iPad Mini is still ahead in terms of external design and looks but the cost mattered more to me this time. I may have paid $100 more for the iPad Mini because of the iOS app ecosystem advantage but $195 was a very high premium for an optional device.Conclusion:-------------The Nexus 7 is an excellent device irrespective of the price but the price makes it easier to appreciate it even more.

I bought a Nexus 7 instead and, while I liked my Fire, I prefer the Nexus 7 in ALMOST every way. Below are some comparisons I've made between the two devices. Which one you end up with largely depends on what you want the device for, but here are some considerations.Android versus Kind-of-Android: As my Fire review attests, I took to Amazon's heavily 'skinned' Android more than I thought I would. But with the Nexus 7, you get Android Ice Cream Sandwich in all of its fullness. The Kindle Fire is the easier to navigate device, as the homescreen is basically a carousel of recent items and a list of categories (apps, books, games, movies, web) that you can select. But the Nexus 7's Android is fully customizable with the traditional five home screens you can use to place apps, widgets, bookmarks, and the like. Full Android takes some learning (ICS is more intuitive than prior releases, though), but if you want customization, Nexus beats Fire. I should also mention the internet browsers. With the Kindles, you get Amazon Silk, a fairly slow browser (yes, it markets as fast, but it is slow by every measure) whose biggest selling point is text-rendering. With Nexus, the default browser is Chrome, but there are some other great tablet-optimized browswers like Puffin and Dolphin; while none of them have text-rendering like Silk, a few are flash-enabled, allow private browsing, and some other stuff that Silk does not allow.Reading, Listening, and Watching: I use my tablet largely as a media consumption device, and toward that end, Amazon is second to none. Those of us locked into Amazon's ecosystem of books, movies, and music will do well with the Fire and its integration into the Amazon universe. Buy a book or album, it shows up on your device (or your cloud). Have Prime? It is easy to stream Prime videos straight to your device. But here's the thing: you can do a lot of this (except for streaming video) on the Nexus, as Amazon's apps are freely available on the Play market. The two things you will (kind of) give up are the robustness of the kindle ebook reading experience (text-to-speech, for instance, is only available on kindle devices) and streaming Prime movies. Of course, I said \"kind-of\" give up because you CAN stream prime movies on the Nexus 7 via a few Flash enabled browsers that you can find by doing a web search. Oh, and as far as ereading apps, you are not locked into any one provider on the Nexus: Google Boooks, Nook, Sony Reader, Mantano Reader, Aldiko - it is all easily available on the Play market (where with the Fire, you have to go through a fairly tedious sideload process).Tablet Hardware: Okay, here, the Nexus 7 is the CLEAR winner. In honesty, the Fire and Fire HD just strike me as somewhat cheaply made (and the Fire is just bulky). The Nexus is not only an inexpensive tablet, but a really pretty and solid-feeling one as well. It is lighter than the Fire (by a lot) and HD (by a noticeable little). The screen is just better on the Nexus than the HD (even though the specs are roughly the same), and the Nexus is DEFINITELY faster than either the Fire or HD. The two areas where I think the Kindle does have the advantage hardware-wise are that the side bezels are thicker (more room for your thumb to grip the front of the device in portrait mode), and the speakers (Fire and HD have stereo speakers that are very good quality, while Nexus has one speaker that is light and tinny).What each has that the other doesn't: The Nexus is more of a serious tablet than the Fire. It has features like Google voice search (like Appple's Siri, but more polished), Google Now (sort of a personal planner), and GPS. None of these are available on the Kindle Fire.On the other hand, the Fire and HD are great media consumption devices: on the devices, you get text-to-speech for most kindle books, whyspersync (where you can buy the book and audio book combo and have the kindle sync them so that you can switch between the two), and streaming of Prime video (per above, a big awkward on the Nexus). While not particularly a feature of the Fire or HD, I should mention that Amazon has phenomenal customer service for these devices, while Nexus customer support is spotty.Really, it comes down to what you want. As you can see, both devices have features the other does not have, but for my money, I still prefer the Nexus on balance. It is a more solid tablet (remember, my Fire HD's hardware encountered problems, which isn't normal, but it isn't abnormal). And it is a tablet that, unlike the Fire and HD, do not seek to lock you into one content provider. If it is available on the Play market, I can get it. And the Nexus's Google Voice and Google Now features are surprisingly helpful.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Item, Don't buy from KayKay Jakestore if they fulfill order...

I know that there are people who will adamantly disagree with me for different reasons, but for me this is it. What I want in a tablet is something that I can use for e-reading, web browsing, e-mail checking and game playing. Lots of devices can do these things, but none of them can do it better than Google and Asus' Nexus 7.The size of the tablet is what appealed to me in the first place. I had owned an iPad 2 before, and while I liked it and appreciated it for all it could do, it was simply too big for me to comfortably hold in one hand while I was riding on the bus or sitting at home. When I want to read a magazine, comic book or book, I want something that I can hold in one hand for long periods of time. While the Nexus 7 isn't a light as a Kindle, it is extremely easy to hold in one hand. This is partially due to the size and weight, but also, perhaps almost equally due to the fantastic build quality and materials. The back of the device, as has been mentioned many times over, is rubbery/leathery and just feels good and is nicely textured and there is almost no risk of accidental slips.The speed of the device is one of the reasons why I was so attracted to getting it in the first place. I have a mid-range Android phone and a mid-range laptop, and for once I wanted something that could do everything snappy, zippy and just...well, fast. The Nexus 7 does that in spades and then has some oomph left over for multitasking unlike any Android device I've ever used, including the Samsung Galaxy S3.Video quality is superb and it streams HD-quality movies from sources like Netflix, as well as all the movies and TV shows I have on my home server, which I stream via Plex and watch on the Plex app. Loading books and comics and everything else I could think of was just a matter of creating a folder and dragging and dropping. The open Android market, compared to other ecosystems, has a player and an app for almost any file format you can think of, and the Nexus 7 makes reading PDF's, e-books and magazines a quick, painless and beautiful affair.Gaming on the Nexus 7 is also fantastic. I have installed several games from the Tegra Zone, just to test out the graphics, and they are unlike anything you've seen, except, save the current generation iPad (and, even then I would argue that they are equal).The thing I love most about Android -- specifically after Ice Cream Sandwich, and even more so with Jelly Bean -- is the widgets. I don't like having countless apps clog up my home screens. That's what an app drawer is for. On my Nexus 7 I have apps on two pages -- the first, main home screen and a screen dedicated to games. The rest of the pages, including most of the first home screen, is dedicated to widgets. I use widgets for Gmail, Google Now, Google Keep, Evernote, Drive, Calendar, Twitter/Facebook, Google Currents, Pulse News and several more. They make opening apps unnecessary at times, and display the information I need to know without jumping between apps.This device gets my highest recommendation, and the only reason it is not 5 stars is because I had an issue with build quality in a previous Nexus 7, and had to get a return/exchange on it -- though this was not the fault of Amazon, and I believe was just due to the individual seller I purchased from.Get one now, and enjoy everything a tablet should be.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "RMH", "ReviewID": "R3OKUH0620O46U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been on the fence about tablets for awhile, but always kept a close eye on the Fire since it came out last year.  As an early adopter of Google's Nexus devices (I still use my Nexus One phone, although as a travel phone now), I was impressed in the \"bare bones\" Android operating system and its flexibility to do what I want it to do, not what the hardware provider wants me to see.Two points that I would give to anyone looking at this tablet, since, like me, I assume people read these things to see whats wrong with a product:1) There is not a native rotation control in the operating system.  I have found several apps in the Play store to give this control, some free, but the best was $2.99 for life.  I'm sure that this oversight will be corrected at some point in the development and my $2.99 app will be worthless, but, hey, its $3 and I haven't found much else out there that I need to pay for (great thing about the Play store, most apps are free if you don't mind stupid advertising).2) There is no mobile data available, but I use the Bluetooth tethering from my phone (HTC One S) and get great connection.  It depends of course on your data plan, but my T-Mobile plan has free tethering and unlimited data (although capped on 4G).

After Apple released the iPad mini, I became interested in tablets again only to find out that the mini has a lower resolution screen, no GPS, and outdated hardware. I read a review mentioning the Nexus 7 so I did a little research. High resolution screen, GPS, fast processor, lots of good reviews, and $80 cheaper than the iPad Mini.

I did not buy it from Amazon though, the price is about $17 higher here than other places, just a heads up.The packaging is professional and apple-esque, first impression of the tablet is that it looked like a giant iPhone 3G.

Coming from iOS and never using Android before, it took me about 5 minutes to learn how to use it. Everything runs buttery smooth, no lag like other tablets I played with. As with any new device, first thing I did was search for applications. The Google Play store is NOT as large as the App Store, but it has all of the most popular apps. Coming from the brain washed iOS ecosystem, I didn't immediately realize I could install apps from outside sources. That is a huge plus! I dug a little further and wanted to transfer some music from my Macbook to the N7. No problem, it is USB right? Wrong. Of course, Apple does not recognize the N7 so you need to use Android File Transfer to move files around. Small inconvenience, but MUCH easier than iTunes sycning BS. Then I discovered Airdroid. Hands down it is the most useful app, it is essentially a browser based tablet manager. It even allows you to install applications from outside sources. Apple would never allow that! At this point it feels like spending the night at your friends house whose awesome parents don't care if you stay up past your bed time or don't finish all of your vegetables.At this point, I am convinced I will never buy another iOS device again. The ability to do simple things such as send/receive files over Bluetooth without a jailbreak, fully customize the user interface, or even move my app icons into a non grid pattern make me feel like I just turned 18 again. What else can it do? I was able to install Google Voice, connect it to my iPhone and now I have the ability to text using my Sprint phone number. I installed Dropbox, got another 500mb of storage for free and then discovered you can upload files - in iOS, you have to have the creepy geotagging feature enabled on the camera app to upload only certain things to Dropbox. In short, there is a lot more you can do with the N7 than any iOS based device. Even simple things like having live wallpapers makes the experience much more enjoyable.The battery life is also great. I have used it for about 6 hours now and I still have 25% battery life left. Charging does take a while though and it charges best with a short cable. It's the only real annoying thing about the tablet but it does have a huge battery.Now, things I don't like about it. There are not any pretty keyboards like the smart cover on the Surface or iPad and cases in general for the N7 seem to be all plain faux leather portfolio type. I don't see a lot of docking accessories like the iPad has but that isn't a deal breaker for me. The speaker is also pretty weak. It is on the back and faces away which is a little awkward but it gets the job done for the most part. I would use headphones to watch a movie with it though. The camera is also junk to be honest. It is good for skype and that is about it. You need a 3rd party app to record or take pictures. But the GPS and NFC both make up for those short comings.I am very happy with the Nexus 7, it is small enough to fill the gap between laptop and smart phone but not try to replace either. The price is right and the quality is great. In fact, running Android has made me a full convert from iOS. It also makes a great navigation aid in the car!Edit: I have been using the tablet daily since I have got it. When I switch back to my $1600 3.4ghz i7 based gaming machine, it feels clunky and slow. It sounds weird but you don't realize how much time you spend moving the mouse around to click stuff. Being able to just tap it makes web browsing much faster. Coming from iOS, it takes a while to get used to the keyboard. In fact, I found the stock keyboard infuriating so I replaced it with Swift Key 3. The more you use it, the better it gets. It eventually gets to the point where it will predict chunks of sentences. Another minor irritating thing is Gmail and the stock Email application. While it is quick, they do not allow you to view mail full screen. A chunk of the tabs take up 1/3 of the screen in land scape mode so you need to move the message around to read it. It's nothing a software update can fix though.As of right now, I have the N7 in my car tethered to my iPhone for internet and the N7 connects to my car's stereo and OBD2 port with bluetooth. It provides navigation, lets me listen to Pandora or my own music, and Torque Pro gives me a read out of everything from MPG to fluid temperatures. It is nearly impossible to get that same functionality out of an iPad mini and an iPhone that isn't jailbroken.I have not had buyers remorse after getting this tablet. I did return my 16gb version and got the 32gb right after it came out though. As my review title says, it fills a gap I never knew was there. Being able to use it to do everything from playing Angry Birds to car diagnostics with intuitive simplicity has made me a convert to Android.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than most 7\" tablets", "Author": "The Great King \"Louaa\"", "ReviewID": "RWKHK38OAEJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will be frank with this review, I am not going to repeat what others have said in their reviews about this tablet.  Me too, have had just about every tablet that has benn made in the last two years. For me this 7\" tablet represents portability.  I can stick it in my Cargo Pants lower pocket when traveling.  I use it mainly for checking my emails, and to browse the internet to get air tickets, rent a car and hotels, not to mention extensive search for restaurants and points of interest using Google Map. I use it a lot to get my hotel room from priceline.  So, I am able to log on from almost any WiFi location.That said:  My 16gb storage is plenty for me, the screen is sharp.  Although I keep the brightness around 50%, and use the Android App Killer all the time, I don't see the battery lasting more than8-9 hrs.  As a matter of fact the first hour of use, it kills about 1/3 battery energy.  I guess the percentage shown is just theoretical, as it is dependant on accuracy of the microchip.  Then depending how I use it thereafter.  Normally cruising the net, checking emails, playing a couple of games for 1-2 hrs. It will last another 6-7 hrs.WiFi, I get pretty decent connection, but just like with my Toshiba Thrive or with the IPad.  Incidentally, I would never compare this with the IPad 2 or 3.  At home I use a Lynksis E3000 router which has proven to work very well with all my computers and tablets, coupled with high speed internet cable, I have no complaints.

This is not a dedicated music player, not a laptop, and not a camera. It's a tablet, thankfully not one made by Apple. Since my first iPod (coincidentally Apple's first, too) I have been extremely disappointed with Apple products. Aesthetics are not representative of capability. It amazes me that the Nexus 7 draws comparisons to tablets costing several hundred dollars more and outshines them in every regard. Seeing all of the Apple fanboy comments here makes me chuckle, but the sad truth is that this tablet should be five stars across the board. I wonder when society willl embrace function over form. You can root your Android device without paying someone else, and you can do anything the OS is capable of. Even without rooting, ICS is outstanding.Last thing I want to address is the ridiculous complaints I have read in some of these reviews about the lack of a rear- facing camera. Seriously? If I want to take pictures with something bigger than my phone, do you know what I use? A CAMERA. No cell phone or tablet has the capabilities to rival my camera, and they never will. You can't beat quality optics, especially with the tiny image sensor inherent on compact devices.On the whole, coupled to a cheap bluetooth keyboard, this tablet is ideal for a range of processes when a laptop is too bulky or boring.

I have owned this tablet since September, and I have had escalating issues with charging the tablet.  First, the charging cable would not sit securely when it connected to the micro-usb port.  It would fall out frequently and I would have to position the tablet at an angle with objects supporting the cord to keep it charging.  An annoyance, but not a deal breaker.  I thought it might be due to the tapering of the edges (which I like) and the fact that unlike my other micro-usb devices the port is upside down (the wide part of the charging cable's metal connector goes in at the top instead of the bottom). The tapering edges provide less surface for the charger to \"brace\" itself against the device and the upside down port means that others (my family members), by habit, would initially try and insert the cable connector in the wrong way. There was no evidence of damage in the first two weeks before they learned to adapt, but this could accelerate normal wear and tear for those not paying attention -- again, an annoyance but not a big deal.Then, as I was plugging the charging cable into the device my son bumped my arm, and just this small action caused the metal housing surrounding the inside of the m-usb port to bend (I caught the charger on the outside lip of the port).  The inside of the charging port has a metal sheet that is split at the bottom (you can see the issue here [...] -- it is suppose to lay flat and be seamless, but it is very easily bent.  Charging became somewhat trickier but it still wasn't a huge issue.But then the contact pins on the interior of the m-usb started to crumble! I was having issues at the beginning of December where it would just not charge, and when I inspected the port again, I noticed some of the pins were longer than the others. I have to use my tablet almost every day for school, and although it holds a charge for a fairly long time (at first it was 12 hours, then more like 8, then sometimes more like 4)it still needs to be charged at least once a day.  The tablet began to only charge erratically, and now it does not charge at all.  After less than six months of normal daily usage.I did not buy this tablet through Amazon but rather through Google, and the return/exchange process seems grim.

The screen is nice, 16GB storage is plenty (about 13GB actually free), it's light, and it has clean lines.  The back has a rubberized & dimpled texture that helps gripping it.

No ridiculous effects, just subtle transitions that unless you really pay attention, you won't notice them and that's a good thing. The OS shouldn't be distracting. It should complement the user experience. So I guess this would fall under project butter.>Con: browser pages don't always render smoothly. Scrolling can be slow and jerky. Even scrolling from home page to home page is not very sensitive.>Multitasking Very convenient to use the task manager soft button on the bottom. It allows me to easier switch from one app to another. The apps have small thumbnails and are either in a vertical or horizontal list depending on tablet orientation. Flick the thumbnails to get rid of the apps. Very easy to use.>Con: still can't have like to apps running side by side. Split screen with two apps on the screen together doesn't work. You can't re size windows.>Chrome I think this is a feature of chrome. It might be, I'm not sure. There is a feature when if you want to click on a hyperlink and there are hyperlinks in close proximity, to prevent you from clicking on the wrong one unintentionally, a small popup will show the area magnified so that you can click on your link easier. It's convenient and really considerate.>Con: I'm not sure if this is a fault, but more of an inconvenience. Even though this is a tablet, I really want to use this as a replacement for my dead laptop. So therefore, when I use it to browse the web, I want it to be accepted as a desktop instead of a mobile device. I can't remember which site I was on, but I wanted to complete a task on my Nexus 7 but the website said that I have to use my desktop to complete the action. I'm not sure if there's a work around for this, but it's happened a few times.>Battery Life Wow. The Nexus 7 has better battery life than my dead Asus EEE PC HE1000 netbook and that was a champ in battery life, too. I haven't had a chance to run down the battery but I can estimate that it'll at least last for 8 hours. I even have a live wall paper running in the back ground, with wifi on always and GPS. Screen brightness at about 50%. Very cool.Con: I believe it uses a microUSB port which doesn't seem to be compatible with any of my old power cords haha. I usually have pretty good luck with using old phone power cords with my new ones as back ups or on trips. However, the Nexus 7 won't work with my HTC Rezound cord, which sucks because the cord is about 3 feet long! The charging cord for the Nexus 7 is a little shorter than I would like it to be.>Sharing It seems like whatever app I'm using, whether it's a photo app, the browser, Evernote, Gmail, etc. I have a ton of options to share my data. Cloud storage is easily accessible. Mostly everything works together seamlessly. Notifications are instantaneous. Uploading Evernote data takes seconds. It's just a very fast, connected device.>Cons: USB drives are not compatible with On The Go OTG adapters unless you root the device. I'm not terribly confident in my rooting abilities, probably due to my failures to root the Droid X I have. You can use a wireless key board and mouse without rooting. Just need the OTG adapter.>Voice Search It has come a long way. It worked about 50% of the time on my Droid X. It faired a little better with my Rezound. Then when the Rezound got updated to Ice Cream Sandwich, it improved greatly. With Jelly Bean, it's a joy to use. Even with my Western New York nasally accent, the voice recognition software gets me right nearly all the time. The only problem is I forget what I wanted to search in the first place I get nervous and I turn it off haha. I just voice searched Museums in Buffalo, New York and up came a \"card\" with a small google map of all of the museums in the area and a lettered list of the seven most popular museums in Buffalo. Then if you scroll down a bit, you get a regular google search results page. I'm sure if I lived in a larger city, it would be more useful to me in regards to metro schedules and traffic information.>Con: Google Now This feature will be AMAZING in a year or two. Right now, it's in it's infancy. Google Now is supposed to learn more about you and provide you with pertinent information on the go instantly and depending on your situation. It would probably work better with a phone that has mobile data. Also, it prides itself on giving you an audio answer of a sports score for your favorite team. It works for the Yankees but not the Buffalo Bills. I suppose that means my team needs to be more relevant!>Display Nice display. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. Imagine it with a pentile display! That would have sucked. The touchscreen is responsive enough for me. Widgets look good on it. I like how the soft keys dim out when reading an Ebook (they change into a very small black dot, so they dont completely disappear, they just become less noticeable). The soft keys rotate with the screen, which is nice. The soft keys are3 responsive.>Con I sometimes get a black vertical line flash on my screen, especially when reading something on a static page for sometime, with a white background.

Good tactile feel to them.No HDMI port out. Thats a shame because it plays netflix movies and shows very nicely.I prefer a vertical scrolling app drawer to the horizontal app drawer on the Nexus 7. I could use a third party home screen launcher to change that, though. i also miss being able to access widgets by long pressing on the screen. cant do that on the Nexus 7.it locks onto WiFi quickly. havent used bluetooth yet. it also has NFC, ahvent used that yet, either.I'll add more as I use it more!", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet!", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "RBT60P5S9WZA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've watched Apple release their tablets as well as many many others have but once I heard Google announce the Nexus 7 I preordered immediately after I saw the I/O demonstration.

Scalia \"Straygull\"", "ReviewID": "R2979VQX2X4K28", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's my only option for passing on some kind of warning about the seller from whom I ordered this tablet. AND YOU NEED TO KNOW!THE FOLLOWING IS ABOUT SELLER johaire13.PLEASE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THIS BEFORE DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS GUY!First you should know I've done A LOT of shoping on Amazon over the years and I can't remember EVER leaving feedback before, but I owe it to everyone else to give a warning about this seller!  I ordered on the 15th of August, and while Amazon gave a delivery estimate of 22 August to 09 September, in my experience it is extremely rare for a package to take that long. Alright, I just realized I should skip some little details here, because I admit to being pretty talkative anyway and I really want you to read this - for your own sake.  So, on to the most convincing details!I DON'T BELIEVE THIS SELLER EVER SHIPPED ANYTHING TO ME.  The amazon on-line invoice said my order was shipped Fedex, so when a little more than a week had passed with no package, I asked the seller for a tracking number.  The answer came back that it was shipped USPS and that he didn't \"use tracking numbers,\" but that he did insure his shipments.  I called the post office to be sure I had this right, and they confirmed that anytime an item is insured with them, that they assign a number to that item, and that one can get online with that number and see a status (like when it was mailled and whether they show it as having been delivered or not.)So, I contacted the seller agian and asked for the insurance number, explaining what the post office told me.  His response didn't even mention my requist for the number, instead he said he had called the post office and was told the package \"will be delvered on Friday\" (this was on a Wednesday).  This seemed pretty fishy to me because I don't believe the post office ever makes statements like that, giving a specific day for delivery, unless it's a special class of mail, like overnight delivery, and considering that he was telling me this rather than even mentioning my request for the insurance number.As I write this (on the 10th of September) I still have no delivery, and when I contacted the seller today I asked again for the number, fully explaining that I questioned if he'd even sent me a package, and that I wanted the number so that I could confirm for myself if he had done so or not.  Just like the time before, he responded without even mentioning my request for the number, and this was in spite of my telling him that I would explain in my feedback about this extremely negative experience with him and his failure to provide the number.So, now I've contacted Amazon about all of this, and was told they will file an A to Z claim, and be certain I get my money back. Still, like I said to them, this guy has gotten a free loan for a month, and caused me considerable hassle. (I wanted this tablet to replace one I'd dropped, and which I use to run chart plotting software for my boat - and for a boat trip that I delayed twice while waiting for this replacemet to be delivered.)Well, I'm glad for your sake that you've read this far.  You needed to know!  I sure as h&*% won't be ordering from this seller again, and I strongly advise anyone else considering it, to find another source!!  This has spoiled my long standing positive record with Amazon, but I'll try to remind myself that it's just one of the very many transactions that I've participated in on this website without anything but an occasional little issue that Amazon quickly made 100% right!Good shopping to you!", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great...at First", "Author": "D.

It was fast at booting up, loading apps, and doing everything else I threw at it.  But for the past 5 months I have been disappointed with the device for 2 major reasons.I don't know what has caused the first reason (my guess is a system update, the storage drive wearing out, and/or the various apps I have installed and uninstalled) but my nexus 7 is no longer the speed demon it was those first few months.  It takes FOREVER to boot now.  Most apps take FOREVER to load, especially big ones like Facebook, Angry Birds, and any podcasting app I throw at it.  It still plays videos well, whether streaming or on the device, and music playback is also fine regardless of the source.  Once an app loads, usually it runs them just fine, but some have a constant lag to them throughout my frustrating use of them. And for those smarta@$es, no I am not running 20+ apps at the same time (whether in the background or not).My 2nd reason for a 3 star review is that the battery has been acting funny lately.  It used to go from empty to full in 3 1/2 to 4 hrs.  I probably have been charging it 4-5 times a week for about 10 months.  The past 2-3 months, the battery has taken 8...10...12...once it even took 24+ hrs to charge.  I have tried turning it off while on the charger.  I have purchased 2 different 2amp 5v adapters (on top of using the original ac adapter and USB cable).  The first one I bought helped speed up the charge times in the beginning, but now all 3 chargers I have take at least 6-8 hours to bring the nexus to a full charge.  I have just purchased the Asus dock and that seems to be getting the charge times back to 4 hrs, so I think maybe the micro usb port on my nexus is messed up and my battery is maybe OK. And again for those smarta@$es, no I am not running an resources hogging app while I try charging my nexus 7, even though it used to charge just fine before while I used it.  Regardless of whether it is on or off, and whether I am using it or not, the charge time has increased dramaticallyThe battery life has decreased a bit too but I expect that to happen to rechargeable batteries, and the drop has not been extreme.I know electronic devices don't last forever, but they should work well for at least a couple years and my nexus 7 is not what it once was.  I have considered doing a factory reset but I really do not want to go through the process of re-installing all my favorite apps and retyping all my different log ins as well.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Andrew D.

Anniversary my wife surprised me with a Nexus 7 tablet as a gift. I am a big gadget geek, and even though I already have an iPad (3rd. Gen), I've been wanting an Android device to play with. I was a little worried about having a ASUS product, as a friend of mine was royalty screwed over by them on a Netbook he bought a few years back (sent in for warrantee service 6 times, and never fixed), but I figured that everyone deserves a second chance. After setting up the tablet, and working with it for a few hours, I fell in love.First thing I noticed, even before pressing the power button, is the over all build quality of this tablet. Although the case is plastic, it is very solid. The screen is very strong Corning Glass (not sure if it is Gorilla Glass or not) but as with my iPad it is flawless. After powering it up I found that the quad-core Tegra 3 processor is fast, and the 1280 x 800 screen is very crisp. The display is not up the quality of the Retina display on my iPad, but I have no complaints about its quality, after reading for over 2 hours my eyes didn't feel tired or strained in any way. Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) seems very responsive and quite functional. I had little problem in figuring out how to set-up, navigate and alter settings. The GooglePlay store seems to have a lot of apps available. I was very happy to find that HanDBase was available for Android. I use this database (lite) app on all my iOS devices and it is compatible all my files, which is quite helpful.I would have liked more memory as an option as I know that many Android devices can use SD cards as expansion, a feature that is not available on the Nexus 7 (which isn't that big of a deal, as I am used to it from iOS) and I don't plan on carrying around a lot of music or video (I have a Touch and iPad for that), but there is the option to stream your movies and music from Google. It seems to work quite well as I watched the free Transformers movie, and it played without a hitch.I have seen some complaints that a cellular version of the tablet isn't available, but since I use only Wi-Fi on all my devices, I really can't add anything to that. I do hope a future model adds it for people who need it, as the Nexus 7 is a really great option. Also speaking of Wi-Fi I was quite surprised  by the range of the Nexus. My iPad can see 4 wireless routers from my bedroom, but the Nexus detected 11. That's more than my Toshiba laptop can find!There isn't a rear facing camera, which I do miss from my Touch/iPad. Not that I use either as a camera (I have a Canon I use for that), but I do use them a lot as a barcode reader. The front camera is 1.2 megapixels, and the quality of it puts the one on my Apple devices to shame (I'm only talking about the front camera, the back camera on the iPad is far superior to this one).I thought the smaller size would be a disadvantage when switching between the Nexus 7 and iPad, but it really is a fair trade off, even though the screen is smaller, it is so much lighter and easier to hold (even one handed, that I wouldn't think of doing with my iPad).I believe that the Nexus 7 will become my take everywhere device. It's compact, light and it doesn't worry me as much to carry the less expansive equipment with me. It has twice the memory of my Touch (although I'm planning to upgrade to a 5th. Gen Touch since I found out it added a flash to the camera, and I want to try iOS 6 without upgrading my iPad with a possibly buggy upgrade). After working with the iPad, my Touch seems way too slow!Also Google gave a lot of extras including a handful of songs, magazines and even a movie (Transformers: Dark Of The Moon) plus $25 for use in their app store. All this for a tablet that cost only $250. I paid $700 for my iPad, and didn't receive anything at all extra.I haven't tried the NFC yet, as no stores in my area use it for POS, but I hope to soon. I don't see it replacing my debit card anytime soon, but I would still like to see how it works.The Nexus 7 is what I like to think of as my laptop tablet, where the iPad is my desktop tablet.I would easily recommend the Nexus 7 to anyone looking for a tablet.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "What's an iPad?", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Seeking truth...\"", "ReviewID": "R9J64HDIDYQWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife has an iPad 2nd gen.  After picking one of these up for me, tweaking it the way I wanted, and getting a nice case, I never touch the iPad.  I love my Nexus.  Seven inches is a great size (It's also a size that Steve Jobs called \"stupid\" ... go figure, now they're working on an iPad mini. Uh huh). I'm an IT guy, so I rooted it so I could stickmount a USB drive .. can't do that with an iPad.  It's proven invaluable on the job, when a client's computer is down & I need to download a patch or malware tool from the Net.  No need to carry a laptop anymore ... awesome.  Plus if you root it, Google Play will credit your account with $25 even if you didn't buy it direct from them .. that was a nice surprise!Battery life could be better (I get about 8-9 hours of hard use, connected to WiFi networks all day).  No biggie .. I'm used to plugging my in cellphone every night anyway. I just do the same with the Nexus.  And speaking of charging .. how great is it that Google / Asus went with Micro USB?  Meanwhile Apple's switching up proprietary connectors again (and nickel and diming the lemmings again).  Sigh.I have had no problems with the screen popping out of the bezel (though the fix is very easy to do).  No problems with screen flickering.  I find the saturation and contrast to be just fine (it's a 7\" tablet, not a 24\" HD flat panel).  Only problem I had is I ran the battery down to 4%, at which time the tablet automatically turned off (to not take the battery all the way to zero).  Plugged it into the micro USB cable I use for my cell .. there was a buzzing from the tablet for a few seconds .. and then it stopped.  I went to bed.  Seven hours later, the battery was only at 21%.  Yikes.  Thought I had a bad battery.There's some talk that the charger that comes with the tablet has a higher amperage (2A) than what you get with a lot of other micro USB chargers (many of which seem to be 1.5A), and that this makes a big difference in charging if you run the battery all the way down.  Could be, but I didn't really see much difference in charging speed. It just seems like that first 15-20% takes a long time if the battery's been run below 5%.  But there's also some question as to whether or not there might be firmware glitch here, because some reported that upon running their battery all the way down, they couldn't get the tablet to charge at all .. and they could't turn it back on.  Someone discovered that if you hold the power button in for longer than 30 seconds, the tablet will boot back up & charging resumes as normal.  Hmmm.  At any rate, if you run your battery down all the way, give this a try before you send your tablet back!

I will share what I learned, filtered of course through one person's perspective. Keep in mind that I am a tablet neophyte, and I would underscore that there are many many fine reviews here worth reading. It's just that a distinct pattern emerges as you plough through the reviews, and this review will hopefully distill some of that.Here is my decision tree on buying my very first tablet:A) The iPad is out. Three reasons;1) PRICE. Outside my budget, plus the models roll over so quickly it seems more prudent to go cheaper if possible and avoid the financial pain of upgrading to the next generation of must have features ;>. And it's hard to pass forking out for those new models when Apple has now dropped support for the original iPad, introduced all the way clear back in 2010.2) The Apple MAFIA (which some call the `ecosystem' or `club'), is the most tightly controlled of the three major platforms (Apple, Amazon, Android). Once you join the Apple mafia it's all Apple all the time. I just saw a documentary on companies that have spent mass quantities of dollars to develop an app which follows the tightly controlled App Store's guidelines, only to have Apple not approve the app for over two years, and not have the courtesy to even say why.3) One word: FOXCONN. When a company sources from a manufacturing facility that must string anti-suicide nets around the buildings to keep despondent employees from terminating their existence, while Apple at the same time makes enough money off the labor of those employees to be able to sock away 100 billion dollars in the bank, and send its stock to the moon... something is wrong. This is a very politically incorrect issue to raise these days, yet the simple truth is that cool iPhones, iPads and other Apple gadgets are making the lives of some people more comfortable at the expense of making others miserable. After seeing the videos (search Youtube on \"foxconn suicide nets\") I made a decision to not purchase from Apple until the human rights situation at its factories improves).B) The Kindle is out. Although Amazon employs the more open Android OS, since it uses a heavily modified older version of that OS, you are restricted on what apps you can use. It doesn't run all the Android apps. I want a more open solution. For example, I live in the boonies and my employer doesn't have Direct Deposit. Most of the big banks now have an app that let's you scan your check with your smartphone or tablet regardless of your location, and have the check instantly deposited in your account. My bank is due to implement an Android app for this service shorlty. Do I want to buy a Kindle and cross my fingers that the Android version of that app will run on a Kindle? Of course not. The latest Kindle Fire HD has a crippled GPS chip and USB port so you can't use it for localization or navigation, and you can't even plug an external GPS product (or many other USB based products) into the USB port. This is too bad because in other areas the Kindle Fire HD absolutely kicks butt on screen quality and on-board sound. :<C) This leaves [pure] Android. After ferreting through a handful of Android tablets the Nexus 7 emerged at the top of the \"value\" heap. Lots of features for the money! Just an awesome device for only $200-250.But the Nexus 7 doesn't look like its ready for prime time. Way way too many postings on quality control issues. And the postings don't appear to be tapering off as we get further from the initial release date. As of this November 2012 posting current reviews are still complaining about QC issues with the display glass.Given reports from users who have had to wrestle with ASUS customer service for weeks or months to get a working unit or a refund, it appears that the only prudent way to purchase a Nexus 7 today is to buy one from a brick and motor retailer, open it in the store, check carefully for signs of raised glass, noises when pressing on the glass, and dead pixels. Then take the unit home, charge and discharge several times over a few days to be sure it will take and hold a charge, use the UI heavily and watch for any signs of the glass moving after the screen warms up, or preemptively taking it apart and checking that the display screws are tightened. And do all this within the return period set by the retailer.If I really really wanted a Nexus 7 that bad I might jump through those hoops. But given the lack of an HDMI connector, crappy front facing camera, the absence of a rear facing camera (can you scan those bar codes at Target?), and mediocre on-board speakers, I am tempted to just hold out a while longer and see what the market brings forth over the next few months. And the horror stories regarding ASUS support is the final nail in the coffin.Btw - props to user \"DLC\" for his many posts offering helpful workarounds for other seemingly missing Nexus 7 features that are in fact not an issue if you know the work around (flash, GPS navigation with no WiFi signal, possible HDMI workaround, etc)UPDATE DEC 20th (the day before the world ends)I ended up buying a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\".

I'm giving this 4 stars due to reflecting on the fact that the time it has worked properly, it has been Very good.  Performance is everything great you read about this, great for apps, games, notes, etc. Fast and Powerful.  The screen has one of the best resolutions out there.  Clear, bright and you feel a good full 7 inches.The sole reason for wanting to 3 star this is the charging issue is as big and unfortunate as they say.  The charging port is poorly designed and shortens the lifespan of your machine.  There are videos on youtube and others can help some short term issues.  Such as, for whatever reason, a majority of the machines has an issue with the battery connector that becomes loose or already is not fastened tightly within the Nexus.  This will cause your battery to not charge properly.  You can send it back, or take the back panel off and just push it in. But this obviously comes with risk.  If you don't have the proper tools (had to order a plastic spudger) you can  crack the screen or worse.  But that's not the big issue.  The big issue is the design of the port WILL wear/round to the point where nothing you do will really help charge it.  That's where I am on my 2013 model.  The only thing to do is have that replaced, which will cost $100-$120 depending on where you take your device and labor.  It's no easy fix due to having to redesign and fit from the circuit board.While the Nexus works as it should (and has the past 7 months), it's the best cost efficient tablet out there.  The only other design flaw that keeps this from a 5 is the front facing camera and lack of back facing camera.  If you open the device, you can clearly see where there should've/could've been one, but wasn't put in for whatever reason.  So, the camera isn't really functional for taking shots of anything but selfies. 4 stars.  Clearly not 5.

A few months later, he said he had not used the Nexus at all, but it would no longer start, and the battery would not hold a charge.  It seemed to be both the video card and the battery that was malfunctioning.  In any case, months after buying it, it would not even start.  When my father was visiting, I called customer support, and was told they would replace it.  24 hours thereafter, they emailed to ask for the CSSN number with instructions on how to find it through the settings menu.  I wrote back to remind them that the device would not start and so could not find it through the settings ment, and my father had thrown out the original packaging. Another 24 hours later, they wrote back with the exact same email asking me to find the CSSN number through the settings menu.  I told them again that their machine was such a piece of crap, that it would not even start.  It was like a screaming at a brick wall.  Another 24 hours later, they Google wrote to ask me for the CSSN number again off the original packaging.  I don't think they were reading my email responses or listening to me at all.  I cannot say how frustrating it was.  After spending a half hour on the phone with their customer support again, they told me they would email the consultants that handle the emailing to see why they kept asking me for a CSSN number.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, and only then did they start to try to cooperate and break through the walls of beuracracy and send me the paper work to get a new device.  Even then it would take 21 days to get a new Nexus and they would put a hold on my credit card until I returned their malfunctioned Nexus.  I bought the Nexus because I was tired of always giving all my money to Apple, but instead I got a poor quality device, was not treated like a human and had to struggle to just get one that worked.  Apple would have made things right instantly, and it would not have been so poor quality to begin with.  DO NOT BUY IT.

I prefer it much more to skins from other oems that make android slower. Google made a great move when making this tablet. Though it isn't the thinnest, the lightest, or the fastest mini tablet there is, because its pure google, it can still run with almost no flaws. I regret the fact that google did not put a rear facing camera on this thing, since all the other mini tablets did, even the ones made by ASUS have them. If google wants this to be a worthy rival, they should try to match all the features of the other competing devices, namely the iPad Mini. Also, when google released the nexus 4 and the nexus 10, they gave them each 2GB of memory. But when the Nexus 7 was released, it only had 1GB, and that was a major letdown, because this had more screen real estate, more pixels, and more graphics pushing games. The nexus tries to make do with what it has though. battery life is ok. This tablet should have more battery life for how large, heavy, and thick it is, but its livable. I like the fact that the rear of this tablet has dimples which provide a grippable design for your fingers when holding it with one hand.

I am your average paid guy with a family of three in my late 20s. I have always been on top of technology, and I consider myself to know what an electronic is worth. I have been there since day one of the NES, the Internet, Android, Touchscreen, and day one of tablets. Being your average consumer I set out with my first paycheck of my new job to solve a problem finally. I needed a mobile device. I don't have a high end phone, and I wanted a solid and permanent solution to being able to browse the web, play games, and keep organized on the go. I have less than $300 to solve this. I'm looking at a netbook, a Nintendo DS, or a smartphone. The Nexus 7 has blown me away.  Please believe me when I tell you that there is no better tablet on Earth for this price range. As soon as you hold it, neigh, as soon as you take the top off and see it, you are warm with the excited glow and confidence that you have a superior and well built tablet for $200.  Spec-wise, this tablet is smashing the 7 inch form factor. Google is amazing for this tablet. It has an amazing screen that matches the quality of my first blue ray disks. The 1.3 gz processor and 1gb ram are top of the line June 2013. These specs are supposed to be OK n a $300-$400 tablet. This is an unbelievable break. Score one for Google by average Joe.  The build and feel are incredible. It reaks of quality. The weight is perfect to hold for hours. And the size is as perfect for a one hand fit as there ever will be. I can hold this in my hands for 10 hours comfortably.  The battery performs even BETTER than advertised. Make sure you cycle your battery properly when you first get it. Drain it to zero then fully charge without unplugging twice. Then never let it dip under forty. My Nexus 7 today lasted 10 hours and fifty minutes today with WiFi on and brightness full while playing Galaxy On Fire two the entire time.  The screen is as high definition as could ask for. The everything is a solid as I could ask for.  THIS IS THE BEST TABLET YOU CAN BUY FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS. There is no dispute. This tablet for this price is like Sony selling their PlayStation 2 for $199 at first launch. Its not just an amazing tablet for the price, its an amazing tablet.  CONS: The only things lacking are a back camera and SD expansion. I don't miss the non expandable storage yet. I have the 32gb and its been two months. All my pictures and games and movies only half fill my Nexus 32gb.  Bottom line, its very hard to impress me. I have never been impressed as I am with this value. This email is the first review I have ever written. I would be in the commercial for this product. Thank you Google, Thank you Asus. I will gladly answer any questions from a prospective buyer. Moralsandvirtue@gmail.com. I would recommend more highly than I recommend myself.  The ONLY thing I cannot speak from experience about that is important is customer service. I haven't had any reason to contact yet, which is a good thing. However if it sucks, we all know, could turn a great product into a terrible experience. I bought the three year warranty that includes drops and screen cracks for thirty bucks at Wal-Mart. I would be dumb to not take that. Word of common sense: your screen WILL break sometime within THREE YEARS. And with free shipping included for when it does happen, make the right choice.

Yes, a full 8 weeks all due to a defect right from the factory.The replacement they sent had issues with responding to touch from the day I got it.  Several reboots would usually fix it, but still, very annoying for a supposedly brand new and highly rated product.  Calling customer service was useless.  \"Did you do a hard reset, ma'am?\" Yes, I did.  I told you that at the beginning of the conversation.  \"Have you tried shutting it off?\"  That's about the helpfulness of the support team.  The last conversation I had with them, the representative sounded as though he dropped the phone several times and would pick it up again and say \"hello? are you there?\" Um, I dunno, are you all there?  Worse experience ever and I have called a lot of techs to fix a variety of products (anyone remember the living nightmare of Windows ME?  Yeah....)  The replacement tablet is now completely unusable due to a boot loop issue that happened after I completely drained the battery by leaving the device on standby.

The 16GB version of the Nexus was $200 (don't buy from Amazon) versus the Ipad Mini charging $330 for what seemed like (from a technical standpoint) a less inferior product, between the missing retina display, the dual core processor and only 512MB Ram (seriously, why does apple cheap out on this spec, it is much needed with today's apps being so demanding on RAM). For $330 I did not want something that was already basically out of date with the specs of the Ipad 2.Which brings me to the Nexus 7I was really worried about learning a new OS, especially knowing IOS (jailbroken) inside and out however, too my surprise I learned it very fast and actually REALLY like it! There are many features that I wonder why they are not in IOS and the speed of this device is phenomenal. So far I am seeing far less \"hicups\" and force closes as I do on my Iphone 4s.The few cons that i see with this device (not even cons that are worth lowering the score, but thought I would mention)-The light sensor seems to flicker from bright to dim in some lighting situations (not a big deal to me, could just be the weird lighting in my house.-Auto rotation seems very touchy at times (my Iphone has this same problem, half the time I have it off)-Power button would be better on top, like most other devices (this is probably just a personal preference coming from IOS devices)-Built in speaker sounds very flatWith all that said this really is a 5 star product in my mind and the best values out there in 7\" tablets, I highly recommend this!", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "You'll love it - but be sure you realize what it doesn't come with...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3W16IO994HQ0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet.

That being sad...- The front camera on the device is not so great - the picture quality lacks a lot.- There's no back camera at all, which would've been nice to compete with many other tablets out there- The headphone jack DOES NOT include microphone capability - don't expect to use this with a headset for Skype AND you cannot use this tablet with Square or any other credit card reader that uses the headphone.- The WiFi gets wonky sometimes for no reason - just stops working and you have to turn it off and back on - this is rare, but it's happened to me at least twice in the 4 months I've owned it.- Probably because of the new Jelly Bean OS, there are several apps that are compatible with your old Android phone which ARE NOT compatible with this device - for instance, I can't even download the Discover Card or American Express account apps.

Before even touching the spec sheet on it, it just feels like a wonderfully made device. The slight curves of the edges make it feel much thinner. The large bezel is great because it allows a good grip on it without touching the screen. The texture on the back gives it good grip, and feels wonderful.  I did not buy my N7 new, I bought it from my friend. Therefore, there are a couple problems with it that I cannot say for sure if they are actual defects or whatnot. The back plate or whatever you want to call it feels kind of flimsy near the top. When pressing down on the top edge, you can hear some creaking. Not a big issue. Another problem with the back is that there is a ridge along the left side edge. It feels as if the back is misaligned, and it kind of scrapes the hand. However, it is not major. The biggest flaw in it, is that there is a dead pixel which I know for a fact is a defect because it was there when my friend bought it brand new. So this is an issue I would keep in mind. That is all for any flaws. Time to move onto the experience using it.  I never used it running a stock ROM, so you might have to take this with a few grains of salt. The experience with it for the past 2 months has been wonderful. Android runs smooth as butter, Google now is a siri-killer, and Jellybean overall is just amazing. The 16 GB is more than enough space if you are using Google music to store all your music. If you plan on gaming and storing music, you may have a bit of trouble with running out of space. But apart from the small space, its beautiful.  The internet browsing is phenomenal, its great for shopping, reading news, checking sports scores, whatever you throw at it. Its great for checking Facebook or Google+ (if you are one of the few people who do), and Skype calls are good enough quality that the other person won't be asking you if you are melting. Front camera isn't anything special but its not a deal breaker either.  Now I am an app hoarder and I have something close to 100 apps at a time, so there is a bit of a slowdown with that much going on. However, with the normal load of apps and games, it runs beautifully. Games run better than Usain Bolt with rocket shoes. I've seen no more than a few screen stutters or lags. You can send your compliments to the tegra 3 packed in there.  Overall, if you are just a casual user of a laptop, you probably will have very little need for it with this tablet around.

That is, for my needs. Carrying around a 10\" iPad is just too much, this thing can slide into a back pocket. While it's not the way I would carry it for the day, lol, but from the car to the football field or hockey rink it's perfect. I'm the treasurer for the fire dept. assoc. and use several spreadsheets all the time to keep track of the money. While a 10\" screen would be nicer to view them on, this works pretty good. If I was looking for a tab for heavy work use, this would not be the one. But for someone who does not need one, but only wants the convenience of a quick portable device for general use, this is perfect. Works well as a reader weather using the Kindle app or the Play books reader. One negative for Google Books, is that you can't upload a book you \"own\" to it.  Kindle allows you to upload books in the  .mobi format that work well.  Does browsing fast. Typing on it is smooth for emails or even slightly longer text entry. Has bluetooth if you choose to get a BT keyboard for travel or something.  Seen a couple in action and they work well.I use it more now than my laptop at work, or even around the house for email, facebook, or looking up quick stuff. At this pricepoint I think it is a perfect solution for those that are not looking for a powerhouse, but more than a no name entry tab they could do without. I could see in not so many years to come, laptops taking a hit as things advance making the tabs more powerful.Positives:SIZELocation of power button..upper left hand corner, so, unlike the kindle fire that is on the bottom, when you rest it in your lap it does not go to sleep.Chrome browser - not a big fan, but it works well with the tab. Guess if I was a desktop Chrome user I would love it. No Flash, but there are workarounds with Firefox mobile. Not a big loss since Flash is dying out.It seems to sense really well where you are about to click on. I think that was part of the Butter side of the OS. At first it was almost too quick for me, since I was hesitating before deciding on what to click on. Now, it is awesome. Very fast, very responsive.Graphics....While it is not a Retnia display I'm pleased. Browsing is nice, pics look good. Where it really comes in to play is games. Any tegra enabled game - google some you tube vids - are awesome. Great looking graphics with no studdering or lag that I can detect.Google Now....While I don't use it that much, I can see this feature only getting better. If you were still traveling to work, it would be a huge asset to you. As they add more \"cards\" to it I'll be loving it. I wish my phone had it, it would be perfect there. Which is what I think it was intended for anyhow.  Worked great - when I had a wifi connection- on our recent trip.  The flight updates were right on, except about 10 mins. behind from the updates we were getting at the gate.  Not to bad of a lag from the live thing.Negatives:The Glass is not Gorilla glass, just a scratch resistent corning type. reports of it being easily scratched. However, I went 2 weeks without a shield or cover and have no scratches. Of course, I was careful. I now have a slim cover from Amazon that puts it to sleep when it is closed. I now have a slim, low profile case.  No shield.  Still no scratches, however it collects finger prints like crazy.  You have to keep the screen clean or it will start glitching with the touches.WIFI - seems to have a problem holding a signal. I'm 70' if that from my router and it is a weak signal. Read many reports of the same. Seems to be less of an issue recently, but it is noticeable, and annoying considering my phone on wifi is right next to it and shows a stronger signal. Could be a hardware issue, but I'm hoping to see a software update. Time will tell.Glass edge....reports that is loose on one side, or raised up. Not a big deal other than it is not perfect. There are fixes, and mine is a little raised, but you really have to look to tell, or push on that edge to notice the movement. Does not effect function. First run problem, and it is a $200 tab.  Mine has not gotten any worse and there is no effect on use.HEAT - our kindle fire runs hot, noticeably hot with extended use. The N7 was reported to not have any heating...lol...same as fire when being held bare handed. Can not tell with cover installed. Does not effect performance.RAM - I have the 16gb version. $50 more totally worth it over the 8gb for me. I want to be able to have a gig of music stored locally on it, some larger games, and a couple of movies for traveling with the kids. The 8 would be overloaded. Most are reporting regrets getting the 8gb version. Read a 32gb version was coming out in the UK, but have not seen anything \"official\"  If there was a larger version when I was ready to buy I would spend the extra to get it.  With the 16 I have not had any space issues, and that is with a book, apps, and 4 episodes of Game of Thrones in HD.Ergonomics - While it is lighter than the kindle fire which is awesome. I don't like the corners. Holding it as a reader without a cover would hurt my hand. The corners are rounded and tapered to the back so it can be easily picked up while it is on it's back....fine...but when you hold it by...say...the lower corners like a book, the corner soon begins to dig into the middle of your palm. Not a deal breaker, but annoying when I'm reading a book for a long period of time. Totally solved by putting it into a cover. Other than that minor personal annoyance, it's light, has a good size bezel so that holding it by the edges does not result in a touch on the screen you didn't intend for. The case has totally eliminated the corner problem for me.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing tablet - but don't buy here as the price has dropped", "Author": "Numan", "ReviewID": "R1I4OO3OBFO4J8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You can buy the 16GB on google play for $199 (google recently dropped the price)[...]This tablet is exceptional for the form factor.

So for me it made the price even more appealing.Awesome movie quality resolution VERY CRISP!There are 2 small problems with this tablet though1. The rear speaker, it sounds a little muffled when you turn it up past 1/2 way, to remody it I installed a free EQ and just lowered the Bass down to zero and it sounds much better. (on the plus side headphones or external speakers plugged into the 3.5mm jack sound awesome with or without eq)2. The tablet comes with only a front facing camera, now the kicker is the tablet doesn't have an app to use it to take pictures, so you need to go to the app store and get the free camera app for it.

To cut straight to the point, it is an incredible tablet.  It's a great size, great weight, and it wants to be picked up and held.  The major flaws in this device is that I would prefer the 32 GB model for more storage of documents and games, and the tablet-optimized apps are small but are finally picking up.  I have broken this down to the type of user you are so you know what to expect from the tablet.Web and FacebookWeb browsing on the tablet is pretty good with the preloaded applications.  A faster browser that I just discovered is Dolphin with Jet Pack.  This is available in the market and makes the browsing experience much faster minus the great syncing services that are baked into Chrome.  Chrome itself has great functionality as well, but can be a little laggy on media rich sites especially when you are pinching and zooming.  If you are looking for a companion for the couch, look no further.  The Facebook application has also received some huge improvements as far as functionality and speed go.  It's not as slick as the Google+ app, but nobody uses Google+, so I'm going to move on.GamingGaming on this device is incredible.  After all, NVidia made the GPU.  You get console quality in a thing and light package.  Gaming will eat your battery significantly more than normal use, but that's what you get when you have 60 fps on the game of your choice.  Big names that I have played and enjoyed on this tablet is Dead Trigger (zombie shooter), Need For Speed: Most Wanted (self explanatory), Horn (much like Zelda, but it uses the touchscreen elegantly), and Galaxy on Fire 2 (space ship shooter).  There are many more that this tablet can play and many more on their way.  You won't get as high PS3 graphics, but you sure won't get as low as Wii graphics either.  With games, your major problem will be with storage as each game can take up anywhere from .5 to 2 GB of memory that can eat through your 16 GB quickly if you use this for other things.ReadingThe pixel density on the screen makes reading a breeze.  I read Kindle books, Play books, and Walking Dead comics on the bus while I'm commuting and I'm very happy with it.  When you are using it in a dark room, the auto brightness can be finicky, but the 4.2 settings pane has easy access to manual brightness controls.  I recommend using your library's digital collection to save you money and keep you reading.  Play Books are overpriced as are the Play Magazines.  If you really want to get a good magazine, you can pay for it, but there may also be 30 day trials to give you a taste of the experience.  The Currents app is a fantastic additional to a readers arsenal.  You select the sources that you want in your own digital newspaper, and it will sync automatically or on command so you can read on the go without a network collection.  This is how I get up to date on all the latest.FlyingThere may be a small niche of you who are wondering how this is when you are literally flying an airplane.  I was fortunate enough to learn to develop HTML5, so I made a great digital checklist for my school's planes.  I use my checklist app alongside Garmin Pilot, Write, and an E6B app for when I'm flying.  Garmin is still growing up, but the application that they have is very good and utilizes the built in GPS on the Nexus 7.  Also, you can preload sectionals, instrument procedures by state, and any other chart that you need minus the actual AF/D exerpts.  The application uses AOPA to transcribe the AF/D which may be fine for some, but not for others.  Other than that, the size is great.  It fits neatly as a kneepad with the right case and strap, but keeps me informed of my ETA, GS, MH, and cross track.  The only problem with the size of the screen is that it is smaller than approach plates, so the size is scaled down slightly requiring you to pinch and zoom if necessary.ConclusionI'm surprised how much I have ditched my computer to use my table instead.  The integration with Google services such as Gmail and Drive is so great that my backpack is rarely used if I am to go to school.  It won't be a good desktop replacement if you type or produce a lot of features, but if you only use your computer to browse the internet and listen to music, look no further.  I see this as a companion to the rest of my life.  With such a mobile size, I use it much more than I though I would have.  A 10\" tablet is too big in my opinion and I debated taking it with me anywhere and it would require me to rest it on something to use for a long time.  The 7\" size is a no brainer for me, since it can fit in my back pocket with a case on, and I can use it comfortably by holding it with one hand for hours.  If you are looking for a tablet of any size, I'd recommend the Nexus 7.

(ii) Touch devices with stylus dead on arrival: Galaxy Note proved it wrong. (iii) Who reads books? First Kindle proved him wrong. (iv) Tablet of smaller than 10 or 9 inch screens are of no use.AND THEN COMES NEXUS 7 TO PROVE HIM WRONG AGAIN.IN SHORT ITS GAME CHANGER OR TREND SETTER, AFTER THIS DEVICE, SMALLER SIZED TABLETS MIGHT BECOME FASHION AND GO HEAD TO HEAD OR EVEN FAR THAN THEIR BIGGER BROTHERS.MARK MY WORD : YOU WILL USE LESSER BIGGER SIZED TABLETS OR LAPTOP FOR THAT MATTER ONCE YOU HAVE IT.IT'S ALWAYS MORE FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUNGER ONES RATHER.Now please proceed to the detailed review of this great device (this deserve it)1. VERY BEAUTIFUL DEVICE: SIMPLE, SLEEK, SEXY AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ITS LIKE APPLE DEVICE MINUS ALUMINUM IN BACK FOR HALF OF THE MONEY.2. MOST PORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO USE AND CARRY. BEST FOR CASUAL USAGE: Its just like novel which you can put in pocket and use it any convenient position. Nothing beats it in this regard. People are using it even for serious work.3. VERY POWERFUL.4. VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED OPERATING SYSTEM equivalent to iOS but more powerful, flexible and customizable. It puts YOU IN COMMAND and don't let you feel helpless or dumb. You can do the things when you have the need for it.5. VERY GOOD SCREEN resolution (216 PPI). Viewable from all angles.6. STOCK ANDROID: BELIEVE ME NOTHING COMPARES TO STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE. With other variations you will most likely be outdated for some duration at least and that too with inferior UI.7. COMPARED TO KINDLE DEVICES: ITS BETTER than those as you can have amazon ecosystem on this but not vice-versa. Kindle ecosystem is very limiting.8. PRETTY DECENT SPEAKERS for its size.9. Very well integrated with Google ecosystem.10. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM IS MORE CONSUMER FRINEDLY IN GENERAL, they have more free, FEATURE RICH applications (almost double). They have recently offered many popular applications free or just for a quarter. I have bought one application @25 cents which otherwise comes for almost 14 dollars. Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI (Buy any micro USB to HDMI adaptor). I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan. I tether with my unlocked nexus phone without paying a single penny.5. Speaker sound is little muffled on high volume (use any free EQ application).6. Back Camera: I don't care as I don't want to steer tablet to take photos I want to shoot photos.GOLDEN WORDS IN END: ITS BEST MONEY FOR THE VALUE AND GAME CHANGER DEVICE, GO FOR IT.TIP: BUY IT FROM STAPLES/OFFICE DEPOT/SEARS/WALMART.

It is extremely light and has a very big screen. Setup is easy and if you sign up for Google Plus using the tablet you get $25.00 for the Play store. It has one ability that no other tablet does. You hold down the home key and slide up and you go straight to Google. Downloads are quick and easy though. One problem, it is very sensitive so treat it with care. I bought mine from a relative a little while ago and it looks and works like new. I love the fact that it has Jelly Bean software on it. Super fast connection and more games from the Play Store.

I actually sold my 6 month old, rooted, Kindle Fire for $150 bucks and then just chipped in the difference to buy this.This tablet is perfect FOR ME and for what I need. iPads are great devices, I've used them in the store and some of my friends have them, but they aren't for me for many reasons. I have had iPhones and iPods and MacBook Pros, but I just prefer the Android OS. I'd still choose an Apple computer anyday over a PC, though.Again, this device is great for me. One of the biggest reasons I got it was because I recently started graduate school and I bought the e-textbooks this semester rather than hard copy. For some odd reason, the programme I needed to run my e-textbooks was not compatible with the Kindle Fire, so I constantly needed to be near Wi-Fi in order to read them. Now, I can download them directly to my device and have them handy whenever I want.If you're going to get this device I would suggest getting a keyboard to go along with it, the one I bought is a case and keyboard all in one.There are a few downsides, but nothing that would have caused me not to buy the Nexus 7. FIRST, it does not support Adobe Flash player unless you upload it yourself, but then again neither does the iPad. Even when you do upload the Adobe Flash player app yourself it doesn't work all that wonderfully anyway. SECOND, there is no SD expansion slot. I wish this feature was available, but it's not. That being said, if you aren't downloading or storing a lot of high quality videos or photos onto your device you should be okay. There are ways to hookup mini hard drives to the device, so don't worry too much about this. Each of my textbooks, the entire textbook, takes up 11MB at the most. THIRD, the screen is not made of Gorilla Glass 1 or 2 thus making a case a necessity!All in all this is a good device, you have to put things in perspective. This device cost about 1/2 the price of the lowest price iPad, so they're obviously not going to have the same features. If the Nexus 7 has what you need then get it, if not then go for another Android device or an iPad.

It's an absolute great value at $199. The $249 asking price was viewed as suspect even back then because it's a $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage. Just for the sake of comparison a 8GB SD card can costs as little as $5 and change. Even the more pricey cards I've seen weren't more than $14. But still, the N7 is a 7 inch quadcore Tegra3, 720p tablet that ships with Jellybean (Android 4.1) and gets first-in-line support direct from Google...for $199 - $249. It's a sexy proposition even with the newly announced iPad Mini. Summary...The positives -- Runs the latest stock Android with support direct from Google- Supports full customization and apps that Android allows with no UI skin and no excuses.- Incredible value for the price between $199 - $249- 720p HD screen- 7 inch form factor is very convenient- Runs smooth- Good battery life (over 9 hours)The negatives -- There's no microSD (mSD) card slot- $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage- Build quality is suspect with many units. There's issues with the left side of the screen coming a bit loose from the housing.- There's no MHL support to go HDMI out from the N7 to a receiver or HDTV. (see Nexus Q for the reasons why)- Google is going to announce a 32GB Nexus 7 for $249 in a few days, effectively burning anyone that bought the $249 16GB N7 3 months ago.Final word - There is a lesson that many people must keep in mind when using Android. If you can help it all at, only buy non carrier branded Nexus devices. This is to guarantee that you get first in line support direct from Google for at least 18 months, it also guarantees that you will get a pure Android device without any UI skins, carrier bloatware (apps) or modifications included. The Nexus 7 is a great device that suffers from the lack of expandable storage and shipping with only 16GBs max (currently, this will change very soon). It also suffers from build issues resulting in some devices that creaks on the left side of the screen. Because of this, it's not a 5* device even for the phenomenal price. But it is hands down one of the best tablets you can buy at this form factor, not just the best Android tablet. Although the Nook Tablet is excellent and the Kindle HD Fire deserves a nod, the problem with these devices is that they run a skinned (read: not pure) version of Android. There are key features these devices will simply not have that the N7 does. Examples being, Google Play access, Google sync, Google apps, Google support. Support for these devices are suspect at best But the N7 can still support Barnes and Noble and Kindle features through their apps.Close to perfect but not quite.

Some is expected, but it has been worse than I hoped for from a Nexus device. If these were the only problems I\u2019d probably give 3.5 stars.HOWEVER, (this is going to be a ridiculously long story skip to the summary at the end if you want)maybe 5 months after I got it, the OS wouldn't boot. Just the X showing forever, restarting the bootloader didn't help. After calling and chatting, Asus agreed to take it back. They sent the RMA form, but no shipping label. Then I had to convince them to pay for shipping, and they caved reluctantly, said they would 'make an exception'.It takes them a month to turn it around. The confirmed that all they had to do was reinstall the OS, no hardware work, and it took a month. Fine. Whatever, it was working again.2 months later the OS stops working a different way. It keeps throwing up Android System errors more and more often, so I try a factory reset (standard fix) but it won't even get through the device setup because the system errors keep popping up and preventing it. So then I go through the same process as the first time - call, chat, RMA, chat again to get them to pay for shipping (this is Feb 10th) I send it back (note: perfect physical condition, just OS problems).After a couple of days I get the confirmation from FedEx that it has arrived at Asus in Texas. 5 days go by, I hear nothing and the RMA status online still says 'waiting' or something. I chat online, the guy says he'll flag it as urgent (which they already said they would before I sent it since it was the 2nd time it broke and I\u2019ve already been without it for a month). Next day I get an email saying it's being shipped back unrepaired because it was received broken. They don't call me or email me to find out if I sent it that way or if it was broken during shipping.I get it back a couple days later and there are multiple cracks covering the whole screen. Maybe it broke during shipping, maybe the tech dropped it on the floor and let it sit there for 4 daysI call Asus and chat with them, and they tell me there\u2019s nothing they can do because they received it broken. I already know that FedEx isn\u2019t going to talk to me about it because I wasn\u2019t \u2018the shipper\u2019.So then I file a complaint on Asus\u2019 website (3/22). This is when I start documenting all of the ridiculousness.On 4/1 I started a chat since I had gotten no response, in the complaint system it still just said that it was \u201cIn progress\u201d, like it had for the last 10 days since I filed it. They tell me that their system is down and they can\u2019t look up anything.Mind you, Asus has set up their systems so you can\u2019t contact anyone directly, so every time I contact them I have to tell them the whole story or tell them to go look up my file then wait 5 minutes (ignoring the initial message it sends at the beginning: \u201cHello Andrew Stevens, thank you for contacting ASUS support. Please give me a few moments to review your information. I will be with you shortly.\u201d and I wait 5 minutes and they know nothing about my case).So I suggest that they contact me when their system is back up. He says that\u2019s a great idea. Guess what, they don\u2019t. I chat the next day, 4/2, their system is back up.They train these people to be closers. Not customer service. They say whatever they need to get out of the current chat session and on to the next one.In this chat session then on 4/3, 4/4, they tell me they\u2019ll escalate the case, they\u2019ll have their supervisor call me and they\u2019re very sorry but Asus doesn\u2019t do replacements and there\u2019s nothing they can do. I don\u2019t get any calls, no help at all. They also tell me I should file a claim with FedEx. I tell them I already did (repeatedly) but FedEx told me (as I expected) that they would have to deal with Asus for the case since they were the shipper. The Asus rep finally tells me that the shipping claim will be handled by \u2018someone at corporate\u2019 and he can\u2019t give me a phone number, can\u2019t check on the status for me, and can\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going to happen.Also on 4/4 they finally respond to my original complaint:\u201cI apologize for the issues you are facing. As Nigel had explained we had received thetablet with physical damage that was not reported to us in the inital contact whenrequesting an rma for your tablet therefore we had returned the tablet unrepaired toyou.\u201dand that\u2019s all\u2026.no help at allFinally on 4/7 they call me (outside of the hours that I told them I\u2019d be available, with no call back number) and tell me (once again) they can\u2019t do replacements so I should send it back in and they\u2019ll request to replace it. They don\u2019t tell me they\u2019ll email me the RMA form or a shipping label, they just leave it at \u2018send it back in\u2019.So I chat again on 4/8, I didn\u2019t have to convince them to give me a label this time, but I did have to ask for it.I send it in, they receive it on 4/15.I get a call on 4/22 saying the motherboard and screen have been replaced, and they want me to pay for return shipping. So I don\u2019t care at this point, I\u2019ll pay the $7 or whatever.It\u2019s now 4/25 and they still haven\u2019t sent me the form to provide my payment information for shipping. So who knows when I\u2019ll get it back and if it\u2019ll actually work then.SUMMARY:DON\u2019T BUY ANYTHING FROM ASUS", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablets for surfing or watching video", "Author": "jdickey", "ReviewID": "RW0G9TVH5ZLGS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this primarily for watching Netflix or HBO go.

I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it. However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service. Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth. The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen. The second time it would continually try to reboot itself. A complete reset would not fix the problem. They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month. Then it broke down the third time. It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen. It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on. Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service. They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you. When they do ship it back, it is Fedex, and if you are not home all day to sign for it you have to go to Fedex to pick it up- a 1/2hour drive each way for me. The total turn around time each repair is about 3 weeks from the time you ship it out until it arrives back at your local Fedex. In one year I have lost all my data 3 times, have been without a tablet for 9 weeks total, and now I am awaiting it being shipped back to me the final time. The thing is, my warranty expired during the time they were working on it, so next time it dies on me- that's it, I'm out my time, money, and data. Really horrible way to treat an Asus customer! I have an Asus desktop and 2 first gen Nexus 7's and a second gen Nexus 7. I doubt I will buy another Asus product. Beware! By comparison, I had a Bosch circular saw that died after a year and a half of light use. It was out of warranty, however Bosch fixed it free of charge and I got it back in exactly 1 week from the day I dropped it at UPS to go to Atlanta.

Bought it from Office Depot about a year ago and it has been nothing but power problems.When the thing actually turns on, it works as expected -- like a slower version of my Samsung Galaxy S4, but with a bigger screen.  I guess that merits the star.But the biggest issue is that if you do not plug this device in EVERY SINGLE DAY and you commit the sin of letting the battery drain then you are in for a world of frustration.  Google's website has these \"fixes\" for that issue, but it only fixes the issue that one time.  If the battery ever drains again, then you need to spend a half an hour doing the following:1)  Plug Nexus 7 in.  Watch the blank screen while it does not register that you have anything plugged in.2)  Press the power + the volume down button.  Watch the blank screen while it does not go to the bootloader menu.3)  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for half an hour.  At this point, you may end up giving up.  Try again tomorrow when the frustration wears off.4)  Finally get to the bootloader menu and choose \"power off.\"  Watch the device power off.5)  Watch as your device finally charges.  Four hours later, your device might turn on.Doesn't that sound exhausting?  Well it is.

I mostly read, surf the internet and watch videos on my tablets.Pros: The interface (Android 4.2) is great.  Very customizable with many widgets to add to your desktop/home screen.  Love the Google search feature which is available with a simple upward swipe from the bottom of the screen.  Great screen resolution.  Inexpensive and portable.Cons: The sound is anemic at best.  Not much better than the original Kindle Fire.  Audio playback from Netflix skips constantly when paired with my Bluetooth headset (very annoying).  Wireless is noticeably slower then my iPad and wife's Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Google play videos are slow to load.  Reading books and magazines is a joke.  There is a significant lag for mags and books to load pages.  It's just frustrating.  Battery life isn't that great, and then it takes about 6 hours to charge fully.I hate to say it, but I now know why Apple is killing the tablet market.  Their machine is simply faster with better resolution and apps.  Simply put, if you are going to buy a tablet for videos and books/magazines I would get the Kindle Fire HD (cheaper than an iPad).

The iPad won the battle when it came to overall quality but the prize wouldn't justify it's advantages over the Google's contender. The Kindle came real close especially taking into consideration the prize, but the power running under the Nexus' hood would leave the Amazon's best seller biting the dust.I couldn't buy it on the Google Store and I was running out of time, so I decided to go ahead with the prize listed here and until this moment I'm very satisfied with my decision.My wife's daily usage doesn't come close to the tests I performed, so I guess she'll never complain for the system being slow.

I noticed it had a circular mark on the screen that wouldn't come off with cleaning. I'd describe it as similar to the mark a GPS suction cup mount leaves on a car windshield. You can feel it with your fingers, it feels rough in that spot. I read there are a considerable amount of others who have had this issue with their brand new Nexus 7 device.So I returned it to where it was bought, but they didn't have anymore in stock, so they ordered me another one. About 1 week later I received the new one, and it had the same issue. I called the store, they dont carry the 16 gb version anymore so all they can do is order me another one or refund my money. I called google, they couldn't help because I didn't buy it from google play store. They referred me to Asus, who offered to repair it if I sent it in. Repair it? It's brand new!At no point could anyone explain why both devices had this annoying mark. My guess: the suction cup mark is from The manufacturing process, maybe it was being held by a machine before the anti scratch coating sufficiently dried. I have to imagine a large batch of these devices with this blemish are getting through QC, probably because you don't notice it until you begin to get some finger prints on the screen (which only happens after some use).I don't want to deal with this anymore, and I especially don't want to wait for another week or more to find out my third device has the same issue. I'd gladly accept another one, if I could check it first before I gave this one back, but nobody will help me with that. I like the device enough (which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1) but who wants a brand new tablet with a big blemish on the screen?So, I'll probably get a refund and try a different brand. IMO the proper way to handle this would be for someone to offer to personally check that the new device they will send me DOESN'T have the blemish, but I cannot get a hold of anyone (be it ASUS, Google, or the store I bought it from) who will work with me on this. That doesn't make me feel very good about my purchase, especially toward ASUS and Google.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet at a reasonable price", "Author": "L.

For my birthday my husband got me a new Kindle Fire, which I expected to love, since I've loved every Kindle I've had up to that point.  But it really wasn't versatile enough for me, and I sent it back and ordered the Google Nexus 7 instead.As soon as I got it connected, there was a software update.  This is huge for me, because LG never, ever, ever updates.  Literally, I never had a single update on the G-Slate the entire time I had it.  Since October (2 months ago now) Google has sent out 2 system updates.  I'm very happy that they keep things current.  The tablet is very fast, and I haven't had to deal with a lot of crashing or apps that won't work.  The tablet itself feels high quality.  The screen is responsive, and everything works the way it's supposed to.There are only a couple of negatives.  One is that it doesn't have an SD slot, so you can't expand the storage.  I don't expect it to be a huge problem since it has a decent amount of internal memory, but it would be nice to have the option to expand.Another is that you can't do ANYTHING until you connect to the internet.  My home internet was set up so that you had to enter an item's wifi MAC address before it could connect.  But you literally could not do a single thing with the tablet until it connected.  I had to change the settings on my home internet connection to not require the MAC address, so I could connect to it and get in to find the MAC address.  This is a big design flaw in my opinion.

It looks and feels great, good enough to be the best 7 inch tablet on the market. I believe it is, however some things keep it from being the best tablet, period. The UI can take a little time to get used to - having both widgets and apps on the same screen(s). It is very simple to customize and does give the user plenty of options to tweak. Both Bluetooth and WiFi are available options as far as connectivity and you can upload and stream your songs over WiFi, yet the whole process seems clunky and unnecessary. Putting songs onto the tablet by copying over into the files while connected to the computer with the included USB cable is not only a lot simpler, but it allows for you to play your songs without being connected to WiFi. You can play these songs or watch videos and listen to them through the speaker or try to connect headphones/earbuds to the 3.5mm jack, although doing that doesn't seem to work. I have tried to connect multiple things through the auxiliary port of the Nexus 7, but nothing seems to work unless you get it just right. Even without the ability to get exceptional audio quality with the Nexus 7, the video quality surpasses many tablets of the same size. With an impressive 1280x800 resolution, text, pictures, and videos all look crystal clear. As well, games can look stunning as well.The Google store doesn't boast quite the selection that you can get from the iTunes store but you can still find some great apps and hours of entertainment. Downloading and updating these apps is very simple and the style and UI can make it easy to find what you're looking for, as well as difficult. There aren't too many subcategories to find something sometimes and the search feature is lacking features as you are forced to search the entirety of the store and cannot choose another way.Speed is something that has been advertised with the Nexus 7 and it does have quite a bit. Everything loads and can be accessed quickly without too much hassle, and everything currently in the cache can be seen by simply pressing a button at the bottom of the screen. The experience throughout is something to not be overlooked. Compared to the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HD, ans the iPad mini, the Nexus 7 is a step ahead. Though some of it's features can see unneeded or frivolous at times, Google and Asus added plenty more good than bad to make the Nexus 7 probably the best 7 inch tablet for a good price.

He told me that since I didn't buy it from Google, I needed to \"Return it to Walmart\" I brought my device back to Walmart, but after 7 days they don't take back tablets, go figure. After a bit of arguing, I gave up. Then I figured, it's made by ASUS, so CALL ASUS. The Rep from there wasn't so great either, but he said he'd open a case for me to send it in. I was hesitant to do so, since cracked screens VOID the Warranty. After a week or two I figured I already paid 250 for this thing, I might as well see how much it costs to get fixed. So I packed it in a bubble mailer, and off it went. Not even a week later, I get an e-mail telling me my tablet is on it's way back to me.

At the same time I have my blue tooth headphones in and I'm watching 'The Walking Dead' (I find that to be inspiring show to watch while running). I can keep flipping between the heart rate program and my movie with no problems. The only thing I wish it had was an HDMI out on it. Besides that its perfect for me.

A beautiful display is a pleasure to look at and use, and the storage is ample in the 16GB version. I have been using the nexus for a month or so, putting e-books and some games on it, and I still have half of the storage space left.

If you have a mobile internet service in your area then the nexus really comes into its own as a portable internet browsing computer. On the downside, I will say a previous review that talked about the mediocre audio speaker is correct. Even at the max volume it can be hard to hear the sound when watching movies or youtube.

The device does a good job running multiple apps at the same time, no issues switching between Sims Free Play, Yahoo mail, and Facebook while all were simultaneously running. I did seem to notice that the device has a little bit of a issue when it comes to it's touchscreen though...if you press too roughly, the device won't register your input, however this issue is resolved simply by using a lighter touch while operating the device. Battery life is pretty good, device ran continuously for 4 hours before needing a charge, (I haven't let mine get below 25% battery life yet, so I don't have a very accurate battery operational time test yet), the device seems to require around a 2 hour charge time to achieve a full charge from 25% battery level.

It has stock Jellybean, a plus for all users who hate bloatware. It packs a punch with the Quad-core Tegra 3. You can count on smooth multitasking and great graphics, especially for optimized games. Then there are some mediocre things about the Nexus 7, like the screen. It is fine and does its job, but doesn't make you excited about it.There is a lot of controversy about screenlift, on the outside of the glass. The edge of the glass seems to \"Pop out\" andit squeaks when you press on it. It can get annoying, but you can send it back to where you got it from.Where it does lack is some key features, a card slot and a back-facing camera. Google did want the costs to be low, so you will not have a microSD card slot. This means you are stuck with the space you get. This is not a dealbreaker, for you can use the cloud for movies, books, etc. The camera would be nice too have, there are times where I wish I had a back-facing camera on my Nexus 7. For me, these two are not dealbreakers. They would be nice to have, but all the other benefits outweigh the negatives.ONE SCENTENCE REVIEWIf you want a 7 inch tablet, get the Nexus 7 because of its super fast hardware and stock android, or the Kindle Fire HD and it's custom Amazon experience.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Trend Setter and Game Changer", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2E3800F1F34J5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like all those things which has proved the greatest Steve Jobs wrong or even has potential of doing it.

(ii) Touch devices with stylus dead on arrival: Galaxy Note proved it wrong. (iii) Who reads books? First Kindle proved him wrong. (iv) Tablet of smaller than 10 or 9 inch screens are of no use.AND THEN COMES NEXUS 7 TO PROVE HIM WRONG AGAIN.IN SHORT ITS GAME CHANGER OR TREND SETTER, AFTER THIS DEVICE, SMALLER SIZED TABLETS MIGHT BECOME FASHION AND GO HEAD TO HEAD OR EVEN FAR THAN THEIR BIGGER BROTHERS.MARK MY WORD : YOU WILL USE LESSER BIGGER SIZED TABLETS OR LAPTOP FOR THAT MATTER ONCE YOU HAVE IT.IT'S ALWAYS MORE FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUNGER ONES RATHER.Now please proceed to the detailed review of this great device (this deserve it)1. VERY BEAUTIFUL DEVICE: SIMPLE, SLEEK, SEXY AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ITS LIKE APPLE DEVICE MINUS ALUMINUM IN BACK FOR HALF OF THE MONEY.2. MOST PORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO USE AND CARRY. BEST FOR CASUAL USAGE: Its just like novel which you can put in pocket and use it any convenient position. Nothing beats it in this regard. People are using it even for serious work.3. VERY POWERFUL.4. VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED OPERATING SYSTEM equivalent to iOS but more powerful, flexible and customizable. It puts YOU IN COMMAND and don't let you feel helpless or dumb. You can do the things when you have the need for it.5. VERY GOOD SCREEN resolution (216 PPI). Viewable from all angles.6. STOCK ANDROID: BELIEVE ME NOTHING COMPARES TO STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE. With other variations you will most likely be outdated for some duration at least and that too with inferior UI.7. COMPARED TO KINDLE DEVICES: ITS BETTER than those as you can have amazon ecosystem on this but not vice-versa. Kindle ecosystem is very limiting.8. PRETTY DECENT SPEAKERS for its size.9. Very well integrated with Google ecosystem.10. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM IS MORE CONSUMER FRINEDLY IN GENERAL, they have more free, FEATURE RICH applications (almost double). They have recently offered many popular applications free or just for a quarter. I have bought one application @25 cents which otherwise comes for almost 14 dollars. Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI. I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan. I tether with my unlocked nexus phone without paying a single penny.5. Speaker sound is little muffled on high volume (use any free EQ application).6. Back Camera: I don't care as I don't want to steer tablet to take photos I want to shoot photos.GOLDEN WORDS IN END: ITS BEST MONEY FOR THE VALUE AND GAME CHANGER DEVICE, GO FOR IT.TIP: BUY IT FROM STAPLES/OFFICE DEPOT/SEARS/WALMART.

So, with that said here's a breakdown of this 7\" beast.HARDWAREThe Nexus 7 is a collaboration by both Google and Asus (my favorite hardware company). Its key features include:+ Corning glass 1280x800 display+ 1.3 GHz quad-core CPU+ Nvidia Tegra 3 GPU+ 1.2 MP front-facing camera+ 1 GB of RAM+ NFC (Android Beam)+ Gyroscope+ Accelerometer+ 8/16 GB of storage (can plug in USB drives if device is rooted)The display is very nice for a 7\" tablet. The Transformer Infinity has a 1920x1200 display, but it's also 10.1\" meaning it's easier to distinguish. Larger screens make the difference so the resolution for the Nexus 7 is fine and looks sharp. The quad-core CPU is really nice as transitions and page loading very fast (this being helped more by Jelly Bean). This also helps make games run smoother as well as GPU power. The camera is nice as well, though there is no camera app installed at stock (simply download it from the Play Store and it works fine). The only real downside hardware-wise is the little amount of storage space. Being an avid Android enthusiast, I often need space to play around with. However, if you root the Nexus 7, you can plug in flash drives and external hard drives (simply buy an OTG cable and downlad StickMount from the Play Store). The feel of the tablet itself is great. It's very light and the back is rubbery, but comfortable to hold for hours on end.SOFTWAREThe Nexus 7 is a Google tablet, meaning it comes with the latest version of Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) out of the box. This also means that it will have constant support and will always receive updates to the latest Android versions first (and if you're a flasher like me the community for modding it is great). This is my first Nexus device and from what I've seen of the Nexus 7, I intend to have all of my future devices be Nexus as well. Jelly Bean is an extreme improvement over ICS. I won't go into extreme detail as there are reviews on Jelly Bean, but its fast, responsive and smooth (mainly do to Project Butter).OVERALLA definite buy in my opinion. With only a $200 price tag on Google Play ($250 for the 16 GB model), it's a steal and beats out the competition such as the Kindle Fire.

Google Voice Search, Google Now (updates me on traffic to and from work, and gives me the current results of my favorite sports teams and more). Google delivered everything they said the Nexus would do.Expandable storage is not an issue for me. I got the 16GB Nexus, and have yet to fill up the device, even with large games like Nova 3 and Modern Warfare and Shadow Gun. And all these games play great, WITHOUT lag. I even use my PS3 controller (w/OTG cable) to play them. It's nice to have a physical controller instead of screen controls sometimes.The device is really portable, and though it does stick out a little, it fits easily within a jacket pocket or back pocket on my jeans.

The speaker and camera are pretty good. Battery life is about 7-8 hrs in my experience. It is built by Asus for Google and they have been a pioneer in netbooks.The Jelly Bean operating system is very fluid and compares easily to the iPad, since there are lot of the same major apps and media content in the Play store. The tablet has a navigation app with built in GPS hardware, but requires a data connection to use while on the move, so you will need to tether to a phone. Google has many interesting new features in their system for searches. The search cards are elegant and show a lot of polish. It would be nice for Google to make other basic elements (contacts, calendar, email) of their OS that elegant. Updates come directly from Google also, so there is no third party.

I have lots of pdfs of medical books. While the 7-inch format is perfect for reading regular books and there are good apps for reading and highlighting text, the problem is that for Medical Books the screen is way to small. There are good readers where you can view a single column but this is very tedious with medical books and, for studying, I like to be able to see the whole page or graphics and text at the same time, this is not good for that.Other issues: My headphone jack only plays one channel and that not even all the time or with every headset.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone so I liked that all of my apps would sync onto both devices, as well as streamlining my e-mail and other settings.  Win Win.  Or so I thought.Here are a couple of the major issues:DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASH-----Update: it does not support Flash, but you can do a couple of go arounds.  They are a bit of a pain.  I installed the Boat browser with an archived flash, and it works well.  But you cannot watch Amazon Prime in landscape view, just in portrait view.  But you can pop out the video so it fits the entire screen left to right, just while the device is in portrait.  I am still looking at various archived Flash versions as well as various other browsers.  Firefox to the rescue please!  (Still having trouble with street view unless you open Google maps in the other browsers).  Google, just give us a Flash app download please that works in your Android 4.1 Chrome browser!------------------So what does this mean?  Well currently I cannot watch my Amazon Prime videos on this tablet.  Instead, Google wants to charge me a monthly fee for Hulu Plus, or Netflix has an app for download.  But the question remains:  why should I pay for these services when Amazon offers a similar service for free?And with the non support of Flash come two very interesting problems: you cannot view the street view mode in Google maps (huh???) and many Youtube videos are not supported.  What gives Google?  Two Google programs that cannot run fully due to lack of supporting Flash?  I for one find this ludicrous.  If Google Maps and Youtube don't run fully without Flash, then why isn't Flash supported on the tablet?Now, for those techies that want to actually play Amazon Videos there is a way, though it doesn't work THAT well.  I actually installed Firefox by going to their website.  From Firefox you can look for an archived version of Flash for Android.  It will be a version compatible with an older Android version, but it WILL work.  Just not very well and not very clearly.  You will have to open Firefox and go directly to the Amazon website then go to Instant Movies and search for your favorite.  I am watching Star Trek TNG and it comes in decently, though some issues with sound and fuzzy appearance at times.  But it's better than nothing until Amazon releases an app (which I hope they will).  I also hope that Google will fix their street view system as well.I will be experimenting with various other archived versions of Flash and Firefox until I find a good match, then I will post in comments.  If you are just playing with Firefox and Flash, then you are not risking anything to your tablet.  Just only use the Flash downloads FROM Adobe's website.But enough of my rant about the lack of Flash support.  Other than that glaring problem there is one more issue, which I am glad to address:  unscrupulous sales of this tablet.  Even Google tried to charge me sales tax (I live in Oregon - no sales tax) and shipping.  Making the total for an 8GB over $250.  So here is the answer:BUY FROM STAPLES.COM :Sorry to recommend someone other than Amazon, but since you can't buy directly from Amazon, you have to pay a larger markup for purchase from a 3rd party seller.  Staples did not charge sales tax, and shipping was free.  It took two days to arrive.  I cannot express how happy I was with that purchase.  They only had the 16GB, but it still cost less in the end than the 8GB directly from Google.  And I still got my $25 Google Play credit.The other factor to point out is Wi-Fi only.  But at $250, I really can't complain.  If you really need a 3G/4G tablet, they do have those and you will spend a pretty penny.Also, no SD slot, but since Google is trying to encourage folks to load content into their 'drive' (their version of a virtual cloud) it seems that 16GB is enough to load many books and apps.  You won't be loading much media onto the device if you're using Hulu Plus, Google Play, or Netflix.  If you have music, I recommend loading it into the Amazon MP3 Cloud, which there is an app for that is compatible with this device.There is a micro USB port, so my Samsung chargers all work with this tablet as well.  You can also connect the tablet to a PC with a micro to standard USB.  I would also suspect that you might be able to use SD memory somehow if you have an SD reader plugged into a USB to micro USB cable.  I am not sure how to make the tablet 'see' the SD card in this instance, but I am sure there would be a software download that would work.  I haven't tried it because I use Amazon Cloud for most of my music.The tablet is actually pretty amazing despite the many flaws listed above.  If you are using it as intended: an E-reader (compatible with Amazon Kindle App), a browser (Chrome really is the best browser for speed/functionality), and a media device (if you are using Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube (for most videos), and Google Play).  I have also installed NES and SNES apps and downloaded a few ROMS and play classic games.  There are also many games and various apps for a variety of uses.  You can also load a Google map into the tablet to view offline if need be.  Sadly, I would just use my 4G phone with Google maps in that instance.So why buy this tablet?  Well I would say that perhaps I should have bought an Amazon Kindle Fire.  I miss my Amazon streaming video.  But the ability to sync my phone and use the same apps is a huge plus.  Having Chrome as the default browser is also huge.  Access to the variety of Android ready apps is really one of the best aspects of this tablet.  It does have an HD screen, though slightly less color than the iPad (at $250 less though).  The screen is also half the size of the iPad.  But that's not a bad thing.This is a very portable tablet, unlike the larger, nearly laptop size iPad.  I have a laptop already, so why would I buy a tablet that is less amazing than my laptop when it's about the same size and nearly as weighty?  Granted, if you are going sans laptop, the iPad is a great device.But for a portable (smaller) tablet with lots of bells and whistles, and impressive hardware, you really have the Google Nexus 7, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, and the Kindle Fire.  Each has pros and cons, but for ease of use, hardware, and connectivity I think the Nexus 7 wins.  Though the Nexus has its share of flaws, if I had to go back and buy one again, it would probably be the Nexus.  The Samsung is impressive, and my Galaxy S phone has been perfect; but with the newer version, it also lacks the Flash compatibility, though it has an SD card slot.  The Kindle Fire is an e-reader first and foremost, with decent media use, but not as functional as the Nexus; though it does have Android 4.0.  It really depends on what you are looking for in a tablet.I can say I'm happy with the Nexus 7.  I think there are a few issues Google should address.  Mainly adding Flash would help.  An Amazon Instant Video app would help too (hint hint Amazon).  Amazon just released one for the iPad, so hopefully it's coming.  In my humble opinion, all three mainstream tablets are amazing and competitive devices.+++Pros: Heavy duty screen, great HD display, lightweight, smaller than Kindle HD (less bevel), fast wi-fi, access to thousands of apps via Google Play, access to Amazon MP3 cloud, decent 16GB hard drive, impressive Nvidia graphics, and 10 hour battery.---Cons: Lack of Flash, currently no Amazon Instant Movie app, no 3g/4g model, no SD slot, only front facing camera (no rear).Verdict: you should seriously consider this tablet or the Kindle Fire HD.  Both are the best in the $200-$250 range at this time.

The tablet is really well made. I feel nexus 7 in my hands much better than my iPad3. However, I keep using my phone, GS3 or iPad3 for web browse, email, skype, facebook, games, Youtube, Netflix, and Splashtop. I do not read magazines or books. I am trying to force myself to use my Nexus 7, but I am not successful changing my habit just yet. Here is why.1. Jelly Bean is nice and smooth, but I experienced some bugs with Apps that were not up to date for OS 4.1. In time, they should be resolved though.2. I like clean OS with less bloatware, but JB needs some basic features like a numerical battery indicator and Landscape mode on the default launcher (because Nexus 7 is a tablet) Sure, I can install Apps to correct all these, but I would like to have them by default.3. No Flash support although it is not the tablet's fault. I can make Flash contents work by side loading the flash player apk, but several browsers often crash watching contents in Flash.4. As we all know, not many Android Apps are optimized for tablets.5. My place is very clouded with 2.4GHz devices, so I have 5GHz Wifi setup. However, Nexus 7 does not support 5GHz. iPad3 and GS3 do support 5GHz.6. The Speaker is weaker than my phone, so no good for Netflix or Skype without a headset.7. Screen is very crisp, but pretty faded due to Nexus 7's aggressive Auto brightness. Sure I can set it to higher value and get nice and bright screen, but I am just too lazy to switch when I change my environment. I would like it to be little brighter from the Auto brightness. It is much darker than other devices set at Auto.8. No Micro SD is OK for me, but I need to store some videos for my daughter. I keep using my GS3 or my old Archos 70 tablet for that.9. HDMI would have been nice. If it had HDMI via MHL, I could have used the tablet as a media player in my bed room mirroring video to a larger screen. I am using GS3 for that now.10. Nexus 7 should have a much better front camera than iPad3, but my Skype recipients told me videos are not good from Nexus 7. It could be the software though since Nexus 7 is not certified by Skype just yet. As a result, I have to use iPad3 or GS3 for Skype.I understand comparing Nexus 7 with iPad and GS3 is like apples and oranges. iPad3 and GS3 should have better hardware from much higher price than Nexus 7, but I still have to somehow find a way to use Nexus 7. The only advantage so far from Nexus 7 is that it is smaller and lighter than iPad and larger screen than my phone. The battery life is not as good as iPad, but it is much better than my GS3. It feels really great in hands. I think Nexus 7's processing speed is on par with iPad3. However, Nexus 7 is slower than my GS3. Maybe that is why I use GS3 more often. If I read magazines or books from tablets, Nexus 7 might become my favorite device. I will keep forcing myself to use it.Conclusion:This is still the best tablet at $200 and $250 as of 8/1/2012, but if you already have other similar devices like myself, you will have hard time finding a reason to use it.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outdated Price as of 10/30/12", "Author": "Sam Bravern", "ReviewID": "R3RC8QVMZE6L0T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This sells for $199 now.

A (not so) brief note about my experience with the Google Nexus 7 and my experience with Google Customer Service.  I purchased the Google Nexus 7 in September as a gift and loved it.  Our device began having problems this week, battery not charging fully, and when the charge was low (and device was plugged in) the screen would flicker and could not power off completely and would not retain a charge.  After a full 24 hours of charging the device and leaving it untouched, we were able to get a charge to turn it on.  The speaker appears to be blown as the sound is completely broken coming from the device (grainy and crackling).When I called Google's Customer Service team, the ladies I spoke with were helpful and processed my WARRANTY EXCHANGE promptly and without question.  When I asked the rep if I was getting a new or refurbished device, she advised it would be new, that they do not house or sell refurbished devices.  Happy to hear that!  When I asked specifically if I would be charged for the replacement device, she stated NO, there would not be a charge.  When I received the link to \"order\" my replacement device, it brought me to the checkout page in Google Play and asked me to supply my credit card to PURCHASE a new device for the full price.  I immediately called Customer Service and was given the standard rep response of \"IT IS OUR POLICY\" to put a hold on your credit card - in this case, my debit card - to have you PURCHASE a WARRANTY REPLACEMENT.  Um, the last time I checked, I was not aware that companies can bill you in full for a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I spoke with several layers of reps that were only able to reiterate their crappy customer service policies and procedures about the fact that the charge for a replacement Google Nexus 7 was required, or I could send my device back and allow their overseas tech team to troubleshoot, fix and send back to me.  I find it hard to believe that there is not a single person working for Google that can remove the charge to replace their defective device.  I am currently waiting for a manager to contact me after Christmas to most likely tell me the same.Hey Google - the reason why Apple is a market leader is because they do not charge you for a defective product replacement within its warranty.  I truly love Google and its services, however, this experience and their rigid customer service policies are completely unacceptable.  I hope someone reads this and can share a similar experience.  I cannot be the only person who is feeling like this is unacceptable out there.  The internet is a powerful tool and I am looking to ban together to get this great company to change the warranty policies of forcing you to put a hold on your hard earner cash to replace their defective devices.Customer Service is trying to tell me that an acceptable work around to my complaints are to contact Asus directly to ship my device to them and allow them to fix and send back to me.  This is utterly unacceptable!Directly from their email: Thank you for contacting Google Play! We will contact shipping escalations to resolve your issue.Google offers advanced replacement warranty service where we place a temporary hold on your credit card.To obtain manufacturer Warranty support without a temporary hold on your credit, I recommend contacting ASUS directly using any of the support options at [...].

I just received my Nexus 7 yesterday, and enjoyed it for the hour that it was working. The apps seemed cool, I started loading some ebooks on there, the free Transformers movie looked fantastic even though the movie itself sucks sack. I was happy... until I downloaded Google Sky and started playing. Not sure if it was coincidence, but after that the unit's stopped accepting any of my touches on the screen. It was just done. I tried a soft restart, hard reset, and nothing seemed to fix it even when done multiple times. I couldn't even get past the lock screen, except for 2 random times when I was pawing at the screen like a frustrated 5 yr old. Somehow, my frantic swipes got through the lock screen and I was able to get to settings to do a wipe to factory defaults. Still, the screen was F'd up. So... RMA time for me.I'm not a diehard Apple fan, or Android fan. All I want is something that works well, looks cool, and lets me customize it out the arse. It sucks when you get so excited for something, and it completely disappoints you. I don't want an iPad, I have an iPhone (and honestly it bores the hell out of me). The most customization you can do with iPhone is change your background. iPhones are nice, but designed so simply that it's borderline outdated at this point. They haven't redesigned the iOS look in how long? Or even changed a ringtone in 5 yrs? Oh well... I digress, as my hopes for the Nexus 7 are over for now. It's sad too, because I can tell it's a fantastic device if it actually worked. I've rarely ever, no matter what brand, had a product be this obviously defective. I refuse to even try to exchange for a new Nexus, I am going to wait on the next generation to see if they are manufactured better.If you really want to give it a shot, be aware of the possibility of a dud. If you get a good one, then luck you... from what I have seen in my hour of use, it's a fantastic device.EDIT: I decided to try ordering another from B&H; a week later. Now that I've had a few days, I've raised my rating a little. I do really like the N7, BUT guess what... a few days into using it and I am having a different (also seemingly common) defect. I have screen flicker when reducing the brightness down. It's not terrible, but annoying. If I buy something, it should be perfect out of the box. I also noticed that at the lowest setting, the screen is still pretty bright. To compare, iPhone and iPad backlight goes down super low when wanted, saving lots of battery life and making it easier on the eyes in the dark. I'm not sure why Android refuses to make their backlight control go comparably low (aside from having to get an app to do it). My original Droid phone was the same way with it's overly high lowest brightness setting. Anyway, now I am again stuck in the 'return or exchange' dilemma. I'm not sure I'm willing to take the 'third time's a charm' route.EDIT 12/10/12:I've had my second Nexus 7 (unfortunately bought before Google changed prices/GB versions) and I'm loving it. There are some minor quirks and imperfections (screen flicker, etc as noted earlier) but overall I don't notice it much since I've installed Lux. I use it fairly often, and at this point I'm pretty happy I gave it a second chance. My one new issue is the camera, which is AWFUL quality pics. It's basically unusable except for video chats since it's front facing. I tried it with Instagram out of curiosity, and the picture quality was so bad that I realized it's not even worth messing with it. Slight annoyance, guess I'll stick to my iPhone for that. Other than these things, I now highly recommend the Nexus 7, especially the newer versions where they've probably worked out all the little quirks.

However, there are some great workarounds.  If you have access to wifi while you're using the device, you can take advantage of cloud storage.

The Nexus 7 came from Google Play with a cracked screen.  I called Google Play and they gave me a phone number to call ASUS since apparently what Google says about getting a replacement if you call within 15 days from purchase for a defect is not really true unless you go through ASUS and their hoops about whether it is a factory defect or not and then send it to them and they determine whether or not to abide by the warranty.  So, as of now I don't really know if I will get a replacement for my broken on delivery Nexus 7, even though Google says I should.  Having dealt with Amazon before I'm sure Amazon would have replaced my Nexus 7 no questions asked basically.  So, should you buy the Nexus 7 from Google Play - NO!!  Buy the Nexus 7 from Amazon even if it costs a bit more.  Do it for your peace of mind.The short time I had with the Nexus 7 entering apps before I noticed the cracked screen were good.  The screen is bright and very nice.  Touch is nice and just right for sensitivity.  There appear to be many very good apps out there and browsing the internet or checking emails on it seem to be very good.  It pays to read about some of the responses to a google search on what apps you should load on your Nexus.  They were very helpful for me to get the camera working well.  Download the manual as well.  It's a good idea to read it so you don't miss some of the capabilities and work flow.  I purchased this for my wife.  She will be using it to primarily have a place to keep photos and share with friends.  The Nexus 7 is just the right size for her to carry around and show friends and relatives photos of grandchildren, etc.  She will enjoy it, IF I get one that does not have a cracked screen.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent tablet.", "Author": "Hernan L.", "ReviewID": "R2HO69SBVQBHQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Top noch quality.

For full disclosure, I have now sold my Nexus 7 because I wasn't using it anymore. Let me break it down for this review.Looks and Aesthetic: 9/10This tablet looks great! Everything is polished and ready to use. It feels a bit heavy in the hand, and is definitely made for use with two hands and not one. At 0.75 pounds, it's a bit heavier than, say, the iPad Mini, but I also think it has more to offer. The screen looks great; graphics are clean and everything is easy to read.Speed and Ease of Usage: 6/10The Nexus 7 is typically very fast. I had a few slowdowns, but I've learned to accept that all technology will have its problems.  The only thing that wasn't good about this, and what brings it down to a 6/10, is the fact that turning it on was a laborious process. I'd sometimes have to hold down the on button for 45 seconds before it would turn on! Sometimes holding the on button wasn't enough and I would have to press and let go. Every time I turned the tablet on was a new adventure. However, once it was on everything flowed mostly smoothly. The one slow thing was when turning the tablet on after a few weeks of being off, all my widgets would take a while to update. So that's just something to keep in mind if you plan to use it infrequently.Apps and Software: 10/10This tablet runs Android Jelly Bean, which is one of the newest operating systems from Android. It comes standard with Google Now, which is an excellent service which puts Siri to shame. I won't try to explain it, but google it to see just how cool it is! The app selection from the Google Play Store is excellent, and there is a wider variety of apps than the Apple Store has. The apps allow you to customize the look and usage of your Nexus 7 to your heart's desire.Internet and Usage: 5/10I found that connecting to the Internet was a little harder than on my laptop, but still relatively easy. The connection didn't pick up quite as well as a full computer, but still worked well. I just want to note that there are almost no free streaming video options on this tablet. You can pay for Netflix and use that app, or pull up Amazon Prime in your Firefox browser (Google Chrome for Android does not support Flash!! Huge mistake in my opinion!) but there are no good options for watching free streaming videos online. Hulu will not work unless you have a Hulu Plus subscription. Also, be prepared for a sore wrist after holding the tablet to watch TV for a while. I thought I'd be using it a lot for downloading and watching TV and movies, but it turns out I hardly used it for that, since it was much harder than I expected.Camera: 3/10The camera is more of an afterthought. I think I used it once to Skype someone. Please remember, tablets are not for photos. If you're filming a concert on a tablet, you're a jerk to anyone who's behind you. Please use your phone, or even better, your camera! The camera on the Nexus 7 is there so the Nexus 7 can have a camera. That's about it.Battery: 7/10The battery lasts quite a while. Depending on how much use the tablet is getting, obviously; I'd say expect 5 hours with heavy usage and maybe 8 hours with light, but continuous usage. Your results may vary.Storage: 9/10You have 16GB of storage. Most of that is available to you. The new trend is to store things in the cloud, so it probably won't be an issue. But if you really think 16GB won't be enough, opt for the 32GB version; it's not that much more expensive!Overall: 4/5Google and Asus have produced a solid tablet with a lot of great features. If you want a tablet, this is definitely the best one to get for this price point. But before you buy a tablet, be sure you want a tablet and not a computer. I made the mistake of assuming the tablet would be good for everything. But anything involving typing is a hassle, even with Google's impressive voice recognition technology!I recommend this tablet, but be sure you know what you want to use it for and see if others have had success with that task.

A 10 inch tablet is to big in my opinion I wanted something more portable.In my opinion neither the fire or the nook were viable options. I wanted a full fledge tablet not a media consumption device locked into one retailer. (Though I am a loyal amazon user and prime subscriber) I can get both nook and amazon media on this device if I want. All of the features on the nexus mentioned in the other reviews are awesome no need to drone on about those, the GPS was a Deal Maker for me, I wanted maps.The only negatives of the Nexus are lack of memory expansion and rear facing camera. The camera was a non issue for me as I dont see the need to take pictures with a tablet. The memory issue is not insignificant. I got the 16gb version but still I already expect to have issuse downloading several movies for watching on the plane.I got myself comfortable with this issue in the following ways;-Android no longer allows you to save/use apps on external memory, external memory can really only be used for media and even that has some complications for DRM protected media-There area number of external media devices that I think will work for my needs, the wi-drive is one of them, essentially creating cloud storage where ever you are.-For this price it has everything else I wanted and if next year something better comes along I only spent $250 and wont feel terrible having to upgrade.One last note, on the FLASH issue many are raising. It is here to stay, no more FLASH. It isnt a device related issue it is Android and Adobe, both no longer will support it. It works with your Fire today but the OS on that device will likely not receive an OS update. If you want a new device it wont support FLASH.(if the new FIRE supports Flash the OS will be obsolete before it ships) On the nexus there are ways to get it working through other browsers like puffin etc.I am so far very happy with this device and to repeat another review I read, it is the first device I pickup in the morning and the last device I put down at night.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!!", "Author": "jon-david", "ReviewID": "R2UV31I8N3R6VG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say is this Tablet has far exceeded my expectations.

Died on me a few months later.  Sent it back for repair.  Got it back. It worked, then died. Called Customer Service, was given instructions for a hard boot--plug it in hold both buttons down until a preliminary screen comes on, follow the instructions.  It worked.  But I had to do it repeatedly.  Then it died completely, nothing worked.  Sent it back again, was told it might have to be stripped of all the apps, files, so forth.  No choice, I had to agree.  But the deal was that if they had to do that, they'd send me a new tablet.  After weeks of agonizing online communication, it, or at arate, a Nexus 7 finally arrived.  But without any charger, either a new one or the one they had told me to send back with my tablet.  Took a week or so to get them to send me an Asus charger.  In the meantime I bought a third party charger on Amazon because I needed the device.  The Nexus 7 charged fine with that, and I had to reinstal everything at my own expense.  The charger from Asus finally arrived. I used it, and it drained the battery dry instead of charging it.  Tried the hard boot procedure with the Asus charger.  Didn't work.  In desperation, tried it with the third party charger, worked fine.  So I complained about this whole thing to Customer Service, and today they finally called me and told me not to use the third party charger, just the Asus charger which had killed the battery charge or worse. In place of the recompense I was promised--at the very least a new updated Nexus 7, I seemed to have gotten the old defective one stripped and maybe fixed and a defective charger.  I was told that my only alternative was to ship everything back A THIRD TIME.  To what?  To \"verify the situation.\"  And then what?  Stone walled.  So now I have a Nexus 7 that works for the moment but can't be trusted and Asus telling me to use the Asus charger that trashed the Nexus 7 and not the one that made it work!  What am I supposed to do?  How can I trust this Nexus 7?  How am I supposed to trust the Asus charger?  One thing is certain, Asus, the company and its horrendous so-called \"Customer Service\" is not to be trusted.  Not by me, not by anyone, not by Amazon.  Be warned!

As a long time iPhone user I was skeptical of the Android Operating System and any manufacturers ability to create a tablet that I would be happy with when compared to an iPad. The Google Nexus 7 was perfect for me and I'm extremely pleased with it. It's different from the iPad / iPhone in a GOOD and refreshing way, and it has a beautiful display screen. I bought a low profile case for it and it still fits comfortably in my back pocket; which is 1 of my favorite features, aside from the fact that it was $200+ cheaper than an iPad mini. Good battery life, excellent display quality, and it just feels good in your hands. I've used Google for years for business, so the fact that the Nexus 7 is fully Integrated with Googles ecosystem is perfect for me in so many ways. This is basically an entertainment device for me, I do not use this for work at all; so for what I use it for it is the Perfect MINI Tablet. I'm sure it would work fine for light business related use, but I wouldn't choose a Nexus 7 over an iPad for everyday business use; the Nexus doesn't have the horsepower that the iPad has to do multiple projects at 1 time, but it does 1 thing at a time VERY WELL.

The size is perfect, I absolutely love how I can hold this item with one hand comfortably (I can't palm a basketball).  It's quick and the screen is bright and clear.  The only thing I have to say is that the colors seem a little bit washed out when compared with my Galaxy Nexus and my Asus TF101.  The price is great, reading on this thing is also excellent!  Typing in landscape and portrait are also a breeze.  I find that the buttons are the perfect size for me in portrait mode, in landscape mode they work great as well with out having to over extend my thumbs; if you have ever owned a large tablet, you'll know exactly why this size is great for typing in both orientations, it is cumbersome to type in landscape on larger tablets.  Another great feature, as this is a Google product, you're going to get Android updates faster than other tablets along with less bloatware (yes, you can root, but I personally have no reason to yet).  It also fits in my jean pockets if I want to carry it around.So why did I take away a star?For starters, the battery life is just okay.  It works, but if you're using NetFlix on battery, it will only last about 5 hours until you have to charge again.  I got about 10 hours on my Asus TF101, obviously, this is due to the dimension limitations and battery size.  However, I also noticed that even with light use, I still have to charge my Nexus 7 every 2-3 days.  My Asus TF101 and iPad 4 lasted a week with light use before needing a charge.  I'm not sure if this is just the Nexus line or what, but my Galaxy Nexus also has a similarly short life span.The charger that came with it, boy, I was really spoiled by the Asus TF101 with their fold up prongs on the charger.  I wish that this one had fold up prongs as well, but the charger is slim.  My other gripe - this cord is short, it seems to be a common thing with tablets and phones these days, really short cables.  Be sure to have at least a 6ft USB 3.0 extension cord handy to take advantage of standard charging speeds, otherwise, on a USB 2.0 cable, it will flip to a slow charge state.While I've had it, the only times it ever shut off on me was when I was trying to download too many e-magazines simultaneously.  It would shut off during the process, but it was an easy thing to just queue up less files at a single time.  Another problem I seem to have with mine is when I near 100% battery while charging or am at 100% charging, having my earphones plugged in and listening to anything causes static to come through.  I'm not sure if this is only on my Nexus 7 or if this is just how Nexus 7's are.  I haven't tried to call their support line yet.Things I wish this had?  Rear camera, rear LED, and dual side speakers for landscape mode.  It's not a big complaint, but it would just be nice features to have.Why did I opt for this instead of the new FHD?  The price mostly, and the newest FHD doesn't have a rear LED yet.  I suspect they'll throw one in on the third generation device.Would I buy another Nexus 7?  Definitely.

I can read all my Kindle titles using the Kindle app, view Netflix videos on the tablet, etc. The sole missing item I wish the tablet had is a front-facing camera. I downloaded a free app to turn on the tablet camera and I can easily take photos of myself or whatever is behind me. Taking photos of what is in front of me is not impossible - just requires me to turn around, get my head out of the shot, and snap - but it's not convenient.

Since the 14 day return policy from Office Depot had expired I called Google and they began to resolve the issue: they tried a software fix and immediately offered a replacement when the problem wasn't resolved. They would charge my card for the new Nexus, ship it, and when they received the old one they would credit the amount. Sensible and straightforward. When I got the RMA I noticed that they were referring to a previous Nexus that I bought for a family member. When I notified them they advised me that this had to be resolved with Asus. This was a radically different experience. With them you have to send the machine, wait for them to determine the cause of a problem, then if it's their fault they will repair it and send it back. \"Normally this takes 5-7 business days but if parts aren't available it could take longer\" basically as long as they need to get the part which could be weeks days or months.The 1 star rating was because the machine stopped working after only 14 days and the customer support service was nowhere near what is reasonable from a company that's trying to compete with Apple.The takeaway is that Nexus is not a Google brand and that if you want Google service you need to stick with Google Play.

I settled on the Nexus 7 as the best value for money and bought one locally at a reputable chain office supply outlet.  The first unit I received was DOA and would not charge or boot up.  Staples was kind enough to take it back and give me a second device on the spot.  I've now had it for ten days and my verdict is in: this device is next to useless and extremely frustrating to use.The touch screen is exceptionally unresponsive and because the wifi receiver is so weak, a great deal of the battery power is used in simply trying to communicate with the router so that estimates of battery time are wildly exaggerated by the manufacturer.  This device has very poor connectivity, and to make matters worse, the touch screen has terribly functionality. It seems to have a mind of its own and is sometimes sensitive to the tiny inputs, even just a bit of motion, while at others  it is insensitive to the ones you want it to respond to.  Frequently you can get two thirds of the way through a letter or document only to find the unit has dropped out and all your work has been lost.  Mine has a nasty habit of returning to the home screen just as I am about to complete a document.  I put this up largely to the poor response of the screen that makes typing difficult and inaccurate.  There are other annoyances that have already been mentioned, but the poor connectivity, mediocre battery life and miserable screen functionality are my main peeves.  Having to return a DOA from a fresh box was not encouraging as well as it spoke poorly of the manufacturer's quality control. I'd like to say you get what you pay for with the Nexus 7, but in fact, nice as the packaging is, you actually get less than that. It is so frustrating to use (I'm no geek but far from computer illiterate) that for me it actually has no value at all.  It is clear I will have to spend a bit more to get a reliable, user friendly and robust tablet, and when I get home from my trip later this week, that's exactly what I intend to do.

Unfortunately, the wrinkles I've been waiting for them to iron out haven't been addressed.My main complaint is with its ability to handle simple tasks without freezing, lagging or downright crashing. I monitor the RAM load and try to stay on top of unnecessary apps running in the background, but none of this seems to help. Even as I tap out this review, I'm several words ahead before it catches up (I'm not a fast typist on tablets). I liken it to the overdramatic girlfriend who spazzes out over all the pressure when there's really no pressure at all. I should be able to browse Facebook or the internet (via Chrome; it's the native browser, FFS) without hangups. Alas, it's all too much to handle, I guess, but so she's locked herself in the bathroom until I give up and reboot.The display looks magnificent, but it has lately had phantom activations. It is as if it thinks I'm pressing on the screen when I'm not. Links magically get clicked or sections of text get highlighted for no reason. Maybe I'm being followed by a mischievous ghost. Or, more likely, the tablet is just bad.When I decided on it last year, I knew it didn't have a backward-facing camera. I didn't think it would be that big a deal. Well, it is more of a deal than I thought. Several times, it would've been handy to have for FB or Instagram when my phone wasn't an option. And you can't use Amazon's app - it won't even load, due to the lack of that backward-facing camera.I think I've had enough of it's shenanigans and will look at replacing it in the coming weeks.

BIG MISTAKE!  If your unit is defective (which apparently is common from reading these reviews) then you need the serial number. There are three ways to get the serial number: 1. Off the box, 2. Through the system (if it's working), or 3. The sticker on the back.I called ASUS support which is overseas and after an hour of working with them was told that I was out of luck.  No serial number, no service.  I was livid since it's a brand new unit.  I asked for a manager and was put on hold for a half hour before finally giving up.  I called back a week later and the new rep Claude was a bit more helpful.  He got me an RMA and I overnighted my unit to Texas for service.  They say after 24 hours of receiving the unit you can track it online.  It's now been 5 days and I called back and they are saying they haven't received it.  I gave them the tracking number and the name of who signed for the unit.We'll see where this goes, but best case they get me a new unit that works in the next week.

After one day of use it also seemed to run a bit slow and had a few other minor quirks. I knew I would not be happy with it for the long termAfter some additional research I switched to the Nexus 7 and I am very pleased to have done so. The display is beautiful. It runs better with the better processor and Android 4.2.2. All Google all the way is perfect for me.If you buy a Nexus over a Galaxy you will be giving up the camera and SD expansion slot.I am able to live with this since I have way too many cameras already. I also do not store a lot on my devices so 16G will be adequate. There are also ways to stream music and video from a flash drive using app Nexus Media Importer and a USB OTG cable.[...]So, the Nexus is much a nicer tablet for only $20 more.

The operating software is great and all of the apps work just fine. I don't like the way Google Chrome looks when searching the internet, but it works perfectly fine. Battery life is really good too.The casing and backing are great. Easy to hold onto and it won't slip out of your hands.The only issues I have with the tablet are minor, but they are still there. Some apps (The Washington Post app for example) are not compatible with my tablet. Also, The Hockey News app constantly crashes. While the first one is due to the tablet and it's software, the other is likely the app itself.I would have liked a spot to input an micro SD card. The more expensive models have that. I'm not sure how difficult that would have been to put on there, but it would have been nice. Especially since there is only 16 GB's of memory.I don't like that there is no camera on the back. While I would mostly use my cell phone or digital camera for taking pictures, it would have been nice to have one. Especially with apps like Skype or for taking photos around the house.The last issue I have is creating a wallpaper. Some pictures I use come up looking stretched out. Perhaps this is user error, but if not that could be a little better. Still a very minor issue.Overall, I think this is a great 7 inch tablet. I got the Skytex Alpha 2 a year or so before and it is no where near as good as the Nexus 7. With the Alpha 2, apps wouldn't work, and after a while the tablet would no longer download apps.

Dillon", "ReviewID": "R2AE416F25Z8X5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I would rate it four stars if not for the severe misrepresentation of its wifi capabilities.  I got it, the tech specs said it could do wifi-N ... but it can't, not at 5GHz.  I consider it a severe misrepresentation because the whole point of the N specification was to have that 5GHz band that doesn't interfere with bluetooth.  They should not advertise wifi-N capabilities without 5GHz, period.Another serious issue is that the display doesn't hold a candle to an ipad or ipad-mini.  It's only 'ok'.  Partly because the display pixels themselves are quite soft, but also because most of the video apps (netflix, youtube) appear to to be upscaling lower-rez video streams instead of providing the correctly-sized stream.  A good chunk of this problem is likely related to the lack of consistency with android tablets in general (something you just don't have with Apple devices), but I also think the display technology leaves something to be desired in this device.For a quad-cpu device it's not as snappy as the ipad mini.  Most of the time those extra cpus just don't have anything to do, and most apps are going to be single-threaded anyway so it's a bit of a waste.  Still plenty fast enough for all use cases though.The lack of secondary storage is well known so not really a detriment for review purposes.  I still find myself wanting it, though.

Warshaw", "ReviewID": "R2SFWXI2F991M2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The following is a reflection of how I use my Nexus 7. I'm not a gamer, so I don't have too much of a problem with games coming to Android second. I don't need all of the latest apps, and I have a set of specific things that I generally do, all of which I have apps for, so I haven't really felt the impact of the Android tablet app disparity. I understand that these things matter to lots of folks, so take what I say with a grain of salt and try to determine if I seem like the sort of user that you are.HAVING FUN:Like most folks, the bulk of my tablet usage is for leisure purposes--browsing the web, connecting to Facebook and Twitter, playing simple games, reading. The Nexus 7 does a great job at all of these things. The screen is beautiful, and it makes all of these tasks a pleasure.Tech journalists will pick on the Facebook app's \"blown-up phone\" experience, since there are no features taking advantage of the tablet's size, but in practical use, this doesn't really cause any problems. Could it be better and slicker by targeting larger screens? Sure. But it's something I would like if it was there, but never miss when it's not.There are a few really good Twitter (and App.net, if you go that way) apps. My two favorites are Carbon and Falcon Pro. Be warned, however, that Falcon is already having problems with Twitter's user token limit (totally on Twitter's side, but still), and once Carbon adds some more features and corrects some bugs, it will likely reach its limit quickly, as well. The advantage that iOS has here is that it had a number of quality Twitter apps prior to the Twitter usage changes, which ultimately gave those apps a much higher user limit than a client just starting out. The two Android apps I've mentioned really do represent the best Twitter user experience on Android, and they are both young, which means their potential for a larger userbase is not there.There are a lot of great games on Android. Popular titles like Jetpack Joyride, Cut the Rope (and Pudding Monsters!!), Angry Birds--all here. I also play adventure and puzzle games, like Machinarium (sweet, sweet game) or Tiny Bang Story. Waking Mars, Swords and Sworcery--all here.Chrome is a great browser on any platform, and it really doesn't disappoint on the Nexus 7. Not a whole lot of new stuff to be said here.Reading with the Kindle app is fantastic. Reading with the Google Play Books app is less fantastic, but honestly, unless you're a die-hard googler, what are the chances that you've purchased a bunch of books from the Play Store?I also do a good bit of Bible reading on my device, and my top app for that is The Bible App from YouVersion. I have some qualms, and would much prefer if the ESV Bible App would be optimized for a tablet (and honestly, improved for Android overall).GETTING THINGS DONE:Here's where I was very unexpectedly surprised by the Nexus 7. I got it, like most people, expecting to use it for fun, and maybe some app development experiments. What I have found, on multiple occasions, is how useful this thing is as an assistant for getting things done.On the first day, we had a Bible study at our house. In preparation for that, I decided to try using the Nexus. I have the Bible app, after all, as well as Evernote and Google Docs.This past week, I was getting quotes for and scheduling a home inspection. I called with my phone, and took notes with the Nexus.In both of these instances, I was amazed at how easy the Nexus made it. There are two chief factors, as I see it, that make it so:1. Android multitasking. In Android, you always have a dedicated button onscreen (or on device) for multitasking. You tap it once, and you see a list of app thumbnails. Seeing those app thumbnails (instead of just icons) is a great brain-aid. Instead of having to recognize an app by its icon, you get to see what you were doing before you left the app. Also, only needing to tap once makes it a cinch to very quickly get to the list, and, in the case of the Nexus 7, since the multitasking button is software, onscreen, it can't wear out like a hardware button. So if you wore out the home button on your i-device (which I did on two iPhones), this might actually be a huge factor for you.2. Android 4.2+. Android 4.2 introduced swipe-typing to the built-in keyboard. This is a massive help. While calling home inspectors, I had my phone in my left hand, my tablet on my lap, and my right hand pointer finger typing up a storm using the swipe typing. If you aren't familiar with the concept, you put your finger down and move it to the letters of your desired word, only lifting when you want to end a word. It is ridiculously useful, and very forgiving. I don't have to aim for amazing precision, because it does a fantastic job of interpreting what you're trying to do. I also used the swiping to take notes in church this past Sunday, and I was able to jot stuff down quickly and get back to listening.SUMMARY:The wisdom of the tech journalists seems to be that smaller tablets are meant to be great consumption devices, whereas larger tablets and \"real computers\" are better for getting stuff done. The Nexus 7 is great for consumption, but it's most pleasant surprise is how great it is for accomplishing real things. It's definitely worth a look.

While it is nice to get updates directly from Google right when they are released, I have a couple issues with ICS & Jelly Bean, namely affecting power users. It's very confusing for a new owner to get into the developer mode. And, effective with ICS there's no task manager, something developers and tinkerers like.

Some of you have already read that this device has no external memory slot, no HDMI port and no cellular connection. So if your intent is a device so you can constantly surf the web than this is not the device for you. By design you can tell that Google wants you tie the user to their services as you won't be able to read memory from external devices. That is until you install Nexus Media Importer app. Still my only complaint is that whoever decided to not put in a HDMI port or a Micro SD slot should be fired. What I really can't understand is why Google opt for no HDMI port? Since you are almost tied to the movies on the Google play site. An HDMI port would increase their online movie sales from anyone who travels a lot and doesn't want to pack a laptop or large tablet like the ASUS Transformer Prime TF201-B1-CG 10.1-Inch 32GB Tablet (Champagne) That I also own. I personally don't intend to buy many movies since they would be UN-viewable without a WiFi connection. So for traveling purposes I will keep downloading my movies on the ASUS Prime. Still I did purchase 2 movies just to test the quality of the screen and my WIFI streaming. I watch Green Hornet and Transformers 3 and the screen resolution looks great and battery life is on this device is great but another downgrade as it does drain a little faster when playing games. As a photographer I bought the Nexus 7 because of it's size. The device works great with the Nikon wireless mobile adapter utility app and allows me a much larger screen for viewing raw shots after shooting when I am near a WiFi source keeping my photos off the web. The photos I do upload on Google's Picasa website or photobucket allows me a cloud type site to show potential clients my work on a screen much larger than my smart phone. I pre-ordered the 16 GB version directly from Google Play and I love using it around the house or at the studio. I have also downloaded several apps to use when I am away from the house that do not require WiFi.

It took a while to get it back, but the repair was done well and device and screen are in new condition.I have been working with the device again during the past few days and there are no other issues. They did re-install the OS which I knew they probably would.I am upping my  review to 4 starts, it is really 3.5 starts though because the device should be designed to withstand light drops.----I purchased this device 3 months ago from Google's site shortly after it launched.Overall this is a good product and fun to use. Jelly Bean has come a long way with responsiveness and user experience.However, there are several significant issues with the device:Issue #1: The glass is thin and it breaks with even the lightest of bumps. The device slid from my lap when sitting on a sofa down to the carpeted floor. You couldn't have guessed it - yes, the screen was cracked when I picked it up. To think how many times I have dropped iphones, ipads etc over the years, if they all cracked that easily then I would either have to spend thousands of dollars on replacements, or more likely stop using mobile devices altogether. I called Google Nexus support and described what happened in detail. Support rep was nice but said \"it is an out of warranty issue\". Sent me to Asus customer support. The service rep over there not nearly as nice but I explained what happened and that it should be taken care of under warranty because a mobile device should be designed to absorb light falls and bumps. I will update on this as I am sending the device to them for examination.Issue #2: Wifi wake up. I expected wifi to come on the moment I wake up the device. This is the case with all the mobile devices I have used in recent years. The Nexus 7 takes a good 5 - 10 second to start the Wifi when I wake it up. It's been an issue from day 1 and this happens every time I wake it up, so need to watch the wifi icon and wait a bit...Issue #3: Get's sluggish fairly quickly. We all remember the experience when using computes running Windows right? We restart the computer on average once a day and everything seems to be running pretty quick for a while, until the next restart is due. This device / os has the same issue. It trained me to restart it once a day at least to get good performance. This may get better with OS patches or upgrades.There are many other minor issues with this device / os but which device doesn't have them? I think the ones listed above really hurt the device so I wanted to point those out. Overall I would still buy the device considering it's low price to value ratio but would have liked to know the issues and especially the issue with its super fragile glass.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Google nexus 7 16gb", "Author": "Christopher R.

I loved it, everything was fine. All the reviews said it was the best low-price 7in tablet on the market. I loved how it fit in my hands perfectly for typing and all that. It's fast enough and whatever. I hated that Adobe Flash wasn't supported. Like really, really hated it. But I got around that problem. The YouTube app sucks on it. It has to load every other second and you have to switch the HD on and off to get it to start playing again. But that may just be a problem with YouTube itself. I don't know and I'm not going to say I'm a gadget expert because I'm not. One other problem I had with it was that the internet kind of kicked on and off. That could also be my internet, but it only happened with the Nexus 7, not with my laptop or my Xbox360 or my nephews IPad or his laptop or my boyfriends Xbox 360 or any of our cell phones. JUST the Nexus 7. Maybe it's more sensitive to fluctuations with the internet connection, I don't know. It wasn't a deal breaker and I got used to \"Internet Connection Lost\" screens flashing on and off every so often.The deal breaker is that I treated this thing like a newborn baby for the last 3.5 months, never dropped it or mishandled it and held it with love and patience despite it's flaws. But just tonight it dropped from my bedside table to the ground (about 2ft) onto soft CARPET and the screen cracked! It's only slightly functional now and a TOTAL WASTE of my money! Basically, I spent $65.00 a month for a semi-useful gadget that didn't last a full season of the year. My nephew has had his IPad for the last two years. He drops it constantly, spills stuff on it, and is basically totally wreckless with it and it's STILL WORKING BEAUTIFULLY. I have always hated Apple products and have wanted to support anything other than them, but after THIS I'm just about to put aside my problems and get an IPad.So the gist of it is- this product is a disposable piece of junk that you should not think of as a long-term solution to replacing or minimizing use of laptops or PCs, but rather a total waste of your money. Get an IPad and have a life long friend. My nephew is going to laugh in my face tomorrow when I have to tell him he was right. IPad wins. I'm sorry Android. I was really rooting for you.

I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this device because I read a lot of negative reviews about the build quality being bad and issues with the screen lifting from the bezel. I put the negative reviews aside and purchased it. The reviewers were definitely right when they said the screen lifts from the bezel, but the issue it not severe...at least not yet. Other than that the tablet it great, when it decides to turn on...I happened to see reviews AFTER I bought the tablet saying that they were having issues with the battery and getting the device to turn on and stay on. Well, I am definitely a victim to this issue because at this moment that I am writing this review my tablet wont turn on, the screen just flickers a very dark blue color. I have disconnected the battery cable and reconnected it and it did nothing. I have also tried holding the power and volume buttons for about 30 seconds to try to perform a reset and that didn't work either. At this moment I am thinking I will have to send it back and get a new one.You get what you pay for on this device.

Earle", "ReviewID": "R2B6YGCUK0FD48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased the 16GB Nexus 7 today.  Brought it home, step 1 selected English as my language, step 2 selected my home wireless network (which works great for 3 PCs and a printer) and the N7 was displaying the full signal bars.  Entered my pass phrase and it said it was \"connecting\".  Nothing happened beyond this for a minute or so until something in the N7 timed out and the screen went black.  Woke the N7 up and it now showed \"disconnected\".Called Google tech support after about an hour of repeated tries of everything I could think of and getting nowhere with the WiFi connection attempts.  The Google tech support wizard said to return the unit to the store and offered NO HELP WHATSOEVER, not even wild SWAGs or stabs in the dark.  I'd heard Google tech support was useless but I guess I had to find out for myself - and I concur with the popular opinion.  Gotta start listening to the other Amazon reviewers' comments.Did a whole lot of internet research to see if others had been having the same problem and if there was an iron-clad remedy.  Yup, others had the same problem and no, no common fix floated to the surface.Called the store where the N7 was purchased and they just said bring it back.  No offer of any help from their tech support department either.  So I did take it back.  Bye bye N7.  Seems no one is really interested in supporting this device.If there is any good news in all of this, the local store where I purchased the N7 has a 15 day no questions return policy so I didn't have the hassle other reviewers had with returns to Google.11-15-2012 Update  - No longer \"bummed out\"After more internet research and thought I decided to give the N7 another try so I purchased another and started playing around with the WRT54G wireless router.  After a couple of hours and getting nowhere with setting changes, etc. (keep in mind the WRT54G router works great with all my other wireless laptops, printer, etc.) I purchased a Linksys E1500 wireless router.  Went through the setup A-OK, fired up the N7 which found the signal right away and connected perfectly.  Problem solved.I've since had a blast playing with the new N7.One problem, which appears not to be an isolated problem, is signal reception drops as the N7 is moved further away from the router.  I guess I can live with that, but it will limit my use in some places where I'd hoped to use it.A couple of other comments on the Android OS (not the N7):1. Still trying to find a way to get my Firefox bookmarks from my PCs (in .html file) into the Chrome browser.2. Wish there was a way to add more groups to the People app.3. Found OfficeSuite Viewer (free) for viewing some of my Word and Excel docs.  Works great!  Not a substitute for MS Office, but I wouldn't try to work in Word or Excel on a 7\" screen when I have laptops and a desktop where I won't get eyestrain.4. GasBuddy app - Great for finding reasonable (for these days anyway) gas prices in the area where the N7 is located.5. USA TV Droid - Great TV Guide app for those of us who get their HDTV OTA, especially now that Rovi is eliminating their TV Guide On Screen service :(One last comment, while Google Tech Support is for all practical purposes non-existent, I did receive a review comment from an Asus (makes the N7 for Google) tech support person without any solicitation on my part and a nice followup email from the Asus person with some helpful information.  Asus cares!That's it for now.  Still learning.  I'll give the N7 four stars now, one star off for weak Wi-Fi signal reception.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RA7P8SBTAIET3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great design asus, and amazing job on jelly bean google.

I thought about being on the plane and knowing my battery would last only part of the trip.  So I bought this tablet.  This tablet is the perfect size, as I can carry it in my purse.  I feel comfortable using it like a PC to shop with, which is not easy to do on a phone.  Its big enough to view and small enough to hold in one hand.

I can say that it is performing without a glitch.  I've got streaming radio (TuneIn), Skype, Audible, Kindle books and web surfing as my main activity.  Instant Messaging (IMO), Dropbox also working well.I did have to install the Puffin browser to play some flash programs (Colbert and Daily Show) that I like.  Puffin does ok, but has an odd thing that seems to be related to the Nexus 7 itself.  The flash video will stop playing , and I can rotate the tablet (portrait/landscape) and it continues playing.  I did this for a couple of hours, so I am sure that changing the orientation actually releases the flash from its frozen state.  Weird.  (I put this in comment back to Puffin and Google, so perhaps that will be improved some time)Another thing that happened was, due to the short USB charging cable, I picked it up, it pulled out of my hand and fell to the carpeted floor.  The force twisted and bent the USB socket (enough that some of the back cover snaps came open).  I was able to bend the USB port back and push the cover back in place and am still able to charge the unit (haven't tried data yet).  Advice:  buy a longer USB cable and be especially careful when plugged in and charging, even on carpeted floor.  I don't think having it in a case would have helped.  The extra weight may have made it worse.I intend to replace the internal daughter board so that the USB cable snaps more completely into the socket again, at some time.  I called Google and Asus to buy the I/O assembly, but they would not sell me one.  I found one on a third party site which is out of stock for now (wonder if that says something), so when I get the part I'll update this post.I can say that the device appears relatively easy to disassemble and replace a few parts (battery, speaker, I/O assembly, front screen, etc).  Asus does not seem to want to support the parts to do so, though.  Since the damage was my own negligence and not a manufacturing defect, I did not try to game the warranty.  I'll take the hit and try to repair it myself.Note, Asus did say that by having it repaired in their center (starting estimate about $75 plus postage) it would restore the warranty.  I almost went for that till I saw how the device can be opened up for this simple part change.Despite the attempted push by Asus to not support user repair, Google gets credit for building a device that can be repaired by someone of moderate competence.  This will be especially appreciated when a battery needs replacement.Buying from Walmart seems to be a consideration when asking for warranty support.  I would not have wanted to go to the store for support with a device like this.  I was impatient when I saw the unit for sale, so did one of my rare non-Amazon purchases, this time, so it will be interesting if I have to get warranty repair some time.  There is apparently different procedures depending on where you bought it when you are dealing with Google support.Amazon just does customer support right, so I'll stay with a sure thing next time.Bought a small portable Bluetooth keyboard as the on-screen keyboard is missing arrow keys (the text edit feature built in can move you around the text, but when the keyboard is on screen it limits the lines you can move around to).  Logitech makes a nice one that has the arrow keys and a few other Android specific keys.  It is just slightly longer than the Nexus 7.  I can be pretty far away and it still connects.  Now I can easily respond to e-mails and edit as I type.One note here is that I am getting pretty good voice transcription from the Nexus, so if I can just put a full thought together before I start speaking (not a Nexus problem), it will likely become my main method for creating text.I like that I can say \"weather\" and and it speaks the day's weather.  Also \"note to self\" is convenient as is \"Set alarm for 2 hours from now\" and \"Set alarm for 7AM\".  The alarm doesn't seem to do a voice based time set for more than 24 hours from now though.  Works fine through keyboard process.You can also say \"traffic\" and it will bring up a local map with traffic info in the web browser.The Chrome web browser that comes with the unit has a couple things that help someone with older eyes (like me).  If you double tap the screen it zooms in to the paragraph as best it can.  Double tap again and it zooms out.  Much better and works pretty consistently.  Also, if you press more than one link it zooms in on the two links and lets you select the one you intended.  Note, either way, if you press and hold the link it lets you open it in another Tab, so you can go through your news provider and open all the articles in other tabs, then go to them to read rather than going back and forth.Anyway, love the unit.  I use the Amazon App center for my apps, though they can be a bit out of date for updates (seems like it is getting better).  I didn't sign up for the Google Play app store (may some day since the two stores are slightly different...Google play lets you filter reviews by the Nexus 7 device and by the most recent app version).Can't wait to see the apps mature.  I can see the device becoming my constant companion.  My brain needs all the help it can get.Dave", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for a Great price", "Author": "J.

It is jam packed with features. Jellybean, 4.1, really does polish Android based on what it was with Ice Cream Sandwich, 4.0. It is easily my favorite operating system. The pure Google experience is fantastic, whenever I use any other Android tablet or an iPad I think they completely suck compared to this. You can customize just about everything that you would ever want to with this OS and it is not complex at all so even if you aren't computer savvy you could find your way through this OS after a bit of use. I have three gripes about this tablet though. One of the most obvious is that there is no SD card slot, so no extra physical storage but you do have cloud storage such as Google Drive which I love. My second gripe, possibly the biggest one, is that it is pretty fragile. My first tablet broke 3 weeks into use. I dropped it three feet while it was charging and it landed a weird way and the USB port was bent and the chassis popped off a bit. I fixed the chassis no problem but the USB port was broken and unusable, making me unable to charge it. I do highly recommend getting a case and possibly a screen protector because it not Gorilla Glass. Another gripe is the fact that there is no back camera. If it did have one it would be so much easier for me to take pictures, not that it absolutely needs one. The front camera has poor quality but I really only use it for Facelock. It would be nice if the homescreen rotated too but nothing you can't live without. Lastly I love this product a LOT but I would highly recommend an extended warranty. Here is a quick list of things:PROS:-Nice feel in your hand, just the right size-Amazing display, lovely warm colors and bright-Operating system is a boss, made me an Android lover but specifically for Google's Nexus series-Pure Google, you can do almost anything and Google keeps growing, can be scary at times how much you can do-NFC, have used it a couple of times and I have to say its pretty cool-Google Now, made me extremely lazy and I talk to my tablet whenever possible-Fast processor, never experienced lag at all-Google Play, extremely convenient to get all your apps and I still haven't used the $25 you get for it-Youtube pause, pauses all music or other videos I have going when I start a youtube video or Play movie-Great speaker, it is actually nice to listen to and kinda loud when you want it to beCONS:-build quality could be better, no Gorilla Glass and you can get scuffs quite easily-home screen doesn't rotate, kind of annoying at times-No SD card slot, bye bye external storage-No back camera, so don't expect to use this for photography-front camera is not HD, so you probably won't want to use it to take pics of yourself-battery could be more powerful, I use my tablet 24/7 and have to recharge it everyday which can get annoying if it doesn't charge properly-USB cable in the box is kinda short, like 3-inches which is kinda short for me", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Delight With Minor Issues", "Author": "allquixotic \"allquixotic\"", "ReviewID": "R2DPEVEAT5XGW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I am very satisfied with my Nexus 7.

My professors are starting to require books in class that are only available online so I wanted something that I could just whip out quickly and use without having to boot-up my laptop in every class. I had my older brother scower the internet for something that would fit my needs and come at a good price. It also needed to have good reviews from other people. And low and behold he found this. I  bought it refurbished since I am a poor college student (I don't even have a car and I walk a mile to campus every morning. :)) and I can't afford very much on my financial aid. This tablet has been awesome so far and the screen is very responsive. I barely have to touch it! :) Reading books on it is very comfortable and I can see the words clearly in all kinds of light. It doesn't blind me when I'm looking at it in the dark so that's a plus. ;) Also, this tablet is awesome for playing games. It's super easy to control and I find it way easier to play World of Goo (my favorite game) on this than on my Samsung SG3. When I'm using the internet, it loads very quickly and never has a lag. My only complaint is that the time is off. The GPS feature puts me in a timezone that is a hour ahead of what it really is. I even put in where \"Home\" is and selected the correct time zone, but it still says it's an hour ahead. I can't figure out how to fix it. But other than that, everything works fine.

It was blazing fast at first, crashy and slow the next and somewhere in the middle now. It's a credit to the Nexus family of devices that this tablets experience is better than it could be given that it continues to receive the latest updates, but unfortunately I feel that given the option the Android experience is still one of compromise. You compromise stability and excellent battery life (as seen in the iOS ecosystem) for a more capable and richer experience of Android, that is made all the better if you use any of Googles services. I suppose my issue is that while I would love to recommend this model for someone who wants a Nexus device without paying for the latest and greatest I simply can't recommend it due to the poor compromises made in the hardware and the continuing lackluster Android app ecosystem that still plays second-fiddle (although to much a lesser degree) to that of the iPad. My rule of thumb on electronics is, don't buy something on potential, so I would say hold out until next year and see if the 2013 model of the Nexus 7 holds up just as well.Positives+Direct updates from Google+Stock Android experience+Software experience has improved over the course of a yearNegatives-Android experience still uneven, still not polished (stable) enough-App ecosystem has improved, but still has a ways to go (still a lot of blown-up phone apps)-Hardware not up to the task a year later, has slowed significantly-Poor battery experience overall**To be more specific, I mean the fact that when charging from the provided charger I can very easily get the battery's charge to 'reverse' when in use.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exciting product", "Author": "Pradeep Wagh", "ReviewID": "R2YQJDCWJAOBLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good in performance.

I was looking for a pad of this size to come out ever since the IPad took the world by storm. I liked the idea of the IPad but it was too big and pricey for what I wanted to do, so when this and the Kindle HD came out, I was loaded for bear and began shopping. After comparing it to the Kindle HD, I decided on the Nexus 7. First strengths and weaknesses.Strengths:Amazing battery lifeCase can be carefully opened if/when the battery starts to degrade so battery can be replacedGreat priceVery good WiFi rangeSuperb graphicsSleek lookingNearly zero lag when browsing the net (of course this is dependant on a good WiFi)Google Chrome is great if you are used to using Internet ExplorerWeaknesses:Quite possibly the poorest user's manual ever seen. They seem to assume that all customers are smartphone users and will be able to \"hit the ground running\" without guidance. If you are tech savvy or already own a smartphone, this won't be a problem. Otherwise a Kindle HD maybe a better choice.Will not (unless you use a difficult wworkaround) run adobe flash. Flash is supposedly being replaced by HTML4, but nobody bothered to tell anyone but YouTube so it's a major pain to access a video and then be unable to view it.The basic model is totally WiFi dependant. If you work in a WiFi environment and/or have one set up at home, you're in great shape. Otherwise, it will be frustrating. But this is a major reason why the price is so good so know what you'll need before you buy.In short, I'd buy mine again and to me there is no bigger praise for an item.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a good tablet", "Author": "Lisa Kay", "ReviewID": "R2AUUOX28C3DH1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The middle of the touch screen didn't work well.

Not having any experience with a tablet PC unless you consider a smartphone one, I approached it as an actual computer and tested what i could do with it.  The learnign curve is not too steep.  The User interface was intuitive and with no prior experience with android after about 8 hours of use and research I found that i became proficient with the Android setup.  I have not explored customization of user interface, rooting it etc at this time.  I found that for normal use it worked pretty good.  We found that we were regularly grabbing the tablet instead of starting the main pc or laptop.  Web browsing is ok though the larger format tablets may be better as some sites are cut or to small to read.  Apps for popular websites like reddit, cnn, etc helps a lot for readability.  We have used it to watch movies after integrating it with tversity so we were able to stream most movies through the wireless as i would with an xbox360. Adult oriented games abound and we have become addicted to several.  All things considered, for adults it worked pretty good.For kids its great.  The small form (7\") and how lightweight it is lets a two year old carry it with ease.  I feel the overall construction is pretty durable.  Though we have been careful, with kids you expect some drops.  Its hit the floor a couple times with no problems.  The kids education apps on PLAY store have already expanded my kids reading and math skills and they have only been using it for a couple weeks.  We allow 30 minutes of education apps with 5 minutes of games like Angry birds and the kids beg to do their learning.  I have noticed signifigant improvements in their at home education.One thing i didnt know is registering it with Google play store with a credit card gave me $25.00 credit to use.

If there are any gamers looking to buy this, I'd either recommend an iPad or waiting 6 months to see if google gets their act together. First, using the touch screen to play games is horrible. So my solution is to use a bluetooth controller.Too bad that for the past two system versions, bluetooth does not function properly. To connect to my bluetooth controller, I had to roll back the software to 4.1. If anyone is curious, rolling back the software is not easy and now I get prompts to update every 30 minutes, interrupting my usage. Oh well, I managed and the bluetooth connected fine after that. So what's the problem now? 4.1 lacks even the most basic functionality such as landscape mode. That's right, a tablet that can't do landscape. I'm shocked that google would have ever released a product that didn't have that to begin with. So now I have to choose between having a tablet that functions like a tablet or having a tablet that can play games.

Overall, I am very happy with it.  The 4 quad processor is very quick, the apps open and close instantly.  There appears to be a good selection of apps for the Jelly Bean version of Android.  I am still waiting for a version of the Amazon app that will work with this tablet.  The device is made with high quality materials.  Normally, I use screen protectors and a protective case for my mobile devices.  I prefer to use the Nexus 7 uncovered.  The synthetic material on the back of the tablet makes it easy to hold and it would be a shame to cover that beautiful screen.  It appears to be a very sturdy tablet.  My only quibble, the packaging was so tight, I had to rip a part the box to remove the Nexus 7.  Good thing I like it, because returning the tablet without the original packaging would have been a major issue.I discovered the auto-rotate switch in the settings area.  It controls the visual orientation of books and things displayed on the screen.  It's default setting is \"OFF\".  When set to \"ON\" the display will always be positioned properly whether the tablet is positioned for landscape or portrait viewing.I considered returning the Nexus 7 when Amazon introduced the new Kindle Fire HD, but after serious thought decided to keep the faster and more powerful Nexus 7.  A few weeks ago, my lady friend purchased the 7 inch Kindle Fire HD.  It does not feel as responsive as the Nexus 7.

Specifically a Pandigital 7\", Kindle Fire, Viliv s5 (winxp based pocket sized pc), and a few WinCE 5.0 devices.So far the Nexus has been by FAR the best. With the Viliv being in second place. While the Viliv can do a LOT more, the battery life isn't that great, and the graphics power is fairly lacking, making the Nexus the better choice. The Nexus 7's battery life is incredible. I use it most of the day for music playing, web surfing, light gaming, and when night time comes along its around 50% left.The video power is really impressive, no issue playing grand theft auto 3. No stutter/lag/etc.It is lacking a SD card slot, with 16 gig of memory, and not upgradable... You would really expect some form of external storage without having to root it. Rooting the device does void the warranty, but you are still able to access the market and such. I would HIGHLY recommending rooting sooner rather than later. The root process will wipe your saved games and such. Once rooted, you can install stickmount and plug in a keyboard, mouse, usb jump drive, etc, using a cheap OTG cable.Built in GPS is great and cool, lots of great ideas made it into this device. Such as cards. When you are away from home, it auto detects and tells you how long it will take to get home under current traffic conditions.Built in wifi, so you can connect while at most stores/restaurants. You can also tether to your cell and get internet connection anywhere.Built in forward facing camera... I haven't even tried this yet, but I wouldn't expect much from it.I got this for  two hundred and fifty dollars at game stop, so I am rather surprised to see it for a higher price online.Over all, this is a very good unit. The OS is VERY well thought out, and complements the hardware extremely well. Haven't ran into a single issue with performance.

It is only front facing and the resolution stinks.-Taking a screen shot is so difficult?  why I ask?-Streaming video is not optimal.  It stops a lot and just does not work great in general.  I have a 4 year old ipad 1 that does a much better job.-It is slow...pure and simple.  (again my 4 year old ipad is faster)-battery is not great.  I expected more because everyone always says that Android batteries are better than Apple.Positive aspects of the tablet:-Great Gmail integration.  Very easy to use and fluid.-except for streaming, the clarity is very nice-Google play has a lot of great, free Apps.My main feeling is that for $100 more I could have had an iPad mini.

I've edited my review in light of the release (previously I was disappointed by a lack of official accessories from ASUS - I've been without a cover or dock for 2 months as I wanted an official one).The initial round of Nexus 7 tablets were not without flaws - I had to send my original back due to the screen popping out.  ASUS has fixed this issue and all new Nexus 7 tablets no longer have this problem.Outside of my initial issue and the long time for accessories, the Nexus 7 is a solid tablet.  Unlike the iPad, you will bring this everywhere with you.  It's the perfect size and weight for taking it along with you.  The lack of 3g might be an issue for some, but really how many times are you without wifi during your day?  For most people, it's not an issue.  For the select few it is an issue for, there is always the option of enabling the mobile hotspot feature on phones (provided you subscribe to the service).Otherwise, the biggest current flaw the Nexus 7 has is a lack of native landscape mode in several areas (particularly the home screen).  This is a design choice by Google but it's a poor one (I should be able to toggle this ability without 3rd party downloads).  If you want your home screen, etc in landscape expect to shell out a couple bucks for a 3rd party solution.Overall It's a hell of a tablet and the pure Google experience makes it a must have for anyone with an ounce of technical knowledge.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely Buggy", "Author": "Alex S", "ReviewID": "R2ZUEH0F6IVS3J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is extremely buggy.Mac compatibility issues - File transfer requires the Android File Transfer program to be installed on Macs because the tablet is not recognized as a external drive/disk but rather a media component.  The program itself is a dumbed down version of a file explorer.  The program disconnects/connects the tablet intermittently as if the USB cable was loose (it wasn't).  Also, there seems to be a bug where if you create a folder, delete it, and recreate it with the same name, the program will think that your tablet is locked and will give an error.  Then if you unplug and plug the tablet it, the folder will be there.  Im pretty sure this is a delete function bug where it doesn't actually delete and instead \"hides\" your file/folder until you reboot the device (not a quick process)Wifi Issues - Wifi is required to \"activate\" or reset this tablet - theres a prompt screen that asks you to select your Wireless Signal upon first startup.  No Wifi?  No tablet.  I found this out when I reset it during a flight and didn't have a wireless signal to re-enable it again.  I couldn't get past the prompt screen, which means I couldn't even upload files from my computer and use it as a video/audio player, ebook reader, or even a flashlight.Wifi Issues continued - When losing a wifi connection, a pop-up will appear saying \"Google Play Store stopped working\" as if it had crashed, when really it just means it cant connect.  And it does it multiple times.  Annoying when you know you don't have wifi.Wifi Issues continues again - This tablet seems to be wifi dependent.  If I remove a widget from the home screen(the \"My Library\" which displays content in a cool collage on the home screen) and then try to put it on my home screen again, it wont do it without a wifi connection.Default Applications - the default applications look great until you start uploading your own content.  The default ebook reader wont read your ebooks.  I couldn't even find the file directory to put the books in.  Same with the magazine app.  The video player can only play mp4 videos, and not all mp4 files (go check your movie folder, most if not all video files are avi.)  The photo gallery displays the ebook covers for some strange reason.  Basically, I have had to download 3rd party apps from the google play store just play my own content, bloating my tablet with two apps for each function - 1 app for google content, and another app for everything else.Form Factor - on/off and volume buttons are located right next to each other and almost identical in feel.  I find myself pressing a button, waiting for it to turn on, and then realizing its not the right button.  Ive also turned it off while trying to adjust the volume.  Not the best design.  Also, they are tucked under the tablet edges, not facing the face or sides of the tablet but more toward the back.  This means they wont be accidently bumped and theyre easy to use if its in your hands, but if its on a table you would have to lift and slightly turn the tablet to access them.  Volume comes out the back of the tablet and max volume isn't that high.TLDR: Biggest con is poor compatibility with audio/video/ebook content.  Wifi dependent.  Form factor needs tweaking.  If you're  a consumer sheep buy it, works great the way it was meant to work (buying all your content from Play store.  If youre not, buy it still for the hardware, but prepare yourself for some frustration or wait a while for software updates.too", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Unit, But...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R78UQYD1DRZMQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, it's a nice unit and I am satisfied with it.

I say \"a\" because the one I'm on is actually the third one I've owned in that time frame. The first one I bought around mid August. It lasted about 2 weeks, and then stopped being responsive whatsoever, however, I suspect I may have had something to do with that. I took it back to best buy and got it exchanged for free, this time buying a year long protection plan with it for $60. This new one had a cracked screen within a couple days of use, but again, I admit that's because I dropped it (it sustained damage even though I had long invested in a protective case). I didn't sweat it too much because the crack was small and close to the edge of the screen, and otherwise, it still worked just fine....for about 12 days, then the touch screen stopped responding. I took it back to best buy, again, where i was told that the screen malfunctioned as a result of a chain reaction set off by cracking. I got it exchanged in the store, again, but that ate up the protection plan, so I had to shell out yet another $60 to stay insured. I made sure no physical damage would befall my third nexus, yet, here I am, this morning, two weeks later, typing this review on my phone because the tablet's screen has once again become unresponsive. Keep in mind, the thing is in top shape. No cracks or anything. But now I'm gonna have to take it back to best buy again, and get it exchanged again, and pay another $60 for another year long protection plan that won't last even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction as long as it's supposed to. On top of that, the battery life is terrible, draining quickly and charging slowly, and the volume is quite diappointing. Of course those things are small, and I could easily forget them, IF THE THING WOULD LAST LONGER THAN A FORTNIGHT. 3 times in seven weeks this think has failed on me, and I can't help but think this wouldn't be happening to me if I'd just gotten an iPad, or even a samsung.

Before price drop but NEVER got my $25 Google play credit as the other tablet did.(4) I call Staples they say contact Google.  I contact Google they say contact Asus-had to repeat myself the issue so many times to ship it in for repairs- they still didn't deal with the $25 dollar problem.  SO I JUST TAKE IT AS A LOSS sat this point. WHERE DO I GO TO NOW??(5) This is why I sent it in to repair: constantly had to hold down 10sec to turn on --in the beginning it was after charging- later on it was ALL THE TIME ; Sometimes it will be stuck on charging screen and won't turn on until 1/3 battery is drained or all is drained; Constantly restarted itself in the middle of a task; It was like my tablet had a mind of it's own and gave me new surprise ALL THE TIME!(6) After it came back from Asus Repair.  Worked for 3 days- and then went COMPLETELY DEAD after I tried to charge it when the battery bar just turned red. Plugged it in to charge.. I come back it's still uncharged.  I re-plugged it in the charger.. battery displays empty okay I leave it for charge and then come back it won't even turn on.  Flashes Google screen then the X screen then it's OUT COLD (repeated this 10x on diff times so assume its' completely dead)........... wth?? So it's worse than it was before I shipped it in to repair.  SERIOUSLY??? They wouldn't think it's less costly for Asus to have done it right the first time and just replace my tablet with a new one?  This thing is a piece of crap.  Just a waste of my time and money.  I told them I've been having all these problems since the beginning before the 15 day return but do they care?? NO! -I have just recontacted them - it's been 2 days now - All I get is the guy telling me oh You having adapter problems?  I'm not part of the engineering department but I can help you if you want to replace your adapter - assuming he means buying a new one.  - seriously?? I NEED TO SHIP THIS THING back in will take another whole 2 weeks to get them to Help me with an RMAWhat's sad is I bought this for school so I can follow the pdf notes since the prof goes so fast in class while taking notes while recording the lecture with an app.  See I shipped it in to repair took about a month.  So by the time I got back it's already Exam 1 and so okay Exam 1 just finished I'm like okay 2 more exams to go and I just got my tablet back.  (DIES) seriously?!! NOW I have to ship it back again.. it's like half way thru the semester already.  SO WHY DID i EVEN bOTHER GOING WITH ASUS?? I SHOULD have stuck with IPAD Or something that WORKS!!!So word of advice..  Okay guys if you are having any minor problems with your tablet like the adapter plastic falling off revealing all the wires or something that's so minor u wouldn't think it will affect your tablet STILL RETURN IT WITHIN THe 15 day pOLICY and geT A NEW ONE until you're satisfied.  OTHERWISE- YOU WILL GO THROUGH HELL LIKE ME-  THis tablet is cheaply made HIT OR MISS KIND.... - I should have just returned it when I realize I couldn't get my $25 dollar.

HDMI is also great for the videos and photos I took with the tablet at a recent family gathering - being able to right away show some of the highlights on a big screen TV using the HDMI connection.The Nexus 7 and new Nook tablets don't even have HDMI, and the new Kindle HD lists HDMI as a major selling point, but it is  \"half HDMI\" with only 720p, not the standard 1080p HD -- so the lesser picture quality is noticeable on a large screen TV and doesn't look nearly as good.When it comes to enough storage space for your files, the big three again limit you since they want you to use their online storage sites to make more money and therefore don't provide the flexibility that a Micro-SD storage slot provides - most people don't always have online web access, so this can be real difficult at times - the Novo 7 Flame has a Micro SD port that takes up to 32GB Micro SD storage cards - if your not familiar with that, they are file storage cards about the size of a dime - much more convenient to put your stuff on.The Novo 7 is also built to last - it's the only tablet made with a thin metal exterior - which really can come in handle on the occasion when you accidently drop it - all the other devices are plastic - much more prone to damage.The Novo 7 Flame has most of the other major features as the Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD and new Nook HD have -matching the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD with a high resolution 1280 x  800 IPS backlit screen with wide 180 degree view; along with 16GB memory, Wifi and Bluetooth, and scratch-resistant Corning glass.Another thing that sets the Novo 7 apart is an option for 3G wireless service through many cell phone carriers as well as Ethernet high speed cable connection  - Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD and the new Nook -  7\" tablets don't offer 3G - and the Novo 7 also makes it easy to get internet through Bluetooth from your cell phone as well.  Only the iPad offers 3G as well.All these things are what make this tablet the most complete device this year - and the Novo 7 does it with a price of $189 -compare that to the Nexus 7 - 16GB device that runs $249, without all these major features added.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor build quality=Incompatible with certain screen protectors", "Author": "Christopher M. Johnson \"Objective Matt\"", "ReviewID": "R34DV21ULGGXEI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having just purchased my Nexus 7, I was very excited to get my hand on this first Google-sanctioned tablet; however, my experience with this tablet grew much worse yesterday.  After purchasing the tablet, I ordered an Invisible Shield to place on the device to protect the screen.  Let me first state that I have put over 50 Invisible Shields on various devices: Iphones, Ipads, Galaxy Phones, Nexus Phones, etc.  I am always meticulous about taping off the port holes and openings on devices prior to applying the Invisible Shield.  Well, I went through the exact same steps yesterday when applying an Invisible Shield to my Nexus 7, taping off all the holes and buttons.  I then sprayed my fingers with the application solution as well as both sides of the transparent shield, being careful to not use any excess.  Once applied, I used the squeegee to push out the excess moisture and bubbles to the edge of film while using a cloth to catch/soak-up any excess. After having let the shield dry, I turned on my Nexus 7 to see that liquid had got under the LCD panel all around the edges of the device (And, no, it was not the shield causing the distortion because I removed it promptly).  Apparently, the area around the LCD panel is not sealed off as is the case with most Apple products and other Android tablets/phones.  Instead, there are porous openings around the screen which readily absorb water like a drain----essentially making any and all of these type of screen protectors particularly damaging to your Nexus 7 device during application.  Trust me on this, I was meticulous in the preparation and application. Despite all safeguards, the lcd panel on the front is not sealed as it should be.

According to the Adobe website, the Nexus 7 is not on a list of approved tablets and using Adobe Flash can lead to instability problems. The end result is that I can not use the Nexus 7 to view certain photographic flash websites nor watch the movies I purchased as an Amazon Prime member (Note that I do not intend to purchase the Kindle brand of tablets because it also limits web access).Additionally, while the unit appeared to be fast, I also experienced other annoyances, including:  1) it is difficult if not impossible to keep closing those irritating pop up windows on some websites; 2) the type font size is small - and I do mean small - and therefore difficult to read ( I was unable to change the size); 3) the screen does not rotate from portrait to landscape ( I knew about this before purchase but did not realize it would be such a nuisance); 4) sometimes the tablet loads \"selections\" which I did not select; 5) sites with a lot of content such as CNN are extremely difficult to navigate and read; 6) I could not enlarge the font on the book reader; and 7) the device keeps trying to get me to use Google Plus and diverts my web searches on Chrome to Google Plus which I don't use (I admit that this may just be user error since I have not found the manual yet and have not yet figured out how to limit Chrome on the Nexus 7 to just web browsing and reading).Note, I returned both units.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Common defect with the Nexus 7", "Author": "L.

After that, I knew I'd need an upgrade.  For a while I considered the Cyberdyne T-600, but the rubber skin could be easily spotted and betrayed its inferior workmanship.Sadly, I can say that the Nexus 7 does not live up to the motto \"more human than human\" and I could clearly distinguish it from a real human after only 2 questions on the standardized Voight-Kampff test.  Additionally, the estimated four year life span is hardly enough time to maximize the memory potential.  I found that it began to behave erratically as the incept date approached and I had to retire it early.Although it has a 4 year lifespan, it only came with a 2 year limited warranty.  The upside of this was that I was free to reverse engineer it as much as I wanted.  I attempted EMS-3 recombination with ethyl, methane, and sulfinate as an alkylating agent and potent mutagen.  It gave rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carried with it a mutation.  Then I tried  a repressor protein, that would block the operating cells.  It didn't obstruct replication but it got a virus again and was dead before it even left the table.But all of this is academic.

This is what I get for being an early adopter (one week after it became available). I bought this device to take on a 3-week vacation so my wife and I could keep in touch with our business contacts, but we spent more time fighting the Nexus flaws than actually using its highly touted (by Google) capabilities.Let's start out with the most serious problem. After about two weeks into our vacation in Colorado, the screen started flickering. Maybe Al Gore's on to something: the altitude affected the electronics (nope, it's still flickering here in Missouri). My wife and I are long-time computer professionals and I can tell when a component is malfunctioning. Google's support people don't have an answer for that.Next, some ergonomic issues.When you're typing something, say an email, if you intend to hit the space bar, but accidentally hit the Home icon which is jammed right up under the space bar, you are sent back to the Home screen and what you've typed is wiped out, so you have to start all over again.It's crazy that the two-finger expansion feature that lets you increase the size and readability of a web site doesn't work with a downloaded e-book. You're forced to try to read a book with \"tiny type.\" My eyes aren't what they used to be, so this is a problem for me.Why can't the Home page rotate like other screens?Want to listen to a movie or music on an airplane? Forget about it. The sound is so weak, even at the maximum setting, and even at home with no competing ambien noise, it is next to impossible to hear. Ear buds didn't help on the airplane.Then, there's the Chrome browser for Nexus. Not the same as the PC version. Extremely hard to set up. Unlike Internet Explorer, where you can start many instances so that you can compare two or more data sets, Nexus Chrome only allows you to start more tabs, so you have to switch back and forth between tabs to compare data points.Something else was screwy with Nexus Chrome--we needed to access our credit union savings account to transfer money to our credit card account (we maxed it out a couple of times because of vacation expenses--Colorado is an expensive place), but Chrome somehow got in the way of our ability to access our account. Our username and password were not recognized, yet we could go to the hotel business center (two different hotels) and use a real PC and Internet Explorer with no problem. Screwy things were also happening when we tried to use Gmail and Hughesnet webmail. Same deal: business centers worked just fine.Google Play? There's no way I could figure out what my account balance was. Amazon always knows what I'm doing. I'm amazed that a technologically superior company like Google has such a poor website.Some people are thrilled that there's a user guide on the Nexus. I am never thrilled by a reference book that has no index. I tried in vain to find out how to operate the built-in camera and finally support told me that it was not for actually taking pictures like an iPad or iPhone, but only for online chats. (Still don't have a clue as to how to use it and there is no clue online).Google also assumes that whoever buys one of these dandies is a longtime Android user, so that many of the instructions in the user guide are vague, relying on the aforementioned assumption. (I can't use an Android phone because I live miles from the nearest cell tower and my Hughesnet ISP connection is too slow. There's also the issue of pouring money down a crawfish hole for a data plan.)In their rush to get this device on the market, Google did not have a carrying case at the time of release of the Nexus. I bought a Kindle case at Walmart that was adequate, but was not really optimum for the Nexus.There are other issues, like being useless for printing boarding passes, but I'm getting tired, so I'll finish by expressing my surprise and frustration with Google's apparent ineptitude with this device. Like Microsoft, they have never had any desire to deal directly with the public and they don't know how. They've built so many barricades against direct communication, it's tough to figure out how to contact their support group.Support is willing when you finally figure out how to contact them, but like most support orgs, they treat you like you're a dummy, because that's what their script demands. Performing a factory reset will not make a flickering screen go away.I use Google exclusively for search functions and have loved it since it was introduced. That's why I'm so disappointed that such an astute company has failed so miserably with the Nexus 7.I'd like to get my money back, but Google doesn't seem to be able to handle that, either. Support sent me a UPS return label. On October 10, someone in Texas signed for the return. Now, on November 6, I still have not received my credit. Support says I have to wait 14 business days, not including weekends. Guess how long it took them to take my money?

I was very disappointed to find absolutely no way to change the white backgrounds of Google apps (any apps for that matter on the nexus 7) to black.Chrome, Gmail, Google+, etc., had fixed white background on which I could not see on. I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note with 4.0.4 and I am able to change backgruond colors in my basic email app ( not gamil) and the browser (not chrome) to a black background. I am able to see on black like many of you can see on white. The reason I wanted to try the nexus 7 was to get a slightly bigger screen to read on.I am very disappointed in this day and age that Google continues to ignore the visually impaired people like me who want to use android devices. I just don't understand the discrimination here at all.Apple is even worse with this regard. I had have iphones since the original and got tired of fighting with them over this issue and putting up with itunes in a white backgound that I couldn't see.I also found the screen on the nexus 7 to be fair with a bit of hazyness.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.00", "Features": "With over 8 hours of HD video playback, 10 hours of web browsing, and 10 hours of e-reading, Nexus 7 is designed to go the distance.\nThe world first Android 4.1 Jelly Bean tablet\nWorld's first 7 quad-core tablet delivers an advanced multimedia experience with up to 9.5* hours of battery life.\nNFC experience on a tablet with a textured tactile design for enhanced comfort measuring just 10.45mm thin and 340g light\n1 GB RAM, 16GB Flash Memory, NVIDIA Tegra3 Quad-Core, 1.2 GHz", "Name": "ASUS Google Nexus 7 Android Tablet", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-Rn8eheCL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DB3SH2G"}}
