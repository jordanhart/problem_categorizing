It works quite nicely. I like the front & rear cameras. Comes in handy with Skype calls. :)The tablet seems to work fine with Minecraft, and other games. Video is good for watching your own vids, or youtube, ect.I also like the keyboard which uses USB, so no worrying about mating protocols.I get about 2 hours of use from a full charge when on fast mode, and a good bit more on normal.I used one of these for a theremin gig I did in New York recently. I had it attached to my theremin so I could call up the music accompaniment tracks I needed. She really worked a treat for the gig. Later, when I got back to the hotel after the gig, I played a little minecraft. :)", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Sherri", "ReviewID": "R2DNCARC7VTL9D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Item was shipped in a timely manner especially with the Christmas season.This tablet is not bad w/ the bundle price and was given to my 9 year old daughter as a gift.For a 9 year old, it meets her expectations, but I would not other wise buy it for myself as an adult.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice tablet, bad power cable", "Author": "Mike Kreckel", "ReviewID": "RI448HHEF56WS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it this morning. Opened it, everything worked right off of the bat. Except...for the power cord...Pros:-Many ports for many different cables-Nice screen resolution-Wide variety of apps (Google Play Store)-Android Jelly Bean 4.2-Fast and Responsive-Great for gamingCons:-Charging cable is VERY short-Not made out of the best materials-Can't charge by USB - Only by the AC/DC Power Adaptor-The power cord broke :'( But thanks to the customer support (THEY REPLIED IN 5 MINUTES!) They said they're sending me a replacement one.All in all, this is a great tablet. For the short time I had with it, I had a blast exploring the Android Jellybean 4.2 OS and customizing it to my liking, in most ways I cannot do on my apple device. I took one star off because of the charger incident. It comes with:-The tablet-A very nice Keyboard/case-A pretty decent, cheap pair of earbuds-A power cable-A USB-to-micro USB cable-A USB Female-to-USB Male cable (To plug in a USB stick for extra memory)-and a ManualI highly recommend this product, I just feel like I got an unlucky one. ;) Please, purchase this if you are interested in a high quality, low priced tablet.EDIT:After I found a charger I could use temporarily until the new one came in the mail, this tablet has been acting strange. Now, the screen won't even show. I'm not overcharging the battery because this power cord has a lower output voltage than the one it came with. I'm taking away two stars for this. If I get it to work again, I'll bring my rating back to 4 stars, but for now, it's going to 2 stars.EDIT EDIT::Alright, I figured out the issue and I fixed it. Brought my rating back to 4 stars.

It has not only a standard USB port for the keyboard case etc but also a micro one for transferring data, files, apps, eBooks, etc.The touch sensitivity is excellent.  There are some things that take a bit to understand/figure out as it is a Chinese tablet and the manual is mostly useless.The back camera is nice as it also has a LED flash that can also be used as a light like on an iPad if you get the appropriate app to turn it on.The quad core graphics processor is impressive and can output in 1080p via HDMI to your TV. (If you really want to use it for such)If you get this remember to get a micro SD card for more storage as I forgot.  We went out today and got a 32GB one and it works just fine.
