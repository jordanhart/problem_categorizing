Though I paid over $100 for this Android tablet, I really should have put that money as a down payment on an iPad. As that is exactly what I am using now to type this review. In fact, for about the same cost for this tablet I could have purchased Kindle, or Nook (from Barnes&Noble;) and those would have worked much faster and with fewer hiccups.
