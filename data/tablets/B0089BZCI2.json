The size is great and it's pretty durable.  Speed is painful and it won't connect to Google Play to download additional apps.  You can work around it using Opera, but what a pain.That being said, I bought it for my kiddos mostly and while I wouldn't want one of these for myself, I'm not real worried about it getting beat up by my kids.  So I give it one star for speed and accessibility to apps, and 3 stars for durability.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Crappy.", "Author": "Xireana", "ReviewID": "R2WY3T55MNBFSM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Won't connect to internet.
