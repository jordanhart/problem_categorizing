I have had many other tablets, low end and higher end, including the Lenovo thinkpad tablet 2, and the acer screen is a little funny. seems a tad glossy in a weird way, I think its just a cheaper screen than my Lenovo?? so be weary, some cant stand it, others don't notice. other than that, good product so far. had to get the keyboard for upper level college!!!!!", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "For students or working away from the office, it's a nice choice", "Author": "Terry \"tcinsatx@yahoodotcom\"", "ReviewID": "R3NFOXQFFB4A6U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Acer Iconia W-3 is a rockin' little tablet with some excellent features IF you make sure it suits your needs.My opinion is that Windows 8 tablets (including the Surface and Surface Pro) are the closest thing to a laptop replacement you can get in a tablet. They shine at work, educational and email activities, but will disappoint when it comes to gaming due to the paltry number of gaming apps available. However, if your desire is a more portable alternative to your laptop for work, school or travel, I think this is a fine tablet to consider.The Iconia has an 8.1\" screen with a display that is mediocre. It's great staring straight at it, but at any other angle, it suffers, so this wouldn't be a good choice if you plan on watching movies or videos with another person. This isn't really a problem for me since I think an 8\" screen isn't well suited for more than one person viewing anyway. It's backlit and has good resolution and for working or inputting data or watching videos solo, it's just fine for me.It has a micro-SD card slot, a micro-USB port (2.0), a micro-HDMI port, and front and rear facing cameras (both 2MP) so it's nicely appointed. No cables included, though, so I suggest getting a micro to regular USB adapter cable and a micro to regular HDMI adapter cable.The wireless capabilities are somewhat lacking, IMO, because the range is the least strong of any tablet I have in my home. I can't get a reliable signal upstairs at the other end of my house from my router, but I do have a very large house. However, I can with a Surface and with an iPad. Keep this in mind if you need to use a tablet in an area that is far from your router.Battery life has been very good. I get the full 8 hours advertised on a single charge. It comes with one of those pin-type charger instead of a mini USB type charger. That's mildly disappointing because I have to remember to bring this particular charger with me when I travel.The build looks a little cheesy, although it feels solid and well built. The front has a white plastic frame and then the back has a silver plastic frame. Later, after I ordered the Acer bluetooth keyboard that is designed to go with this tablet, it made more sense. The tablet snaps into the back of the silver keyboard, face down, for storage and easy portability so the silver back makes it look seamless. Still doesn't explain the white frame around the front but that's just aesthetics.This Iconia is a true Windows 8 tablet - not Windows RT. If you've never used Windows 8, there will definitely be a learning curve. Once I got used to it, Windows 8 is actually pretty quick to get around in and I'm liking it but be warned, it's a big change from Win 7 or earlier.The fact that the Iconia comes with a fully licensed Microsoft Office Home and Student version is the thing that makes this tablet very, very attractive, IMO. If you currently use Office, you know how expensive this software is to purchase.To get the most out of a Win 8 tablet, I strongly recommend getting a keyboard (bluetooth) and mouse. To my mind, using powerful apps like Office without a keyboard and mouse is an unnecessary waste of time. Productivity is this tablet's strong suit so get a keyboard. I personally like a mouse so I use the tiny Microsoft Wedge Touch bluetooth mouse and it works well, but it's a little pricey. You can easily use an inexpensive USB mouse if you buy a micro to regular USB adapter for a few bucks.I did purchase the Acer keyboard designed to go with this tablet, but I don't especially recommend it because it seems to run through batteries. Otherwise, it's nice, well-built, has an integrated stand for the tablet and a storage slot in the back for your tablet. However, I also have a bluetooth Logitech keyboard with a case that converts to a tablet stand and it works just fine at half the price. (You'll need some kind of stand for your tablet no matter what.)There are very few covers available for the Iconia and of those, not all of them fit properly. I purchased this cover and it fits and functions well at a great price.

Lofton", "ReviewID": "R3A304HDZD4ECI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd been eyeing up this unit for the last month and finally popped for it last week - if only I'd waited a few more days...I could've saved myself $30.  But you know what - absolutely no regrets:  I love this thing and for $299, I think it's more than worth a shot.  I can't believe the \"refreshed\" model will come in anywhere near this price point and is a \"better\" screen really worth the extra $100+?Don't get me wrong, the complaints about the screen are valid but you do get used to it.  I'm a Windows gal so having a full W8 OS (my first encounter with it) in a unit so small and portable has been great.  Not too bothered about some of the Windows Store apps but having MS Office preloaded and being able to run Vulkano Player (meaning I can access my DirecTV box from anywhere I go; perfect when connected via HDMI to a flatscreen TV in your hotel when travelling), and my music training software like EarMaster and GuitarPro on it has made it more than worth the price to me.If the refreshed version comes in at a reasonable price point, I may very well snap one up as a better screen would certainly be welcome for these middle-aged eyes.  But poor screen or no, I've got to say a backup unit of this current version for the heck of it is mighty tempting - especially if the price drops any further.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "lance66 \"lance domhoff\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y255DZ6BWLVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cant get over how many people DON'T know what they are buying then put it down because they bought it.

Here's a list of my pros and cons:Pro*Size - I had mixed feelings about it (always felt iffy about the in-between tablets) but it's actually pretty nice and portable. My 10\" ASUS is a bit too big to throw in my purse but this one works nicely if I want to play with it on a commute.OS - I'm an android/linux user all the way, but when it comes to this tablet, it's actually nice to have real Word and Excel, especially if I want to look at a file from work. I don't think it'll ever replace a computer, but again, for looking at something for work during my commute, making a small change, and sending it back in an email, it works.Cons*Screen - It's not bad... when looked at directly. Changing the angle even slightly really messes up the image.WiFi - When I hold it in landscape that the WiFi cuts in and out, and it's not just one magic spot or a port my finger closes, it happens all the time.Lack of regular USB port - The other ACER models I've seen had a regular USB port. In my mind, it justified their thickness. I feel like regular (not micro) USBs are still the most universal way we transfer files. It would have been a really nice feature here.Weight - It didn't feel as heavy as I thought, but it's almost the same weight as my ASUS 10\", and considering it's only 8\" but thicker, I would have preferred a lighter tablet.So all in all, not bad, but I think I'll stick with my laptop and ASUS Transformer Prime.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Full Windows 8 Experience on the go; Great value, especially if you can overcome the screen", "Author": "Kiyo M.", "ReviewID": "R3Y2MR6HDTHVX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the biggest complaints about this product is the screen. If you own an iPad or have been spoiled by retina/OLED displays, then you will be disappointed with the screen. Of course it is nowhere near as bright and sharp as those; however, I do also believe the complaints are definitely overblown and it's not horrible as everyone puts it out to be. There's some people who complained about the text being too fuzzy or not sharp; I've noticed when I received it, the resolution was low. Once Windows updated, having the resolution set to 1280x800, it looked much better. Yes, the screen viewing degree is not great, but it's not often you'll be using the tablet from the side. While it's no retina display, I do still get a sense of HD when playing HD videos.The touch keyboard is okay, but if you really want a full Windows 8-laptop/natural experience, then you'll definitely want an actual keyboard. I also purchased a Acer Bluetooth Keyboard (W3-810). Having a physical keyboard is much nicer, but it would have been nice if the tablet could actually be docked/locked into place and have it in different angles; it's basically just a simple bare stand, at a fixed angle, and if you move around a lot, it gets a bit annoying having to manually grab the tablet and keyboard together. It's nice to have shortcut functions on the keyboard, and it definitely gives the tablet a whole new life/better experience, just by combining with the keyboard. Being able to store the tablet on the back of the keyboard is a nice touch; however, it is made out of cheap plastic and the docking could have been thought out better.Having an actual mouse/cursor is also much nicer than using fingers on a full Windows. I wish the tablet had a regular full-size USB connection for connecting USB mouse dongles; however, the tablet only has a micro-USB port. I did purchase a micro-USB on-the-go cable and connected the Logitech Zone Touch Mouse T400 for Windows 8; it works and with the combination with the keyboard, it really turns the tablet into a real laptop experience.You really don't get much space left with this 32GB model with the Windows 8 OS and other installed things when you receive it. If you can, I would choose the model with more memory. However, I do appreciate they have a micro-SD card slot so you can have more memory.The left side (holding it in landscape position) of the tablet has the power button, micro USB slot and micro-HDMI port. the top side has the volume controls and micro-SD slot. The right side has the power connector and speakers.If you consider the size, the tablet is a bit on the heavy/bulky side.Pros:- Full Windows 8 Experience- Micro-SD slot for expanding more memory- Good battery lifeCons:- Screen (poor viewing angles/brightness; however, it's not as bad as most people make it out to be - Just don't expect iPad display)- Would be nice to have a full USB port.Now this definitely won't replace your computer. You can still definitely tell when browsing the web, it's not super speedy and loads more like it does on a tablet/smartphoneI definitely recommend attaching a keyboard/mouse with this tablet and you'll have a much nicer/real Windows 8 experience.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great software but poor wifi hardware", "Author": "Pikmin", "ReviewID": "R1DSH9RKY619E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this table for a month and I love it.

I recommend the Dell Venue 8 Pro, which has a nice display, feels sturdy and has a responsive 10 point touch screen, all for $300.

Cool otherwise.", "Author": "Z28James", "ReviewID": "R2MIJXPR1TFB6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lets start this all off with a few words about the screen. The screen is a lower quality TFT display that favors viewing angles from head on and to the right. I assume this is to assure being able to view the screen adequately from portrait and landscape. When looking at the screen you see what could only be described as if there was a matte screen protector on top of it. I got used to it but I also have a matte screen protector on my HTC One X that has the same effect. Don't discount what people have said about the screen. Have the proper expectations and you will be fine. If this thing cost me $600 I'd be pissed for sure.With that being said here are my thoughts on the pros of this tablet.The first is that it runs full on windows 8 and you can actually take advantage of the pieces meant for a touch screen. You can run full on x86 32bit programs as you do on your desktop.Second, it is versatile. I was sitting on the couch working on some documents when it dawned on me. Why try and forcefully do work on this tablet using a touch screen when I could be doing this much more comfortably with a mouse/keyboard. Seeing that this tablet has HDMI out + USB OTG I simply plugged in a mouse/keyboard/monitor and I was using the tablet like a full on PC. After I was done I unplugged the tablet and took the tablet to work where I utilized the finished documents. I plan on keeping a Micro HDMI cable at work so I can simply plug this at my desk into PC peripherals.Third, the battery life is decent. 8-9 hours is completely obtainable.Fourth, the form factor is just right. 8.1 inches is big enough to provide a comfortable experience. I always know that when I want more that I just plug it into a monitor.Fifth is performance. The UI is fluid. Metro UI apps tend to be the most fluid but \"desktop\" apps are very acceptable. For a $279 device this thing delivers. I even installed steam and you would be surprised how many games actually run. It handles emulators no problem. Video decoding is no problem.I love this thing. I have a beastly desktop PC rig, a hardcore gaming laptop, a linux work laptop and an iPad 4.

I would imagine that after using it day-in and day-out, it would become a non-issue.The machine was quicker than I thought it would be. The metro interface and apps worked flawlessly and smoothly.

If you need some entertainment, or enjoy watching someone suffer, keep reading.This tablet would be good if it were priced 90% off! Otherwise, FORGET IT!!! First, you don't get 32 gb. You get under 11 gigs! ....ok, let's start from the outside. The power button on the edge makes me nuts. I constantly am turning it off by accident. And with the lack of connectivity while in landscape position, you would think I'd learn my lesson, but I like lanscape and you shouldn't have to suffer for it. Also, the second it takes to rotate the screen (currently it is stuck onportrait mode for some reason), is annoying. Just when you think it's going to take long, it changes. The tablet is also slippery, so becareful not to drop it....or not. This really is like a practical joke. It is unresponsive, sometimes having to press an icon multiple times before anything happens. I'm kind of like the guy who gets a paper that saysturn over for something special and then you turn it over and it says turn over for something special. I am the idiot who keeps turning it over expecting a different result. I suspect the camera is filming this somewhere and people are getting a mighty good laugh out of it. \"Look, he's trying it again! What a moron. You are absolutley brilliant Mr. Pavlov.\"The charging hole and the earphone hole are on the bottom edge and we often confuse the two, very annoying. The tablet gets hot, while using and while charging, very annoying. You need to sign in to Acer cloud to use some stuff, download updates, nowI have8 gigs free....annoying....are you seeinga pattern evolving?I love sitting 15 feet from my wireless router, with no walls, and constantly dropping connections. Have I mentioned that I am getting annoyed?This is NOT an intuitive OS or tablet....not in the slightest. I guess if you are used to Windows 8 (my condolences) you won't hate it as much.I have to say that the viewing angle is not all that bad in a well lit room. I'm surprised, however, that they did not market it as a \"privacy\" screen, as the idiot writing this review would have probably bought right in. Btw, rotation is back.FYI, this comes with kindle, acer explorer, huluplus, 7digital, evernote, chacha, zinio, ebay, didlr, stumblupon, netflix, icookbook, skype, tunein, newsexpresso, socialjogger, acer crystal eye, spotify, etc.Ok, here is a comparison, the iPad mini is better in every way. The viewing screen is better and just about the same size. The mini is faster, connects better, is more intuitive and you don't have to buy 32 gig to get 8 gigs! Battery life is pretty much the same. I know, the ipad cannot accept an Sd card...oh wait, neither can the Acer. You can use a micro SD, and since you will probably need it, I'd get a 64 gig card....if you still insist on getting this....and if that's the case, I believe amazon sells whips and chains as well, this way you can beat beat yourself for not listening. I have done my best to talk you out of this....but if not, go to the apple store first and try out a mini.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CM1BN5G"}}
