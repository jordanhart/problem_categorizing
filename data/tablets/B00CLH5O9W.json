{"Reviews": [{"Title": "KF HDX 8.9 is ok; do homework on Prime download before you buy", "Author": "B. Tarbuck", "ReviewID": "R3OSONR0PBKHU6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.  To Amazon's credit it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than originally claimed.I have a Galaxy S3 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing.  Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Cloud Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device.  Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion.  This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download to your HDX.  Caddyshack can be downloaded but not The Hunger Games.  You can download certain videos but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out.  There is no banner (like the Prime banner on the movie icon) to show that it's content you can download to the HDX.  You have to open the content to check.  *** Edited 12/21:  You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device.  That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content.  Nice job Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX.  Also NOT the case.  So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption.  That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity.  You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device.  Many people will opt up for the 64 GB device like I did only to find that 16 GB would likely do fine since it would be hard to download enough content to fill 64 GB.  As another commenter pointed out if you downloaded long movies in full HD perhaps you'd really want the bigger device.  Which brings me to the final point.The final criticism is that once you start watching content you have to finish watching the content within 48 hours or you need to reconnect to the internet.  Again, I was surprised to find out that the content I downloaded expired.  Hopefully these criticisms lead to a more informed purchase decision on your part.Here is the official word from Amazon which is indeed on their site and the purpose for my edit.  I was unable to find this prior to my purchase and learned about it only after I acquired the device.*  Many (but not all as I note above) Prime Instant Video titles are also available for download on Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation and Kindle Fire HDX devices. The detail page for each Prime Instant Video title indicates whether the title is available for download. You can download available titles to only two separate devices at one time. If you have already downloaded a title to two devices, you need to delete it from one of them before downloading it to another device.*  You can have a maximum of 25 total Prime Instant Video titles downloaded at a time across all devices associated with your Amazon.com account. While not all Prime Instant Video titles are available for download, the same videos may be available for rental or purchase from Amazon Instant Video, and rented or purchased titles can be downloaded to compatible devices.*  Viewing Period: If you have a Prime membership or Prime free trial, you can stream any video that is currently designated as a Prime Instant Video title on its detail page. You can watch Prime Instant Video titles that you've downloaded within a limited viewing period, which varies by title. A typical viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the title or 15 or 30 days after the download, whichever is earlier. We'll typically notify you when the viewing period for a title is close to expiring. After your Prime membership or Prime free trial expires or is cancelled, you cannot watch any Prime Instant Video titles unless you've also rented or purchased that title.So my recommendations are this.  Amazon is a great company, one that I have committed to in a big way with Cloud Music, Prime and now the HDX.  They need to be more upfront about the download limitations and I'm very disappointed that I've had to discover these limitations on my own and feel it is important to convey that to others who may be considering this device over others based solely on the much touted video download feature.Also the rear facing camera in my particular device only works properly 30% of the time.  There is some weird RGB output happening.  It's not even close to the Galaxy S3 quality or acquisition speed so just don't expect that the camera will replace your SLR and you won't be disappointed.The rest of the device is great.  All my Cloud music magically appeared and it is very easy to operate. I can get on a primitive version of Gmail but it works fine.  Outlook Web Access for work is fine.  Yahoo! email works fine.  No Dropbox app yet and it won't work with Google Docs or Microsoft's online Excel / Word apps but that was known in advance and expected given the fact that Amazon isn't touting this as a work tool; it's for play.Amazon really owes it to their faithful customers who purchase these devices to improve the download / Prime experience and this will be a home run.  I'm looking forward to trying Mayday to help sort out the problems with the camera and inquire about the return policy as I felt very underinformed in advance on the downloaded video limitations.  I hope these comments help you ask good questions and help Amazon improve their product and content experience.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rocks!

The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning.  Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX.\u2714 BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9\" HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos.\u2714 PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet.  There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).---Videos you purchase do not have a viewing period.\u2714 GLITCHES---Verify your kindle is set for the correct TIME ZONE or you might have glitches.---If you cannot see your apps or any other items on the CLOUD then you probably need to RESET your device.---Filling the device to the max with videos then trying to delete a video might turn your kindle into a brick.\u2714 POWER ADAPTER INCLUDED---Yes, you get a  Kindle Power charger! Previously this had to be purchased separately ($19).\u2714 OFFICE SUITE MISSING---You can view an item with the integrated Office Suite but you cannot edit the item unless you upgrade to the professional version and paying $4.99.  That is, the HDX has a built in OfficeSuite shell, not the full functional program.  Hint: Use your 500 free coins to get the upgrade free.\u2714 No HDMI port (MIRACAST instead)---There is no HDMI port. To view kindle content on a television you need a Miracast enabled receiver (which can be your tv or a Dongle you connect to your tv). Although this is all done wirelessly, you are not using your local wi-fi connection, the receiver creates its own adhoc network.\u2714 PICTURE QUALITY---The picture quality on the HDX is stunning. It is noticeably better than the HD, there is no comparison between the two of them.\u2714 SOUND---The sound on this device is about the same as the Fire HD.\u2714 PROCESSOR---Faster. A lot faster than the HD!\u2714 VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS---The volume and power buttons are on the back of the device instead of the side. Fortunately the power button is on a different side than the volume buttons.\u2714 VIRTUAL KEYBOARD---There is white secondary text on the virtual keyboard buttons which makes information easier to read. On the HD, the secondary text is black which is difficult to read on dark gray keys.\u2714 KARAOKE (X-Ray)---You can now get x-ray on your music which shows the lyrics line-by-line. This feature is not available with all songs.\u2714 PRINTING---This new device will soon support printing documents straight from the kindle. Previously needed a .99 cents app.\u2714 STORAGE---This model can be purchased as 64GB without having 4G connectivity.\u2714 MAYDAY Customer support---Click the Mayday customer support button (in the Quick Settings) and you can see the rep but they cannot see you.  I have used Mayday about three times and it is wonderful.\u2714 REAR AND FRONT CAMERA (Important information)---The HDX includes a rear facing camera with an LED flash. There is also a front facing camera. On the HD there is only a front facing camera and no flash.\u2666Important:  once you take a photo it automatically goes to the CLOUD storage.  Please do not take any images that you do not want floating around in cyber space!\u2714 Special Offers---As before, Special Offers show up as screen savers. They are much better than the traditional screen savers. I recommend buying cheaper with the offers. If you do not want them then pay the extra to remove them. If you buy without the offers then change your mind and want them, you can't get the discount.\u2714 Amazon Coins---All new Kindle Fire owners receive 500 Amazon coins to spend in the app store. This equates to about $5. Plus there is always a free app of the day that can be downloaded. This is nothing new.\u2714 RETURN POLICY\u2666If you do not like the HDX (and you buy from now through the holidays) then you have until January 31, 2014 to return it.  In general there is a 30 day return policy.Cheers", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "An enlarged version of the 7\" HDX - Same good internal components with a nicer screen- still a battery hog though", "Author": "Amazon Reviewer \"Reviewing is my greatest int...", "ReviewID": "R2GE0AJTQPLZ9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simply put, this is the Amazon\u2019s iPad Air Killer. The 7\u201d HDX is the iPad mini killer.  Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware.  This means the 8.9\u201d version is an enlarged version of the 7\u201d version.  For my 7\u201d version review, please search for my HDX 7\u201d review.My profile: I\u2019m a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) & use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.  It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7\u201d \u2013 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7\u201d as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7\u201d As I mentioned in the 7\u201d review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This screen is a much bigger step up from the original HD 8.9 1920x1200 screen to the Kindle Fire HDX screen at 2,560 x 1,600.  The screen is comparable to the iPad Air which I saw in Apple store and text is crystal clear now with such a high per pixel inch density.  The viewing angle is just as impressive as you can hang the kindle in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly. Last year's model was not as clear as this. The overall screen improvement for this year\u2019s Kindle lineup is just impressiveSound (8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound. Similar to the 7\u201d that gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):Like the 7\u201d HDX, this 8.9 HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device. It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.The biggest improvement is the weight for this HDX 8.9 compared to last year\u2019s HD 8.9, the device is noticeable lighter (567g for Kindle Fire HD vs 374g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue. It\u2019s also lighter than iPad Air and that\u2019s quite impressive.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting. It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view. However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful. Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it. Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):With higher resolution similar to the kindle fire hdx 7, the battery life is still the biggest drawback.  As mentioned in my HDX 7\u201d review, it takes more to power to drive the battery now thanks to the screen upgrade.  Anything on the screen requires higher resolution = more power draw.  The 2650x1600 screen pulls a lot of power still compare to last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  It maybe fine for casual use but for people who are more absent minded in charging or require this for business productivity purpose, it can be quite annoying when your batteryrunning out of power.  Regardless, how much power saving features you have, it seems that the screen resolution is still taking most of the power.  I'm able to pull 7 hours of moderately heavy usage vs 9.5 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time. Again, if something like a battery case is available, that will be great. Otherwise, it will be wise to find an external battery pack for this just in case.Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueLike the 7\u201d Silk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX. For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use). The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon. I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):Same problem here arises for the 8.9\" compare to 7\".  For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available. At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch. This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached. Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon. Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.  At the moment, will just have to go with the original origami case (which again can be pricey as you can see from my other review)Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use. The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and its does show relevant items I maywant. Compare to the iPad Air, this is a total steal.  At this screen range, you cannot find anything comparableConclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad Air killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade from HD 8.9, I say YES to that.  The overall lineup for Kindle Fire has vastly improved and that is great on Amazon\u2019s part.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade. The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It used to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag. It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case. You get great price, great screen and great performance that surpass iPad Air. To me, the HDX is Amazon\u2019s answer to an iPad killer. This tablet at the moment has the best performance/price ratio.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market with no only one device revamped, but an entire lineup of Kindle Fire HDX having such performance leap. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!With 7\" HDX, it is my e-reader device whereas my 8.9\" HDX, it will be my productivity deviceThis will be reviewed periodically throughout the year. A more comprehensive review on productivity will soon be available. [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "An ipad convert", "Author": "R. Kumar", "ReviewID": "RTVD01N5TDVFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an apple guy since 1994.  I learned how to program on the Iic and have been using just about every version of the macbook and iPhone since it's inception.  I've also been a very proud iPad owner since day 1.  I still have my original iPad and bought both the iPad 2 and most recently the iPad air.  The iPad air is a remarkable device, it is gorgeous, thin and light.  I realized quickly however that iOS 7 was not ready for primetime on the iPad air.  Not to mention that I was having memory crashes 5-6 times per day.  On mobile safari, I would have two web pages open and the device would slow down.  If I opened a third tab and went back to one of the original two, they would both need to reload.  On top of all that, even though I am fully vested in the apple ecosystem (I purchase all my apps, music and movies through iTunes), I was quickly realizing that the competition was catching up very quickly.That's what lead me to the 8.9 HDX, mind you, I tested out the Galaxy note 10\" as well as the Nexus 7 for a \"true\" android experience.  I found jelly bean to be no different than ice cream sandwich which was marginally better than the last version.  I know android purists will say there is a huge difference and jelly bean was designed for tablets, but in all honesty, android is just a boring experience.  Even with a gorgeous screen as there is on the nexus 7, it has the occasional stutter, and I don't find the operating system intuitive with the exception of google now, I swear they've got spies in my house.With all that said, the HDX is the first truly different tablet experience in almost four years.  You will be truly dumbfounded by how light this thing is.  I mean after holding an iPad air, you'll feel like this weighs nothing.  But even with the lightness there is a \"heft\" to the device, one that gives it a presence.  And 8.9\" is the perfect size.  I mean PERFECT.  You can hold it in one hand in landscape easily.  And the rubberized plastic feels phenomenal.  From an iPad guy, this thing is neck and neck when it comes to design.  Yes, it doesn't have an aluminum back, but the front screen feels so much better.  The iPad Air screen felt plasticky in comparison to previous versions.The OS on the HDX is good.  I like the launcher.  It doesn't give me the feeling of completeness that IOS does by allowing me to customize and launch different apps, but it does it's job well.  I've always wondered why Apple didn't just have a live screen that automatically selected the apps I use most often and put them on the front page.  That's where Mojito's (as an aside, dear Amazon and Android, stop. being. cute.  Just give me a OS Version number, I can't wait for Android \"lifesaver\" or \"mint julep\") carousel comes into play.  It updates as you use it.Oh, and I know some folks like to use tablets for productivity, but let's be honest, they are purely entertainment consumption devices.  I realized that quickly with my previous iPads.  As much as I liked having email, iMessage, FaceTime, office suites, etc, the reality was that I used my iPad to browse the web, shop, read, and watch movies.  Guess what, that's what the kindle fire focuses on.  This is not a laptop replacement, this is not a post-pc device, it's the dessert you know you shouldn't have but realize after eating that it was the best thing ever.Prime Content is not exactly amazon's strong suit unfortunately.  I love prime, I've been a prime user for a very long time.  The streaming features of prime are ok.  Decent shows (like the most recent daily show) and movies (most of Marvel's latest flicks) are available.  But I'm paying 7.99 for netflix and until Amazon shows me content like that, I'll stick with my buddy.  Prime again is ok, not bad, not great, it does the job, but don't buy this for prime.  You can obviously buy all the same shows and movies on amazon that you could on iTunes, but from a free content perspective, prime isn't the driving factor behind this device.So, should you get the HDX, here's a few questions for you:How vested are you in google's or apple's ecosystem?  Have you purchased dozens of apps, more importantly, do you use the dozens of apps you've purchased?How important is productivity software to you?  Do you have to check email constantly on your tablet, open attachments, edit documents?  Or do you find that using a laptop or other PC a better solution for that?Do you play lots of tablet games?Finally, where do you get most of your content and do you purchase, torrent, stream?  There are ways to get movies from both the play store and iTunes to the kindle fire legally and easily.I found for myself, that a laptop is the best solution, and with today's ultra books and the macbook air, you can get a small, light laptop for under $1000 that does exactly what you need.  But for content consumption, the kindle fire is very hard to beat.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW.  More than I expected!", "Author": "My $0.02", "ReviewID": "R2VTY8AFSMKDI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this delivered last week to an Amazon Locker so it wouldn't be sitting on my porch and so I could pick it up in the middle of a work day. The Amazon Locker experience was really cool and convenient.First impressions....fast, lightweight, thin, and super sharp picture.  How the heck are there so many enhancements stuffed in the Fire HDX without weighing it down or slowing the processor speed?Navigating through the apps is quick and smooth, very responsive to touch.  I had multiple apps (10-20) running at once and it didn't affect performance at all.The picture is amazing, the colors are vivid and the contrast and sharpness makes some content almost look 3D. It also handles glare pretty good. Best screen I've seen to date and I have an iPhone w/ retina.The speaker sound is really good, they actually put out some bass.The app selection in the AppStore is plentiful...once you have your top 50 apps you should be set and Amazon has all of the must-have apps (do you really need 500,000 apps?), every app I looked for/needed was found and downloaded quickly and painlessly (love the Yahoo fantasy football, Facebook, Pandora, TuneIn PRO, and Netflix apps).The video camera is crystal clear and the rear camera is a much welcomed addition.  Great pics and video! The built in Skype app works very well for free video calls with friends and family.  The good thing is, anyone with the Skype app can receive your video call on their device (unlike Facetime where both users must have an Apple device). This allows you to have free video calls with more of your contacts as long as they download Skype from their respective app store.The camera app is surprisingly useful considering it comes built in. It has a ton of photo editing capabilities including filters (way more than instagram), panorama shots, cropping, text, and funny stickers you can paste to pics. You would think this was a paid-for camera app.The email client was very easy to set up, I had my Gmail loaded in less than a minute.The overall build feels sturdy and just pure quality. Again, it is very thin and lightweight but feels like it was put together very well.The battery lasted for 10+ hours while I was hopping around fantasy football, Facebook, and email on Sunday during the games. This is very good for an HD tablet.  People must remember a tablet is more like a smartphone and needs to be charged when not using since apps and wifi are constantly running in the background. For being so thin and lightweight the battery is very impressive.The Silk browser is nice, although it defaults with Bing, so I changed it to Google (personal choice).I really like the icon with reading glasses that appears in the top right of the browser that let's you change to reading mode.  It converts the web page text into a book-like page, similar to the Kindle e-reader.  It really makes reading articles on various websites easy on the eyes.X-ray feature: Watching TV shows and movies is enhanced by x-ray.  Just tap on the screen and factoids about the actors in the scene (at that moment) pop up on the side of the screen without interrupting the play.  Just tap the screen again and the info disappears.  This also works when listening to music from the music tab; the lyrics of the song appear while the song is playing.  I've always had to interrupt myself and check my phone for movie info or song lyrics when I watched or listened on other devices, now it's all in one place and available with a tap of the finger.  No more asking \"what's that actor's name\", \"what other movie was she in\", or \"how does that song go\"!The keyboard is really accurate, no typos yet. I noticed there is an external keyboard by AmazonBasics, but I'm okay with the on-screen keyboard for now.The price was reasonable for what I got. It's good to know they're not making a profit on me before I even opened the box!Overall, I am very pleased with the appearance and performance after using it for 7 days.  I was really looking forward to this purchase and I must admit that I am more than satisfied. Amazon over-delivered on this. Well done Amazon.If you don't care about \"labels\", then this is the best tablet you can buy right now.  And if you ask me, Amazon is the best \"label\" when it comes to taking care of their customers.  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!P.S. - You really should be an Amazon Prime member to get the most out of this tablet. The free Amazon Instant Videos for Prime Members are awesome!  I also opted for the Special Offers, which knocked $15 off the price of the tablet and does not bother me at all.  In fact, I am glad I got the special  offers version!  Since I've owned the tablet I have received offers that only Kindle Fire owners have access to.  I got a new Kindle Paperwhite for $20 ($100 off) and a Cuisinart Juicer for $20 ($100 off) - these 2 deals alone practically paid for my tablet purchase!  There was a deal for Madden 25 for $5 but I missed that one.  They are really awesome deals to take advantage of or you can just ignore them since the special offers only appear for a split second on your screen as you swipe to unlock the tablet from sleep mode. Definitely recommend the special offers, you can always opt to pay $15 later to have it deactivated but you'll find they are totally worth having.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Screen Display and All Around Nice Tablet", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R3L6RNVTOIVG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $379 you are getting a good deal on a large tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $399 for last year's base unit of the first-generation 8.9\u201d Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi base version of the iPad; if your pocketbook can afford it, I would recommend upgrading to the one with 64 GB of memory. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year\u2019s 8.9\u201d HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer looking for the larger screen size, or where price vs. value is a key consideration, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $269.  If you're comparing last year's 8.9\u201d model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one because other than screen size, for what I am using it for, I can only tell the difference between the video playback and playing a couple of games.I\u2019ve been playing with this for over a week now, and my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the 8.9\u201d Fire HDX to the original 8.9\u201d Fire HD as well as this year's model of the \u201cregular\u201d Fire HDX, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Initial setup of this year's model of the 8.9\u201dKindle Fire HDX was pretty easy \u2013 that\u2019s saying a lot as this year\u2019s versions of the various models had significant crashing issues due to operating software updates.  While this unit did update the operating software, it ran quietly in the background with no issues at all.Screen Display / Video Playback:If video is your thing, this version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date: I\u2019ve been comparing various episodes of the first season of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d TV show to each of the previous Fire models and I am very impressed at the picture quality. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp.  The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 2,560 x 1,600 (25% better than the HD version of the 8.9\u201d Fire) with 50% more pixels per inch at 339 ppi than the 8.9\u201d Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:It was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version sitting next to last year's HD version and this year's version of the 7\u201d HDX Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of CNN, FoxNews, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a slight difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My usual test of this feature is cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks and hear the bass), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  To have the sound throw back at you, you need to have a cover on it as the sound reverberates from the back of the Fire off of the cover back to you (hopefully, you followed that).One thing to point out is there is not a default equalizer with this Fire: everything sounds the same.  To get the most out of the bass and treble, as well as to turn down the mid-range, I highly recommend you downloading and installing one of the many free equalizer apps here from the Amazon app store as it makes a huge difference, especially if you are listening with headphones.The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account with the software came with the Fire.  Previously, I had to install and use an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store because like many of you I have more than one email account: Amazon eliminated the need for this aftermarket app because you can now switch back and forth between your various email accounts and it was very easy to setup my particulars.  The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.  The last tab on the top right contains a link to various deals on Amazon you can tap to open (or not) as you see fit.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app  here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There are two cameras on this model - one faces the front or toward the user / reader and one in the back.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.I really don\u2019t like the positioning of the back facing camera \u2013 primarily because if you use the Origami cover purchased here from Amazon (about the only one available as I type this review), the cover hides not only the camera but the LED flash.  That makes the back camera essentially worthless to me.Game Apps:Playing most of the games I play on my tablet is a much better visual experience than the 8.9\u201d HD model.  Now if this device would help me move up faster with Candy Crush I would be even happier!Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  Better yet, it is the \u201cpower fast\u201d charger that charges your Fire faster.  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.  Amazon touts it takes about 5 hours to charge this version of the Fire when the battery is completely empty.  I\u2019ve charged it several times when it was in the 20% - 22% remaining charge, and it took about six hours.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I pressed the button but felt pretty dumb: when the person who answered asked me how can they help, I basically said \"Hi, I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"  They laughed and I promptly let them get back to work answering other \u201cI just wanted to try this out\u201d queries.What I Wish it Had: a screen protector that was ready to go.  With all of the tapping, sliding, etc. on the screen, you can easily scratch the unit.  The screen protectors have been out of stock for a while now and I hope mine gets here soon.Overall, I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be.If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but I would recommend you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the 8.9\u201d Fire HD at $269.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Most Beautiful Screen I've Ever Seen", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae",

To see more videos on this Kindle Fire HDX, visit my YouTube channel:YouTube/JohnnySaigon2013You've already read a few detailed reviews from here, so I'll make this one simple to read: bullet points!PROS:*Beeee-ay-ew-tee-full screen: 8.9 inches at 2560x1600 resolution means the highest pixels per inch(339 PPI) for ANY tablet to date. Compare that with 299 PPI for the new iPad Air. This screen will literally blow you away. Apple is known to have the best phone and tablet screens on the market, and the new iPad Air is leaps and bounds better than the original iPad. However, compared to the Kindle HDX 8.9\", even it has to take a second seat.I read an article where DisplayMate compared this Kindle HDX's screen to that of the Nexus 10 and the new iPad Air:-100% color accuracy means whatever that is displayed is true to form. The best way to compare this is to pick up the Nexus 10(Samsung-made) and any Samsung AMOLED on Vivid settings.-This screen also has the brightest output - 527 cd/m2(or \"nits\"). This means that whether you're using it in pitch black, or on a sunny day in direct sunlight, this screen has enough brightness to excel in any situation. For a comparison, the best computer monitors output in the 400 nits range, and most TVs are in the 300 range.-Viewing angles are also top notch - you will not lose much quality even when you're not looking at it straight on.-Reflectivity is also minor. You bought this Kindle to see what's on the screen, not use it as a mirror. You don't know how important this becomes until you see a crappy screen such as cheap laptops.-Finally, it uses very little power, which means more battery life, and won't heat up and burn your hands.*Awesome stereo speakers. The virtual Dolby surround sound is really effective, and really immersive. You can crank the sound to 11 and it won't distort. By far the best speakers I've heard on any tablet or phone.*Truly lighter than \"Air.\" I hated holding the iPad 3(the most recent iPad I have). It was uncomfortable and wrist-breaking. Even with the iPad Air weight reductions, it still weighs about a pound(16 ounces). The Kindle HDX is 13.2 ounces. I can now finally read and watch videos in bed comfortably. Even holding it one-handed is now a comfortable reality.*Downloading movies, streaming videos, etc. through WiFi is super fast with the built in dual-band, dual-antenna.*This tablet is fast! Having a Snapdragon 800 processor means you'll never have to worry about apps and games slowing down on you. Having 2GB of RAM also means you can multi-task and run multiple apps to your heart's content.*It has never gotten hot or uncomfortable while holding/using it so far, so in totality the form factor and userability are excellent.*This is subjective, but I think at 8.9,\" this is the perfect screen size for a tablet. I have the old Nexus 7, and when compared to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3(5.5\"), or even my HTC One(4.7\"), there wasn't a big upgrade in screen size for me to use it more than my phones. The iPad, while having a nice screen size at 9.7,\" is too heavy and uncomfortable to use for a long session, even with the improved iPad Air. The Kindle HDX, at 8.9\" and 13.2 ounces, has the perfect combination. If you want something bigger, then just use your laptop!CONS:*There is no Micro-SD slot, so there is no potential of increasing your storage capacity. This is perhaps where the hardest decisions will be. The 16GB version has 10.9GB of useable space left, so it would not make sense if you want to download or store more than a handful of movies. Considering an HD movie can be anywhere from 2-10GB, make sure you select the right capacity for you.*There is no micro HDMI-out like on the older Kindle HD. The new HDX uses a wireless system called Miracast. This is all great, however, it is a new functionality that has not been widely implemented, meaning most likely that the TV you are using now isn't Miracast-enabled. So if you want to mirror your Kindle screen to your TV, you'll need to buy a new TV, or find an app or dongle that would provide an alternative.*The only other thing I can think of for the casual user on the fence is, because the ecosystem is not as robust as Apple iOS and pure Google Anroid, they won't have access to all those apps of the other two ecosystems. The Amazon App Store is growing rapidly, but it is climbing an uphill battle to reach the other two.CONCLUSION:The two most important factors I think people will have to decide from is:1) Do you love and live Amazon enough so that the lack of apps you would get from the iOS and Google app stores won't affect you?2) Are you one of those that uses your tablet as your universal multimedia hub, and want to store all your apps, games, music, photos/videos, and movies in there?I only play other media and games occasionally, so for me the lack of app quantity of Amazon from iOS and pure Android is not a deal breaker for me. It is for a lot of people, so in the end, it might come down to user preference and brand loyalty.Overall, for my needs, which is to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Videos, and surf the Net/read the news apps, this is the perfect tablet for me.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Miracast and other misc.", "Author": "AMB", "ReviewID": "R3B8OZYWBFO34Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I love my new Fire HDX (64Gb, wifi only with ads), but all the positives have already been reviewed at length by others, so I will concentrate on what I have not yet seen discussed elsewhere in a lot of detail:1) Display mirroring (with Miracast).  I got the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and finally managed to make it work, no thanks to Netgear who have just lost a customer.  Well, not really since I never bought a Netgear product before and arguably I didn't this time either as I bought it refurbished, but still.  Installation issues notwithstanding, after it started working, it was pretty amazing.  I tested the Miracast functionality successfully with both my Win8 laptop and my Kindle Fire HDX.  Yes, there is a very slight lag, but nothing major and I suspect the technology will only get better what with the rate of the firmware updates being pushed out by Netgear for this product, trying to keep up with their competition which I think will be fierce now that Amazon has put its weight behind the Miracast technology by doing away with the HDMI output port entirely in the Fire HDX models.  Which means that if you are emotionally attached to using an HDMI cable to connect to your external screen or TV, or just do not want to put up with the potential pain in the neck the installation of the PTV3000 may turn out to be (though to be fair, some people had no trouble whatsoever?), you will want to stick with the HD models instead.  If you are excited about Miracast and want a WiDi adapter for your TV, use some caution, because as my review of said item demonstrates, it can be a hassle to setup.A cheaper alternative is the Tronsmart T1000 Mirror2TV Wireless Display HDMI Dongle Support Miracast DLNA EZCAST AirPlay Compatible with Android OS / Apple iOS / Samsung AllShare Cast S3 S4 Note2 Note3 Note10.1 / Google Nexus4 Nexus5 Nexus7 / Amazon Kindle Fire HDX / DELL VENUE 8 PRO which performance is unfortunately not as good as the PTV3000 (noticeable time delays and pixelation when mirroring and requires use of their free proprietary app, EZCast).2) Customer service.  I have never seen any company spend so much time and effort into ensuring customers were happy with their flagship product (the Kindles, I mean.  When it comes to every other product and services, they are just as impersonal and crushing as you would expect).  I have rarely -if ever- had to contact Amazon with any of my Kindle issues before, but I was forced to contact an Amazon representative three times since my HDX arrived and each rep was unbelievably polite, helpful (and downright nice! all three of them!  What?) and went to extraordinary lengths to resolve my issues (minor hardware problems - I'll update this review upon final resolution).[UPDATED:  my issues were resolved very satisfactorily, all it took was the guts to call Amazon support in the first place... All the customer service reps I spoke with -all 6 of them by now!- were helpful, patient, reasonable and even technically competent!?  I don't understand this minor miracle, but it's certainly no coincidence and I was very glad to be able to take advantage of it.  This great level of customer support is available for all your Kindle issues, not just HDX models, by the way].One of my calls was made while testing the Mayday feature and I was stunned by how amazingly good the concept and execution of this idea was!  Kudos to Jeff Bezos, this new feature is brilliant and will gain him major customer loyalty, especially among the older set (this is not meant to be insulting as I am no spring chicken myself).3) Accessories.  This tablet is a thing of beauty and a joy forever, granted, but it is also a fingerprint magnet -especially its display which is a touch screen, of course- and the rubberized back, which was so convenient and comfortable in the 7\" original Fire, seems to have become a sponge for natural skin oils with the 8.9\" HDX model?  Fingerprints are everywhere and stay obstinately attached to every surface, not just the display, and personally I never figured on wiping them off as a full-time occupation.My solution?  DecalGirl skins (check their website for a dazzling number of choices or why not, the original DIY look: Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" DecalGirl Skin - 'Create Your Own'):  no, I do not work for them, I just spend a lot of time and as little money as possible trying to get the right accessories for my Kindles.  They are a tad expensive ($20), but they are unbelievably easy to apply, of superior quality, extremely durable, come in a huge variety of designs from colorfully eccentric to classically elegant and DecalGirl often offers up to 25% discounts on their website. They will keep your Kindle looking and feeling like new.Note that most cases easily fit over these skins but remember that if you also want a screen protector (I did!), it should be applied before the skin is applied to the body of the Kindle (front and back).  By the way, covering the front of the Kindle (the bezel around the screen) makes holding your Kindle a lot more comfortable... This is no ad for DecalGirl:  if you prefer one of their competitors (for instance:  Protective Skin Decal Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" Tablet (2013) Sticker Skins Books), do your research and go for it, I am merely pointing out that I believe getting a good quality skin for your HDX is more important than buying a case.  Also a lot cheaper than an Origami case, Amazon's preferred solution which at $50+ is just too rich for my tastes (sorry, this bon mot was just too easy)!Speaking of accessories, since I cannot recommend any one case wholeheartedly, I can at least recommend the Targus Mini Stand Designed for Apple iPad, iPad 2, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, Clear (AWE65US).  It's surprisingly practical and elegant for a simple block of acrylic!  Designed for any smartphone or tablet up to 10\", it's perfect if you like watching videos on your HDX from a desk or a table rather than balanced in your lap.4) Downloading videos.  The limitations mentioned in B. Tarbuck's review could be a problem for everyone who purchased the 64Gb model with the new downloading features in mind, which was my case... but a few months of heavy usage later, I can confirm that the points he raises are not necessarily a big deal.- First, you'll want to keep in mind that not all Prime videos are available for download as licensing rights limit what Amazon offers and which videos are Prime and downloadable is liable to change without notice.- Second, there is indeed a 25 downloaded videos maximum at any given time which personally I find is acceptable, even though I would have preferred to have heard about it beforehand rather than discover it afterwards.- Third, the Viewing Period limitation (48 hours or so depending on the video) is a lot easier to swallow when you realize it only starts applying to videos once you start watching them.So the Viewing Period limit is actually quite comparable to the Lending Library's limitations:  you just need to remember that Prime Videos are not available for streaming while you are traveling outside the US which is why you need to download them to your Fire HDX before leaving the US.  Or if you are an overseas customer:  yes, this IS discrimination!  Just kidding, it's due to the same licensing rights limits referred to above which Amazon negotiates with the content owners (Warner, Fox etc.) themselves, ie the same people who insist on different DVD regions etc.[IMPORTANT:  the 'Viewing period' limit actually applies only once you've STARTED watching a video.  As long as you simply keep your downloaded videos on your Kindle Fire for later viewing without starting the playback of the file, the Viewing Period limit is irrelevant.  Now, that's more like it!  :)  ]Personally, I invested in the 64Gb model because I am often in the position of traveling overseas for months, with very little personal internet access.  Let's not get into a discussion of what most hotels overseas -ahem UK, I am looking at you here, not that Italy or Germany or Japan have a leg to stand on either- think is 'free internet access' or the availability of English-speaking entertainment media outside the US.  Can you believe that some countries expect you to understand their own non-English language to get your entertainment?!  Just joking:  English is not my native language...  My point stands, however.Therefore purchasing the 64Gb model may be worthwhile if you like to load up your Kindle with lots of videos in preparation for a long overseas trip:  just remember that once you start watching a video, a fairly short Viewing Period time limit starts running - about 48 hours (more or less depending on the movie/show in question).  This is similar to the time limit you run into when downloading Prime Videos to your PC or renting vs. purchasing movies from Amazon, by the way... Please also note that movies and TV shows take up a huge amount of space when downloaded from Amazon, even when you do not choose the HD version, compared to your own personal videos (ripped from your own DVDs, I mean) which usually take up no more than 1 or 2 Gb per movie. Plus, your own videos have no such intrinsic Viewing Period time limit and can be re-watched as often as you want, forever, just like the videos you actually purchase from Amazon.Remember, if you are willing to actually pay money to purchase a video from Amazon, you can then download it to your device at any time (while you are in the US), and keep it on the hard disk of your Kindle Fire -and any other Kindle Fire you own, past and future- forever (or you can re-download it repeatedly).  Which is what Amazon is hoping we'll do, in fact...  That's the whole point of selling the Kindles at near cost, after all.One more relevant item of information when it come to the HDX hard disk:  the micro USB port is not OTG compatible, so you cannot simply use an OTG USB key (like this little beauty for instance: Patriot Stellar Series 64GB USB 3.0 OTG With Up To 140MB/s Transfer For Android Base Tablet/ Smartphone- PSF64GSTROTG) to easily increase the size of your Fire hard disk. Oh well...5) non-Amazon content and apps:  let's just reiterate a few points which most official reviews I have seen rarely make.- you can totally get non-Amazon apps from the Google Play store.  Or any reputable website, as long as you are careful and do a bit/a lot of research first if you don't want to be sorry later.  Download the .apk file (all Android apps are really files with an apk extension), then transfer it to the appropriate folder on your Kindle.  Opening the apk file then installs the app on your Kindle Fire and the app will afterwards appear in your Fire's Apps section. It's that easy!  This simple process is called sideloading and no, it's not difficult or complicated and does not require rooting and does not invalidate your warranty or anything:  the internet is full of simple how-tos on the subject, just begging to be read.  And Amazon is perfectly fine with your sideloading non-Amazon apps, especially free apps.Obviously Amazon will not refer to it or explain how to do it and they will avoid even mentioning it, but Jeff Bezos is well aware that lack of flexibility on this issue would be a deal breaker, even if he'd rather not admit as much officially.  Which is why it's a fairly straightforward process, even though it would have been quite easy for Amazon to prevent us from sideloading non-Amazon apps.- you can easily get non-Amazon ebooks (pdf or epub or any other commonly used ebook format, free or otherwise - B&N; etc.) to your Kindle:  just install the Calibre software on your computer and it will handle all the format converting and transferring to your Kindles, from the oldest Kindle e-reader to the latest HDX.  Plus lots of other neat and amazing features, including tagging or helping with the rental of ebooks from your public library system.  Calibre is free, it's got heaps of documentation and technical help, it's regularly updated and it can and will handle your whole ebook collection beautifully while synchronizing all your e-Readers easily.  It's like iTunes for ebooks!  If iTunes was easy to use, efficient, inclusive of formats and platforms.  And came with helpful free add-ins like Firefox does.  And did not lose your full music library the way iTunes loses mine all the time.- comic books/graphic novels/mangas and magazines in pdf format. This is a seldom mentioned advantage of the 8.9\" HDX:  its larger screen size and higher resolution makes it a great way to read comics in pdf format with the built-in pdf reader!  It's a bit less practical in cbr or cbz format (as opposed to reading comics on a PC where using a free cbr/cbz reader is best), but easily doable and well worth it for facing the hours of tedium that travel often requires.  No need to use a comic book reader app, especially since the best such apps are not free, if your comics are in pdf format!  But if your non-pdf comics library is just too extensive to convert, then you can check out ComiCat which costs $2.99:  it handles most comic formats, organizes your collection nicely on your Kindle HDX and allows easy synchronization with cloud services like Dropbox, which is pretty nifty - compared to having to copy your comics files to your HDX yourself.- other external content (music, photos, audiobooks and videos):  nothing is to stop you from ripping your favorite DVDs and CDs (reliable free and paying tools are all around you) and transferring them to your Kindle Fire.  It's even easier with an HDX than ever before!I've been doing all of the above since the Kindle Fire 1st gen all the way to the HDX without any trouble via the USB port of my computer:  a simple USB to micro USB cable -the same type of cable you use to recharge your Kindle- and you're all set!  Or send your ebooks attached to an email to your Kindle's email address:  Amazon Help pages are full of detailed descriptions about it... this email method incidentally lets you share your non-DRM ebooks with your friends and family simply by emailing them with your ebook.  Assuming their own Kindles have been set up to accept documents from your email address - this last requirement is a security measure to avoid spam.  Personally, I use this nifty 'sending books via email to a Kindle device' functionality to guilt my relatives into reading edifying books I think they would benefit from (passive-aggressive stuff about healthy diet, exercise and the like... ) and it helps with their insomnia issues, if nothing else!Google will lead you to numerous helpful how-tos explaining which folder you should copy your video/audio files to on your Kindle Fire and which free apps to use if for some reason you do not want/cannot use the default app.  Videos and Photos will show up in your gallery under your Photos section and your uploaded music and audiobooks, naturally enough, in your Music section.  If your files are in a format your Kindle Fire cannot open and you don't want the headache of having to convert your files, just use one of several apps that open most files:  personally, I use ES File Explorer to navigate the hard disk of my Fire and open all my non-Amazon content.  You can also check out MoboPlayer which plays any video file format, not just only mp4 files like the Fire default video viewer app.  These two apps are both available free on the Amazon app store and are very popular for good reasons.Again:  all of the above in point 5 works for all Fire models, not just the HDX.6) On a different, UNRELATED topic:  if for some reason you want to root your Amazon Fire in order to run the non-Amazon version of Android and be able to control the look and feel and functionality of your tablet, please be aware that you will lose all Prime membership advantages on this Fire tablet (though not on your computer or any other Fire you may own).  Such as free Instant Prime Videos and the Lending Library. And Mayday functionality, also a bonus of the FireOS.I just want to emphasize the fact that sideloading has nothing to do with rooting:  the amount of ignorance and misinformation floating about this topic is simply astonishing.  And by the way, I really don't recommend rooting a Kindle Fire, though yes, technically speaking, it is doable.  By anyone with nerves of steel.  And at least several hours of free, preferably uninterrupted time for in-depth research beforehand...  Just be prepared to take responsibility for the waste of hundreds of your dollars if you do brick your Kindle device.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed in the 8.9\" HDX vs the 8.9\" HD", "Author": "Harold W. George", "ReviewID": "R1EQJON9NR9QR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD for a year, having gotten it last Christmas (2012).  I have also been an Amazon Prime customer for some time. So I was pretty excited when I saw the hype for the new HDX.  This seemed like it would be a great upgrade.  It seemed like it had several things I wanted in the HD, like all my icons on one page, a rear facing camera, and faster Wi-Fi and internet, and a lighter, thinner package.  Since I already had the HD, this should be a pretty seamless upgrade.Well that's not how things went for me.  First of all taking the HDX out of the box, it felt really cheap and flimsy compared to my HD.  Even though both tablets are 8.9\", the HDX has a slightly smaller display.  It actually seemed like a tablet you might buy your 10 year old.  I already was having my doubts, but let's fire it up and give it a try.I started it up and went through all the registration hoops, and then had to go to the cloud to get all of my apps loaded onto the HDX.  Well, immediately, I noticed that apps I had purchased were missing.  Most notably was Weatherbug, which is my main weather app on the HD.  I went to the app store, and it's not there, either.  Ditto a calendar, contact list and calculator I have on the HD.  Apparently these are not compatible with the HDX.There are some items on the HDX that are not on the HD, as well, but for someone that has already set up all their apps, this is disappointing.  Most of the games, candy crush, deer hunter, pipes, etc., that I play came over, but you lose the levels you have achieved playing them on the HD.  That was a big disappointment.The other thing missing from the HDX is an HDMI port to connect the tablet to your TV.  The HDX uses some kind of sync technology, but it would not work with any of the 4 TVs, two of which are HD flat screen, in my house.  So there is no way I can watch videos or movies on my TV.  That was the real deal breaker.In addition, Amazon touts a much better display, faster Wi-Fi and faster browsing.  I didn't see it.  comparing the 2 tablets side by side, I noticed no difference in speed, and couldn't discern a difference in the screen quality.  They are both very good.  When I turned both tablets on from a cold start, the HD actually booted up and was ready to go slightly faster than the HDX,  The browser interface is different and much less intuitive in the HDX than in the HD.If you like to read books, which my wife and I do a lot of, you will also be disappointed in the ability to control font size in the HDX.  In the HD I have the font set to 7.  There is no comparable setting in the HDX.  You get small, bigger, bigger yet, and HUGE.  None of those suited me like the settings on the HD, which are easily adjusted.If you already have an HD and are thinking about an upgrade, I would suggest you not waste the money.  You are not gaining much with the HDX (the rear camera, mostly), and are giving up a lot.  If you haven't purchased a tablet yet and are considering the Kindle Fire, I think I would still buy the HD, the prices have dropped to $229 for the 8.9\", which I feel is a great value.If you find you must buy the 8.9\" HDX, definitely stay away from the Origami cover.  It's expensive and it's a piece of junk.  I returned it along with the HDX, and would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE:I have since returned both the HDX and the Origami case.  Seeing how this was a Christmas present to me from my wife, we are both disappointed.  I certainly hope Amazon rethinks the HDX and it's marketing.  For now, my old 8.9\" HD workhorse is still going strong!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Display; Compares Favorably to Competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2YPITHVTYLCZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the top model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  (this tablet). This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an 8MP rear-facing camera, an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3 for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVHBC7NMNOGU for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I noticed with this tablet was how amazingly light it was. Not only is it 34% lighter than last year's 8.9\" tablet, it's even lighter than last year's 7\" tablet! This really is a one-handed tablet. Even better, they shaved the weight off without sacrificing build quality. The tablet looks and feels solid, stable, and secure.A fairly common complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet is that a slight blue glow is visible at the edges of the screen when there is a white background. I saw no such blue glow on my 8.9\" tablet. According to DisplayMate Technologies, the backlight on the HDX 8.9\" has white LEDs, so no blue glow source.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 2560x1600 (323 ppi) vs 1920x1200 (254 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement in sunlight, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby digital stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Amazingly light (13.2 oz vs. 20 oz) and noticeably smaller (9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" vs. 9.4\" x 6.4\" x 0.35\"). This is the first large tablet I've seen that is truly a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time. That was definitely not true of last year's model.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.5GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is smoother and faster, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations. The additional 1GB of RAM doesn't hurt (2GB vs. 1GB for last year's model).Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: Last year's HD had only a front-facing HD (720p) camera. This year's HDX has that front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing 8 MP camera, complete with LED flash and the ability to take a 1080p video.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you will need to purchase one of last year's models.Battery Life: The battery life has been increased, from 10 to 12 hours. Additionally, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 18 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is fine; I find that I'm charging it about twice a week with regular use.Price: It's more expensive ($379 vs. $299 (the price when last year's model launched; last year's model is currently $229)) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in the launch-day price is $60. That's a larger spread than the other tablets, where the difference between the 2013 HDX and 2012 HD is only $10, or the 2013 HD vs. the 2012 Kindle Fire, where the price has dropped by $20. This one isn't a slam-dunk, as the other two are. What you get for that price increase is pretty good, though, including the lighter weight, the added RAM, the longer battery life, the rear camera, the better display, the faster processor, and the updated software. Still, while I can definitely recommend this tablet, you might want to wait a couple of months for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price, which it likely will do next year. Or, if you want the larger size and don't need the latest and greatest, fastest and lightest, $229 for the regular Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a very good price.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 10 and the just-announced Apple iPad Air. This year's Google Nexus 10 has not yet been officially announced, although some details have leaked; I'll update when I have more information.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the HDX and the Nexus at 2560x1600 (323 ppi) and the iPad Air at 2048x1536 (264 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors. The HDX display is 8.9\" (measured diagonally), the iPad Air display is 9.7\", and the Nexus is 10\". In the recent DisplayMate Technologies Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet got the highest score they have ever given:\"Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy.\"It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Air is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Air has stereo sound. The iPad Air also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Air both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" and 13.2 oz.Nexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 9.4\" x 6.6\" x 0.29\" and 16.8 oz.The HDX is definitely smaller and it's significantly lighter than is the iPad Air, although the iPad is a bit thinner. The size difference isn't too surprising when you consider that the iPad Air has a larger screen (with a lower resolution, though).Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Air have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX has a front 720p camera and an 8MP rear camera. Realistically, I doubt that the extra resolution on the HDX will make that much of a difference but if you take a lot of pictures, the HDX may be your best choice.Battery Life: HDX = 12 hours (18 hours when reading); Nexus = TBD; iPad Air = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, though, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the parental controls and options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its software update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real corporate productivity, though, I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this category. With the HDX at $379 and the Nexus at $399, both are priced significantly less than the iPad Air at $499. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.I don't think there is a single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 18-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is decent, particularly for what you get, and it's a light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.For a couple of reasons, I have all three of Amazon's 2013 tablets. So which one should you get?Kindle Fire HD - A good choice for a child or for a first tablet when you're not sure just how much you'll use a tablet. The price can't be beat and while it's clearly a budget tablet, it's not cheaply made. The only corner they cut is that they don't include a camera, so no Skype or self-portraits.Kindle Fire HDX - A good choice if you want the smallest lightest tablet of the bunch. If you'll be regularly on the go with your tablet and you want something you can easily slip into a purse or coat pocket, this is the tablet for you. You should also get this tablet over the Kindle Fire HD if you need a front-facing camera or you need the extra power. And you should get this over the larger version if price is an issue, since it's $150 cheaper.Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" - This is the one I use most around the house because I really like the large size and I love that I get that size with that amazingly low weight. If you need a rear camera, this is the tablet to get. And the one to get if price isn't an issue. I stick by my recommendation above, though, that you should probably wait for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price.This year, Amazon released three good, solid, highly competitive tablets. Personally, I think they got it right and I can recommend all three.Note: I check back here pretty regularly. If you have questions, I'll be happy to try to answer them.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful tablet!", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R23L7BXQOFIB6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my HDX 8.9\" on the day it was released and have been enjoying it since then. Here are some of my impressions that may help you decide whether or not to buy one for yourself.1. Very nice to hold. This tablet is amazingly lightweight and thin. The HDX weight is about 1/3 less than the iPad Air! It is quite thin, and in a very good way. The back is nicely rubberized for a good grip, unlike some cell phones that are too thin and slippery, so much so that they feel fragile and are difficult to manipulate without a good case. The HDX is very, very comfortable to hold and manage.2. AMAZING screen. The screen on the HDX is the best I've ever seen. \"Beyond HD\" is not an empty marketing phrase. This thing surprised me with its color, clarity, and brightness. It still reflects noticeably, though.3. Easy to navigate. I can quickly and easily switch among reading, watching videos, shopping, and more. I happen to like the carousel system, because it lets me return effortlessly to any of the last few things I looked at. With the instant response of the touchscreen of the HDX, I can find books faster than on my Paperwhite.4. App selection. Most of the apps I want are available for my HDX. Dropbox and almost anything Google, including YouTube, are what I miss the most. But YouTube works just fine on the Silk Browser. And there are plenty of news apps, games, alarm clocks, The most annoying aspect of apps for Fire is the prevalence of 3rd-party apps that do a poor imitation of the original. There are scads of apps that try to connect you with Google, YouTube, etc. but do so poorly.5. Seamlessly integrated with all things Amazon. I buy the vast majority of books and movies from Amazon, and my HDX provides an unbeatable way to enjoy them. I have come to prefer watching movies and reading books on my HDX over and above anything else I have, including a nice large HD television with sound bar and fancy ultrabook with >HD resolution. Plus, I can shop from my favorite retailer. The HDX makes it easy and enjoyable to watch movies and TV shows, read books, shop, listen to music, go through my email, catch up on the news, and more. Our family has owned the 1st and 3rd generation iPads and numerous smartphones including the latest iPhones. When you consider CONTENT, other tablets cannot match the ease and seamless integration of the HDX.6. Mayday. I've only used it once, but I was pleasantly surprised. I honestly was not expecting Mayday to live up to the hype Amazon is putting out there, but my experience was just like the commercials! Hardly any wait and a prompt answer to my question.  Amazing!You may have recognized in the past that great hardware is nothing without great software. Well, in 2013, you might say that great hardware and software are nothing without great content. And now you can get all 3 from Amazon!!", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The good the bad and the ugly - Missing items like \"Officesuite\"", "Author": "Artist formerly known as Amazon Customer \"ghe...", "ReviewID": "R2Y13IX845STIG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I am exactly the audience that Amazon aims at with the Kindle.  I am complexity immersed in the Amazon universe as a Prime member for the last 7-8 years (and customer long before that) all of my music is on the cloud player and a huge consumer of Kindle books and prime videos. Amazon makes it easy by offering more than competitive pricing including freebies and really low cost books, music and apps. You don't get that with iTunes and the App store.  I used to buy a lot from the Apple store but since I discovered how much more I always had to pay for everything I switched and haven't been back.This is my sixth Kindle starting with a Kindle 2, Kindle 3, original Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9. So the day the HDX's were announced I ordered the 8.9.  I am a gadget freak so in addition to the multiple computers I own, I also own a New Nexus 7, and an Asus Vivotab Smart. I have also played a bunch with various iPads.The good:I can honestly and truly say this is the fastest, smoothest most appealing tablet by far (in terms of hardware)that I have ever held in my had.  The screen is simply stunning, my Google Nexus 7 has a gorgeous screen and is the same resolution as the 7\" HDX.  but in spite of the similar dpi (326 vs 339) the screen on the HDX in my opinion is more vibrant, the colors just pop and at times it looks almost 3D.  One thing I haven't seen in any of the reviews is all that much about the sound. It is truly AMAZING sound for a tablet and frankly is better than my HP Envy with Beats Audio.  I watched Galaxy Quest on Thursday night.  It is one of my favorite movies is almost mesmerizing on this tablet.  I keep hearing about \"virtual surround\" on devices with two speakers.  I have never really experienced it.  But watching this movie I could hear Foley sound behind me!  Music is sharp and clear and not at all tinny like an iPad.  Web browsing is incredible, it is fast and smooth and easy to use. The enhancements to the interface and browser functionality work really well. I can honestly say this is the first tablet I have seen that I can really use as more than a casual browser.  I much prefer a PC most of the time but I am confident I can use this on the road.  With a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse I have full function.  Screen sensitivity is excellent and the on board keyboard is terrific but for these older hands separate devices are needed for real work.  (which makes my \"ugly\" part even more frustrating.Mayday is as good as advertised.The Bad:I have found several apps that don't seem to work on this including Madden 2014 Football.  I am sure they will be fixed in a matter of days but it is an irritation because I want to play!Speaking of play, it is really irritating that Amazon and Google continue to have an impasse on allowing downloads from the Google Play store. It may be true that Android is so customized that many apps won't work properly.  But many do if you know how to side load which isn't true for most users.  But what it does do is give people a lot of ammunition to the \"The Kindle is just a machine for Amazon sales\" argument.  Virtually every review I see says the Kindle family is only useful for people that are married to Amazon already.  Virtually every time I am in a retail store like Best Buy that has Kindles and other tablets I hear the store personnel steering away from Kindle for that reason. It is a very short sided policy on the part of Amazon.  Yes you bind your already loyal customers more closely to you but a more open policy would sell far more tablets and bring in many more new customers. The relatively small amount of sales lost to Google Play would be way overcompensated by the number of new customers Amazon would gain.  And it would take away the biggest criticism of Kindle.  I know that Amazon is providing a lot of encouragement to developers to provide apps for the Kindle store. One of those developers should be Google!Make sure if you plan on using the new Amazon Prime movie download service that you get at least the 32 Gig. HDX and preferably the 64.  The average 2 hour movie in 1080p is almost 10 gig of space, which is roughly twice what it would be on a PC.The Ugly:Missing promised items like OfficeSuite? One of the reasons I was really excited was that an office suite was supposed to be available on this and available for the previous Kindle Fire devices I already own at a fee.  There are a number of \"Office\" apps in the store, most of which are mediocre at best.An \"office suite\"  includes at a minimum a word processor, some kind of spreadsheet and a presentation editor.  When I gave up searching and contacted Mayday I was told that no I wouldn't find an app but if I had a document on the device I could open it.  She couldn't tell me what file formats it would open, like if it would open spreadsheets or presentations.That is not considered an office suite, that is a document viewer.  I do not see any way to create documents or even edit existing documents. At this point all major tablet vendors bundle at least basic Office capability. MS Surface and other Windows tablets offer MS Office 2013,  Apple offers iWorks suite which appears to be really nice.  I am using QuickOffice on my Nexus 7 which is of course written by Google and free for Nexus devices and a part of Android 4.4 KitKat.  Not providing an office suite when everybody else is and then trying to promote your device as being work and business friendly is not a good thing.  Saying you have an office suite when all you have is a viewer is false advertising and frankly shakes my loyalty to Amazon badly.Update:Actually when I copy something over from my PC and open it there is an \"OfficeSuite\" that shows up long enough to view the item and now yes it does open docx, xlsx and pptx files in addition to pdf. And it does allow for at least some rudimentary editing.  From the icon and capabilities it appears to be OfficeSuite Viewer from Mobile Systems Inc. The same app is available for free on Google Play and the Amazon store for free.But there is NO ability to create new documents and the application does not appear as available anywhere on the Kindle.  The average user isn't going to know how to find the viewer the way you and I just did.  There is an OfficeSuite Pro that I was not prompted to download that costs $4.99.What is included does not in any way constitute an \"included Officesuite\" any way you would care to define it.I am not an average user.  I support enterprise middleware and MS SQL systems for a major corporation and have been a systems professional for over 20 years.  If I have troubles what  kinds of problems will the average user have?", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mirroring is great! Mayday is unbelievable!", "Author": "kdsm", "ReviewID": "RVW91PO437UBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for my wife. She already had a Kindle Fire 8.9 HD and was in love with it. She uses the oldone for reading books (works great),e-mail,and her jigsaw puzzles which she is fascinated with. She thought it couldn't get anybetter. I am a retired electronics guy and was blown away by the specifications of the new HDX with its fast quad core processorand its graphics coprocessor. I was particularly drawn to the MIRACAST capability that was mentioned. This is a wireless way tosend the screen content of the Kindle to a HDMI equipped T.V.There isn't much written about the MIRACAST feature, but I found out that NETGEAR makes a streaming video device called thePush2TV (PTV3000) which I also bought from Amazon at the same time. It arrived before the Kindle Fire HDX.I was so proud of myself for finding and downloading the \"firmware\" update for the Push2TV and I was ready for the Kindle to arrive. When the KIndle arrived it was cold from the outside and I decided to let it warm  to room temperature and wait for wifeyto come home from work.Wifey arrives and we began the process of trying to connect to the Push2TV device. I followed the directions to the letter that was a BIG mistake! I tapped the MAYDAY button (unbelievable genius that) and was connected to a very pleasant young ladywho knew less about \"mirroring\" than I did but she REALLY tried. Unfortunately that connection was cut off. I tapped the MAYDAYbutton again and was again connected to a pleasant lady who couldn't help me and was again disconnected. I think the disconnections were due to the fact that the MAYDAY operators took control of my Kindle and accidentally disconnected the WiFilink. I was getting frustrated at this point and I was also very disappointed, The mirroring was a big reason for my HDX purchase.I tapped the MAYDAY button for the third time (wifey says I'm stubborn, I prefer tenacious) and again spoke to a very pleasantyoung lady who could not have been any nicer. She and I could not resolve the problem either but she set me up to receive a call from an Amazon help operator. The call arrived within seconds and again I'm speaking to a really nice young lady (do you see a pattern here?). This lady's name was Charlie and she couldn't help me either but promised to research the problem andconnect me with an I.T. deity which I requested for after Thanksgiving because it was already after 10:00 p.m. my time.Here comes all the good stuff. Even though it was late, I was determined to make this thing work I'm retired and can work all night if I want to. I started at the beginning! This time I DIDN'T follow directions about pushing the button on the side of the Push2TV box! I did push the reset button with a paper clip on the Push2TV unit. I observed my T.V. screen and noticed that the versionnumber on my Push2TV was 2.4.3 this is really important! I did NOT need to upload new firmware. The firmware in my unit as shipped was NEWER than on the NETGEAR website which was 2.4.26! In the end all you have to do is connect the Push2TV toyour T.V. the turn on mirroring in the Kindle and your done.Mirroring is beyond belief. The picture on the T.V. is stunning.

I returned that one, because the bezel around the screen, invaded the screen to much to make the device prove useful when reading magazines, and for viewing some webpages.Also, I have owned pretty much every tablet made including, the ipad 1 & 2, Samsung Galaxy Tab (orginial), Kindle Fire HD 7\", Kindle Paperwhite, Microsoft Surface Pro, and most recently the Dell Venue Pro 8.I feel qualified to speak to the usability of this tablet in comparison to the others and in its own right. What I will not do in my review is review the technical aspects of the HDX, as you can read them on the product page.1. First Impressions:This device is solidly built, and it light as a feather. It is really a shame to put a case on this device as anything that makes this baby heavier is a shame. For the women out there that may be wondering, if you threw this in your handbag, your arm would not fall off, provided you have it stowed in a sleeve case or very light weight case. The speakers are placed at the top of the device and have a good output of sound at low and high volume. If you are using the device flat on a table it can muffle the sounds a bit.2. Screen:The screen is perfect. No blue haze, or abnoramalities whatsoever. The brightness of the screen is wonderful, and while I have not used the device outside, I have used it sitting near a window with the sun streaming in and I had no problems seeing the screen.3. Ecosystem (OS)It should not be a surprise to anyone that this device points to Amazon's ecosystem. People that knock this tablet for this seem to be off base. If you want a google tablet with no restictions, then buy a Nexus or some other type of tablet. Amazon is not going to build a table that points to another company ecosystem, anymore than Apple would allow you to interact with Google directly. Lowering the rating of the HDX for this reason is unwarranted.Using the Kindle OS is simple, and the onscreen hints help for first time users. If you are coming from a previous generation Kindle you should be able to navigate without much trouble with a few small differences. I also use Amazon's Cloud service for photos and docs, and you probably should also. Installing the Cloud Photo app on your cell phone will allow any picture you take to upload to the cloud and once you register your HDX, they will automatically populate. Such an awesome and thoughtful feature. The Cloud Doc feature works the same, install on your PC or Mac and any document you drag into the doc folder will automatically show up on your HDX4. Music Player:To my surprise, the HDX will show the lyrics to certain songs that have the Xray enabled. This is an awesome feature if you are someone that likes to know the words to songs, or if you are like me, a singer, and need to actually KNOW the lyrics to some songs. If you also have songs in Amazon's Cloud Music Player these will automatically populate on your Kindle when you register is, and if the lyrics are available they automatically show. You can also place your music directly on your Kindle via usb as well from your PC or MAC if you want.5. Kindle Book ReaderI read entire book on my HDX just to make sure that I did not have eye strain or any other issues before deciding to rate this tablet. Amazon for me has always been about books first and of course my HDX excels here as well. I read well into the night and all the next day with no eye fatigue, or issues.6. Video/Prime SubscriptionOk, people here are getting upset about the prime subscription. For the $79 bucks a year you get free 2 day shipping on most anything in the Amazon market place and a thousands of free movies, of which some are downloadable, 1 free book you can borrow each month, and now a free book that is new to the Kindle store to preview. That's a lot of stuff to consider, and yes there are improvements to be made, such as choosing a movie from the Prime Movies to Download category showed movies that I could not download along side the downloadable ones (so why the category?) but overall, its not a deal breaker. You have a month to decide either way.The videos are beautiful, with wonderful color and sound. Not much to say here. This was another expected point.7. ProductivityI wanted to see if the tablet could really function as quasi laptop for when I was out of the office and still needed to stay in touch with work. I added my Microsoft Exchange Account (along with my personal email accounts) and was surprised to see that my work email was able to sync easily along with my Exchange Calendar. All my contacts were added to the HDX as well. The true test came when I needed to open a spreadsheet emailed to me, which I was able to do. The HDX comes with a program that allows you to view office documents, to edit requires you to purchase the full version. I own my own business, so being out of the loop is never really an option, and I am always looking for devices to allow me some acces to work without carrying 3 or 4 different devices.8. PrintingI was able to print to my HP Laserjet printer, the HDX required me to download a HP Printer App, which allowed me to print an email just fine. You are supposed to be able to print emails and docs. I would like to be able to print from the Silk Browser as well, but I'm not sure that this device allows that. Maybe I'm wrong. Somebody please correct me if I am.9. Mayday Button:This may seem gimmicky, until you actually need help, which I did. I purchased another HDX for my husband, and while setting up his, all the books and music and newsstand items synced, but not the apps. Odd to say the least! I pushed the Mayday Button and within seconds I was connected to a nice lady who tried to help me, but was unable to fix my problem. She transfered me to another woman, who I could not see as she was with Kindle Second Level Support, but who I was able to speak to online. She needed to call me back becuause I had to reset the HDX, which she did right away, and helped me solve my issue. Which by the way was to deregister and then re-register the device and everything was able to sync perfectly.10. Magazine Reading:As I stated earlier reading a magazine on the 7\" HDX is just too small to see the pictures and text completely. The 8.9\" solves that problem, opening up a whole new world for me. I subscribe to several boating magazines, where there are a lot of pictures of beautiful boats that I want to see. Also, utilizing the 'reading view' allows you to pull the article you are reading into one cohesive reading screen. Great!11. BrowsingSilk is fast and easy to use. Not sure why people do not like it. Not much to say here.12. BluetoothI was able to pair the HDX to a Bose Speaker easily and an external keyboard within seconds. Again, not much to say here, bluetooth works as expected.In conclusion, I hoped I have answered any questions you may have from the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" I cannot really speak to gaming, as I do not use any gaming apps, but take it from somebody that loves trying out new tablet, this one is definately one I'd recommend to someone that loves to read, watch movies, read a few emails, and listen to their favorite music. This a consumption device, and all roads lead you to being able to read, watch, listen or browse easily and quickly.**Update 12/21/2013**I thought I'd update you on how my and my husband's experience has been with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.My husband has an Ipad2 which he uses daily. I have noticed that he uses the Kindle Fire a lot more everyday. I asked him about his experience and he told me that the Kindle Fire is much lighter and the screen resolution is better. The only thing that stops him for using it fully, it that he has some apps he paid for on the Ipad that he does not want to pay for again. He is a bit of a technophobe, and he has also found that navigating the Kindle is pretty easy.We also purchased the device with special offers and he really likes it. He likes getting the special deals on the lock screen, and even the recommendations from the Carousel.He is a big Netflix, Slingbox, HBOGO user, and he finds that the Kindle Fire handles all of these apps well.My experience is really surprising for me, as I find myself using my Kindle Fire HDX for work a lot more. I can easily look up information on our company website when I am away from my office, and even respond to emails easily. I am having a bit a trouble transferring documents to my Kindle via usb for some reason. PDFs and word docs transfer easily, but for some reason excel files will not. Not sure why I keep getting an error. Beware though, it does take a few minutes for docs transferred via usb to show up on the Kindle for some reason.Working with the docs with the Office Suite App is pretty easy too!Revision 1/4/2014There seems to be some problem with my Fire HDX hanging a lot. I am getting a message saying that I do not have a wireless connection, when clearly I have full bars. I have made sure there is no issue with my WI-FI - none of my other devices are losing a signal. The only fix is to disconnect from the network and reconnect and then I can continue with what I was doing.I also have had an issue playing videos. Both on Prime, and on the A&E; App. At first I thought it was the app, so I closed it an reopened, still was unable to play videos. Next I tried to watch a Amazon video and was unable to even pull up the first screen that pops up when you press video. I had to turn my Fire on and off before I was able to play any videos. I do not that sometimes these devices need to be turned off and on to 'clear' or reset them, but with these two issues, I'm getting a little concerned. The WI-FI issue is starting to be a hourly occurance. I am going to have to press Mayday to find out what is going on. I will have to lower my review by one star. This whole device is dependent on the wireless connection. If that does not work well, then it's just a nice looking paperweight.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Let's take a look....", "Author": "ND Mike \"rabid1\"", "ReviewID": "RB19URRPGZ104", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first. I have been one of the most outspoken people against Kindle tablets. The lack of hardware options and the proprietary interface always were a big minus to me. That is why writing this review is painful in soooo many ways.As a big supporter and developer for the lesser brand and generic tablets I have owned around 50 tablets in the last 3 years. I always look at hardware potential first, OS functionality second because that can be fixed. That is also why I decided to check out the Fire HDX 8.9. The hardware specs made it difficult to believe it can't deliver. It does indeed deliver.While benchmarks can often be misleading in real world application but they still give a good performance comparison and an idea of what to expect. In Quadrant it hits with a blazing 19,546 and in Antutu it jumps in at 31,765. To put this into perspective the Galaxy Note * get's about 18,000 in Antutu.The tablet is thin and light to the point of thinking I got an empty shell, but it still manages to feel solid. I have an Afunta 8 inch that while a little heavier still feels like it is going to break in your hands. As thin as the HDX is there is no flex to the case.When I booted the HDX the display is obviously the first thing I noticed. (OK the boot speed surprised me first) It is really crisp and bright and the colors are crisp. Even when set at the lowest brightness movies are still entirely watchable. The touchscreen itself is very responsive, a little sensitive so it took a a bit of getting used to. But having big fingers isn't the tablet fault.Both the N and A wifi are strong and solid. The 5GHZ connection is the best of the 3 tablets I have that use it. The 32GB HP Touchpad is the closest. I can hold -55dbm all the way out to the curb. With Netflix set to the highest quality it needs no refresh time when the movie starts.The speaker quality is easily the best I have experienced. Not just volume but actual sound quality.The rear camera with flash always sounds great. I have several tablets with this feature and up until I bought the Sero 7 Pro it has always been short of useless. The HDX exceeds the 7 Pro. The pictures taken with flash off the HDX look like they came off a camera, not a tablet with a camera on it.As for the things the HDX is missing. HDMI out, MicroSD, I can't knock off points for thing that you should know about before you buy. Lack of research on the part of the buyer isn't the manufacturers fault. Just like knocking a tablet for not having Google Play when it isn't a Google certified device.  You don't buy a chain saw to hammer nails do you?As for apps it is simple enough to side load apps onto the HDX.I really was planning on writing a scathing review thus justifying my dislike for proprietary tablets. But as a pure tablet the Kindle Fire HDX is amazing. There are tablets within the price point that may have more features, but none can do what the HDX does as well as the HDX. That goes for much more expensive tablets as well. Time will tell if there will be a lot of independent development on the HDX but I would guess the hardware will draw developers like candy draws a fat kid.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "one more", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "RLED3IV8E8HNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been buying kindles since the 1st generation, so I will leave the very wordy reviews to others and simply tell you, this is the fastest smoothest kindle so far.

Ferrell \"virtualgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R26J06WBJ4XIPE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first say I really wanted to be a Kindle Fire HDX fan. I recently ditched an iPad 4 in favor of the Kindle but found ultimately that the device just doesn't perform. Upon receiving the Kindle I connected to my lab network powered by an Ubiquiti Unifi AP-LR which provides 802.11n MIMO. I went about downloading my cloud stored apps and books but found some interesting symptoms.When downloading my Kindle would sometimes timeout after prolonged periods of waiting with no start of the download, other times with apps like Olive Tree's Bible Study I would download one of the Bibles and the download would stall and timeout at different points maybe after 1MB or even nearly complete. When surfing my page load times were unbearable. It wasn't just that my pages loaded slowly but my pages wouldn't start to load until several seconds after hitting a link or enter at best. Sometimes they would never load. I tried restarting the Kindle, resetting the Kindle, completely erasing the Kindle, de-registering and registering the Kindle again. I changed my wireless security, I changed from HT20 to HT40, I assigned static IPs vs. DHCP, I used public DNS versus my internal DNS server. I turned every single device off in the house, disabled Amazon's page surfing booster and still didn't see a performance improvement. I downloaded a Wifi Analyzer and watched the Kindle drop the signal strength every few seconds, I pinged internal servers and saw fairly typical responses but if I pinged an external server I saw between 10-15% packet losses. Other devices on the network did not experience the same performance and even other Android devices running the same analyzer never saw the same signal drop at all.I called Kindle customer service who asked me to do all I had already done and then went on to ask that I reset the router I use to power over 40 different devices including our virtual machines in a lab environment. When I explained to them why I couldn't they told me it was because I had too many \"people\" on my network that my Kindle didn't work as fast despite no other machines experiencing the same. I eventually conceded and reset the router, no difference. I open the Kindle IP up to the internet completely unprotected by the firewall and still got no different response. The last recommended step per Amazon was to drive to an Internet cafe and try their internet. Despite how ridiculous that sounded I did go to another location and get on their wireless connection with the same results. I exchanged the Kindle for another Kindle thinking I had a defective unit. The second Kindle did have marginally better performance but still the same symptoms so today I forfeited and got a RMA to go back to the iPad.As a device the interface is great, I didn't have an issue with reading a book or using an application if it worked but it seldom worked and since tablets are primarily internet connected devices it just isn't anything above one star without functioning wireless. Prior to boxing it up the Kindle started to not show a MAC address or valid wireless option and would take several restarts to get the wireless connection to appear again. I may have left out one of the resolutions I tried but I believe I went well beyond what a typical consumer would do anyway to troubleshoot a device.If Amazon's engineers need it, I finally ended up on channel 1 of HT40 for the best performance which is to say I was able to surf with still long delays or no page load at all unless I sent the request a second time. I think it's fairly common but the initial ping was often times 4 to 5x longer then the subsequent replies and the software my wireless APs run showed the Kindle as going in and out of powersave mode from second to second. I booted up Wireshark and did notice that when pinging an address from the time I started the command using Fing on the Kindle to the time it showed up on my network was near equivalent to the maximum ping response time minus the average ping response time. I have a feel that the power save features of the wireless chipset may give an additional hour or so of run time but create a performance issue and since it isn't user selectable it's a pain.Thanks again Amazon, better luck on the next release.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "UPDATE: Kindle Fire HDX was NOT what I expected!!!", "Author": "Bennett Jackson", "ReviewID": "R2G1JT25SYDYDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently ordered the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and I was very happy with the device, if only for the 4 hours that the Kindle actually worked properly. The Kindle reset on it's own once or twice within a span of twenty minutes, but it eventually loaded after a few minutes. Then the device reset itself after I tried to start up a new app for my e-mail, it took 20 minutes with the Kindle resetting over and over before it came back on. I contacted customer service and I was told that my problem would have to be forwarded to the Kindle developers and I probably wouldn't hear back for a few business days.So far my Kindle is still running through the power cycle, over and over, but if I don't get this issue resolved and receive a new Kindle within the next week I will be demanding a refund.I did enjoy the high-def quality of the screen and how it played videos. I just wish Amazon got rid of all the bugs before putting stock into this new device. I also happened to order the Origami case and I am very happy with this accessory.I really hope this was a fluke and I happened to receive the one Kindle in the whole bunch that didn't work. I'll update my review if I happen to receive a new Kindle.UPDATE:Earlier this week I received a brand new replacement Kindle. Fortunately it seems that the first Kindle Fire HDX that I received just happened to be a, one in a million, defective device. I wanted to wait a few days before I reviewed this item for the second time. I did this so I could see if my new Kindle had the same problems as the old one and I wanted to be able to play with and try to experiment with all the bells and whistles.Display: The display is crisp and clear, with no blue bleeding around the border. This was a problem that some people reported, but that isn't the case with mine.Ease of Use: The Kindle Fire HDX is very simple and easy to use. I have yet to use the Mayday button, but the mere fact that it is there makes all the difference.Apps: There are a lot of apps available for the Kindle and I have downloaded most of the same games and apps that I use on my phone. There are a few apps that are not availble for the Kindle, but they are few and far between.Video: I have used my Amazon Prime membership to watch several free movies and tv shows on the Kindle and I am very impressed with the resolution and playback.Books: I really enjoy using the Kindle to read books. I was dead set against using an e-reader, but my growing hardback and paperback collection and the slowly dwindling space in which to put my books, has made me rethink purchasing a Kindle. I like how the kindle allows me to place bookmarks, toggle text size and most importantly the price of each Kindle version of books I read.The only real issue I had with Amazon, was how long it took them to send me a replacement.

I hoisted the HDX in one hand and my \"old\" Kindle Fire HD in the other, and it was the proverbial night-and-day moment. The fact it's slightly smaller and thinner as well is great, but holding it for a long time, say reading in bed, the older one made my arthritic hands carp and grumble every time. This one does not.Although I had specified the \"no-offers\" option in my order (which is what I got, let me add) all of a sudden last night at around 10:30 PM I suddenly started getting \"offers,\" much to my shock. However, that turned into an enjoyable experience: I got to test, firsthand, the new Mayday button. I spent perhaps five minutes chatting with a friendly girl named Deborah who, once she verified my claim, took over my Kindle and fixed my problem. This, admittedly, was not an earth-shaking concern, but I was very impressed with how easy it was to use this new service as well as its novelty. iPod, eat your heart out!Two small complaints, neither of which impel me to change my rating of the device from five to four stars: a few of the apps I BOUGHT for the Kindle Fire HD apparently will not work on the new one; and I miss the variety of \"wallpaper\" available on my earlier one, being left with this slightly odd copper and blue whatever-it-is that appears each time the Kindle opens. I would enjoy having the ability to change the wallpaper at will as I do other Android devices, such as my LG cell.Admittedly, I've used it for only a few days.

Wanted the new HDX too - it was shiny and seemingly fabulous.  Advertising promises \"faster\" and better display, and \"mayday.\", etc.  HAD to have it!  Got it about 40 days ago - had issues with it right away:  No volume on device once any earbuds are removed and had to hard start it to get sound back (happened often). Videos which were deleted were still taking up storage on the device even though I couldn't actually access the deleted video any longer.  Had to force stop apps and restart; device frozen/unresponsive.  Had to do factory reset.  Kept calling Mayday, which is a great concept except that when you have to power down to fix something Mayday disconnects.  Problems with Wifi (would drop or show as only 1 bar while my Kindle Fire HD had full wifi bars and never drops). Videos slower to download than on my HD.  I expected the HDX would be \"better\" based on the advertising; I think it would be if everything works as promised.  Finally, when I had no volume again and it had crashed the night before, I called Amazon and requested a replacement.  Today, received a REFURBISHED HDX to replace the 40-day old HDX.  Not acceptable Amazon!  I paid for a NEW HDX.  Refurbished can be a good option when you pay the cost of a refurbished device.  I am returning the replacement (the refurbished HDX) and am also returning the HDX I bought 40 days ago.  Amazon originally stated because I am past the 30 days they would only refund 80% of HDX cost, not 100%.  Guess I should not have been patient in trying to make the HDX work - should have returned it immediately.  Amazon has agreed now to refund 100% once they receive the returned items.  All of my frustration could be avoided if they would have sent me a NEW replacement, not refurbished (AND offered to do it before the 30 days expired when I was calling \"Mayday\" every few days).  Not cool, Amazon!  The lesson I learned:  If your HDX doesn't work perfectly immediately, send it back, don't be patient.  I also learned that Amazon customer service is not as terrific as I had once thought they were.Updated comment:  When I finally received my refund,  it wasn't the full amount expected.  Amazon imposed a restocking fee.  I had to call them, explain my situation again and  request the restocking fee be refunded.I did end up ordering a new HDX and paid in full for it.  It works great and I'm happy with it.  However, note that when the first HDX was purchased, I bought it on an installment plan being offered at the time.  Two weeks ago they charged me the second installment on the returned (first) HDX.  I had to call Amazon, explain the situation again and they are \"working on reversing\" that installment.

Here is my take on this, my second Kindle Fire. I've been waiting on a tablet with decent resolution that will play HD video smoothly... I tried a few different tablets for this and I was dissatisfied with the video display or the smoothness of the rendering.My search is over. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is a marvel. The color reproduction is fantastic - truly, you have to see this with your own eyes to really appreciate how stunning this display looks. HD video streamed from Amazon Prime is so good I almost prefer watching on this screen over my TV. My laptop looks like a piece of junk next to this... not to mention the sound! WOW! It's loud, clear, without being overly tinny. Again, blows all three of my laptops out of the water. My wife and I just watched an episode of Firefly streamed from Prime (yes!) with it sitting on a stool while we were on a couch and it both sounded and looked great!The camera is far better than I expected - even the forward facing camera is of solid quality. But, considering this isn't why I bought the tablet, I haven't really run the camera through any real paces.Bluetooth connection is solid. I've connected my headphones and a song sheet pedal (to switch between pages on chord charts for guitar) and both devices paired and worked as expected with no problems.I've actually used the Mayday feature twice - both times I was connected within a minute to someone who was cheerful and ready to assist. Best tech support experience I've ever had. Maybe it's because you can actually see these people (though they can't see you), they were professional and courteous and seemed genuinely interested in my issue with a desire to help me fix the problem.Turns out they'll have to send me a new Fire because my issue seems hardware related (lock screen image never changes and I've had two random restarts and a force close on the Store). So... do you see that... even WITH those issues, I'm incredibly pleased with this device. I have spent HOURS on this thing, reading, listening, playing games, watching videos, downloading content, editing documents, taking notes... and except for the few times I mentioned... this thing has been flawless.This is one of the best electronic devices I have ever purchased.So... glowing review... why only 4 stars? The browser. Silk is simply terrible. Sideload Dolphin HD and sideload Flash... you will be sorely disappointed with your web browsing experience if you don't. To this day I'm still not sure why Amazon isn't just allowing Dolphin to be installed from the app store.

Not exactly what we call \"High Quality\".So, why did I rate it a '3' instead of a '1'?First, let's go over the problems.1) While the device was supposed to have 64 GB of storage, it ran out of storage after downloading 6 movies.  My rule of thumb is that an HD movie takes around 4.5 GB of storage, so WTF?  When I talked to the Amazon Help Desk rep, he agreed that this shouldn't have been a problem.2) When attempting to remove movies from the device, it didn't just freeze, it turned into a brick.  Nothing I did (under the Amazon agent's direction, mind you) fixed it.  Nothing like a $500 brick.3) The menus are not intuitive.  I've seen better GUIs designed by freshmen college students.4) The size of the menu items are VERY SMALL... barely readable with my 62 year-old eyes, and I inadvertently selected the wrong item twice in a row.  There appears to be no way to change the font size of the selectable items.5) There's no way to Search to find downloadable movies.  It's just \"click each item until you can download it\".  There ought to be a better way to find items that you can download without a random Drunkard's Walk.So, if the Kindle Fire HDX is so bad, why did I rate it a '3'?Well, normally the \"Brick after less than 24 hours\" would make it a '1', but I like the potential for the device.  As with my initial purchase of a Kindle Paperwhite, it appears that Amazon releases products before they've undergone sufficient testing.  However, Amazon has the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've ever seen.  Their agents are well-trained, and capable of responding to hostile / unhappy customers, and they move heaven-and-earth to fix problems / dis-satisfactions.  I've already shipped the Kindle back to Amazon, and they've already shipped me a replacement device.  Unfortunately, I'll be in Europe when it arrives, but I can't fault Amazon for their response.Bottom Line?  I'm a fan of the company, even if their initial product rollouts suck.For you early adopters, be aware that the quality may be substandard.

I wanted to like it since I have so much video media and books (eBooks and audio) purchased from amazon or amazon companies. I used the fire for a 10 hour bus trip and again on the way back. The battery lasted for the entire 10 hour trip and the fire was running about 75% of the time.As an entertainment device, movies, books, and audio it was very nice. I also loved the idea of downloading the movies and TV shows from amazon prime to watch off line when there wasn\u2019t any internet available. With 64GB I had plenty of room to load my device with mp4 movies I already owned to watch later. Strange you have to use the photo app on the kindle to watch a downloaded mp4 movie.The email was very easy to set up and worked seamlessly with my work email, a big plus. I purchased excel contacts (5 Star app by Sam YU, samapp.net, in kindle store) to load all my contacts from my ios device to an excel spreadsheet then to my kindle.Why I sent mine back.The operating system supporting apps needs more time to mature. The apps I commonly used were not always available on the fire and there were no substitutes.A problem I had I tried using the mayday feature. I wanted to convert my ios calendars to use on the kindle. I have hundreds of appointments, birthdates, anniversaries etc. plugged into a calendar already and I was trying to convert it. I used mayday to get information, she had no help for me. Next step for mayday, I asked if I converted the ios calendar to a google calendar (information on the web on how to do this) how do I change it to the kindle calendar. I kept getting a repeated message, which I believe she was reading, \"You can only use what is available in the kindle app store\". I wrote to Sam Yu, one of the developers at, samapp.net. They have the excel contact app (in kindle store) but they also have a great excel calendar app which I have used on ios and was hoping they were close to one for the kindle. No luck.ConclusionThere weren\u2019t enough PRIME movies or shows that I have not seen available for download. My main reason for purchasing the kindle hdx, to justify keeping the Kindle HDX. I also do not like you do not know if a movie or TV show can be downloaded until you click and open the movie options. Most of the newer movies and shows cannot and must be streamed and will not work without a fast internet connection. I had to spend a lot of time opening every movie or show to see which ones I could download to take on the bus with me. The internet provided at most places on the road, or on our bus, will not support streaming without the constant buffering stops.I ended up sending the kindle fire hdx back and purchased an IPad Mini retina. I\u2019m pretty sure square trades will transfer the warranty over so I just pay the upgrade in price. They told me to call them directly. I have not given up and will most likely purchase a kindle fire, maybe the next version.

It's fast, lightweight, and easy to use.  My only minor quibbles are 1) the matte finish on the back cover already looks smudged and dinged up and I've had it for about 7 hours and handled it very gently 2) the kindle app does not let you organize your books into categories.  Even the iPhone and iPad Kindle apps and the original Kindle let you do that.  What were they thinking leaving this out of the software?  Honestly, the Kindle functionality was the main reason I chose the HDX over the iPad, so I'm kind of disappointed, but the Mayday person assured me it would be available in the software upgrade before the end of the year.  If not, I would have returned it, but the other features are so nice, I really don't want to do that.  The Mayday feature worked great, I got help within 10 seconds.  And there are more than enough apps for anybody to be happy.**Update** - I have a lot of movies on my computer and the only way to view them in the Kindle is under Videos - Personal Collection.  The way they are displayed is very stupid!  They are displayed graphically in a grid with the first still shot of the movie showing, and there is no way to organize them by title.  So if you want to watch a particular movie, you have to guess and keep opening movies until you find the one you want.  I asked Mayday for help and they said it's not possible to do it any differently.  This may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for me.  I may be returning it for the iPad (in which you can just import anything into iTunes) if I can't figure out a way around this.  Downgraded to 3 stars, feedback given to Mayday.***Update #2: I downloaded a program called ES3 which allows you to copy files to the HDX and you can sort them however you want.  Some movies won't play (it seems to be the ones purchased through iTunes) but I've been satisfied enough with this program that I didn't return the HDX.

Usually a one star product is clearly junk, but that is not the case here.If I were to rate the hardware only (I bought the HDX 8.9 w/o special offers), I would say it's a five star product. But we can't just rate this on hardware alone, we have to look at both the software and Amazon's walled garden policies.I read all the reviews from the gadget sites about how this was somewhat crippled by lack of access to google play, but that you could sideload apps, and that if you wanted to consume Amazon content that it was a good choice. As all I wanted it for was to read ebooks, I thought it would be perfect. It has probably the best screen I've seen on a tablet (compared to my new Galaxy Note 2014 and my wife's Ipad Retina, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the better screen). The problem was I have a lot of technical ebooks (I'm a software developer) from Oreilly press, and I prefer PDF format for these. I also have a few ePub books. I did some research and found moon+ reader pro in the Amazon store. I figured I was good to go, I could buy Moon Reader + pro and have a device that could read all my kindle books, watch amazon prime, and read my ePubs and PDFs. Then the tablet came and I logged in to the store, and Moon Reader + Pro was not listed. I followed a link from the web and lo-and-behold it says \"Not compatible with your device\"..which was interesting because the free version worked just fine. I wanted the pro because It supports PDFs and the ads are annoying. I then looked for other readers in the Amazon store that would support ePub or PDF and work on my device and guess what...there weren't any. Interestingly enough, there are other readers in the Amazon store such as Aldiko..they just say they aren't compatible with the HDX 8.9.. if you sideload them from the web they work fine though so it's not a compatibility issue. It's Amazon putting artificial limits on what content you can easily view on a kindle device. I don't mind the lack of Google Play because I can understand Amazon not wanting to pay to license from Google or follow Google's policies. But when they have apps that work for what I want in their App store but they intentionally limit access to them to Kindle Devices because they allow ePub and PDF content I have a problem with that.In closing, I would say that if you want to consume Amazon content, an Apple Ipad is currently the best choice. You have full access to a huge selection of apps, and you get the ability to view Amazon Instant Video and you get Text To Speech in the kindle reader. I absolutely despise Apple products so it pains me to recommend them, but for Amazon content the Ipad is the best choice. Android is purposefully crippled by Amazon. They do not have an Instant Video app for Android (other than for the Kindle Fire) and they don't support Text To Speech for Android (again other than the Kindle Fire). As for me I returned the Kindle and bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I don't get prime videos, but I do get Netflix if I want and I've started looking elsewhere for books and movies.I originally started buying from Amazon because I liked the choice, I liked the customer service, and they made things easy. With this tablet, they have taken away the choice of content and nothing was easy. Customer service is the only thing left. I'll still shop at Amazon for almost everything else I buy, but my great opinion of them was tarnished by the whole experience and I probably won't buy another Kindle device.

I had planned to just borrow his device for mobile reading.  I often find myself waiting for him to finish with an activity or work.  I had been using my smartphone, Android os, to read and play a few games.  However, the tiny screen was leading to major eyestrain.  I can read a paper book, but during the winter it is dark when I am waiting on him to finish work and I was running down the car battery to read, if I didn't use the phone.  There also were some issues with the Android os and the Kindle app, Amazon kindly fixed those, but the screen was still very small.With the latest sale price on the Kindle, I decided to go ahead and purchase one.  I had intended to purchase the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", but after some encouragement from my son, I purchased the 8.9\".  I was afraid the larger device would be awkward to tote around.  I was very wrong.  I am actually reading more since I purchased the HDX,  The device was fairly easy to set up.  I turned it on and signed in -- and it defaulted to mountain time zone.  I don't live there anymore and it was annoying to hunt to find where to change the time zone.  I ended up borrowing one of the Kindle guides and learned many interesting things about the device.The device is for me, most of the time, but I was pleased to find apps for studying for the GRE for my son who is a junior in college.  I also like the language apps which help us master correct pronunciation.Since I have a small iPod, I don't use the Kindle much for music, at least not yet.  It isn't portable enough to fit in my pocket when I exercise, therefore I cannot comment on the speakers.  We will likely use the device for watching Amazon prime movies, assuming the streaming doesn't eat up our internet allowance which is why we chose the larger size.  I also find the clarity of the screen and speed to be excellent.A few things I would like to see changed -- I read more than one book at once.  With this Kindle I can set more than one bookmark in a book, but I can't \"name\" the bookmarks -- one for where I'm reading, one for something of note....  I would also like to be able to have a tiny box or something to display the current time and battery icon when I am reading, or playing a game.  I know others won't want that, so I would like to see it be an option.I purchased the WiFi model because I could not afford 4G.  I am pleased that the device automatically connects to the WiFi devices it has \"met\" before, automatically.  One thing I learned early on, make certain to fully shut the device off to conserve battery power.  If used mostly for reading, the battery really will last 16 hours, or more, but only if fully shut down, in sleep mode it will continue to consume battery power.We don't watch much tv, although we love old movies.  We don't do social networks, I tend to be a more private person, so I wasn't certain if I could find enough uses to justify the Kindle purchase.  I was excited to find one of my favorite apps, Laudate available, and I can get an assortment of other theological resources easily.There are enough differences between the HD and the HDX that I am very happy I waited and purchased the faster and clearer device.  I do recommend a cover and if possible a padded bag for anyone who is as prone to dropping things as I am.  Actually, I have put my ID, credit card, and cell phone in the outside pocket of the padded bag and left everything else behind.  I purchased the set of 12 accessories at the same time I purchased the device.  The cover isn't fancy and if I use it often, I'll have to replace it within a year, but it is fine for now.I did not think I would like reading without the physical feel of a book in my hands.  Admittedly, I cannot close the book when I finish an electronic book with the same finality.  However, we already have 20 bookcases, very full, and I am reluctant to purchase more paper books without getting rid of some.  It will be so much easier to throw the Kindle in the vehicle and know I don't have to box up all the books included in it when my son head off to post-graduate work and studies!  I also love that I can change the font of the electronic books on days when my eyes are tired instead of digging out a stronger pair of reading glasses!I will next see how I like having the Kindle read to me, but that is another adventure.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful screen, good sound, a few  minor dislikes...", "Author": "CMB", "ReviewID": "R2DGYF70H05JY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a woman in my late 50's, computer savvy but not a techie, and I like electronic gadgets.  I thought long and hard about buying a tablet (do I really need one???), and then about which one to buy.  Based on reviews on both Amazon and other websites, I had a hard time deciding between the Google Nexus 7 (the 2013 model) and the Kindle Fire HDX.  After playing with both of them for about an hour in Staples, I decided on the Fire.  I was originally going to buy the smaller Fire but got the 8.9\" because I wanted to use it to watch videos.I really like it very much.  I'm not into apps, so it doesn't matter to me that I don't have access to the Google (or Apple) app store.  I use the Fire mainly for surfing, checking emails, watching video and listening to music. The interface is easy to learn and use, and things move with lightning speed.  The Fire does have an absolutely beautiful screen which makes watching videos a pleasure (the picture is much better than my TV).  I haven't actually purchased any videos but have found lots of things I like in the streaming videos.  Of course, this thing is an Amazombie's delight - it's easy (maybe too easy) to access videos, books, my Kindle library, etc.  I think the speakers sound pretty good on their own, but I got a little Jam speaker and also some bluetooth headphones and love listening to music via Pandora or my iTunes library.Some minor complaints:  I understand that the Silk browser is improved on the HDX, but I absolutely don't understand why it doesn't support Flash.  It would be much more useful if it did.  I installed the Dolphin browser, and can play flash videos, but Dolphin acts a little twitchy on the Fire.  Also, there's no way to organize bookmarks in Silk (there is in Dolphin).I wish that I didn't need a smart TV in order to mirror the screen and watch videos on my TV, but it could be time for a new TV anyway.  However, I've read other reviews and people are generally disappointed about not being able to use a cable to connect their Kindle to a TV while traveling.  It's too bad this feature was removed, but I knew that when I bought it.It's really easy to set up email accounts, but there's no way to organize email other than the standard folders.  Also, there appears to be no way to select all messages so I can delete them - I have to go through and select them one by one.  I wouldn't want to have this as my only was to receive and send email.I've had a couple of Kindle e-readers, and I like reading on the dedicated e-reader better than reading on the Fire.  It's nice to have color and the back lit screen is good sometimes, but there's a lot of glare.  The 8.9\" size is a bit heavy for reading.  I've had to get used to reading on it, and I still use my Kindle Touch a lot.In general I'm really pleased with the Kindle Fire, and I use it a lot rather than getting out my laptop.  Although as I said, I like gadgets, but I don't have a smart phone and the Fire is in between a smart phone and a laptop - very useful except for making phone calls!  I chose the Wi-Fi only version because I don't want to pay for a data plan, and it was great on a recent trip where there was Wi-Fi everywhere.  I didn't have to bring along the laptop but was able to have all my books, music, plus check out hotels etc. all in one small package.

I'm glad I did!First, delivery time was amazing. I ordered Friday night and to my surprise, it was delivered Saturday afternoon. This was my big gift to myself for this holiday season and I was expecting it to take a couple of weeks to get here like my previous Kindle orders. I'm still waiting on the cover as I decided not to go with the origami case after reading reviews of it being very heavy.As soon as I opened the box and had my precious in my hands, I knew I was right to wait for this version. It's exactly what I wanted. The weight is perfect, the rubber backing and beveling make it easy to hold at any angle.Turning it on with the new button in the back is a breeze. Once it was booted up I was ready to go. All of my apps were waiting to be downloaded from the cloud as well as all of my books and magazines. It took about 10 minutes to download all of them. Some apps aren't available yet for this model, like Draw Something but that's a developer issue, not a Kindle issue. The display is beautiful and crisp and the volume buttons are great. No more swiping down to adjust the volume while watching a video!I've synched two gmail accounts, one for work and one for personal use. I'm able to get notifications for both at the same time which is much easier than logging in and out or having to use two devices to get notifications for each. I've tested Picasso for drawing and the response to the stylus is incredible.I'm loving the side-bar swipe to access other apps while in use of another app instead of having to close out the current app to use another. If I'm watching a video on netflix or reading a book, I can quickly swipe to the side bar, check my email or look something up in wikipedia and then get back to my content.I love the rear camera, which was a big reason for holding out for this version. I've taken a few pictures, edited them on the tablet and shared with facebook from the editor with great ease. Videos are very nice and clear in HD and also very easily uploaded to facebook from the kindle. I would like to see some better video editors in the kindle apps but for now this is good.The processor is super fast, even with several apps open I've had no freeze ups or delays getting to content. Mostly, this is used for entertainment but now and then I need to do some work related stuff while I'm using it for entertainment. No problems at all with pausing a game, retrieving an email with a document, editing the doc, sending out and getting right back to my game.Lastly, battery life. I've been running Swagbucks videos on both the old Kindle Fire and the new one for the last 2.5 hours starting both with a full charge. The old Fire is at 70% now and the new one is at 80%. With the new one I've had it in constant use with games, videos and reading for more than 4 hours at a time without it getting below 56% charge. Including the PowerFast Charger with this Kindle was the cherry on top, it really does charge it fast!I have a lot of faith in Amazon as a company and was certain if I just waited it out another year they would have the tablet I wanted and I was right. Apple quality has been slipping in recent years as they seem more focused on new gimmicks to keep people lined up at their stores every year than quality. I think this tablet will hold it's value for a couple of years at least without feeling like I'm missing out if I don't upgrade it with each new version and that is also important to me.

Not for \"us\", of course.  See the details below for the details. - There are (really useful) apps which you cannot get on an iPad - Price :)Cons: - Not an iPadQuick Bottom Line:  If you want a great, versatile tablet then get this and save some money.  If you need an iPad then get that.Now some details; let's start with a comparison...Size (and weight) (different and may now) matter - This larger version of the Kindle Fire is much smaller, a tiny bit thicker, and a tad lighter than the iPad 5 Air. Of course that means the screen is a bit smaller too, about an inch.  Frankly, from using the previous versions of both  devices, which had similar physical dimensions, everything is close enough to not really matter a lot.Speed - About the same when doing similar activities side-by-side.  Same for wireless down/upload speeds.Available apps.  There are a lot more apps available of the iPad.  Again from personal experience, there are enough of any type available for the Kindle Fire that I can always find one (or more) that I like.  After that, how many note taking apps (for example) do I need?THERE ARE SOME apps available for the Kindle (and android in general) that are not available for the iPad.  One that I use, which for some IS REASON ENOUGH to choose a Kindle, is \"WiFi Analyzer\".Price - Another tiny difference is that the Fire costs hundreds of dollars less than a similarly configured iPad.  This can matter a lot if none of the other differences do.The May Day Feature - I have friends who bought iPads for their technically challenged, typically older, relativeness.  The intent was to provide a foolproof platform for access to email and those internets.  Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't.  When it didn't getting problems resolved could be difficult since Grandma wasn't always willing to head out to the local Genus bar.  With this feature, the bar come to her.  Kidding aside, it positions this as the gift device of choice for anyone who might feel threatened with alternative tablets.Now for some specifics about this device: - The Ads supported version - They never get in the way.  As with previous versions, for me it is worth saving some money. - Display:  The display is outstanding!  Even better than the previous version, clear and bright without making everything look like a comic book and shows up well in sunlight without having to turn the display way up (which means the battery won't drain quickly). - Usability:  I've grown to prefer the Kindle interface, compared to the iPad or \"Native\" android tablets. The Kindle prominently displays apps used most recently and the ones I just installed in a side scrolling \"Carousel\". Other apps are just a few taps away. That's great for me and greater still for my young daughter ssince there's no hunting for the things I'm likely to want the most. The iPhone and other Androids I've seen do it the other way around. - First use: First use was very straightforward. I liked that it knew my name without me having to tell it. First thing it did, after greeting me (by name) was ask for my WiFi password. Once I logged it, it already knew about the apps, music, books, and videos I am using on my other Kindle devices.  I realize iPad does something similar. However, having used both, I feel the Kindle is easier. -On the business side, the built-in office software is handy and saves me from having to buy it outright.  I can access my email accounts, including those in an Exchange server, with no problems. Attachments, including .PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets can all be read with no problems. - Back to the fun stuff, YouTube, Netflix, and SmugMug videos stream flawlessly. Pandora provides music without a hitch. It connects to Bluetooth devices quickly and easily. - The Camera:  The front facing camera, designed for video conferencing, provides a clear image while the screen provides a vivid image of the person at the other end. We ran some side-by-side tests with our iPad 3 and the Fire always performed better. They've added a rear-facing camera which I probably won't use for taking snapshots (that's what an iPhone is for) and will for Skype sessions where I want to show my surrounds. - The Missing Charger: Isn't missing this time.  In the past Amazon didn't include on, probably figuring by this time most people already had *something* capable of charging their latest device and would prefer to save a couple bucks.  This time they tossed one in.  Still, if you haven't sprung for a Bolse\u00ae 4 Port High Output Charger buy now, you're missing out.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than any tablet on the market!", "Author": "Nigel", "ReviewID": "R2I2B6FNW7KXT1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best Kindle ever.

Precourt", "ReviewID": "R26X2B56V34235", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recommended the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 to my uncle who wanted a tablet just for basic stuff like e-mail, web browsing, Skype, etc.  I thought this one may be the best fit for him because he is not very tech savy and always asking me for help with his computer.  The 'Mayday' feature was the tipping point over other tablets as he could get assistance right on the device.I ordered the device for him and had it shipped to myself for setup and planned to ship it out to him, along with a wi-fi router already configured to it.  While performing the initial setup I quickly realized that this was not going to be a good fit at all, dispite the Mayday feature.  Here are my observations.The first problem I ran into was that the Kindle OS is VERY limited on settings compared to any other Android device that I've used (and I've used many over many years.)  The first thing I wanted to change was font size as he is older and would have difficulty reading the extremely small print size and found that there are only two settings for font size (normal and large, which isn't much larger than normal.)  On some screens it's acceptable, but on others it's still SO small, like the registration page for example.  It does have a 'magnifier' setting, but that is a pain to use as you have to pan around the screen to see everything with two figner swipes.  All my other Android devices have five (5) different font size choices, allowing easy reading of the entire screen at one time.  I found the limitation of settings options to be the case throughout the device menus - very few customization settings options.The second big problem which was the deal breaker is that you MUST provide credit card information, address, etc in order to download FREE apps.  I confirmed this with a rep over the Mayday feature, which I must say does work flawlessly.  My uncle did not want to provide this information as he never plans on downloading anything that would cost him, as he will only be using this for basic things.No flash support at all, at least out of the box.  I know this can be an issue on other tablets, like iPad especially, however, I could not get any videos to play on the Kindle Fire at all, not even YouTube, which generally will work on any other tablet I've owned.  Couldn't try downloading any other browsers or apps due to the need for a credit card to download free apps.At this point I gave up and decided to return it and get him the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 instead, as it is a full featured Android tablet and won't require him to provide credit card information to download free apps from the Google play store.In all fairness, I realize this device might not be designed to be a full featured tablet, but I was hoping for more and did not expect it to be locked down so much.There are good things about it though, if you can deal with the other shortcomings.  The screen is amazing!  The sound quality is also very good.  It's lightweight and seems to run pretty fast (although I really couldn't do much with it to explore that.)  The Mayday feature is great also!  The camera takes good pictures, although it seems to take a long time to focus.If you are a Kindle user and want a device for that purpose this is a great product that goes beyond the basic Kindle experience.  If you're looking for a more robust Android tablet you may want to look at some of the other choices out there.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed...Read the return policy", "Author": "Rosalie Buck \"CHESSNUT\"", "ReviewID": "R292JAY86V1CII", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The device I purchased in January would not connect to wireless or update my email unless I powered down 2 to 3 times a day.

Nothing too in depth just some basic office apps. I also would like to have a tablet that I could sync with my Android phone but that wasn't a deal breaker, I could live without that option.I was contemplating this tablet or the Nexus 7, Asus Memo FHD 10\" tablet, or a Samsung one. Well the Nexus 7 screen was too small for me especially when watching Netflix or movies but was awesome for gaming. The Samsung tablets were surprisingly expensive when compared to other tablets that offered more in terms of screen display, speed, and functionality (I think my biggest dismay with Samsung is their Touchwhiz overlay. I mean it's good when it works but it sucks when it doesn't, I have a Galaxy S4.) I didn't like the size of the 10\" tablets, so I thought an 8-9\" tablet would be a good compromise and it turned out to be the perfect size range for me.Now I knew that the Kindles come with an Amazon skin, Mojito 3.0 OS as they like to call it, on all their hdx tablets and this works well....for the most part, depending on what type of person you are with a tablet. Now onto the positives and negatives.I'll touch first on the positives, IMHO.-The screen is fantastic. The colors \"pop\" out and really are vibrant. What's even better is the battery life paired with this is phenomenal, at least in my usage. (I'll touch on this a little later.) You can really tell that they had put some time and effort into making the screen one of the best. I think it really shows the ingenuity of how well they were able to push a wonderfully looking screen. The PPI is almost absurd, 339, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600. Incredible, especially when Apple's own Ipad Air has this; 2048 x 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Kudos to you Amazon for making such a wonderful and beautiful display. Oh, and having 100% sRGB color accuracy helps with making all the images and colors shine and pop out. All my movies and shows really looked astounding in low or high lighting. Touch reaction was spot on, no lag. Everything was very responsive and concise. Very impressive screen.-The speakers.....oh my the speakers. They too are awesome. When I had first turned on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", my gf almost didn't believe the sound was coming from a tablet! The sound is fantastic, not the absolute best, but close to it. You can really hear the Dolby Digital from within these speakers. The highs and mids are great while the lows are discernable enough to make them sound as they should, given what speakers they're coming from. Even on the highest volume setting, the sound was still clear and crisp. It didn't sound muffled or reduced as you would hear in some speakers. TBH, I never tried the listening through the headphones so I can't comment on that, sorry.-The battery. Very impressive, imo. I had used my tablet for an avg. day, 4-6 hrs with mostly gaming and watching videos, some light reading (Had the Amazon Prime Free trial membership while had my Kindle Fire hdx.) The brightness was always set to auto. I didn't have any email setup so never had to push notify there. So specifically speaking, I used this tablet strictly for watching videos and playing games, while doing some light reading. I would charge my tablet about once every 3-4 days. The charge time was always brief, never going over a few hours, charged just as fast if not faster than my Galaxy s4. Battery was impressive with my usage.-Speed. Not much to comment here other than it was super fast! It's the only tablet I've seen so far that changes orientation from landscape to portrait INSTANTLY. I mean instantly, no lag whatsoever. It was nice. With a quad core Snapdragon 800 on 2.2 GHz Krait 400, it flies. Add to boot it has an Andreno 330 GPU and 2gb of ram, it has the latest and greatest processing power at this time. It definitely showed when playing games or multitasking. Apps loaded with ease, everything was super responsive, no lag whatsoever that I had encountered.-Cameras. I opted for the 32g version as I wasn't sure how much of personal content I was going to add on here. I never used the camera other than for a test. I like the fact that the HDX 8.9\" version has a LED back flash and an overall better camera on it than the HDX 7\" but it's really not needed but nice to have, for me it wasn't necessary. To note, the HDX 8.9\" has both a front and rear facing camera with a LED flash on the back. I add this to my positives b.c even though it's not really necessary to have a camera on a tablet it's nice to have \"just in case\".-Size. The overall dimensions of this tablet are great. It's actually pretty light and not at all bulky or thick. The dimensions are what is expected in this day and age for top end tablets. Unless you tack on the Amazon made and endorsed Origami case onto it which adds almost double the weight. It surely protects but it adds a considerable amount of bulk.-Having Amazon Prime. If you're already a member or thinking of becoming one then an Amazon Kindle is the way to go if you want a tablet. It offers a bundle of advantages to Kindle Fire owners when they also have Prime, it's a great service. However, in recent days I've read and heard they are looking to increase the price of Amazon Prime because of shipping costs (2 day free shipping is included in Prime.) and the like but I guess that's still in the talks and perhaps their may not be a price hike after all? Hope not. :)  You get to borrow one book/mo from their extensive library, you have access to their Prime video library (I honestly think Netflix is better but to each their own.), and other nice features as well.Negatives-Tied exclusively to Amazon...Now before I say anything else, some people may view this as a positive but again, I said these were IMHO. I know you could root and flash to another ROM but outside the box you're stuck with just Amazon and their regulated ecosystem. (Some people don't want to take the risk of voiding their warranty or bricking their devices just to get it to run an Android rom or the like. I understand that it can be a simple process but sometimes the risk doesn't negate the end result for some.) I didn't think much of it initially but as the days went by I was becoming more envious of not having the Play store. I bought this tablet mainly for media consumption so I had hoped I would be set on what Amazon provided...I was. For a bit. I liked the idea that Amazon has \"coins\" you can purchase for a discounted price in which you can use anywhere in their mobile store. The Amazon store is good but if you're looking for game or other entertainment apps then the Play or App store is the way to go.-No external sd card port. I know that with the newer versions of Android most apps and games you can't transfer to the sd card but knowing it's there in case you want to save personal music, vids, or pics, is nice to know. I will say in the Kindle Fire HDX's defense it has a nice cloud based server to \"drop\" things into but at this moment I'm not completely sold on the \"cloud\" universe yet. Time will tell.-Read up on some current Fire HDX owners complaining about their power adapter plug-in port becoming loose or outright breaking. I don't want to scare anyone but please be forewarned that this is an issue, how big or small Idk but it was one of the top complaints when I did my research. I was leery myself b.c the way the charger adapter plugs in is very odd and can easily seeing it being broken or malfunctioning in the future and the incidents where people had notified Amazon about it, well that's another story. It plugs in at an angle slighted towards up. It's kind of odd that it would plug in at an angle and not level with the tablet. It looks very wonky, imo. With my luck, the charging port would break a day after the warranty, lol.OVERALLIf you shop Amazon frequently, or have Amazon Prime, plan on getting it, or want a tablet that's easy to use comparatively (Mayday button is a great feature for noobies and the like.) then this tablet is for you. If this tablet had the option to either have the Amazon store or the Play store downloaded right out of the box then I would've downloaded the Play Store and would have kept my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  I honestly couldn't take having a \"locked\" down app store but again to each their own. I like having Google Voice, Maps, Gmail, etc right out the box. So instead of keeping my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", I had replaced it with the LG G pad 8.3\" tablet and my the differences. It's almost night and day even though they are both running Android technically. I will be writing a review for that tablet once I get to know all the nuances with that one.But overall the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is an AWESOME tablet. It's just I, myself, didn't like having just the Amazon store and no direct access to the Play store especially when I had purchased some apps from there on my Galaxy s4. I would highly recommend this tablet it you're looking to use it to read, watch movies, and some other light entertainment activities.For gaming and productivity I would undoubtedly recommend an Android, Windows, or Apple tablet.Happy shopping and thanks for reading my take on the Amazon Kindle Fired HDX 8.(\"", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "I know I made the best decision on this product", "Author": "Iris McElroy", "ReviewID": "R3AGVZ498GCL2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reviews from many sources, I choose to purchase another Kindle Fire HDX.

I knew early on that the Kindle HDX was not meant to be a full featured tablet like the Thrive and Nexus. But I was still disappointed at how much Amazon unnecessarily left out or disabled features that are common on Android tablets. The Mojito OS takes some getting used to even if you are accustomed to Android, not seeing a whole list of configuration options was a little jarring. But overall the HDX OS performed very smoothly.PROS:- Lightweight. About a third of what my Thrive tablet used to weigh.- Great display and video.- Sound was clear and crisp.- Nice case texture and screen. The back has a subtle rubber texture that makes it very easy and comfortable to hold. The screen is super smooth; it feels like you're moving your finger on an oily surface.- Painless E-Mail & Calendar Sync. I was able to connect my Google GMail account to the HDX's email client quickly and easily. However the email & calendar client are basic and limited in what they can show. For example my GMail Inbox message categories did not carry over into the HDX email client.- Speedy performance. I was able to stream Prime movies with no noticeable lag.- Connection to Amazon.com was seamless. When I took my HDX out of the box it recognized me right away and connected me to my account.- Mayday Tech Support. Really works as advertised. I was connected to a tech adviser in about 30 seconds. He was knowledgeable although he did misunderstand my initial problem and I had to interrupt to correct him.CONS:- Speech-to-Text(Voice Dictation). This is a new feature that was added in an update after my purchase. Is accurate but is noticeably slower than the voice recognition in other Android devices.- No GPS. I have read conflicting reports on whether or not the HDX has GPS or not. Either way using your HDX with GPS enabled apps is a no go.- No Haptic Feedback. It would've been nice to have a tablet that provided tactile feedback for text entry and games.- Bad photos with the Camera. My HDX took pics that were very grainy with inaccurate color. The photo options available for the HDX are also very limited. About the only things that you can change while taking a picture are the flash and panorama modes. You cannot adjust the white levels, spot metering, etc.- Limited personalization options. On my old Android tablet I like being able to organize my apps as I saw fit. Also I liked being able to change the wallpaper every now and them. There is no way to do these things with the HDX.At this point I'm torn on whether to keep my HDX or to return it. I like the idea of watching Prime Movies on a tablet even if I am not connected to the internet. However not having basic tablet functions is very frustrating. Also Amazon makes no promises that the problems will be addressed in the future. All I was told by Kindle Support was that a new update was coming soon.

Sherman", "ReviewID": "R1W5FBZXY74ODH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon sent me this tablet free for 30 days.  I was in the market for a new tablet anyway so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to test the kindle.  I own a first generation iPad retina already and I'm looking to possibly upgrade to the Air.  Amazon puts the Kindle HDX 8.9 directly against the Air.I will start the comparison with my current retina.  When I unpacked the HDX the first thing that stands out is the weight of the machine.  It's very light and comfortable to hold.  Seams appear tight, however the plastic housing feels a bit cheap.  No doubt they used the plastic to cut weight but it does not have a quality feel and I worry about it's durability.  Next I plugged the HDX in, the plug is either purposefully angled awkwardly up (I doubt it) or it's just poorly aligned when built.  The plug works, but it is not anywhere as smooth to plug as the lightning plug on my 5s and on the new air.  It's about as easy to plug as the old Apple 30 pin on my retina.Once it was fired up and ready to roll the home screen is fairly spartan.  I decided to open my Amazon cloud account and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my stuff there and waiting.  Your Amazon account is very nicely linked to HDX.  I pulled up BB King's \"Live in Japan\" on both the HDX and my Retina iPad and did some side by side audio.  There is no easy way to put this, the HDX is an audio dud with the external speakers.  the iPad was capable of getting much louder, clearer and better bass response.  I tried with both on flat hard surfaces and holding in hand.  I use the external speakers when I'm working on projects around the house and want some music around so this is a fairly important feature to me.  Next came the headphones test.  Both performed equally with my Klipsch S4i headphones and my Sennheiser over ear headphones.My Amazon prime streaming was very handy on the HDX.  Easy to access and I had zero issue streaming HD quality movies.When it comes to the screen it's a bit off a toss up between the Retina and the HDX.  The HDX is capable of a slightly sharper image thanks to the higher resolution but the Retina has better colors...The HDX display just looked dull.  Whites appeared with a distinct yellow tint and nothing seemed to pop off the screen. Try as I might, I could not get it to display colors as well as my Retina.  But again, the resolution is sharper on the HDX so you need to decide whats more important to you.  To me, the colors are far more important so I will say that I prefer the Retina display, slightly, but it's still my preference.In terms of general use.  I do not, at all, like the lay out of the HDX.  Simply finding things is much more of a chore compared to the iOS layout.  This might be more to do with the fact that I'm very accustomed to iOS, but I would like to think that a well laid out tablet is something that you can pick up and it feels great right away.  I never really had a learning curve on any iOS device, it was all fairly natural.  It's hard to blame Amazon here, ease of use is something Apple has been leading the industry on for a long time, but Amazon does have a long way to go to catch Apple here.Next I did some simple web browsing.  Silk on the HDX was VERY disappointing...It's a standard web browser, but it was not smooth at all.  Load times were twice that of my Retina and scrolling up and down pages was vert stuttered.  Safari on my Retina is very smooth and very quick.  Keep in mind this is a two year old machine.Besides Safari Vs. Silk, the Retina and HDX seemed to run at about the same pace, if not slightly quicker on the Retina.  Very upsetting considering the Retina by Apple terms is a slug now.  In all reality my 5s runs circles around the HDX.When I was visiting a friend that I know picked up a brand new Air, I brought the HDX with me to do a direct head to head.  Now that it's all said and done, Amazon has zero business comparing the HDX to anything Apple is producing today...The Air just blew the HDX out of the water in nearly every aspect.  Once again, the only thing the HDX had on the Air was the resolution.  The Air loaded everything faster, was snappy and smooth as butter.The HDX is lighter, but it's also a smaller screen...IF you consider the extra screen size, the weight difference is in my opinion a non factor.  Add to that the Air keeps that solid quality Apple feel with it's metal case.  I found the Air to feel very light and nearly as tiresome to hold as my Retina.With the Air everything that has bothered me about my Retina since the latest rollout of iOS is fixed.  Mainly my Retina is now a bit laggy.  Most notably when typing.  The HDX touchscreen keyboard was hands down the worst part of it.  Almost impossible to type on in my opinion.  Laggy and a lot of mistypes compared to my iPad and even my 5s.All in all, this is not a BAD product.  But to act like it competes with the Air is just down right false.If $400 is your MAX budget, I would go with the iPad Mini Retina all day long.  If you can swing the $500 for the Air, it's no contest.My advice to Amazon, continue to fine tune this thing.  The next generation NEEDS to be MUCH faster and the HDX screen must display better colors.Maybe in the future, but it's just not there yet to sway me away from from Apple.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beats IPad by a mile!

I have bought more than one thing because of seeing it on the special offers screen. They come up as screensavers sometimes on the unlock screen, or you can go to the top bar and scroll all the way over to view all special offers. The sound is very good quality, in fact it is better than my laptop sound. Good battery life, I can play apps all day on it. I would highly recommend this tablet. The Kindle also has great accessories available.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet with a ton of new features", "Author": "James R Davis", "ReviewID": "R3PZIWCLH47IAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are a ton of different kinds of tablets and e-readers out there today and it's hard to know which one to buy. Some of them can have features you don't understand and sometimes they just all seem to be the same thing at different prices, so you don't know which one to pick. As someone who has had personal experience with several different tablets (and a couple e-readers), I would recommend this one. It comes with so many features and options that it may seem overwhelming at first, but it's definitely worth sifting through it all.The Kindle Fire HDX is designed with the user in mind and is built to help you do everything you would want to on a tablet. The Kindle has always had a pretty good display, but this one truly takes it to the next level. The images and colors pop out at you just as well as any good computer, and possibly better than some. They also gave us improved brightness settings and reduced the glare so you can use the tablet in bright lights or outside without blinding yourself or having to deal with those annoying bright spots.The performance is better than any Kindle before. In layman's terms, it works faster and better than ever before. Even so, it's very thin for easy holding and storage, but very durable, so it takes more to break it. It claims to have a 12 hour battery life, or 18 if you're just reading, but in my experience it can often stretch to around 20, depending on what you're doing.The two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, are excellent. The front camera offers a pretty clear picture. It's perfect for taking selfies or things like video calls with your friends or your boss. The read end camera takes amazing quality pictures and comes with a flash option so you can even use the camera in dark environment. The rear end camera also comes with several features and options which improve picture taking.The Kindle Fire HDX also has a new feature which they call the MayDay button. It's basically a help button that you can push at any time. It connects you to a live representative who can help you with any problem you're having with the Kindle. They're available at any time, for free. I've used the service a couple of times when I was confused about how to do something and they were great. They helped me fix my issue quickly and they were super polite. This feature may seem unnecessary but you won't think that when you end up needing it. You'll be glad that it's there and that you can use it for free!It comes with Prime Instant Video downloads. You have to already be an Amazon Prime member to use it, but once you are, this feature means that you can download any video from Amazon Prime to your tablet. Then you can watch it wherever you are, even if you don't have an internet connection. I use this to watch movies on long flights. It keeps me entertained and even helps me a bit with the sick feeling I usually get on planes.The tablet comes with a lot of new apps that can help you do the stuff that's important to you, like accessing your email and calender, plus a lot of other new apps to help your productivity. Of course, you can still install all the other apps that you might want to, just like with any other tablet.They've also added a new and improved operating system for this version, which they call Mojito. It starts with an Android base, but Amazon has added on a lot of their own stuff to make it more personal and easier to use for their customers. Mojito is completely customer oriented, so you're sure to love how convenient it is and what it can do for you.This tablet comes with a huge amount of other features that I can't possibly discuss here as thoroughly as they deserve to be. Beyond that, it has some options that are personalize at the time of purchase. They give you three options for the amount of storage you want - 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. I personally am using the 64 GB version, but if you're usually the tablet casually or just for reading, you can probably get away with a smaller amount of storage.They let you choose whether or not you want to see advertisements on your table (what they call special offers), and it's not that much more, so I would recommend getting the ad free version, but it's not that big of a deal if you don't want to pay extra for it.They also give you options about your internet connection. You can choose to get just Wi-fi, or you can get 4G LTE from either Verizon or AT&T.; I go through AT&T; and it's always worked perfectly for me. Pages load great and load time is nearly non-existent.You can also buy a 2 year warranty which includes accident protection. This isn't necessary, but I would recommend it, just in case something happens. Paying a little more to get the warranty is a lot cheaper than if the tablet breaks for whatever reason and you don't have any way to replace it. After all, buying a replacement tablet will cost far more than what you would pay for the warranty. It just makes sense when you do the math. You might also want to consider buying a case for it. I have one, and it helps me to keep it safe, plus it looks pretty cool.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Kindle Fire HDX, whether you're looking for a new tablet or just a simple e-reader. It has the features to be great for everybody.

I've used the iPad, iPad mini and Blackberry Playbook, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted in a tablet. In the end, I narrowed it down to the Kindle Fire and iPad because I'm a member of Prime and I wanted to view Amazon streaming video on on a mobile device. Also, my favorite apps are not available for Android devices. I chose the Kindle Fire because of price and I know I will still one day get an iPad. So, the Fire is my iPad Mini. In terms of functionality, and I'll discuss this more below, the Fire is more reader and less tablet.With all that said, here's what I do love about the device -- it's a great value. The size is perfect for reading and I do love to hold it portrait style and read it like a book. If I feel really daring, I do so without the origami case so that I can appreciate how lightweight it is. The Amazon leather origami case is a really cool idea, but not great protection. Took me a day or so to get used to it. I do wish is was lighter and I wish I could get it in pink.I like the organization of my stuff -- carousel, home page/favorites and collections. I do have suggestions for improvements:1. I wish you could add web pages to the carousel2.  I wish the tablet would learn that just because I used something recently, I don't want it in the carousel.3.  I wish the collections could be for more than apps. For example, for my morning devotion time, I would love a collection that contained my gospel playlist, Bible reading apps and certain Kindle books.4.  There's no way to organize picturesMayday is so sweet. Although, I've realized that the help is really about technical issues, not bigger questions like why can't the device run Google apps. Still, this is an awesome feature if you a gifting the Fire to someone who is not tech savvy.As expected, the Amazon apps work great. I would like more visual notification to indicate which movies and TV shows that can be downloaded to the device. It should be just as easy to spot as the Prime indicator.The biggest disappointment with the Fire is no Google apps (as of January 1, 2014). This is why I consider the Fire more of a reader and less of a tablet. Without Google apps like Drive, Google Maps; YouTube and the full cadre of Android apps (like Instagram), this device fails to be a really serious workhorse. For those who use Chrome, you never realize how much you depend on it until it's gone. Don't be confused by the Google apps you see in the Amazon Appstore. These are workarounds developed by others; there are no Google apps, developed by Google, in the Appstore. You can sideload some Anddroid apps onto the Kindle (and I have done so for Instagram and PocketBible), but my point is that I shouldn't have to.If Google and Apple can find common ground, I simply don't understand why Amazon has to be so territorial with the Kindle. I'm wondering if this is the same marketing mistake Blackberry made with the Playbook; the marketplace has pretty much decided that we need two mobile operating systems, iOS and Android. I'm sure Amazon will say that developers have the option of putting versions of their apps in the Amazon App Store, but the fact that many haven't says something.Being forced to live without Google apps has forced me to discover a new favorite app -- Feedly, for blog reading. I've downloaded it to my Android and Apple devices.My next biggest issue with the Fire is the Special Offers. (I know I have the option of removing them for $15.) I'm complaining not because they are there, but because they are so 'untargeted' to me. Amazon has more than a decade of my purchasing history, wish lists, web data and tons of my reviews. Serve me ads for stuff you'd think I'd buy. I was expecting Special Offers to be so much better -- as good as recommendations on my Amazon.com homepage. The Special Offers are generally crappy because I have no interest in the products.Update 2/17/14: I have found a bug in the music playlists. I create my playlists on the cloud using my Kindle. I then dowload them to the device. All of the songs are already saved to the device before I download the playlist. However, songs will be missing from the downloaded playlist. The cloud version has 117 songs, the on-device version has three. Mayday and customer support gave me a solution. So, I uninstalled all music from the device and downloaded it all again from the cloud. I then downloaded the cloud playlists and the problem was solved -- for a few hours. Later, when I updated and created new cloud playlists; uninstalled the device playlists; and downloaded the cloud playlists again, songs were missing.Update 3/15,14: After weeks of back and forth, the issue above was resolved with a replacement Kindle. My cloud playlists loaded onto the device without a hitch. I haven't revised the cloud versions and tried to reload onto the device yet; no new songs have caught my ear. I have to say the getting the issue resolved left me very frustrated. Amazon's usually stellar customer service just didn't bring its A-game. I was so relieved when the rep I spoke with a week ago agreed to ship me another device. It took way too long to get to that solution.I find the speed to be slower than my iPhone and Galaxy phone.  I used all three while playing my favorite mobile game via Wi-Fi. When response time matters, I go for the iPhone instead of the Fire.My Fire has a problem connecting to free Wi-Fi. I haven't hit the Mayday button yet to figure out if it's something I'm doing wrong. The device will connect, but it takes a long while for it to tell you that you need to go to the provider's web page to agree to the terms and conditions. Opening the Silk browser yourself to get to the permissions page doesn't always work.I ordered the 16GB version based on other reviewers' comments regarding Prime movie and TV downloads. If I had it to do over again, I would have given more thought to the 32 GB because I have the Wi-Fi version. If I had gotten Wi-Fi+4G, 16 GB would have been just fine because I would have always had the connectivity to stream what I wanted to watch.All in all, the Fire isn't a bad purchase. I think how much you like it depends on what you're used to from other tablets and even your smartphone. It's a good value, but Amazon needs to rethink the relationship with Google. My user experience isn't as rich as it could be without more Android apps.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely A Keeper!", "Author": "Hal in Howell", "ReviewID": "R2NDI6FL9MORTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 last Thursday and I am very pleased.  It is SO fast compared to the Kindle Fire HD and lighter, too.  The HDX has a much more responsive touch screen and unmatched screen resolution.  WiFi set up was effortless. I was able to easily set up my various email accounts and download all the apps I used on the old KFHD including Netflix for video streaming (I also have Amazon Prime).  I side-loaded the Dolphin browser in order to view Flash videos (just like on my old HD).  Battery endurance seems very good and have run the HDX several hours at a time (I've not run the battery flat yet and recharge every morning).My only criticism of the HDX is the lack of the HDMI plug (I know, wireless is the future and all that, but I did like having it for travel where wireless video connection is just not available).  I'm holding on to my HD solely for the HDMI functionality.  This complaint is certainly not a deal killer.I've barely used the rear-facing camera (took just one photo to see if it worked and it does and the photo looked very good and I will be using it in the future). The rear-facing camera is a great addition and remedies my major complaint about the KFHD.The only real problem I've encountered with the HDX is that I'm unable to delete photos I downloaded from the Cloud (see updates below).  Enter the Mayday button.  I've got to say that Amazon's customer service is second to none (I guess it's part of their on-going plan for World Domination).  I pressed the Mayday button and I had a live CS person on-line within 15 seconds.  She attempted to fix the photo deletion problem without success.  However, she escalated the issue to a tech support person who, after going through several diagnostic procedures, wrote up a trouble ticket to pass on to the developers; all this taking place on-line (the problem is apparently unique).  A callback is scheduled for later this week.  The whole point of this story is to show how responsive Amazon is to customer problems.  BTW, the photo deletion issue in no way affects the functionality of my Kindle.I read just about all the 1-star reviews before purchasing and found few complaints that were credible (it seems that most of the negative reviews were by iPad fanboys or by those who just didn't know what they were talking about.  I invite you to read those reviews and see for yourself; they are quite entertaining in a perverse sort of way). The Kindle Fire HDX that I own is not the same HDX the 1-star reviewers were talking about.At the end of the day, the KFHDX is a superb device.  It is definitely not just an e-book reader.  I'm still discovering all that it can do.  I highly recommend it.I will update this review with the results of the Kindle problem mentioned above.*********Update January 3, 2014**********Received a callback from Amazon (on-time as promised) regarding the photo deletion problem.  The developers are stumped, but are still working on it.  There is supposed to be a new software update release in the next couple of weeks that may resolve the issue.  If that fails, we may try a factory reset (not my favorite solution as I'll have to reenter all my email settings, etc.).  If the reset fails Amazon will just send me a new device and I'll just start over.  I'm pleased with Amazon's efforts, though disappointed it may require a reset or de-registration or replacement of the Kindle.  At least the problem doesn't affect the Kindle's functionality in any way.  High marks to Amazon CS.  I still love the Kindle.  Further updates will be forthcoming.*********Update January 11, 2014*********I solved the photo deletion issue!  The problem was I was unable to delete photos.  The Kindle kept asking if I wanted to delete the photos from the Cloud (there were no photos on the Cloud).  I solved the problem by asking the Kindle to download the undeleteable (that's not a word, is it) photos from the Cloud even though there were no photos on the Cloud).  I could then delete them.  Apparently the Kindle got locked in some sort of loop and attempting to download non-existent photos broke the loop.  It took me awhile to figure it out, but it worked.  I'll have to let Kindle CS know about this.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, this is a very nice tablet!", "Author": "KG62", "ReviewID": "R25ZBU5V21KSHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my Christmas present, I love it! The colors and the picture quality are sharp and crystal clear!

Even games I had downloaded for my little granddaughter are fun! :DUsing the cloud app I was able to send some of the pictures from my phone to the fire and the pictures look great!

Dudley", "ReviewID": "R2OUF968WC0UGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Kindle DX (Bought a couple of times over thanks to a theft and a dropped Kindle) I decided I wanted to get the Kindle Fire for some of the magazines I am subscribed to as well as the NY Times. I have had a few stops and starts trying to figure out how to use a full touch screen electronic component. Also navigating the store and my library. Not all my kindle games are compatable with the fire. My review is less from a tech head perspective and more of just a user.I got it and it was automatically registered to my account since I bought it through Amazon. I was thrilled to see I was given some free tokens for audio books and games which I used. (I had a driving trip coming up the following week) The audio book played well through the aux outlet to the car stereo. I could see my pre-exisiting library on the cloud and select the items to download to my fire device. I got a little stuck 2 weeks into ownership trying to access netflix. It doesn't run on the silk browser. So I tried to download firefox which isn't available for Kindle although the app is in the Amazon store. This  ended up with a mayday call by accident (I was just trying to email customer service) and the rep was on video chat in less than a minute and helped me find the netflix app as well as answer another question about my Amazon watchlist navigation. That mayday app is worth the whole cost of the Kindle in my opinion. I have watched a number of videos, the streaming is great, the download aspect worked well. I could hear well, I didn't even feel the need to use headphones. I have shopped through the audio books, bookstore and videos. It has worked well, no complaints.A word of advice. I wavered between getting the 4G Verizon option or just wifi. At home I have wireless for my internet so it would be no issue for the Kindle. But I do travel occaisonally so I was concerned about that. Then I did the math If I bought 4G it is roughly an additional 80.00 on the cost and then I have to add it to my cell phone plan which runs an additional 20-25.00 a month. The I remembered virtually all 3G 4G smartphones have the hotspot capability. This includes mine and was something  I just discovered this year. So I skipped getting 4G. In the 3 weeks I have been out and about I have had to activate the hotspot option on my phone to allow my kindle to hook up and download a paper. It has worked great. It certainly beats the extra cost of getting 4G capable and the monthly plan addition. So think about it when you are buying. I also bought the 89.00 accidental coverage plan. I couldn't find a cover I like right off the bat and I had the previous misfortune with my other Kindle. I recommend buying the insurance. I did find a good cover for a great price if you are not a hardcore road warrior extreme athlete.

It's a great size; thin, light.  The screen is crystal clear and vibrant.  The processor is quick, and everything is snappy.  All that being said, there are two (kind of three) reasons I ended up returning it.1) For me, the biggest thing is the lack of the standard Android play app store.  I know a bunch of other reviews have pointed this out, but I thought I could deal with it.  Honestly, I couldn't.  I use a lot of Google services (gmail, drive, maps, etc.), and none of these are available in the Amazon app store.  Some of it you can do web based, but some of it won't work correctly.  I really wanted to learn to love the Amazon store, but I just couldn't.  Some of my favorite games are not available either.2) I purchased the 'no ad' version, but there are still ads on the tablet.  They are not on the lock screen, but they are under the 'frequently used' app section.  It is SUPER annoying.  \"Oh, we see you like Facebook, but have not downloaded Pinterest.  Click here and download it.\"  No, I don't want to see ads for other apps on my tablet.  It's incredibly obtrusive.  You can click and hold, and then select 'remove ad', but it will come back within 24 hours.  There is no way to get rid of these things.2.5) When using the tablet, every once and a while, the screen would go black while I was actively touching the display.  I hit the mayday button once (awesome service by the way), and they told me to do a hard restart.  That would fix the problem for a good while, but every once and a while, it would need a hard restart again (kind of like a computer).  I wouldn't return the tablet just for this, but it's worth noting.All in all, if you are not a heavy Google user, and don't have favorite apps in your current app store, you would love this tablet.  For me, it just wasn't a great fit.  Amazon's customer service was amazing as always, and the return was no issue at all.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good...", "Author": "PIttsburgh Troll", "ReviewID": "RGB09RKZ1DZJV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is for a HDX 8.9, 4g+WiFI, 64GB. Also note that I am a Prime member.Pros:-Screen is excellent-Silk is a vast improvement (I had the initial Fire, so it is a huge leap in performance)-Very intuitive layout.-Excellent customer service.  My screen started to show purple and blue streaks, and after calling support, they agreed to replace it without hesitation (they send a new one and you have 30 days to return the problem unit)-4G performance is very good; pages load almost as fast as with WiFi-Integration with Amazon cloud is well done.  Most of your Amazon music purchases are available, and if you use the Amazon Cloud Player, you can download music from iTunes or most other formatsNeeds improvement:-While Mayday response is very fast, I found there is still a lack of knowledge.  For example, I asked why my magazine subscriptions could not be viewed any longer in text format, and the representative just said they would note that for future reference.  However, purely by accident, I found that all you have to do is double click on the article in the native format and it switches to text.-I find that WiFi needs to be stopped and started occasionally.-There still appears to be a lot of apps that are very buggy.  Read reviews before you download, even if free.-Note that some videos are not downloadable.  I don't find this an issue as the selection is expanding, and I doubt I will ever even scratch the surface of the Prime video library.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet and would recommend it to those that are looking for a media tablet.

I have a Kindle HD 7 inch.  I've not really had complaint with it except occasionally slow/sticking browser etc.  But for watching movies and t.v shows, no problem whatsoever. UNTIL I turned the Kindle HDX 8.9 on!  Now I realize the 8.9 is larger of course, but the picture is absolutely better on the HDX 8.9,  More light, the colors more bright, crystal clear, awesome!The Silk browser on the HDX is much faster than on the HD.  When I compare the two on the same page of a site, definitely the HDX looks better.  I wasn't expecting such a change with the HDX since I hadn't been unhappy with my HD.I had attached tape along the speakers of the HD to help point the sound toward me. (Don't laugh, they make tapes in lovely colors now!) With the Origami cover on the HDX, it directs the sound from the top, straight to you.  There is a difference without the origami case.....( better sound- with the case.)The sound is loud enough for me, without using an add on speaker.I like the touch buttons on the HDX using the origami case.  You don't have to look, you can tell by feel which is round and which is a rocker type button in case you forget which button is which. So of course, you can also without the origami case.I hope next year Amazon comes out with a 12 inch Kindle Fire HDX with as good of specs and hardware as the HDX.I love, love, love that all I have to do with a Kindle device is- turn it on.  I don't have to register, fill out forms, emails etc.  It's automatically done for you.  I love convenience.  Don't have to remember different passwords or log ons etc.I have  watched and read reviews comparing an Apple device to this Amazon/Android device.  The HDX beats those Apples in almost every way.  Yeah maybe Amazon doesn't have one million apps.  I'm never in my lifetime going to use one million apps, so that 'point' is senseless.I love that I can go camping without internet access available, no 3 or 4 G around, and still watch movies on the KindleHD/HDX!  And now we can download prime movies and shows too!I don't have use for an 'office' type device and am not a big gamer.  I use this to consume movies etcMy spouse has an Windows 8 laptop - absolutely detests.  So I got  the Kindle HDX- no logging on, no passwords to put in, open the cover swipe and go.Sure laptops have their use, and I still have an older windows version......but that's going to be changing with these tablet computers that are easy to use...Yes we have apple devices.  They are declining in specs but leaving prices high and high for accessories.Don't regret one bit buying the Kindle HDX 8.9 over an apple device.I use a tablet to check weather, surf the internet  and watch movies and t.v.  And the Kindle Fire HDX is excellent for doing all those things.Spouse says- \"it's Awesome, neatest thing since sliced bread\"UPDATE:I did order another 8.9! The picture on this Fire HDX 8.9 is better than on my huge smart tv on some of the shows I watch.  The color and disctinction is better on the HDX. Movies are actually awesome on the Fire HDX and our smart t.v.  But some shows are better on the 8.9.The HDX is so lightweight! Easy to hold with one hand. I use it with and without the origami cover. A pure pleasure. The best picture I've seen on a device and yes I have Fire HD, Apple devices and now HDX (2 of them).  I didn't choose another apple, but I did get another HDX 8.9!I did also upgrade the router to an Asus ac router as well since the HDX has the new 802.11 ac /b/g/n , although I had a good router, we have so many devices we were losing connection on different devices, at different times.  Added more bandwith from the ISP as well.All is smooth now!Also added the origami cover and once again, the sound is better with the origami cover on it as it sends the sound forward to you, instead of up and out...Easy to get the HDX in and out of.  Does add some weight, but it's worth it.Those who try to compare an Apple to an HDX are deceiving people.  the HDX doesn't 'stretch' the screen to make it appear bigger and apple devices do...the old 4.3 instead of the 16.9 format.  HDX is absolutely the better more vibrant, accurate color, better camera by far etc.The old Fire HD still works fine, it's in the laundry room now so I can continue watching while hanging/folding laundry, without having to carry the HDX with me.Is that the sound of someone being spoiled?If your looking for a device for watching and consuming content you can't do better than the HDX.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Edited:  Great hardware with several software annoyances", "Author": "J.

When I read the specs on this baby, I pre-ordered it along with the Origami case.  No regrets whatsoever.  Performance is fantastic...my wife has the iPad Retina (not the Air) and this is better in almost every way, and way cheaper to boot.  I also have an Android tablet so I realize the Amazon app store is not yet on the same level as the Google or Apple app stores.  I have found all the apps I need though and like the Amazon media features that are only available on the Kindle line.  I don't know of a pure Android tablet that can match this for quality, battery life, and performance at this time.  The Tegra 4 models are disappointing, it looks like Snapdragon is the processor to have right now.I'm hoping they make a 10.1 inch version of this...same resolution and processor just a bigger screen and battery would be fantastic for those of us without great \"close up\" vision.EDIT:  4/6/2014  OK, after living with the HDX for a while it has one pretty serious flaw, and a few annoyances as well.  The flaw:  Text scaling on websites is terrible....everything is TINY, with lots of white space usually left on the sides.  On some sites this is easily fixed by zooming.  Other sites do not allow zooming and you can't do anything about it.  This is not a function of the screen size...my 2nd generation Nexus 7 and my wifes iPad Mini w/Retina display do not have this issue.  I can't find any way to increase the default scaling.  Sometimes a green \"Reading View\" button pops up on the browser, which opens the page full screen (and scaled properly) and works great.  Unfortunately this option is only available on some pages.The annoyances:  The Silk browser is frustrating.  Some sites behave very strangely, like zillow.com.  The keyboard is terrible compared to the Asus keyboard on my Asus memo pad FHD.  (to be fair this was an issue on the Fire HD 8.9 from last year as well).  Amazon does not offer you the option of changing the keyboard or browser.

I absolutely love it and find reading on the larger screen a pleasure with the super resolution. The processor is both fast and responsive. I don't experience the crashes that were becoming ever more common as I tried to check Facebook and read a book with the HD.I'll admit to having a problem when it was first delivered as it wouldn't fully charge. And the reason I purchase Kindles from Amazon was quickly apparent. Without question they shipped me a replacement making sure it was scheduled for priority next day service (I received the Kindle for Christmas and the replacement arrived on New Year's Eve - that's service!) Luckily it seems the problem was actually the charger and not the original Kindle's battery, so I'm shipping the replacement back (I don't want to relinquish my new best friend).So would I recommend that you purchase a Kindle HDX - absolutely! I really love the size of the 8.9\", but would guess that the 7\" is equally superb. BUT the one thing that is a great benefit with the larger Kindle is the rear camera. I love it. The one thing I regretted was while practically having my Kindle attached to my side, it didn't have a camera like the iPad or iPhone to capture those spontaneous moments. Now I have the best of every world.So, purchase from Amazon with the assurance that they stand behind their products and the Kindle HDX is a product to be proud of!

The latest selection of available apps in the Kindle App Store more than met my needs.  I was able to find and download every \"Essential\" app I wanted that was recommended on multiple web sites.  I understand that there is a \"middle-man\" web site to get to Google Play apps that have been previously purchased.  Whether all those apps will be HDX compatible is unknown but at least you can get to them.  HDMI out?  Right now there's no adapter cable solution as the HDX just doesn't provide native HDMI streaming but there is Miracast (available here on Amazon and HDX certified) that user reviews when using with the HDX are very positive.  Some issues with using Miracast with other devices but we're talking HDX here.  External storage/PC connectivity?  A microUSB to USB adapter cable works just fine with Windows 7 and I'm sure it would work equally well with an external USB drive or even a USB hub. Don't want to be tethered to a cable?  The are a couple of decent WiFi apps in the App Store that work to provide PC connectivity.  Keyboard too small?  I'm using a Logitech Bluetooth model that hooked up right away.  Charging issue?  Not on mine plus keep in mind that to extend battery life, remember to turn off your WiFi and 4G when you're done using it.  Had to do that with my old original 3G WiFi Kindle too.  I have the AT&T; 4G and really enjoy the abundant and free AT@T hotspots (at least here in the Southeast anyway).  There's a decent Outlook/Hotmail app that I use and although I wasn't happy with the Maps in the Google+ app, when I browse to Google maps via the Silk browser, everything works as I am used to including directions.  Speaking of Silk, I have no issues with it, including speed.  Skype? No problems.  YouTube? Haven't run across any clips that won't play.  I am completely pleased with my HDX and definitely recommend it.  Too bad you can't get the 64GB model if you want the AT&T; 4G LTE but considering that I can have external storage, the tradeoff for the free hotspots balances things out for me. Works great with my Epson WF-3540 wireless printer after getting a printer app from the App Store then downloading a couple of small drivers during setup (just follow the prompts). Final plus for me is that I can read in bed without a light on!  Yes a paperwhite would have been lots cheaper but the HDX has tons of extra capability.Update: Tried to connect to an external USB Hard Drive and that didn't work. That's fair I guess as Windows always installs drivers for whatever I connect via USB (including my HDX which then had full drag and drop capability). The tablet OS doesn't do that so I guess we'll have to wait till Seagate or some other manufacturer comes up with an app to support USB external drives. Until then, I am looking at wireless external drive solutions and have seen several HDX compatible ones on Amazon that I am considering.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best purchase ever!!!", "Author": "Snapdragon", "ReviewID": "R2O323U6OFZ2C0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love..Love..my new Kindle fire HDX 8.9.

I was very excited about this purchase and was so much looking forward to this kindle.  One of the main reasons for my purchase was the text to speech and also that the kindle has a camera (where as my apple ipad does not have the text to read, read to me option).The text to speech worked perfectly and i was impressed, as this was better then my earlier kindle from two years ago. However my thrill for the kindle soon disappeared when i tried to make a 30 second \"happy birthday\" message and send this to a relative.  It seems that this is not possible with the kindle (where as the apple ipod, i have made hundreds of 40 to 50 second video messages and sent them to relatives and friends).I figured that i must be doing something wrong. So i used the instant help \"mayday\" (which is nice), once the technician help came on, he told me that the video can not be longer then 30 seconds and this should work fine.  So i made another video that was about 27 seconds, however this did not work.  So i used mayday day, this time the technician told me that it must be less then 25 seconds long.  So again i made another short happy birthday message that was 22 seconds long.  Once again, this video would not send and i used mayday and spoke with a third technician. This technician told me that the video must be less then 20 seconds.  So once again, i made a very short 15 second happy birthday message, and once again, it would not send.  So once again, i used mayday and spoke with a forth technician and i was told to purchase a special app that would allow me to send a video.  So i purchased this app, and once again. It did not work and the app crashed.  So i called amazon and spoke with a supervisor who informed me that he believed that the kindle COULD NOT make any videos longer then 2 or 3 seconds that i would be able to send by email. This supervisor was very kind and informed me that i might be better off returning my kindle fire hdx and just purchasing a kindle fire hd (just for the \"read to me\" option).  So this is what i did (however i really did not want to as i was bored and i wanted to spend the money on a new toy for fun, and i was just looking for any reason to keep the kindle fire hdx and did my best to try to make a video using the camera and send this in a email, like i can do with my apple ipad).I was hoping the kindle fire hdx would be user friendly as much as my apple ipad, however for myself, this was not to be!", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 16 GB", "Author": "Kristina2011", "ReviewID": "R12EIROD0VI18", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2013 edition) and have owned an iPad (2nd gen), Nook Tablet, and Nook Simple Touch in the past. I love my new Kindle Fire HDX because it is remarkably fast. I purchase/rent kindle editions of my textbooks and I noticed a lag when reading them on my other tablets with the Kindle app. This isn\u2019t a problem with the Kindle Fire HDX, thank you quad-core processor! Another reason I wanted a Kindle was for the Immersion reading experience. I use this feature almost everyday. I originally thought I could save some money on audiobooks and just use Read-To-Me but the voice is too robotic and mispronounces words like \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d. The last main reason I wanted to try a Kindle was for the ability to mirror the tablet to a TV screen.It isn\u2019t the best reading experience outside when it is bright but I think it is better than most. It is really lightweight and I never know when it\u2019s in my purse or backpack and the battery life is excellent.I really like Kindle books but unfortunately when I started purchasing e-books I had a Nook so I had a lot of books in the B&N; store that I did not want to repurchase from Amazon. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I was going to return the Kindle Fire HDX but changed my mind when I found a way to get the Nook app on my Kindle. I am still disappointed in Amazon because they made it challenging. You can\u2019t personalize the background on the lock screen and that is also something I really don\u2019t like. I originally saved $15 by purchasing the Kindle with special offers but the ads were too annoying so I decided to pay the extra money to get rid of them. Unfortunately the default backgrounds are not a lot better to look at.I would suggest doing research before deciding to purchase a Kindle Fire. If you want a tablet and don\u2019t already have one, the Kindle Fire will probably not be good enough for you. If you have a lot of digital purchases from amazon (books, audiobooks, video) and want a simple tablet/e-reader, this will probably be a good investment for you.

The only way to get it back is to shut the wifi off and turn it back on again. This gets very old after about 30 times a day!Maybe the 3g and 4g devices work better.

Had mine lasted even 4 months and then died I would not be upset with a used device as a replacement... however I barely got to use mine before it died which means my husband paid 444 dollars for a USED kindle as far as we are concerned... and we are sure had we not sent the defective one back we would have been charged the price of a NEW unit, even thou that was NOT what was sent to us.  Given how brief my time was with a new one and the fact that we have no idea how much time and wear and tear is on this replacement we are very dissappointed in AMAZON and their so called quality.", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Replaced my iPad with the Kindle Fire", "Author": "Deborah Theall", "ReviewID": "R18KHML8ATN7JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit nervous about replacing my iPad with a new tablet.

I am disappointed with Facebook and Ancestry apps, however.  Neither one works as advertised.  With Ancestry, it may be the fault of the app, but Facebook simply does not perform up to the expectations as advertised.I assume this is a problem with the app?  Anyway, this is a bit of a disappointment, although a minor one.I highly recommend the new HDX 8.9 and, depending on your needs, recommend adding a Bluetooth keyboard of some kind, so that you can turn it into a mini laptop.

The Nexus is wonderful. Although it is a great size at 8.9 inches, I find the Fire tablet to be very frustrating.When using the keyboard it seems that it put spaces in all over the place and is very hard to type what we want. When editing it is almost impossible to put the cursor where you want it - sometimes the cursor is not visible and sometimes it isn't showing up even though the computer has you set to type from that spot . The capitalization seems to jump around without asking it to. It seems to put a space at the beginning of each paragraph, and takes several steps to get rid of it since you can't move the cursor accurately. Voice recognition is ever so much better on the Google Nexus.  And in general the screen touch sensitivity just seems to be off.  Lots of retyping.When you set a bookmark it is named sometimes in caps sometimes not, sometimes with icons and sometimes not.  Bookmarks are in one menu system at the top left. Saving a bookmark is in another menu on the right. The buttons on the edge of the screen are not there for some of the applications, so you have to get completely out of the application to get the home button back.We knew that the application store would not include many of the games and other applications that are available on all other tablets. Didn't think that would be such a big deal. But to discover that some very common applications and games are not available in any way on this tablet makes it much less useful.I could go on with many other little frustrations, and there are many more .

Now the cons - if you are accustomed to the large number of apps offered by Android and Apple, then you will be extremely disappointed. The app selection is seriously lacking and the apps that they do offer are way behind the ball on updates.

Most of the stuff can be accessed in a roundabout way or over the Internet, but certainly not as convenient.

If I do not like the item after testing it or wearing it or even better, looking at the way it was manufactured, I return it.I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" 32GB for my mother for Christmas. My brother bought her the iPad Air. After my mother used both tablets, we returned the iPad Air because it was so difficult to use especially with the game Ruzzle, the play screens and layout were for some reason different and confusing on the iPad, just to name a few negatives.My mom uses the Kindle HDX Tablet for email, a few games and surfing the net. She reads her books on it and jots down notes with the tablet. The Kindle HDX is one Amazing Tablet and for the price, you cannot beat the deal! The screen is crystal clear, sharp and vivid. The colors are bright, true, and brilliant.Amazon \"Nailed It\" with the Kindle vs. iPad TV Ad. The Kindle is a fraction of the cost and the quality of the Kindle HDX is just as good if not better than the iPad. With Apple, you are paying for the name, nothing else. Apple gives you nothing extra, in fact, the iPad is a Tablet with no bells or whistles but yet because the name Apple is written on it, the company feels they can \"Rip-Off\" the customer and charge an arm and a leg for the iPad. Also, Apple tracks you all over the web including the push for you to purchase the Apple Cloud Storage space. This is sale smasher in itself. No company will tell me I have to purchase cloud storage when the cloud is not safe.When we first registered the iPad, Apple wanted all kinds of information, it was intrusive and aggravating. Registering the Kindle HDX was as simple as a few clicks.The iPad cannot even run flash, we tried, it would not work.Buy the Kindle HDX, you will not look back especially for the price you paid. If Amazon puts an SD Card Slot in the next version of the Kindle, it will be a hands down slam dunk winner and could crush Samsung.I hope this review helped.

It's completely eliminated the near-nightly fight over the main TV and DVR. The wife doesn't have to be relegated to the bedroom to watch something when we want to watch sports.Admittedly, the strength of this is as a content delivery device. I haven't really used it for office stuff and doubt it would be well-suited for that. But as a method to get books/movies/mags/TV shows, it's really unequaled. The real power isn't fully realized unless combined with Amazon Prime - seamlessly integrated into the operating system. If you have a bunch of Apple or Google Play content, the case for the HDX isn't nearly as compelling, but even then I think it's still a strong case on the combination of ease of use, perfect size, light weight, performance, and price. But with Prime, it's really no contest. Very satisfied. We use our Kindle HDXs (we have both a 7 inch and 8.9 inch) daily.The only thing I wish it had was GPS....you can still use Google Maps (no, it's not in the Amazon App Store, but it's fairly easy to add, along with Chrome, as the included Silk browser...well....kinda sucks) but it won't enable turn-by-turn directions since there's no GPS.

I love to see all the book covers in color instead of the boring black and grey.The two cameras are great \u2013I can\u2019t complain about them. While skyping I had a great picture and my family could see everything clearly. The photo editing options are easy to handle and navigate; totally dummy safe.What threw me off was that if you have read/finished a book it still stays on the screen (under Book and then click Device/Cloud) \u2013it\u2019s confusing. I\u2019m used that when I finish a book and move it to a special genre folder that it\u2019s gone from my home screen but with the kindle fire it\u2019s not the case.

Definitely recommend!----------UPDATE------------This is just a personal opinion, and I'm not going to dock a star or anything. I just don't like how the charger fits into the device. It sits at a kind of cock-eyed angle, sort of pointed up. I feel like I'm breaking it every time I plug it in to charge. Not a big deal at all! Just be kind of careful.ALSO! I'd recommend getting rid of the special offers. (which you can do at anytime, for $15 plus tax) I felt like it really drained my battery very quickly. Again, just a personal opinion. My original opinion stands, that this is the best tablet you can get for the money, and really is the best tablet I have ever used.----------UPDATE #2----------Finally having issues at a little under three months, I knew such an amazing device has to have a flaw. Starting 3 days ago, my Kindle started spazzing out (the only way to describe it). It wouldn't select the book I requested, instead it opened Silk and navigated me through 2 yahoo pages and a Wikipedia entry, all by itself. It freaked out while scrolling, arbitrarily zooming in an out of pictures on twitter and Facebook. While reading, it would highlight words and navigate me all through the reading menus and stuff. It was exhausting. I did a factory reset last night, thinking it was something I downloaded. This did not resolve the issue. So I called Amazon Customer Service today for help. Within 5 minutes, after explaining my problem, they offered to replace my device, which will be here by Saturday, 03/15. I am docking one star, because Customer Service does not attest to the quality of the device. I haven't dropped my Kindle a single time in 3 months, it's barely even been out of my house. These issues were just out of the blue and random.Other than this issue, the device was great and I'm really looking forward to my replacement and jumping back into my books and tv shows :D", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 Wi-Fi 16 GB", "Author": "Shorian \"gadget guru\"", "ReviewID": "R23PPSPT8GGAUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kudos to Amazon for quarterly installment payments on the Kindle.

I am thrilled with my HDX and glad I didn't wait to get it.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you're on the fence....", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "RZ4DO3ZIL3GX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my kindle fire HDX 8.9 yesterday, and it is amazing. If you're on the fence about getting this - GET IT.The good: The display is breathtaking. Seriously. It's very user-friendly. My non-tech savvy mother figured out how to play around with it almost immediately (after i showed her how to turn it on... see my comment below). If you have prime (which you should - if you want to get the most out of your kindle), they have plenty of content available for viewing. The lending library is awesome. They also have this program called \"kindle first\", where you can get an advance copy of next-months releases. So... free movies + free TV shows + free books = happy girl. Some people have complained it's hard to find the free stuff. I'd have to disagree. There's an entire category for \"free\" stuff in the store, which makes it super simple. Amazon cloud drive is pretty neat too. I can back up my photos from my phone and tablet to the cloud drive so they are nice and safe.The bad: why are the buttons on the back? This is kind of silly. My tech-savvy boyfriend couldn't figure out how to turn the dang thing on because there's a tiny tiny little button in back. I always have to turn it around every time to find it so i can put it to sleep or wake it up. Also - 16gb is going to be too small for the average user. I bought the 32gb and i'm already close to capacity after downloading three HD movies and a few apps. If you're trying to decide which size to get - go with the 32 or larger. Also - the special offers are annoying. Get it without. We see enough ads in our everyday life to have ads on our reading devices, right?! one last thing. This is not an android tablet so you won't be able to download all the apps your android or apple phone has. It doesn't have a few apps that i use (instagram, google hangouts, gmail, etc.) But i'll survive. This might be a deal-breaker for a few people, but i have my android phone to fill in the gaps.Have I mentioned how amazing the display is??? I haven't been able to put the dang thing down since i got it!

The power/volume buttons seemed to be in strange locations, but after a few minutes, I was used to them. The buttons work very well if you are using the tablet in landscape, they are a little awkward in portrait mode. The finish/feel of the tablet was great, it's very slim and light.Once powered on, I loaded up a couple Amazon HD videos. The screen is amazing. There really isn't much more to say about it. Everything is so sharp and clear. And color reproduction seems great to me, but i'm not a videophile. Besides the screen, the next thing that really stood out to me was the sound. The speakers are some of the best ones I've ever heard on a portable device. They are not going to blow you socks off like some high end Bose system, but they seemed well above what the norm is for portable devices.The OS (operating system) on the Fire HDX works well. Everything was very smooth while navigating. Loading and switching between apps was nice and quick. The factory installed apps seemed to work well. I had never used a Kindle Fire tablet before and the OS seemed pretty easy to figure out. The Amazon App Store seems to have a lot of decent apps/games, but is still missing some of the apps I was looking forward to using. This is where things just didn't fit for me.I can use the Amazon App Store on my android phone, but can't use the Play Store from the Kindle. I understand why Amazon want's you to use their store, but I wish I had the option to use others without having to \"hack\" the device. I did find a way to load unsupported apps onto the Kindle, but it took a decent amount of effort, and I felt like it was a little too much to go through for unsupported apps.The only other complaint I have is that you can't change the background in the OS. I know you can change the lock screen background (if you paid to remove the ads, which I didn't mind the ads at all), but not the one inside the OS. It seems you are stuck to a black background. Which maybe I just didn't figure out how to change it. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.In conclusion, the kindle fire HDX 8.9 tablet is truly an amazing piece of hardware, I think as far as tablets go, it's a top dog for sure. The OS is not bad by any means, but it's not the \"pure\" android experience I was hoping for. The Amazon App Store not supporting some of the apps I mainly bought this tablet for, was the deal breaker. It seemed like way to much money for something I couldn't use as I had planned, so I ended up returning this tablet to Amazon.That said, I did purchase two of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD's for my kids for Christmas :)I will be going to a more pure android tablet for myself.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is Incredible!", "Author": "Robert C Brown", "ReviewID": "R2J7GC8QRBEA9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have the Fire HD and the features on the HDX really improve the experience!

Prior to that I didn't have much use for tablets but this one has changed my mind and become part of my daily routine.First, the audio/visual side of it works very well for me. Obviously the HD display creates very sharp images and video playback runs smoothly, looks excellent (with a high-quality source), and I have had no complaints about the sound. I added the origami case and while some people say the design doesn't really affect the sound, I do think it improves it slightly by helping redirect it back toward you just a bit. Even without it, you can hear everything just fine.I can't really get into all the deeper details about how the tablet itself works except to say navigation is simple and easy for me. The carousel is a snap to customize as far as showing what you want on it with the rest of your apps elsewhere.I mostly use the tablet for e-books, some games, and Amazon Prime videos. I've also propped the tablet up in the kitchen to follow a recipe without having to print something out or go back to the CPU to double-check something.  I have always been a traditionalist when it comes to reading, preferring the physical feel of a book in my hands, but having it on a tablet compared to a smaller device has made me change my mind.  It's probably a standard option, but I also prefer being able to set it as white text on a black background since my eyes are a little more sensitive to bright things than usual.  It just helps keep them from getting strained.A major selling point of the device is the ability to watch video through Amazon Prime.  The simple fact of the matter is you aren't going to maximize the potential of the Kindle Fire without it, because it opens up a ton of viewing options when it comes to movies and TV shows.Not everything is free through the instant video service, of course, but there's still a whole lot of stuff you can access that way.  You just have to see what the options are for each film or show.  Some allow you to download directly to the device while others don't.This should be showing up in the right place, but I bought the 64 GB version, wifi only, because for the most part it's an at-home device.  When I thought about what I pay for home internet vs. what I'd probably be paying to stream or download over a 4G connection, it made more sense for me to get the wifi-only version and live with knowing that if I'm going to take a vacation or otherwise be out of town, I'd have to either download stuff directly to the tablet before I go or hope to have a wifi signal somewhere.As an example, I took an overnight trip out of town and even though I stayed at a place with wifi, I didn't bother getting it.  I just downloaded a few episodes of a TV show to watch and that was that.  I also took a two-day train ride that did not have wifi, and I was able to watch an entire season of a TV show during the trip.  The HD episodes took up about 3 GB each so I came pretty close to maxing out the storage capacity, but as soon as I finished watching an episode I just deleted it.Be aware that once you start watching a show or movie you've downloaded, if you're not connected you have 48 hours to \"verify\" things again or you won't be able to watch that particular download until you do.  This is really a great feature of the device, since you can actually watch downloaded stuff while being completely offline for a bit.  It made the train trip extremely convenient, and I also got through most of two e-books by the end of it as well.I find the battery life to be pretty much as advertised.  It holds up well even when watching a few videos in succession, though I often charge it when I'm not using it.The camera gives a good enough image, but the examples I've taken with it seemed to have a bit of a contrast issue compared to my smartphone or the actual camera I have.  I'm not the kind of person to go around taking pictures or video with a tablet anyway, so it's not a big deal to me.  The camera itself was hardly a factor in what I decided to get.One small criticism I have is probably not a device-specific thing, but it does bear mentioning.  I have it set to automatically update my apps, though from time to time an app will prompt me to update and send me to the appstore only for there to be no \"update\" option.  On a few occasions, I've had to uninstall then reinstall the app in order for the update to register.  The last couple weeks, at least, apps I had that problem with seem to have auto-updated fine, so this may be fixed.By the way, if you're concerned about the \"special offers\" being intrusive or anything like that, they're not. When you access the device, they're no more than a displayed ad that goes away when you unlock the device, and you're on to what you want to do.  there's a tab at the top of the home screen to view all offers if you want to.  You can also spend $15 (I think) if you want to have them removed, so you're not stuck with them if you originally buy a device that comes with them.Overall, for what I got the tablet for, it meets or exceeds my needs.

And I flip it around I like the new design compared to last years body, It feels so good when I hold it I just love it, and the other thing that amazes me is how thin it is, its not as thinner then the iPad but still just as thin I would say, but its way lighter, they have removed the HDMI port so you wont be able to connect it to a TV but you can do it wirelessly with Mira case, I first turn it on and the screen is really Beyond HD, its beautiful its really amazing, the only thing I don't like about this device is they made the volume lower then the Kindle Fire HD 7 (2012) the HD was the loudest tablet I have ever heard but they made this tablet speakers worse but it is much more clear and has surround sound, but its just not as loud as the HD. When I first power house game (Dragon Slayer) it ran smoothly with no lag what so ever and the game gas I would say PlayStation 2 or 1 graphics, and it ran smoothly with no lag or stutter, Its a really fast and snappy device really it will handle any app you put on it, Its running the latest  Snap Dragon processor, and its really fast, its the fastest tablet you can get for its price. The other thing I like is that they finally added a rear camera its 8 Mp (mega pixels) its not so great but it will do what ever you want knowing tablets don't and shouldn't have really good cameras and this one has flash not many tablets have flash, only Samsung really does that and Sony is all I know of but its nice that they include that. I also like the interface its has a good design instead of fire os 2.0 which just had a plain black background, this one has a grey and black background mixture that looks amazing, and with this perfect screen it looks even better, with Fire OS 3.0 (mojito) Its a skin version of android made of all Amazon content which has a good selection, but not much of it on its app store, but it only has all the good stuff none of those useless apps. This Tablet is amazing I love it and its a great family tablet with Kindle Free time, I mean if you are an amazon user you will LOVE this device, and maybe if you never used amazon you will soon start to love it, really its the most easiest thing to get used to, its so simple.

Seroczynski", "ReviewID": "R753H1YTTKES0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've spent a lot of time over the last three days searching, working, and \"fighting\" with my new Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX (I also have first generation iPad). I was really intrigued by the hardware (primarily the display) and lower price than the competing \"Air\" product.I am very impressed how cool it runs (but I have not tried to play games with it and the display's brightness is turned down) and it has not crashed even once. Also, the battery is good for many hours of lightweight use.>I probably would have returned it by now, but I've found a couple of very good applications that I would like to continue to use: CalenGoo and Polaris Office (I don't think spending a few hundred dollars on just a \"content viewer\" is such a good idea), so I will probably keep it.>I keep discovering user interface issues. I have just discovered a problem with Kindle's PDF reader where I was unable to exit the reader when viewing a single-page PDF (would not display any \"soft\" buttons/icons and there is no hardware \"home\" or \"exit\" button). Apparently there is no way to empty \"email trash\" other than selecting each and every deleted email first (!). There seem to be NO WAY to place photos in collections or folders (I've created folders with a file explorer but they were ignored). I am just wandering who wrote the software...>So far, I have not been able to set up the Kindle calendar (this just amazed me). It wanted me to synchronize with an existing online calendar of some sort, but I don't have one. It will NOT work in a stand-alone mode and, apparently, it will not store it's data in Amazon's Cloud either. With \"CalenGoo,\" I created a few Google calendars (as it recommended), and so far it is working very well.>I was able to open, edit, and save older versions of Microsoft Excel files with \"Polaris Office,\" but it does not work with Google Drive. I used a file explorer to transfer files from-and-to Google drive and then I moved them from-to another subfolder on the Kindle; it was doable but unnecessarily tedious.>The often bad-mouthed Silk Browser has worked quite well (but I've turned the \"acceleration\" off); the only problem I've discovered so far was NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) site (disappointing).>A fact that the user cannot change the screen backgrounds (login and \"desktop\") is astonishing...The included user guide is too basic. I've just bought an e-book to solve that problem.>Amazon does not allow access to Google Play, which has some applications that are either newer or even not-available in the Amazon's App Store. I have also discovered that a lot of the available applications I was looking for (productivity and utilities) have poor users' ratings.>It would have not bothered me that there was no easy way to connect to Google Drive directly if Amazon offered a similar functionality. For example, not allowing storage of calendar data in IT'S OWN \"cloud\" totally amazed me (unless I am missing something here or I am just having a bad dream).I think, the Kindle Fire has a great potential; Amazon just needs more ambition to go beyond the reader-viewer-listener-shopper business model, or sell them for half price so we can buy multiple tablets for different purposes.Please report all shortcomings to Amazon, so the software can be improved (hopefully soon).>For clarity sake, I am a long time, \"loyal\" Amazon's customer.==============================================================================================For people new to Kindle Fire 2013 (now or in the near future), I recommend this e-book by Michael J.

When I choose some frees games it would not download them. I could not watch movies they would just buffer. I called Mayday and the connection did not hold and the man did not seem to know anything technical. He turned me over tokindle support. I was not offered any real technical support. I tried to inquire if a certain amount of broad band was needed and she said you don't have enough. You can return it so I did. Later I called again to see about another device and I was told that the HDX did not need certain broadband requirements. No one really offered to trouble shoot the situations and I could hardly understand the person helping me. She did not seem to fully understand my questions and seemed like she was reading from a script saying the same thing over and over. I was not only disappointed in the HDX I was even more disappointed at the support which seemed really non-existent. I called again to inquire about the HD after all I am not going to spend over $400 if I can only read and no one can answer how that would work. So I am really writing this to see if Amazon reads these and if they really care about how their staff responds to problems.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Having so much fun", "Author": "Marcia", "ReviewID": "R35UEEDXPESRN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having so much fun with my new Kindle fire hdx.

It does have a decent amount of apps.  But if your expecting the availability of apps similar to what Android or Apple has, then the Kindle may not be for you.  The size and weight of the Kindle HDX 8.9 is great, very lightweight.  I use mine with just a skin as protection.  The screen on the Kindle is its strong point, absolutely great for watching videos or reading books, superior to Apple or Android in my opinion.  The battery life so far has been great, for my usage.  But like any other tablet, it depends on how much you use it and what you use it for. Have yet to use the mayday feature, mostly because I haven't had the need to yet, which is a good thing.  Disappointed in Amazons epub reader selection, and they make it somewhat difficult to place your own epub books or documents from a source other than Amazon.

I got the 32 gig 8.9 incher and have only managed to fill up 4 gigs, and I have a few dozen apps and over 220 e-books on it (mostly in large part still on amazon servers, ie the cloud).  The sound is loud enough that everyone in the room can hear when someone reads to us from the 2 able speakers on the tablet, but I wish it were just a tad bit louder.  It is louder than my 16 inch notepad speakers.  Amazon whisper sync is the cat's meow for starting a book on my HP laptop and finishing it sometimes on the tablet or vice versa.  This tablet is overkill for my wife's reading needs, but I am enjoying it's other features.  I have 3 browsers on it and 2 readers, and the pixel count exceeds that of most apps and games,  so it should be a photographers delight. The 8 mp camera takes the best pics compared to a certain fruiti pad.I hope the screen is gorilla glass; so far so good.  Stays charged a long time also.  The reflexes and speed  on the kindle exceed those of a cheetah, no gripes there.  I have no gripes about the wifi.  I do find that the auto brightness can be distracting, so I turn that off most of the time.  I discovered quite by accident that it has sleep mode and Off, and no instructions about that unless I do some internet research.  It's really simple to use.  Sleep mode is a power sipper.  I can charge it from way low to over 90% in about 2 hours with the handy dandy wall wart and usb plug.

When the HDX came out, I thought about the change and decided to wait for a bit.

Great graphics resolution.Con:  Amazon Marketplace, not Kindle Marketplace. A new account, so linking things to Google's account doesn't work.  Lots of applications seem to run all the time, causing issues with other applications.Who wants the HDX?  If you want to watch videos from Amazon Prime, get the HDX.

I called Amazon customer service but with Kindles one must now call a special Kindle service line.  The Kindle CSR told us that we needed to do a number of things and then call back if the problem persisted.  It persisted but not as often.  We called back to report this and we were instructed by the Kindle CSR to reload some apps including Netflix.  It was strange that the Kindle CSR blamed Netflix's streaming for the glitch or our wireless router when our family of six watches wireless Netflix & Amazon streaming on numerous devices in numerous rooms throughout the house with no issues.  My daughter told him that she accessed Netflix with both the Kindle HDX and her laptop side by side watching the same movie from Netflix and the Kindle froze but the laptop did not.  She told him that this should be evidence that the problem was not Netflix or a wireless issue at our house.  the Kindle CSR told her that if this second round of steps did not fix the problem, then a new Kindle HDX would be sent out.  After she reloaded the apps and did what the Kindle CSR told her to do, the problem was still there, so Amazon sent out a new Kindle Fire HDX.  The new one has not encountered the problems that the old one did.  It is an expensive item to have issues with streaming when other items like our numerous laptops, smartphones, iPads, and Android tablets do not and we think that something must have been updated to fix this glitch.  My daughter likes the light weight and portability of the HDX, the image is clear and crisp, and she can download some college textbooks to it if she wants to.  She had downloaded many apps and is enjoying it.UPDATE: Now she can no longer view youtube videos again.

I love being able to get my Prime movies and TV shows on this. I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids. I use close captioning on my TV. I used to have Netflix, but when they went to the streaming they didn't have closed captioning. I let them know my need and they said they were working on it, but it was never available for anything I wanted to watch, so I cancelled. It has been hard for me to use the Amazon Prime Movie downloads on my TV. I have to run it through my laptop into my TV and Prime downloads didn't show closed captioning. So I was delightfully surprised that everything I have been watching on my Kindle from Amazon Prime has closed captioning! I like the larger screen and the picture is amazingly clear, crisp, with great colors. I keep finding new useful apps to download. The battery seems to last a long time. I know it lasts a lot longer than my iPhone. This thing is very light in my opinion, but it is my first pad computer so I don't have anything to compare it to.

In fact I was so annoyed that I thought of have it replaced.  The second week onward this phenomenon did not occur and I am keeping my fingers crossed.3. Occasional lose of WiFi connection, despite of strong signal.  I need to turn off and then turn the WiFi back on to get the connection again.4. Despite this tablet is basically running on Android, many of the Android apps are not available in Kindle Fire.5. It boosts to be able to print documents directly from the tablet to the network printer, it does not have a standard app to help you set up the printer to achieve that function.  I am totally lost in the process of shopping for the appropriate app for this purpose.  Why can't Amazon recommend the right app to do it?To conclude, a great device if you are already a Prime member and  the majority of usage is for movies, books and audiobooks.

The mayday is just awesome, and all I have to do is touch it and I have live help. The customer service is wonderful, and you can see them, but they can't see you. They can see what is on your screen and help you with almost everything. I have my Bitstrips, and my instagram, but on the Kindle it is called Padgram, but works in conjunction with the instagram. I just signed up with  Statigr.am, which is similar to instagram. The games are so much more fun on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, my favorite is Subway Surfer. My grandson is in the Marines and stationed back in Missouri, and we play Subway surfer together.A little bit about 4G LTE, mine is through Verizon, and it was suppose to be $30.00 a month rather you use it or not. I got signed up with them and they pulled the 30.00 out of my account, 2 weeks later I received a bill from them for a whopping $175.00, with no mention of the 30.00 I already paid, with a bunch of BOGUS TRUMPED UP FEES, so be Leary.Most of the games are about extracting money out of your bank account, but there are some good ones you can play without having to pay more money.If you are a previous Kindle owner, all your games and information is transferred to your new Kindle, and you will find them on the cloud. You will just have to click on the cloud, and then click on what you want and it will download it right onto your new Kindle. It downloaded all my games, apps, and my book purchases, so you don't have to re-purchase them. I use my pinterest a lot on my new Kindle. I have 5 different emails, for various reasons, and thru the Kindle I have all of my email accounts at my fingertips.I forked out over a thousand dollars for the Ipad, and I was not impressed, and it is not ADHD FRIENDLY. The photos and video were o.k, but no flash. The sound doesn't even compare with the Kindle. I originally bought it so I could talk to my grandson through Facetime, but when I started comparing the difference between the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and the Ipad, the Kindle won hands down. So I returned the Ipad and bought my Kindle HDX for 600.00, and I am so very glad I did. Now, I talk to my grandson on the phone and thru Facebook and it works for us.

I get two days on one charge and that is with full use during the day. 17 hours is not a lie, this battery lasts 17 hours of use. The screen is great and is very better than my 42 hd tv with a blueray player, my son actually prefers to watch his shows on it. (16 months). He just got interested in educational shows and responds better to the Kindle than the TV.I like how easy it is to use your amazon products in kindle, I have prime so I download Barney videos and when out and about son can watch them. Makes for a nice dinner when he is watching his shows.Where would I go with this, well I would integrate Kindle fire OS with Ubuntu because of the close business relationship they have with Canonical also a tablet as powerful as the new kindle fire hdx would kill with Ubuntu. I have an old HP laptop with similar hardware specs and when I first was using it with Ubuntu I thought I had bought a new laptop.

The kindle freetime is great too, although I have not set up an account for my son because he is just a bit too young.My only complaint is well Amazon is a bit like Apple with the apps and restrictions, let us use all the android apps, also allow for a dual boot Ubuntu :) tablet with an Amazon prime app that allows us to still take advantage of all the Amazon-Kindle environment.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful first tablet!", "Author": "shelby220", "ReviewID": "RYJ2SEHKKHK14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use, great picture/camera!

I don't know why they tell us this if it isn't true! But oh well, it worked out because Kindle gave me a bunch of \"coins\" for downloading certain apps that they were advertising that I could use towards the already discounted price of the app. It's originally I think $10 but was on sale for $5 and I didn't have to pay for the app anyway which is good! But now I can do everything on my Kindle! Watch Netflix or Hulu or go on Facebook and create documents! Screen and display is perfect even if you download a Movie or Show in Standard instead of HD it still looks like HD!! I just wish downloading movies didn't take up SO much space on the Kindle but it does. Plus it sooo lightweight and pretty. It sucks though that it has no nice and normal screen savers and they're just AD's and if you want them gone you have to pay an extra $15 but some are helpful and they're not too annoying. But overall I have no complaints. I got mine for Chistmas '14 and so far nothing has gone wrong! Tested out the Help option and they are true to their word that you can speak with a live person!

Only the slightest inadvertent rotation will change the portrait/landscape orientation. This was evident in both my units. Live Tech support could only suggest locking in the desired orientation (Options menu).

I was told by a colleague ofmine that he likes the apple because it is sexy.  Well guess what the Kindle Fire is just as sexy and more and the pictures make the Ipad Air look amateur.  Okay so you say the IPad has more apps well how many of those apps are you really going to use.  My suggestion buy the Kindle Fire and let Apple know they are not the only game in town, in fact they need to step up their game iof they are going to compete with Kindle.  Kindle Fire rocks in every way.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly What I expected!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1QOG4E7NZ9BJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been waiting for an affordable 2 in 1 tablet/computer that included everything that I wanted but it seems that none of them met my requirements so I decided to table that idea and go with just a multimedia tablet with an emphasis on reading/video/music. I had previously purchased my wife a Nook since she is an avid Barnes and Noble shopper, but since I primarily shop for books at Amazon and have purchased quite a few music CDs from Amazon as well, I figured that I might as well go with the Fire HDX. Another factor in my decision was that I had already downloaded the Kindle reading app on my phone and computers and acquired quite a few free books for my library. I am a teacher and having these available on my classroom computer appealed to me.So that is \"why\" I went with the Fire HDX. I decided on the top of the line with everything except for 4G coverage because I figured that I would always have enough content to keep myself occupied between wifi hotspots and would never need the Kindle to download something urgently enough to require it right then when I was not in an area of coverage.I am totally impressed with the display on videos, the music sounds great when connected to quality headphones, and I already have enough books to keep me busy reading for quite a while. I need to remember to utilize my 64gb hard drive since so far everything that I need is sitting in the Amazon cloud. I never was a big gamer fan, but I've downloaded several free games and a few interesting apps and being a traditional guy, I will probably stay with a steady rotation of those when I feel like playing something instead of trying to improve my mind by reading.If I would have to give any negative comment to this device at all, it would have to be that it occasionally doesn't keep up with the buffer on streaming and doesn't play perfectly with a few online video apps like Watch ESPN or CBSSports. So far, I have had only one instance of it needing to catch up with an Amazon Prime video but it wasn't a huge problem and obviously could be remedied if you went ahead and downloaded the video before watching.Speaking of Amazon Prime, it seems many people are upset because all videos are not available with an Amazon Prime subscription. I just started my trial and will spending the next 30 days checking to see what is actually available with Prime. If I cannot find enough of the videos that I want to stream for free, then I will simply discontinue after the free trial. I did the same thing with Netflix because their selection did not have the newest or best videos available for streaming. The same seems to be true of Amazon Prime but I will give them the full trial period before passing judgement.  I suggest everyone check out the videos that are available through Prime before jumping on that wagon.Anyway, the Amazon Fire HDX is everything it says it is and apparently every bit the competitor for the Apple Ipad Air or the Nook, with a display that tips the scales in favor of the Fire HDX.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "kindle", "Author": "joshua diaz", "ReviewID": "R3DX474QQ7G6U0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is just ok.

My complaint is that the calendar app that is included can't be even used if you have your email account with AOL. That, it appears, is due to the fact that it is not written in a way to allow the calendar app to sync with AOL. I learned this by using the Mayday button and going through about three reps before one that understood the problem could explain it. He stated that you had to have certain email accounts (ie. Gmail, yahoo etc in order for the app to sync.) Why in the world would you write an app like that? He further stated that there were many other calendar apps availabe that did not need to sync with your email. Supposedly that's a satisfactory answer.

But a friend of mine got one and really liked it, and he owns about 15 tablets as well as develops roms for many of them.  So along with the offer to pay in installments, I decided to give it a try.First thing is the amazing light weight, and thinness.  It almost feels like it's going to break, it's so thin.  But it hasn't(yet :) ).  The power and volume buttons being on the rear take a little getting used to, but it feels pretty good once you use it a while.The screen, of course, is tremendous, with the high resolution.  And colors are very bright, as well.  In operation, the speed of the UI is quite good, I haven't really noticed any lag.  Apps load quickly, and games like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 4 play effortlessly.Not everything is perfect, of course.  Three things in particular i wish were different.  First, lack of an sd card slot is a con, although with the 32gb version I have, storage isn't a problem so far.  But if you had a lot of movies, normally you could play them off an sd card.  Of course Amazon wants you to use the cloud, but what about if you can't connect to wifi?  For me it's not a big deal but I can see it being so for some users.The second item is no HDMI out port.  Sure, it can use Miracast, but if you don't have a Miracast enabled tv, then you have to get an adapter, and they're not cheap.  This bothers me more than no sd card slot, but again, i have a couple other tablets with HDMI out, so not a deal breaker.Lastly, no Google Play store.  While I thought this would be really bad, the Amazon app store isn't totally lacking in good apps.  Also, you can enable adb, and sideload apps easily enough.  Unless an app needs to download additional content, everything pretty much will work.Overall I find myself satisfied with the device, it's super-fast, the screen is brilliant, and the UI is actually pretty good, with the carousel.  If you're already in the Amazon ecosystem, it's much easier to get more out of the tablet.  And nothing else can really touch it for performance at this price.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very impressive!", "Author": "Michael Malloy", "ReviewID": "R1M33OG50J46NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet! I wish I could have afforded the version with more internal storage. I have purchased many Kindle books already and I'm delighted to have such a library available in one lightweight and thin device. It's much better than the B&N; Nook I bought a year or two ago. It weighs almost half of what the Nook weighs. That alone is a major advantage. I bought the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" because the technical specifications are much more attractive than the similar iPad.I have used Amazon for several years. I find shopping on Amazon extremely easy. I only wish more of the books I like were available in Kindle format.I purchased a cover/stand from another manufacturer at a computer store. So far I'm happy with it and I got what I paid for. My Kindle is well protected and I can prop it in a comfortable position horizontally for reading and viewing.The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" also comes complete with TWO cameras. Granted the camera for taking pictures is pretty low on mega pixels but it makes good snapshots. I've never had a computer with a camera that allows me to communicate with anyone. The first time I used the \"help\" feature on the Kindle I was astonished. I had an immediate connection with someone who knew the product very well and helped me more than he knows.Watching videos on this device is very addictive.

Although excellent it is not perfect. Kindle needs to supply a file storage program so you can see where documents reside. Now we have to download an app to do that. There should be a delete key to delete text to the right of the cursor instead of only a backspace to delete to the left. I am tired of the browser telling me I have too many windows open. You can never have too many windows. I have not yet found a function that properly stores your favorite websites.  The Adobe reader tells me some of the PDFs that I download are not in proper PDF format.  Yet I can download them on my desktop and  email them and put them on my Kindle.

I tried out this device under ads and it is annoying. If you are buying a device then in theory you own it. While the Kindle Fire with ads makes the purchase \"cheaper\" in a way you are not free to make a choice. Consider using the device everyday, just the thought of looking at an ad displayed on your own device is odd.Compared to other tablets out there, the Kindle Fire is the lightest and affordable. If you are new to Android, consider the Kindle Fire. It has the popular apps people use, the battery life is great and simply a great device to hold and to read from.

With the help of some Christmas money from parents and grandparents she was able to get this nice 8.9\" Kindle Fire HDX. She struggled with the decision, however, and did a lot of comparison shopping. She looked at reviews of both the iPad Mini (comparable in price to this device) and this Kindle Fire. She had to get the 8.9 to get the camera on both sides, which she wanted and the iPad mini has. The iPad mini was winning in her estimation and research, but what made her choose the Kindle was that she'd already spent so much time and energy over the many years of owning the Kindle Fire, advancing in her games and purchasing coins. I asked Help if everything from her Kindle Fire would transfer to the new Kindle Fire HDX and they said yes and failed to note exceptions to this. After getting the new device there ARE exceptions to this and they include your standings in Apps you already own and your coins. What? The whole reason she chose the Kindle Fire over the iPad mini. Two things happened to help her NOT return the Kindle, the help desk was helpful and worked hard to make things \"right\" for her on the new Kindle and she really does like the \"feel\" of this new Kindle. The HDX is light, easy to hold and does not \"accidentally\" touch the screen when you are playing games, which is something she notices a lot on her friends iPad Mini. We have had one situation of a frozen screen and we will keep an eye on this over the next couple of weeks to see if it happens again. Hopefully, no. The Help desk is easily accessible, however, and responsive so if the screen freezes again we will hopefully get some help and be able to fix it rather than have to exchange the Kindle.

HDX, 8.9\"'s basic features. I use my Kindles mainly for watching videos and tv, as well as web browsing, shopping via Amazon and very occasionally checking email when not near my laptop or pc. My daughter, who is 12, is constantly using my other Kindle, so it's a good tablet for kids- very easy to use with the added security of parental control options. Something I neglected to mention in the video is the placement of the power and volume controls which are now located on the back of the tablet, along the beveled edge. I find this to be an improvement over the prior Fire HD version, on which these were located flush with the tablet's right side edge, making them somewhat cumbersome to use without feeling around or actually looking at them.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Display!

I did a bit of research on the different kinds of tablets available and most guides I read suggested considering a variation of this question.  I use my tablet primarily for media consumption.  My primary concern was picking a tablet that streamed videos through my Amazon Prime account. This left me with two choices: the Kindle Fire HDX or an iPad.  I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 over the iPad Air because I could get the 64 GB Kindle for less than a 16 GB iPad Air.  I was also disappointed with the letter boxing on the iPad Air when it played HD movies.  While the Kindle has a smaller screen than the iPad Air, it has a bigger picture when watching movies than the iPad.  Perhaps the iPad uses more of the screen when playing TV shows and older movies, I don't know, but it only uses a portion of the screen when playing newer movies in HD.  The Kindle Fire HDX uses the entire screen when playing HD movies.  I regularly use Netflix, Amazon streaming, and Hulu Plus and have no complaints with the HDX's performance on this front.  The speakers are more than adequate for watching movies and listening to music.  I have no experience with other tablet speakers so I can't make a comparison, but the HDX speakers are well placed, clear, loud, and don't sound tinny.  Reading on the HDX is very easy.  I have the Nook, Aldiko, Moon+ Reader, and Comixology apps, and of course the Kindle App is pre-loaded on the HDX.  The HDX is quite light and easy to hold, in either portrait or landscape mode, for extended periods of time.  I'm very happy with the battery life as well.  I get 13 hours on a full charge.  On weekdays, after work, I can use the HDX for two days in a row before I have to think about plugging it in.  On weekends the tablet will last an entire day of almost constant use before needing to be charged.  I've only ran the battery down to 0% once, and I think it took a little over six hours to reach 100%.The biggest problem with the Kindle Fire HDX is the app store.  Since the Kindle Fires are closed off from the Google Play store I thought Amazon would focus on quality over quantity with regards to apps offered, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  There seems to be an abundance of cheap, poorly designed apps and a noticeable absence of certain popular apps.  The 1Mobile Market rectifies this a bit, but I still find the absence of some popular apps in the Amazon app store curious.  I would like a Google Drive app, but have to settle with accessing it through the browser.  With a little bit of research, I've found workarounds for most problems, but it's annoying to not have simple, direct access to apps other tablets have.  I'm also not a big fan of the carousel on the home screen, but I suppose some people may prefer it.The Kindle Fire HDX has some real limitations, but on the whole I am happy with my purchase.  If you want to use your tablet for work, you may want to do some more research to make sure the Kindle Fire will do want you need.  If you want a portable media player to watch movies, play music, browse the internet, and read books the Kindle Fire HDX is a good choice.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had to return it.

The carousel interface is kind of neat, but more often gets in the way of finding the content you want to use at than assists in it.  That it tries very hard to direct you into purchasing new things rather than letting you get to things you have already bought and now want to use just makes it worse.  While some of the features can't be had anywhere else due to Amazon licensing terms (and the only reason this isn't getting 1 star) you know who you are if you want these.While I'll agree that a media player needs a nice screen, and this certainly has it, the problem is that the rest of its' technical specs are complete overkill for the job at hand.  You simply don't need quad-core, dedicated graphics, or massive internal storage if all you're going to be doing is reading books offline and streaming movies.  And boy, do they want you to stream over downloading.This is even further hampered by several bizarre decisions in the design.  Rear-facing speakers make it difficult to hear the thing even in relatively quiet environments without turning it up to the point where you will bother other people.  The keyboard and dictionary features are weak compared to Google's and Apple's offerings, making the touchscreen keyboard a pain to use effectively.  And the internal power management means that it often can't take advantage of the increased battery life - playing an HD movie drains the battery FASTER than a power cable can supply it.The Amazon app store is a complete joke.  My last tablet was an HP Touchpad, and before I installed Cyanogenmod the app store for THAT had easier, cheaper access to needed features.  When compared to Google Play and iTunes you just have to laugh.If all you're looking for is a cheap way to get access to Amazon content, consider the Kindle Fire HD - at over 200 bucks cheaper the minimal loss of resolution is probably justified, and you can actually connect that directly to an HDTV instead of needing an expensive new wireless setup of questionable utility (another strike against the HDX).  If you want a full-featured tablet, look at the iPad Air or one of the new KitKat-based Android tablets that should be coming out soon.Only buy the HDX if you seriously can't live without the ability to download a small subset of Prime-access videos.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would be 5 stars except....", "Author": "Don Weber", "ReviewID": "RXFMR02FA0L9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nicely done product, but not quite as intuitive as the iPad.

Within 5 minutes, I had the Kindle Fire HDX turned on, connected to my wifi, it knew it belonged to me, and had my email set up. By far the quickest start-up of any device I have had. After having it a while, I do have issues with the fact that it will not let a number of my music cd's transfer correctly. I am gathering it is because they are mwav files. Using the Mayday button did not provide a lot of help. The wait for help was less than 15 seconds, but the assistant did not have any ideas why I could not see a number of my cds on the Kindle at the same time I could see through my laptop that they were in the Kindle internal storage in the music folder. He suggested I download the Cloud player, put my music on the cloud, and listen from the cloud. After several attempts to download the Cloud player to my laptop using internet explorer, I eventually got it to download properly using Google Chrome. Then I discovered you can only have 250 songs on the cloud without paying the $24.99 fee to put more music on the cloud. After picking and choosing what music to send to the cloud, I then found out you can't download from the cloud to the Kindle, you have to transfer from the laptop. Useless.  The Amazon cloud player would not accept about 20% of the songs I tried to transfer due to the wrong format(I think that is the issue, anyway). That is how I then looked at the properties of the tracks on the CDs and discovered the ones that would not transfer were all mwav files (windows media) so they must somehow be incompatible with the Kindle (or protected) not sure. So it appears my music issue is not just a Kindle issue, but an Amazon issue. Anyway, I am not happy with the fact that I can't put a lot of my music on the Kindle Fire HDX. That is why I have given it 4 stars instead of 5. I have been overall happy with the Apps I have downloaded. The location of the power and volume buttons is difficult to get used to. The screen has stellar resolution, and reading books is easy.

This is my 6th Kindle.  (2 used by grown children, 1 to sr. citizen mother, 1 used by grandchild, and my Kindle HD 8.9 now goes to husband.) So I've grown with the Kindles, from Fire 7\", Fire HD 7\", Fire HD 8.9\", and now the Fire HDX 8.9\".  Each one has new improvements.  And up until the HDX 8.9 the user guide has been really good.  But with this Kindle, you can now use the Mayday feature and get instant help (I haven't used it, so don't rely on this info).  Apparently Amazon has decided that no one would prefer to just look it up for themselves.  So you can't.  The information isn't there. The user guide is a very shallow overview.  If you have never used a Kindle Fire, the guide will tell you how to charge, plug in to a computer, register or unregister your Kindle, purchase content, and other basics.  But you won't be able to find out how to do the new, nifty stuff.  For that, you need to contact Amazon or hit the Kindle Forum.  Which means you may not know what you're missing because there isn't anything in the user guide to tell you what your Kindle can do. I've already had to contact Amazon twice to find out how to do things I could do on the HD 8.9.  It's just different enough on the HDX that I needed info.  An adequate user guide would have been useful. Perhaps Amazon will make one available in the near future (I hope).Don't let this deter you from getting the HDX 8.9.  It's a great tablet. And Amazon has the BEST customer service I have ever used, so the answer to my questions were just a quick phone call away. I just wish I had the choice to use the user guide instead. This is especially true when I'm in the middle of nowhere, because wifi isn't always available. 4G isn't always available. Electricity and running water aren't available.  We're that kind of weekends and vacations people.The HDX 8.9 comes with a 9W AC adapter and cord to charge your Kindle.  These adapters are $20 if purchased separately, and charge Kindle Fire models, as well as phones and similar items, in half the time of standard adapters. The HDX 8.9 takes great pictures (haven't used the video function yet), and is so light, you actually feel the difference compared to the HD 8.9.  Because it's different from the HD, I'm still getting used to some differences in using features, but after a week, I haven't found anything missing from the HDX 8.9 that the HD 8.9 had, and there are lots of new goodies.

First of all, for a premium tablet, the Kindle Fire doesn't have GPS.  Secondly, you are SEVERELY limited in what you can do with this tablet.  Amazon really only wants you to use for reading their books and watching their movies.  They realized that they couldn't sell a tablet without games, so have a limited set of games available.  This is NOT an Android tablet.  Amazon took the Android operating system and seriously customized it, removing the ability to use any browser other than the one they wrote (at least one if not ore generations behind current Chrome, Firefox, or Opera), you can't use the Google Play Store, you have to use Amazon's store, which doesn't have near the variety of apps.All in all, it is disappointing that Amazon advertises this as an iPad competitor, when it is so ridiculously limited.**Update** based on a comment, I will be more accurate and say that you can't run a browser other than Silk without sideloading it...in other words, you cannot download another browser from the Amazon App Store, you have to change a setting to allow loading apps from unknown sources, then load the browser apk file from another website or device...something that many folks that aren't tech-savvy will not want to do.My assessment still stands as-is...great hw (except missing GPS) but overly restrictive, modified OS.**Update** after using it for several months now, I bumped it up to 4 stars because I find that I do very little with it outside of reading and watching videos of my granddaughter.

As when PPI gets above what Apple calls a retina screen, my peepers cannot tell the difference).  So don't worry about the screen, either tablet presents what is being displayed in a gloriously bright and clear manner.One item that I do wish Apple had included (In an aesthetically pleasant way, of course) is a microSD slot which would allow quick transfers of data without an additional dongle that plugs into the Lightning port.  The kindle provides this out of the box.The OS that is installed on the Kindle is what is irks me the most of all and is the reason I wouldn't suggest the purchase over an iPad Air.  The kindle has an obvious purpose here and it has become overtly advertised with the discounted kindles like the Fire HDX that ruins the feel that you are getting a premium product; \"Special Offers!\" Once you realize what Amazon's true goal of the Kindle Fire is; to try to sell you more products from Amazon based upon what you do with your tablet, or should I call it their tablet as you are losing your privacy from where you are when you do whatever it is that you do with that* kindle.This is a deal breaker to me as I know how iOS on the iPad Air was designed and who it was designed for; the business sector and Apple users that think like the designers.  The iOS operating system is very detailed about when it is going to provide personally identifiable information to an application regardless of developer (Apple or any other).  Apple also does not let out any applications that attempt to gain user information without absolute transparency and asking first.  This walled garden is something that cannot have a price attached to it.With the Kindle HDX, you are paying for a device that is letting a company know what you are doing with their tablet at all times. When you consider this factor in the pricing hype over the Kindle HDX you would not be alone to wonder what they are paying you to use their tablet over a protected Apple iPad Air. (I cannot stop thinking of this tablet like those free* internet providers that  were around a few years back as well as those companies that used to give you a free computer that used these same targeted advertising techniques Amazon has rediscovered and deployed with the Kindle HDX).I expect Amazon to keep information on what I search their site for and what I purchase from them.  But this is where I feel our relationship should stop.  If you are comfortable with this information keeping aspect of the Kindle Fire and the absence of a large, tested and safe marketplace of applications and add-ons from tripod mounts to microphones to lens attachments and more.  The Kindle Fire HDX might be good for you. Be sure to try one out first at a Best Buy where you can compare it to the iPad Air.I will continue to use my regular Paperwhite Kindle, to read eBooks.  This is one thing the Kindle Fire can't do, surprisingly.  But to get that paper-like look you need an eINK display not a high resolution one like the Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad Air have.For my peace of mind, I am going to return the one I purchased to the store and stomach the slightly higher price of the iPad Air.

Uncertain as to why as my other wireless devices were working just fine from the same location and only a few feet from the wireless router. I've read other reviews where this was a problem.

There are some quirks (e.g., the touch screen is supersensitive, so I prefer to use a stylus), but you can adjust to them easily enough.  I really needed a device that would allow me to be productive away from home, and so far the Kindle fits the bill.  I am still working my way through some of the features, but to date I am very pleased with my purchase.  Go for the 8.9\" for greater ease of use.

I travel quite a bit, and wanted to be able to watch movies/shows available via Prime when I am on the road. Unfortunately, there are several \"gotchas\" with this feature that make the Kindle quite a disappointment.1) You might think that *all* Amazon Prime shows / movies would be available for download. You'd be wrong. It seems most TV shows are available, but movies? I'd say maybe 1 out of 4 movies I looked at are available for download.2) Even when you download content, Amazon wants to \"phone home\" frequently due to DRM. I took the tablet on a two-week trip to Europe where I had infrequent access to Wi-Fi and wanted to watch shows on flights. Several movies refused to play at all unless I connected to Wi-Fi to \"correct a problem\" that demanded Internet access. This was a rude surprise, and I was deeply disappointed that having spent quite a bit of time loading the Kindle with content turned out to be a waste of time.Since the Kindle Fire is based on Android, you might expect to have some of Android's more popular apps - like Chrome, YouTube, or Google Maps. Nope. None of these are easily available on the Kindle Fire.I will give the Fire high marks as a playback device. If you download content in its highest resolution, it looks and sounds fantastic. The X-Ray feature is also pretty nifty, if you're connected to a network when watching shows on Amazon Streaming. Unfortunately, I didn't really buy it for home streaming - I have a TV to watch content on when I'm home.Bottom line: I'm really sorry that I bought it. I hope Amazon will open up the download feature to other tablets before too long, as I'd prefer to have a tablet that does everything I want - and the Fire isn't it.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "old sarge", "ReviewID": "R3RGKL28U797TY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the HDX,  the display  is as good or better than than my wife's IPad, the kindle is as fast as the IPad as well.the colors on the HDX are fabulous , it is lighter than the IPad also.

The only problem I have had so far is that I haven't figured out how to download the pictures from the Fire HDX to my PC, so I'll have to consult the book on that (I think I will need to upload them to the cloud then download from there to the PC).  I use it enough that I have to recharge it everyday, but that is no problem.  I read my first generation Fire while it is charging.  I love the way they sync between each other.

The IPad was okay, and it did the job, but it had its issues; kind of iffy WiFi reception (even in my house), problems playing certain types of videos that required flash player, etc.  I did a fair amount of research, for a layperson, read lots of reviews, and decided to purchase this tablet instead of going for a laptop.  My main reason for doing so was portability; so much easier transporting a tablet.  I really needed something to access work sites from home, do professional reading, casual reading, watch a movie here and there, play a game.The first thing that I noticed was that the graphics were amazing. Crisp, clear pictures; clean lines, really gorgeous.  WiFi reception was much improved within my house, pages loaded faster than the IPad, so far so good.  Then I began running into some snags.  Amazon doesn't have the app we use for our company email (First Class), which was available on the IPad.  I am able to enter using a browser, but the site does not function as well.  I tried to access another company website and was met with \"Error 500\" codes when trying to login; again, not a problem I had on the IPad.  This one hurt, because I actually had to get in to do some work, so I had to kick my 15 year old off of his desktop to get into our company website (that was enjoyable for both of us).I did play one puzzle game and it was great-no hangups or lags; same with watching a movie.  I wish I could say that everything went well in this area, but I also ran into some snags.  Some games aren't available for the HDX, only the non-HDX versions of the Kindle, but are advertised by Amazon as \"Available for Kindle\".  It gets frustrating when you think you've found something, only to find its a non-compatible version.  If you go looking for games on popular sites like Big Fish or Google Play, you notice how far behind in the market Android is compared to IPad (I was schooled by a 7-year old in a rather know-it-all tone).So, is the Kindle the end-all-be-all? Well, it's nice, but not quite the workhorse/playhorse their ads make it seem.

One of the most important reasons why I bought the HDX is because it is thinner and weighs less than the Kindle HD.  The picture/screen is more resilient and the other driving reason I bought it is because of the camera - not just a front facing one (which is an app on the HD camera) but is a real camera with zoom and video and other capabilities.  The one main issue that is somewhat of a negative however is that nowhere does it tell you that if you want to watch a movie by connecting to the TV, you have to purchase an additional 'unit' (I spent $60 for it).

I'm really not happy about this.

I really don't want to have to purchase an iPad or a Galaxy...  I want a Kindle darn it all.*****  Update  *****The replacement kindle fire hdx was an improvement... must have been a bad unit I received at first.

Bought the HDX because I wanted an IPAD style camera among other things. I got the HDX a week ago and it has blown me away. First of all, the weight is so light and also the battery is great. I played a video with the brightness all the way up and I got like ten hours with the WIFI off(the WIFI drains a lot of battery by the way so keep it off if your not on the web). The screen resolution is like BLURAY quality but also a great tip is that if you're watching an SD video, put it at least five feet from you and the brightness all the way up and it's very close to HD quality. It's very smooth and fast when scrolling around the screen. Love that they finally included a rapid charger. Nothing bad to say but are a couple of things they could improve on but are really minor.

I always enjoyed it, with the exception of the poor workmanship of the charging port. Amazon made that right by giving me a Fire HD (the first gen of the HD with the camera) for a minor cost upgrade even though my Fire was 2 years old.  I appreciated that and then bought this.  This really does a great job of tying it all together.  The only complaint I have about the Fire platform is that it's a little too \"Apple\" for me.  What I mean by that is that because Amazon earns so much off their content, they purposely limit what they feel is competition.  I can't use Chrome as a browser and I can't download dropbox. (on their native settings... I've not attempted to d/l apps from other sources yet), but that's all on the \"App\" side. The actual tablet is a nice tablet (a great size) and has most of the bells and whistles i need. I wish it had GPS for the basic WiFi version (My Nexus 7 does) but where they go wrong there, they have a flash for the camera.

The issues/downside:  There was (is?) a packaging snafu and the adapter cord did not fit the adapter properly, therefore, the Kindle wouldn't charge. I had gotten an extra 9W adapter and after problem solving this with the Help line, I was sent what I needed at no charge, in very little time. After resolving that problem, recharging is much faster than my laptop.  My other disappointments were 1) it's not compatible with the program that allows me to play some of my online games, although I've been told that addition is being negotiated; and 2) I live in the Florida Keys, too far from the mainland for greater access to E books, so aside from purchasing the books I want to read, what's available to me for free is very limited. This is probably not an issue for people on the mainland. I have, however, been able to buy the books I wanted from Amazon ($9.99).  I haven't traveled with it yet so I don't know how it functions with videos, but all in all, I'm glad I bought it. If your primary use is reading, this is the one for you.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome device", "Author": "Judy Norcini", "ReviewID": "R2AUK2NE8YPWCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great color and clarity.

Other tablets I have/have used extensively are: two previous versions of the ipad (job issued), a nexus 7, galaxy note 8 and a galaxy note 10.1 2014 (beautiful but returned because of changes to how handwriting recognition worked - see my review if interested) and a kindle fire 7 (original).  I have some background for comparison.Pro's:  A beautiful and responsive touch screen with plenty of power \"under the hood\".  The device is never laggy.  Great \"consumable content\" through the Amazon ecosystem including the ability to download some prime video (great for me because I travel extensively).  Relatively long battery life when compared to the Galaxy note 8.  Great value for the price.  Superb Amazon customer service - they stand behind their products and my experience with this product has been no different.  I consider this last pro to be one of the most important to me.Cons:  Limited apps in the appstore.  I agree with most reviewers that you can find most of what you need, HOWEVER, there are some caveats:  some of my favorite apps are not the most recent versions and can be buggy (Flipboard and Zite crash occasionally and im not sure if its the apps themselves or something with the Kindle), silk browser is improved over prior versions but still isnt on par with other browsers in rendering the odd page here and there (and what do you know?  you cant easily use any other browser yeah, I know I can sideload but should I have to? maybe this is because the default is for use of accelerated page loading so your data goes through Amazon's servers and they can use it to market to you?)  Additionally, battery life can be erratic occasionally and I had a black screen that didnt go away with power button reset so I had to completely reset it.  The onscreen keyboard is shifted to the right and makes it difficult to touch type but the ability to \"swype\" type negates that issue for me.I know the cons look like a long list but in reality it isnt.  The tablet provides real value in the form of screen, brute power, and content.  Its just a little rough around the edges.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE MY KINDLE", "Author": "T.

She loves it. The download speeds are quick and the picture on it is amazing. The operating system was no problem because she was already familiar with the Android system thanks to her phone. She takes it with her when my daughter is at practice which before, with her laptop, would have been too cumbersome. If she is using her Kindle and she needs to do something, she simply (and easily) sets it to the side, goes about her task and easily returns to where she left off. The size is ideal and she doesn't worry about the \"leg burn\" you can get from a laptop sitting on your legs. The battery life is perfect and she takes it with her everywhere she goes. The portability is miles ahead of where a traditional laptop would be. And there is an app for just about everything you might want to do.She also uses her Kindle as an educational tool for some of the children she looks after. The app store has a multitude of educational apps that she has downloaded and uses with younger children to help them learn to read and to improve their math scores. Every day she seems to find a way to incorporate her Kindle Fire HDX in a new way.I am more than pleased with having made this purchase and somewhat surprised how much she uses it in a variety of ways.

It's really fast and the picture quality is amazing.  And best of all...NO ITUNES!  I was a little concerned before buying this about not having access to Google Apps.  However, most apps were available through the Amazon App store.  Other things, like Google Maps, was available in it's full version using the Silk browser, which is really fast as well.  And if you really need an app you can't find in the Amazon App store, there are simple ways to get your apps from Google without needing to root your device.  Just search online...it's really easy.The only thing this tablet is missing that I can find is the lack of a GPS.  But for $170 less than an iPad, and for a faster processor and better display than almost any other tablet on the market, I can live without a GPS.  For the record, we are streaming videos to the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and an iPad at the same time using the Corsair Voyager Air.

When tying it onto the Prime membership, it makes it a winning combination. There are a few reasons why I can't give 5 stars to this Kindle:1. No Google integration - Yes, I know what everyone else will say. If you really want that you should've bought either Google hardware or go with Samsung, etc. Sure, you're right. But no, that doesn't mean Google integration should not be part of the package. What happened if Google decided not to support any Amazon app (and just removed them all from Play store)? I wish Amazon would just allow Google apps in and let the market decide who they want to go with. Again, this hardware is just plain beautiful.2. Problem with speakers - Within the first few weeks I had a problem with speakers where they just stopped working.After reaching out to Mayday (awesome service, Amazon!) the service person suggested that I would insert/remove headphone jack and see if that would fix the issue. It did immediately. The person went on to say that it was a known issue and product development was working on it. I just wish there was some communication/fix on the issue already.Overall this is a great device. I am still enjoying it very much and look forward to updates to the ecosystem.

Connecting to my WiFi was simple and without problems.  Adding the device to my existing Verizon account did require my calling Verizon's tech support, but that's probably because I live out from town and wasn't getting a strong enough signal.  However, Verizon tech support was very helpful and quickly resolved the problem.  There was also a glitch connecting to my email account on my ISP, but that seems to have been a problem at their end, and has been resolved.  Connecting to my Gmail account was seamless.I've found the frequent complaint of not enough apps (compared to as standard Android) to be a non issue for me.  I've had no problem finding the apps I need and want, or acceptable replacements in cases where the ones I'm use to aren't available.It would be nice if the HDX came with Google maps/navigator installed, but I have that on my phone, so it's not a big issue.  Besides Map Quest maps/navigation is free at the Kindle app store.  It may not be quite up to Google maps, but then again, maybe it is.  I really haven't an opportunity to try it yet.All in all, I'm pleased with my device, and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I've only had it for one day.=======================  Comments added on 2/27/2014 ==================================================I'm now two weeks into owning my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (Verizon), and I've added another star to my rating to make it a 5-star rating.  I stand by all my comments above, and would like to add that I find the management and use of my Kindle library so much easier with this tablet than with my old (Gen. 3, I think) Kindle.  With this device I get to see the cover of the book I'm reading each time I open it on the carrousel, so I can remember the name of the book I'm reading.  On my old Kindle, I usually only saw the title and author when I first started reading and quickly forgot both (hey, I'm 70 years old).I've installed Waze navigation app, and it works very well - not that I will use my tablet often for navigation, but it's nice to have.Like most, if not all, Android based tablets, it doesn't get as strong a 4G or 3G signal as my Android phone, but I'm usually connected to WiFi, so that's not particularly important to me, which I'm sure begs the question of why did I buy a 4G model to begin with.  The answer is simple - I wanted to.All in all I find the Kindle Fire HDX far superior to my wife's Android tablet, and I'm very pleased with it.
