{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Multi-function Tablet at a Great Price!", "Author": "Shoof \"trice di cinema\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3CAA9MLYV9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife has a Google Nexus 7 tablet and the latter is my only frame of reference for functionality and quality.I purchased (3) Zeepads for my grandchildren and they arrived 12/22/12 instead of the scheduled 12/21.  All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.  While I was very skeptical that a tablet would do all the things claimed, after seeing the Zeepad in action, I wish I would have grabbed one for myself!", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet! see review to get some tips on it.", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "R2T2EI4DAUN9YR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently received my tablet yesterday, it worked right out of the box it was somewhat charged. Note: You should charge it as soon as you get it because it takes 6hrs to charge the first 2 times, this is stated in the manual. Also, be careful with the wall charger, mine needed to be adjusted before it could begin charging the tablet. If you charge by USB it might take longer, i found that the wall charger is quicker. YOU SHOULD BUY MEMORY EXPANSION, it's not optional if you plan on adding a lot of items on your tablet you get 1 GB of on-board storage. Make sure you are careful not to drop it, i would not recommend that at all because it doesn't seem like it is able to take much damage. Personally i bought a tablet case with a keyboard a good 1 to use is the 7\" Tablet Stand with USB Keyboard - Black Faux Leather Carrying Case, there is a converter that comes with this tablet that you can hook up to the cases keyboard USB cable. The browsing speed is quite nice and the apps are amazing since they come from the Google play-store. You can stream any type of online content like from YouTube or the web. One thing i found odd is that when your on the main screen and you click the search magnifying glass you see a brief image of previous YouTube videos that you've watched. In my opinion i suggest you uninstall the YouTube app that comes with the tablet and re-install a newer one which fixed my problem. Tip: If you put a SD card in and you want to get it out you push the SD card in and then release it and it will come out. If you decide you want to link a YouTube account with your tablet, and each time you try to login you get an error message. You might need to do the 2-step verification for the Google account you want to link with(additional help just ask). This is an overall good product. If you have any question feel free to ask.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "S Far So Good!", "Author": "Tashagaqt", "ReviewID": "RXQOBJKHS2L0O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tab for my mother as a Xmas gift.

They are nearly useless, but it is and android operating system, and nothing that you cannot figure out, if you've ever used an android device.

Its biggest advantage is that it comes rooted from the factory. With a fast SD card (Class 6 or better), it runs full screen, full motion, video without even straining and it's compatible with Kindle. Granted, the camera isn't the greatest but, hey, look at the price and move on. The WiFi connection is rock steady and this tablet can also be set up as a Wireless Hot Spot. Audio Quality is outstanding and it even has a rudimentary Graphic Equalizer, along with sound FX, included. Obviously, the video quality isn't what an iPad or one of the more expensive Android tablets would offer but, again, look at the price and move on. It's good enough that only a comparison with something a LOT better will show its shortcomings. You can set up one of three different kinds of start-up security but be warned: If you password protect this tablet you MUST use a USB keyboard to log on. Otherwise, you won't get in.There are a few small, (to me at least), problems with this tablet:1) I originally purchased this tablet from Sears and those, (I purchased two for my grands), had the Adobe Reader, Skype, Netflix, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flipit, and Solitaire preloaded but this one did not. Apparently, this is a slightly different, (read: Newer), version of this tablet and that accounts for the difference in available out-of-the-box apps. That's not a con for me personally, but for those of you who buy a tablet for any of the above, be aware that you'll have to download all those apps.2) The viewing angles are actually pretty good EXCEPT....If you tilt the top of the tablet too far back, you will get what amounts to a negative image. The other viewing angles are about what you would expect with a flat screen. If you, as I did, buy this tablet with one of the keyboard cases that have the \"kickstand\" on the back, you won't have to worry about this problem except when using the tablet in Portrait position.3) The specs say it has 4Gb of internal storage but unless there is something here that I'm not aware of, this tablet has only 2.5Gb of actual, usable, internal storage. For me, that's no big deal because I'll be using it mostly as a reader for Kindle books. For someone who wants to load a bunch of apps and games, be aware: There is not as much internal storage space as you think there is. On the upside, the tablet will accept up to a 32Gb Micro SDHC card and you can also plug in a USB Flash Drive so storage space, (except for apps which just don't play well unless installed to the primary \"hard drive\"), is not really an issue.4) I'm not sure if this is really a con but I need to mention it. The battery life seems to be a bit short. I've gone from 100% to about 20% in a couple of hours of intense surfing. That said, I've also watched a 2+ hour movie with no problem at all, so it could just be me. On a brighter note, Comodo has a free battery saver app that's worth its weight in gold. So far, I've seen a 2x increase in battery life after installing that app.5) This tablet is woefully short on documentation. The included manual is nothing more than a Quick Start guide and there is a shortage of any kind of technical information about this tablet on the Net. After a bit of searching I found the manufacturer's web page, [...], but there is very little useful info there. Again, this is not a con for me personally, I do computers for a living, but the average user needs to be aware that if you buy this tablet, you'll need to do your own problem solving because there is very little in the way of help from the manufacturer.I put this tablet through rigorous testing over a period of a month. I did everything I could to it, short of actually \"Bricking\" it, (or throwing it against a wall), to see how much it could take and how well it performed. I actually got it to freeze but a quick Google session, (Hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time until the tablet shuts off [About 5 seconds]. Press and hold the power button as instructed in the manual to turn the tablet on and you're back in business), produced a solution to that problem. I can truthfully say that this tablet is built like a Timex. The Boomers who read that last will understand exactly what I mean by that and why, as a result, I'm giving this tablet a 5 star rating.I bought two of these as birthday presents for my grands and I liked them so much that I got one for me and will buy at least two more for two more of my grands. They come with everything you need, (USB OTG adapter, USB Data Cable, Stylus, Earphones, Screen protector, and Charger), and they can be used with a USB Keyboard/Mouse. You could even attach a USB Mini-Hub if you'd like. This particular version also solved the problem of the shaky charger connection and even included better quality, noise cancelling, in canal earphones.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Great Performance to Price Ratio and you're looking to break into the world of tablets, without breaking the bank, you want this tablet.

Since that tablet is no longer on the market, we purchased another \"no-name\" device, figuring it'll all be the same. Boy, we were so wrong.To start with some positives, this tablet looks cool. It is small and lightweight, and it connected to our wifi fast. Now I will elaborate on why I gave it one star. We don't expect much of those cheap tablets, we only want it to load and play the internet videos and display pictures. That is what our daughter uses it for. However, this tablet would not load the videos. Youtube website will load, but the video will be loading and loading forever. It might have loaded eventually, but I never waited for longer than 5 minutes. I figured, it it takes 5+ minuted for a simple few minutes video to load, my daughter will have a problem with it. I was very disappointed, I so wanted to keep this little tablet.Another thing we noticed, is that the tablet would shut down periodically on its own. What the heck is that, so annoying. Plus the battery life is measle, it lost 50% of its charge in about 30mins being turned on and connected to wifi. And finally, I made sure I ordered a black device. However, the one delivered to us was red. The stylus was not included either, although advertised.All in all, this parody of a tablet went back the very next day. Amazon was great, made the return easy, fast and simple. Needless to say, I would strongly advise to stay away from this product.

I've turned down the brightneess and tried other things but to no avail.  Its a great tablet tho so the battery issue isn't a deal breaker for me as I'm not taking it out of my home.

The manual that comes is very very tiny and also in broken English, probably used a translating program so you tend to scratch your head a bit.. that is IF you can read it, the print is so small I had to get a magnifier to read it and then discovered it was of almost no use at all.  So without any instructions it was/is hard to sort of figure out how it works.  It took me a considerable amount of time just to figure out how to set up the internet WiFi.... but once I figured out the simplicity of it.. it was set up in seconds .  The downside is that sometimes the device just does not want to let you get onto the internet even when the signal is strong.. unsure what is causing that issue... but you can come back later and try it and it might go onto the internet easily.. so don't know what is hanging it up.The device itself feels a bit flimsy but is also very light weight. The screen colors are fine and the sound is \"just ok\" .  I haven't tried Netflix yet but if there are issues I will edit this review.The battery is not very good, and I am not wild about the charger that came with it, however you can use it and play games on it while it is plugged in and being charged.  The type of battery that is in it.. the instructions say it is better to let it run out completely before you recharge it.. and if you have issues because you have charged it to soon.. to let the battery run out completely then recharge it.On the Positive side... For the price ($77.00) it is a pretty decent little handheld.  It accesses tons of games, almost all of the  same games I have on my Kindle Fire.. many many free ones and most games are between 99 cents to 2.99. The game downloads go easy and the game play is fine. The touch screen is very responsive and it takes only a gentle touch to play the games or select items.  I do plan to expand the memory with a micro sd card but may find that I don't need to.  I have half a dozen games on it right now and in less than 24 hours I am getting to understand the device. It is not a Kindle or a Ipad.. it is what it is.. which is a ok value for what you pay for it.  I dont mind the quirks with the internet for I think I will be able to figure that out as time goes by.  I originally bought it for my husband to be able to look thinks up on the internet but think I will probably just load games on it and let it go at that.. my husband will use it a bit or the grand kids will surely play the games so it was worth the price just to have a small handheld game player around for them to play.Would I buy it again? probably  Would I give it as a gift?  probably  of course this opinion is based on only having the device up and running for 24 hours  and hard to predict if it will hold up.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Mrs. Kia", "ReviewID": "R1TCM0WSC220PQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is that I have yet o find out no to put on the parental control.

I am sending it back for a refund.  Very disappointed!-----------------Previous reviewSo I just received my Zeepad last night.  First impression out of the box, it is better than I expected.  I ordered it thinking how good could a $70 dollar tablet be. and how much can it really do compared to the more expensive brands and models?  Well I was surprised.  It is a bit heavier than I expected, but that just gives it a more substantial feel.I have a 'better' tablet already.  I have the ASUS Eee Pad TF101 32Gb and love it.  But I was wanting something a bit smaller that wouldn't break the bank.  I read alot on my tablet so it goes almost everywhere with me, but the ASUS can be a little big for the handbag:)  I wanted something that would fit better in my purse for on-the-go reading, but I also wanted a bit more then just an ereader in case I wanted to look something up on the internet or play a game to pass time somewhere.  Yes I could have gone with the KindleFire or Nook Tablet but they are still well over $100+.  I also like having access to the wide variety of Apps that are available with Android.  I'm not totally sure what all is available with Kindle and Nook.I saw this and several people who purchased had said they were pleased so I decided to give it a try.It connected to my home wireless easily.  The touch screen is responsive, much better than I expected. I immediatly went to Google Play and began downloading and installing Apps I wanted.  No problems there.  I went to the browser and everything was working OK except for one of my favorite web pages.  When it loaded all I got was a blank screen.  Reloading didn't help.  I went back to the Apps store and downloaded Firefox and Opera web browsers to see if they would display the page.  Finally after paying with settings I got my page to come up in Opera.  I'm really not sure why this web page was having such a problem on this tablet but i got it to work so I'm happy:)With the display only being 800x480 everything is not as crisp as my ASUS but by increasing the font size on my ebooks they read OK.  I haven't tried any videos or the camera on it yet so can't address those at this time, but then that wasn't the primary reason I wanted it.  Also haven't tried to connect it to my laptop to see how syncing and transfering files over to it works.  The web browsering and reading capabilities, in a more portable size, was what I wanted and for those pursposes I am happy with it.We'll see how it goes after a few weeks with it:)", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "She's enjoying it", "Author": "Tarche", "ReviewID": "R28MQG0WB9JW7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from a company called Goodios and it came with a pen and car charger and this company was very accurate whenever i would email them..

Neither of us have used a tablet before so keep that in mind.PROS:It arrived packed securely before the expected arrival date (2 days early)It had about a 50% charge when it came, but I stuck it on the charger and left it there for the remainder fo the day (5 hours), the following day I got it back out and started to set it up.

You have to play with the cord and jam it into the tablet in order to get the darn zeepad to charge.  The charger is not the typical UBS or iPad type, but a thin connector, which is impossible to buy at regular stores.  So when the battery goes dead on a car ride, you are simply out of luck.

It goes back to some factory programmed time zone (maybe China).  The battery doesn't seem to last more than 2-3 hours with constant average use.

I ordered it for my son's 8th birthday and I'm upset that the device did not function properly and now he has to go without his gift until I receive a refund.I gave this 1 star because it arrived on time and that's about all it did right. I received it on Tuesday, as scheduled and I charged it for an hour. I had trouble turning the device on but after holding it down for a minute it came on. I connected my Wi-Fi and went to the Google Play store to set up an account. As I was selecting a password the tablet started malfunctioning and random letters started popping up. I didn't have a change to put a password in because the tablet was randomly inputting letters. After a few minutes I shut it down and tried again. Then I was able to make a password and add some apps I know my son would like. I properly shut the tablet down and my son was anxious to play it on his birthday. But when his big day came the tablet WOULD NOT TURN ON! I tried charging it with the charger and on my laptop but even charging it did not help. I held the on/off button for 3 minutes and still nothing. I am so disappointed with this product and will never purchase from this seller again!! When my refund is honored, I'll just shell out the extra bucks and get my son a Nabi tablet or a Kindle Fire.

When it arrived I rushed to get it set up and download a ton of apps so my son could play with it as soon as he opened it. It was very easy to use although the downloading did take a while. Took approximately 10-15 mins to down load each app and I had purchased about 60 apps (along with some children's kindle books). This was fine since the tablet is priced under $100 (what did I expect, really).My sole issue with this tablet is with the charger. It does not charge well or quickly with the USB cord and the wall charger is difficult to work with. The charger plug does not fit completely into the port so I'm constantly trying to stop myself from shoving it in further. Also, if the plug is not positioned in the port exactly right the unit will not charge. I end up twisting and turning, and wiggling the plug around while constantly checking to see if the tablet is indeed charging. It's a little annoying. If it at least had an LED light that would blink or light up when the unit was charging, I would like it a lot better.Overall, it is a nice tablet especially considering the price. If I could do it over, I would probably purchase the same one again. I may look into purchasing a different charger that might fit the unit better. I did have to purchase a separate MicroSD card since only 40 of the 60 apps I purchased fit onto the tablet. But that was only an extra $20 or so. Well worth it since I am sure I will be purchasing more apps for the tablet in the future.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1MGE2ZCWTOYTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my 8 year old he loves it never had an issue other than not much storage space in it", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Dawn Yates", "ReviewID": "R1PTXS4X6EXMLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is easy to use for me and my son and my son loves having a tablet of his own", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "its great", "Author": "deidre harden", "ReviewID": "R157BREUJA1KX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Zeepad is great.

Thi is specifically about the tablet itself.  In a word... OUCH!I didn't expect much at all for this price.  I have young kids who really wanted a tablet for games etc... I didn't want to get them something that would make me hurt too bad if THEY broke it.As a techie I am aware that my personal standards may be a bit high but I tried to keep my expectations in check for the purposes of  the intended use.  a 5 and 6 year old.I ordered two of these thinking that less than 80.00 a piece for a \"tech toy\" can't be horrible.  Boy was I wrong.  The quality of the propduct build was about what I expected, plastic, and cheap plastic at that.  The screen, while I didn't expect it to be up to par with something like a Nexus 7, I didn't think it would be practically unviewable in portrait mode, and low visibility from certain angles even in landscape mode.I knew it would be slow, I fully expected (thus appreciated) the lag in functions.  The battery life however was a shocker.  One was dead in about 2.5 hours and the other made it about 3 hours.  Not acceptable no matter how inexpensive it was.The other thing that I noticed is that one of the tablets (though they were identical) did NOT have Zeepad branding, it was a generic of a generic, nothing to cry about since as I said before they were identical in every other way.The packaging and contents are also of a generic caliber.  One came with earphones and a cheap sylus, the other came with a cheap stylus/pen and a screen protector.Another thing that really bothered me was the jailbroken state they are in.  Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the company. I can't say that the software was \"stolen\" because Android is largely open source however it did seem to be a bit janky and illegitimate.One tablet was in an Asian language with little hope to change it to english, fortunately I'm used to android and it's icons so I was able to make it through.Overall it just wasn't worth it for me to keep them, Got them on Friday, sent them back today.  Decided to get my babies a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 instead.  They are worth the extra hundred bucks a piece :).If you order this your mileage may vary depending on your expectations of course.

Pay attention to the delivery date.  It still came 10 days earlier than promised.  I only mention this because I didn't pay attention and wondered when it would show up.  Anyway I have an HP iPaq PDA that holds a lot of my day to day info and it is not getting younger. I don't want the data on my smartphone as I don't want it hacked.  I need to replace the PDA before it dies.  Looking at replacement costs was eye opening to say the least, 500 smackers.  Forget about it.  Then I thought, hey get a 7\" tablet, bigger screen and lots of apps.  I didn't want anything too expensive as it would be an offline one or two use device.  I saw that the Zeepad had a lot of good reviews and got one.  I've had it for several weeks and have punched a lot of data into it.  It is slow and punching data in is time consuming as sometimes the character doesn't register.  But for my purposes, I don't care as I will be inputting once and reading hundreds of times.  As I said slow, you click and then wait 3 or 4 secs but I am a very patient person and it doesn't bother me that much, though I gave 4 stars because of it.  The charger's plug to the tablet is longer than the socket on mine so it doesn't fit all the way in but it charges.  Do not force the plug into socket or you may break it.  One review says the prongs to the wall socket broke, I checked to see if mine were loose and I recommend you do the same.  Bottom line, this is an $80 tablet not a $200 tablet and you have to expect it will not work the same.  If you are looking for an all around excellent, fast 7\" tablet get the Kindle Fire, if you need it for a one or two use device I recommend the ZeePad.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!!", "Author": "Ashton Brereton", "ReviewID": "R3DP8OKRDZPNEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a fully functional tablet that would allow me, wirelessly, to access the internet, check and write emails, and access files on computers on my home network - from anywhere in or around my home - at a price below $100. The Zeepad 7.0 cost me $81.95 - delivered,  It does everything I wanted - flawlessly. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have a backward facing camera - so I can't can't scan documents. The front-facing camera works perfectly. So, in sum, I recommend it unreservedly - at the price.UPDATE:I have been using the Zeepad more often now and found that the built-in browser was somewhat slow - taking seconds to access main pages for sites such as CNN, NBC and BBC - and occasionally the browser froze. So, I installed Opera Mini for tablets (free) and found the increase in speed of access to web pages was dramatic. Access is now in less than a second, the formatting of the pages was changed to suit the Zeepad screen, the font size was automatically increased, scrolling is a breeze and all the stories and information are available.

The packaging screams cheap but that's to be expected with an 80.00 tablet.  what was not expected was the inability to play music, it does play... 60 seconds after you click a button in Google Music and once it's started you cannot stop it for another 60 seconds, the point is this is ridiculously slow, even after removing everything installed on it. Displaying album art is non existent as well as even the song names.  if you click out to look at another album, you better go brew a coffee and take a shower, it might be ready when you get back.  This was not a symptom of Google's app either as all the other music players I tried had the same issues.On top of that turning it on and off is a problem, after it goes into sleep you have to hold the button for 30-60 seconds for it to reboot, it will not turn back on after it shuts down the screen like all other tablets do.  I read some of the reviews and unless I got a bum tablet I cannot see how anyone can get this to work properly, there is no way anyone can function by clicking a button and waiting 30 seconds for something to happen.Try it, think \"click\" in your head and then count to 30. that's how long it takes to respond when an app is open.I cannot say how it plays games but if a simple MP3 is any indication this is not worth 8 dollars let alone 80.I would not give this item to my worst enemy... or wait, maybe I would...We should have sent Osama a few of these in 2001, we'd have found him in the same cave still trying to power it on.Update 01/20/2013: after looking at this thing siting in the box waiting for the return I decided to try one thing, I forgot that I did not erase my google credentials so I opened it and did a \"reset\".Oddly enough, now the thing is snappy enough to play the music and show albums and turn on and off properly, not sure what did it and it doesn't change my rating but it now works for my purpose  So if you get a sluggish unit, try resetting it in the settings of the device.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible customer service", "Author": "Corinne", "ReviewID": "R3CSAS1I1L3YEM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this for my son for Christmas. 2 weeks later the screen stopped responding.

That it runs the standard Google Play Store and standard apps is wonderful.  But aside from the software, the hardware is about as minimal as possible to still run Android 4.2.

We also have a Kindle Fire HDX that's about the same size but twice the price, and the Kindle is still the better bang for the buck tablet-wise.  This Zeepad tablet has a terrible viewing angle if you try to use it in portrait mode.  But if you want a pretty cool and inexpensive digital photo frame, this is a good option.

My kids have had these tablets a week one of the chargers is broken (yes already) The tablet freezes if it works at all, the volume is bad I can't even explain to you... Nothing works! So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the \"manual\" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the \"seller\" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these.

I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase that I wanted to submit a review to save others the time, hassle and money. The first problem occurred when I attempted to read the user manual before doing anything with the tablet. It was horrific! The manual was written with english words but the grammatical errors, spelling errors and everything else about it was so poor that I couldn't make sense of it. It was like reading a different language with english words. Once I let it charge for the day I gave it a try, only to be completely disappointed! I realize I didn't purchase an iPad so I was willing to give it a chance. I tried to play a netflix from it only to find that I could hardly make out the image on the  screen. I also had to hold the tablet at one exact angle in order to even see anything. The sound was so poor I couldn't tell anything was even coming out of the speaker until I turned it over and held it right up to my ear. (That was after I had turned up all of the sound). The final complaint and what lead me to my decision to return it, (as if the above is not enough) is that there is such a delay when pressing an icon that I felt like I had to keep pushing it to make sure it was recognizing my touch. Actually, I can't say there is anything good about this tablet. Buyer beware, Do NOT but this! I don't even want to give it one star.

After reading the reviews, I thought they were going to be a great buy but much to my surprise, they didn't last.  After receiving them, I opened them to check them out and everything seemed fine except I kept hearing a slight humming sound while they were powered on.  I was immediately concerned, but it was so close to Christmas that I didn't want to risk sending them back for an exchange and end up not receiving them in time for Christmas.  It didn't take long before I realized that I probably should have.They have all of the features that I was expecting, but within the first 4 hours of my granddaughter opening hers, she dropped it one time.  The screen cracked and it completely stopped responding to touch.  I sent it back for an exchange, but was only able to get a refund.  In less than a week, I had to return my grandson's tablet as well.  After the first couple of days, the screen turned all blue and it stayed like that for at least 2 days.  It eventually came back to life, but that only lasted for another day before it was completely gone.  So after less than 7 days, I arranged to send his back for a refund as well.The reasons I gave it a 3 star rating instead of one star has nothing to do with the product itself, although the colors are rather cute.  But it has more to do with the excellent customer service regarding order processing, shipping/delivery, and returns/refunds.

(Luckily charged through the USB slot).It bricked just past 6 months. (It wasn't rooted, and only had a handful of apps installed.)Slow and would lag on internet.Took time to render pdf pages.Not much information on how to unbrick online.Would I get another one? No. Was I happy with it while it worked? Mostly. I was mainly using it as a reader and even though it would lag rendering pages, it worked for what I needed. It never lagged during any of the simple games (Fruit Ninja/Angry Birds), but would bog down on youtube and other internet things.I'm now looking to replace it with a first generation Nexus tablet, or something similar.

So far this tablet is better than that one, meaning faster and able to handle movies without having to change the file type etc...and if it breaks, its 1/3 of the cost of most other tablets, plus his favorite color is red so that added to the excitement.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Zuhair Baker", "ReviewID": "R2EGMJALBJ5YL1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a tablet that cost about $80 it is great slow but for your kids it is what you should get them they can play watch and it has all Android stuff.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my 4 year old", "Author": "Bryan \"hydrophoid\"", "ReviewID": "RHW0Z43HSZ2Z9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No one is going to love working on this tablet, but at the price point I hope no one is expecting to work on this tablet (you could do some work with it but you would not like it).Overall this is a great tablet for the price. My wife and I debated getting our 4 year old a LeapPad for educational games, but I was able to win out by pointing out the cost of many Android games: free.The screen has a small viewing angle and the resolution isn't the best, my daughter loves playing the ABC and puzzle games we downloaded for her. I have not purchased any software for her, but the free games on Play are awesome. This thing even runs Candy Crush (just in case you were wondering :).I wish this didn't have a proprietary charging end on it (it has a USB port, but that is not for charging) but my other tablets also have proprietary charging ports so it seems to be standard for them to make a different port.The box was full of goodies: charging cable, usb adapter (so you can plug in full sized usb items to the tablet), a stylus, AND a screen protector. They really delivered on the packaging.This tablet is really a bargain for the price, it wont win any processor speed awards and it can hang at times but if you are in the same boat and looking for something to entertain your children during long drives or you want to use some type of electronic game/learning system this is priced to be in your top 5 list of purchase considerations. On the other hand, if you are an adult looking for something to surf the web/look for jobs/ do any type of professional work with, I would suggest a different more powerful (and likely expensive) tablet.Willie-B", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for kids", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "R1HJVM1FB2GU6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is great for my grandson with downs syndrome.

So they have been through more than six months of regular use. For $70 these are pretty good. They are definitely not iPads, Google Nexus, or Samsung Galaxies, but they are a good buy for your average 4 to 8 year olds. At this point, three of the four are still working and two of the four are working well. They work well for playing games, reading ebooks, watching movies, or taking silly (albeit low quality) pictures of oneself. They do all this just as well a Nexus.About two months ago one the tablets stopped charging, the battery still had a small charge (not enough to power up) and the charger was working. Something stopped working in the charging circuits on the motherboard. So that one is no longer usable.All but one of the chargers has stopped working, I think the wire or plug is too weak and broke, they worked if you wiggled the plug. Also the charging receptacle in the tablets is weak, one tablet's does not work anymore. And the USB port of another does not work. This has probably as much to do with the kids jamming and yanking on the cord, as anything.Fortunately, the USB connector does charge the tablet, so even without any of the chargers you can still use the tablets.The third tablet is very slow to react when tapping on the screen. This is most noticeable on the home screen, but also when playing games, though not as bad.Very odd, seems more of a software based problem than hardware.The fourth tablet, so far (knock on wood) is working fine no problems at all. Battery life has never been that great, two hours or so max. It hasn't diminished in six months so they are good quality, just not that big. Keep a smart phone charger on hand and they will last as long as you've got gas in the car.Overall, I am pleased with these tablet. Especially for younger kids, when you don't want to throw a lot of money down the drain (literally!) Trust me, I know, before they got these, my wife's Nexus, ended up in the toilet when two kids tried to grab it at the same time. Fortunately, it still works fine.We know they can take care of them now, so we will upgrade them one at a time, as they stop working. So far only one has had to be replaced.

ANTIVIRUS AS SOON AS U GET TABLETThe tablet comes installed with games and 2 of the games came up as potentially threatening so if u just hand it to your kid and they try to play those games u are at risk I use avg pro its still$15 bucks but I have it installed on 4 devices so worth the money u can get it in the play store this tablet is awesome but an adult should go thru all the settings and run spywear b4 handing it over to kids as I said in my updates whoever rooted the device changed the settings if u run avg it will walk u thru the settings at the end of the scan to protect your deviceI bought this tablet for my 18 month old daughter because she is determined to keep up with her older brothers and loves all the learning apps available for young toddlers I must say this tablet is great for her im going to try to find a kid tuff case of course the tablet is on the cheaper side I only paid 76 bucks im not complaining all the apps work and this tab has options to delete installed apps and options to move apps to sd card I did not have those options on my galaxy so not bad at all shes gonna be so excited to play her word games when she wakes up from naptimeUpdateJust realized this tab comes rooted I know this is a high selling point for some it makes me a little nervous but so far so good I will update again if anything else pops upUpdateSo my daughter loves it the abc phonics games are a must for anyone with young toddlers the zeepad is definatly great so far of course the speakers suck and itscheap plastic its only $76 bucks I recommend going thru the settings whoever rooted it set those kind of weird still tweaking them my daughter doesnt want to let go of the thing its great for kids and budgets I cnt afford an ipad and if I could im not handing It to my child so this is a great way for u to let your youngster play without losing out on $500 or more if they drop itUpdateDay 2 with the zeepad the charger works its battery life definatly isnt great and it depletes even when your not using the tablet but I also believe those small annoyances to be the reason the zeepad is available for such a cheap price its a wonderful beginner tablet for young kids it comes already installed with kids games and is obviously intended for kids but as I said before if your on a budget an adult could find this useful also its not the fastest or the best thats why its so cheap but its still more than enough for my daughter to watch her shows and play her apps I would definatly recommend this tablet to others great purchaseUpdateThe tablet is still working despite the fact my 18 month old has been drooling and pushing on the screen a little harder than I like then again I bought her the zeepad so she wouldnt abuse my galaxy anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain reading the reviews are what helped me make my purchase and they are also how I determine what seller to purchase from that is ehy I keep updating I feel like this tablet is a good deal if u purchase from a reliable seller and supervise your kids charge it for them its not a tank they can still break it make them sit on the couch while they play it instead of running with it this tablet is cheap and has tons of features but its not durable or it would cost more if u want durable spend $100 more bucks and u will get higher quality this is a great beginner tablet its still quite fast for a single core processor and has tons of features runs netflix youtube and my comcast apps all fine on comcast I have to log out then back in somtimes for it to work but for it $76 delivered its not that big of a deal plus u can install apps that require root access my tablet doesnt do that and to buy higher end rooted tablets is at least $100 more on top of what the going price is so im assuming the negative reviews are the people who bought from the seller at the very bottom offering the dual camera on the probably fake zeepadsUpdateIts been a couple weeks now the zeepad is still charging and works great I only charge it about once a week but I also shut it off when my daughter isnt playing it I think this was a great deal my daughter loves it and it plays all her movies and games without any problemsUpdateThe zeepad is still working just got done loading a bunch of free mp3 songs for my daughter off of the free app I got off google play I really dnt understand all the bad ratings for my$76 bucks this is an amazing deal we have 3 samsung galaxy tab2 also and this tablet does just as much a little slower at times and not as good quality but for the price this is a great dealUpdateSkype works and all of the other apps we have loaded on here just got done reading elmo and dora ebooks we downloaded on the kindle app I still cnt figure out why people dnt like this tablet I'm writing my review on it rn the battery isn't that bad and why would u want your child playing 5hrs of games a day anyways either way zeepad still works and we still love it", "Date": "March

address was incorrect. I chatted with Amazon and they sent a request to Draco Tek. I also sent an email to Drack Tek and they responded within 48 hours...I was impress with the seller and Amazon for helping me correct the shipping address. I purchase this item on March 9,2013 I received this item on March 23, 2013 sooner than promised. I brought this product for my grand-daughter she is 4 years old and is very savvy with my iPad 4. I brought this product for the price and for what it can do. I was some what disappointed because when I received this product everything was their except the stylus pen, the box came with 3 different type of chargers. One was USB, AC adapter and one for using a flash drive. The USB and AC Adapter does not work I tried it and the charge stayed at 1%. So I tried a different USB and it started charging so I left it to charge overnight. I tried it the next day and it did not charge more than 2%. The product request that you charge it the first time 6 hours...so I was disappointed that I still could not use this item. So I tried another charger that I had and this charger was charging I started charging at 9:00am and it was fully charged be 2:00pm.  Finally I was able to see what this could do and so far it works okay. I know folks say this was inexpensive...however you should always receive what the seller is selling and the item should do what the product states it should do no exceptions.  I brought this base on what the product offered. Money should not be a factor...just because some items cost more does not make them a better product. I could send this product back after all if the product cannot work because you cannot charge it then it is no good to you...major flaw. I think Drakco Tec Store which is located in China should read their customers reviews. I did read the reviews and had mixed emotions. Being a buyer at Amazon and trusting Amazon I took a chance. I have purchased a lot on Amazon since March 9,2013 and I'm learning a lot about the sellers and shipping. I what have rated this product higher because it does work and it is a good buy...however not being able to charge this item is very huge for me. Please take the time to read all reviews...their was a lot to read. I read all of the reviews after ordering. So I did know there was a possibility that the charger would not work. So I did gather up all of the old chargers I had collected over the years from old cell phones which save the day...so in the end it did work out.

First off the good points i observed is it comes preloaded with a couple of games ie: Angry birds and a couple of kids games which is what this is really geared to . I bought this for my 9 yr old nephew knowing full well it was not going to be a top of the line tablet . It accesses the internet on WiFi only no Ethernet port that i observed . It is relatively fast but again we only talking 512 mb ram so your not talking lightening fast . It has a decent camera with it and also a built in microphone , both as i have said are decent for what your paying . Its only really bad downfall is it's battery life . Even fully charged its battery might last you an hour depending on what your doing with it . It seems to use more power using the internet than the games. Possibly because of it being on wireless .i am assuming you will not be able to use this in a wireless hot spot because you do have to set it up to detect your wireless configurations on your device at home . But if your looking for something for the kids to use and don't want to spend 500 bucks or more on an I Pad  then this might serve the need .

A plus is that it comes with a screen protecting sheet(that you have to apply) but its one less thing you need to worry about buying and if you are looking at this guy, you value saving some $$. The plastic cover is quite solid but the edges do scuff up pretty quick. The battery lasts about 2 hours and that is acceptable for the price. If you are thinking about using this as a PC substitute please keep in mind that after the OS you only have about 1.9Gbs of space left; bought a 32Gb microsd from scandisk and the system recognized it right away; but only as a 29.8Gb device(might be file system configuration, but that's enough space for me. It comes with angry birds and fruit ninja installed and it was a great excuse to have some random children play with it and although they handled it as if it was made of solid titanium; it came out with minor scratches, but non on the screen because of the protector.The major down side for this device is the charger; as noted before it doesn't fit all the way and most of the time you have to \"giggle\" it around so that it will start charing; but the usb cable charges perfectly, just takes longer; I get a full charge from 2% to 100% in about 15 minutes on wall charger and about 23 on usb.I would have given it a 5, had it come with bluetooth or at least gps support.

That was my first mistake not reading thoroughly as I usually do and not buying within the United States. The tablet was slow doing anything,the battery life seemed to be short,there is no reset button to try. The settings menu for example looking up battery use you couldn't tell where you stood it says like 40% and then it would die. But, that wasn't the biggest issue as had it for a month and now it's completely dead. Now, if we go with just a bad tablet it happens and or something about the seller and overseas I can't answer about this tablet as it gets rave reviews which is why I bought it. One big positive I can say is the Amazon A-Z Guarantee. Make sure you have it. I asked them to step in when I was only having trouble before totally dying and I believe in less than 24 hrs. it was resolved and I received a full refund.  Another big positive to have on electronics from Amazon is the Square Trade Warranty. It's worth the extra money. I have had to use it in the past on another item and that is also everything you read on reviews. Easy,fast,amazing. Trying to be fair.

We have a 5 year old boy and a 10 year old girl. Upon reading other reviews that these might be somewhat fragile, we have drilled into the kids that they need to be gentle with them. In general, these work just like a Droid smart phone and last a couple of hours before they need to be recharged. As we don't really want the kids playing games longer than this, we are fine with the batter life. The Google Play Store works just like on a smartphone and we have had no issues with this or using the wifi. I added a couple of leftover mini SD cards I had from old smart phones to increase the storage space for the kids.The only issues we have had with these tablets have all been in with either the original seller (not Goodios) or the quality control of the product. We originally ordered these 15 days before christmas to be from Santa. These never arrived, Amazon refunded our money and that company is no longer in business. Beware of the folks with the cheapest price. We then re-ordered these from Goodios who have been perfect in solving our problems. Our first set of these arrived and one of them was dead on arrival. It was quickly replaced with another that had a bad charger. We had a new charger within a couple of days and then found out the little USB connector was also defective. They sent us one of those and now everything works fine.We got the little USB keyboards that double as covers which work fine with one exception. When the Zeepad is in the case and the case is turned vertically the Zeepad can slip out of the little claws that hold it in. As these cases are all made the same I will put either double sided tape or some velcro on ours to keep this from happening.We really like these tablets and they kids have been using them up everyday when they get home from school for over a month. If Zeepad improved their quality control we would have had no issues with them at all. The 4 stars are because of this.

This is the ONLY way I can charge it, but at least it can be done, and for me is not a problem.  The price is fantastic.  The features are good and it works quite well with the Android 4.0 OS.  Having access to Google Play makes for an endless stream of apps.  The battery holds up very well for maybe 4 hours of hard use, and the standby is very good as well.I asked the merchant for ideas on the AC replacement to no avail.  I didn't even get a response from them.  I'm happy with the unit... just not the merchant's response.  For the money, you will get a very good 7\" tablet.

The manufacturer apparently knew this and included a screen protector.  However, the protector is of very low quality and peels off and/or develops air bubbles after a few days.One of the units had some problems with the internals and if you put your finger on back it in a specific spot it would create a distortion pattern on the screen in the front.One unit was DOA.  The touch screen had a dead spot (which happened to line up with the \"S\" key on the onscreen keyboard making it unusable.  In general, the touch screens are of low quality.  All of them have manufacturing defects like embedded dust particles in the plastic (that become evident after installing the screen protector)  indicating they were produced in a low quality facility.The power button on one of the units has already failed and no longer powers on or off the unit.The screen is a critical feature of a tablet and this one fails miserably on all counts.  It is cheap Chinese crap and should be avoided.I got frustrated and purchased a Nextbook in Walmart for the same price as one of these units and the difference in quality is astounding.

I admit there are a few things the Galaxy has as features this tablet doesnt do, but for the most part it can do all you need (unless you are a high end user).  This tab comes with just under 1gb memory onboard.  I do recommend you buy an 8gb micro SD card (TF card) to go with when ordering as most aps want to install to the card.  Set up was easy and second nature~ no having to flash the bios, or other such nonsense that many other no-name tablets had on their reviews to get Google Play (market).

The thing is the equipment turned out to be defective tablet wont turn, the screen didn't work. So I went yesterday to the Toys R US Where I bought it the one in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, to have it exchanged by another tablet or for a refund. And not only did I wait sooo long in line I was attended by this obnoxious assistant manager , whom which after looking @ the tablet just simply told me she couldn't accept the tablet because the manufacturing company wouldn't accept it. I told her the Tablet had arrived like this yet she didn't do much or anything to help out in this situation. All I can say is that Toys R US.. should emphasize more on customer service which is very low quality, they don't seem to hire a lot of employees although the stores are very big. Sometimes you have to walk around for a while through out the whole store in order to receive some assistance by a employee. As far as this situation I feel totally robbed/Scammed for my money. Employees are supposed to assist customers diligently and efficiently on any situation. But I just sensed they don't really care even though my daughter was next to me while I was trying to exchange the item ( Which obviously made her very sad, she wouldn't stop crying on the way back home.) I simply don't understand why wouldn't Toys R US exchange my item or give me a full refund it seems there always some sort of controversy or excuse to their own benefit  when it comes to exchanges or refunds. Other stores like Game Stop, Electronics Boutique, Wal-Mart,  Amazon won't give those obstacles when it comes to exchanging a item which they also sell a whole lot CHEAPER. Iam beyond indignated because the store manager totally wiped her butt with my receipt ( The purchase had been made less than a month ago) And even though  she did admit the Tablets were in fact coming with defects  she declined to offer any assistance or a exchange, refund, store credit whatsoever. Usually I never really buy often in Toys R Us... because there isn't located where I live & because I don't find the prices of the items cheap or affordable.. compared to Wal-Mart or K-mart or Game Stop , AMAZON . But this incident totally made it for Iam never BUYING ANYTHING ON TOYS R US ... EVER AGAIN.. and will give NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS to relatives and Close ones based on my Personal EXPERIENCE.
