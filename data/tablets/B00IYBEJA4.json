{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phablet, with some reservations.", "Author": "IskovK", "ReviewID": "ROVXI6DI30HK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well built and fast with a superb IPS display, and a quirky android skin that attempts to mimic iPad icon behavior.  Every installed app is on one of the main screens. There no separate repository of all apps and widgets as in standard Android.In the down side, some minor menu settings remain in Chinese even though language is set to English, and unexplained ads or apps pop up from time to time in Chinese!  Just a bit annoying.The standard Google Play store is not accessible, and the provided version is all in Chinese.  While somewhat functional, it's much better to use the Amazon Android store where everything is in English, and most of what you want is available there.Ideal size to carry around with 3G data enabling operation on the go!  Just a bit quirky!", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$225.99", "Features": "3G and GSM Phablet:GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz; WCDMA: 2100MHz\nDual camera.
