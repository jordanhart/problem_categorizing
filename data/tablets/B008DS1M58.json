It wasn't high tech enough for her. The touch screen is more of a slam your finger repeatedly into it screen for anything to work. The apps are cute, but just not interesting enough. She get's bored easily with it. And it eats batteries for breakfast lunch and dinner.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "ALREADY STOPPED WORKING!", "Author": "casey merritt", "ReviewID": "R2VSWH035YIEIX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughter for christmas and kept in in a case at all times and its already stopped working when you turn on the camera all that will come up is a green screen. tried new batteries and resetting it, and nothing!

I ordered it separately but it doesn't charge the Tablet.  So the children have to sit near an outlet to play the games.  It is a waste of time to invest in the regular batteries for this product as it will last a child the time period of  4 to 5 continuous hours until they (the batteries) exhaust.  Therefore I purchased the V-Tech battery pack which consist of 4 double AA batteries along with it's charger. This was the key to a couple happy campers. So to save your self a headache and money for extra batteries, invest in the battery pack charger to include the 4 batteries needed for this device. Now I will work on adding new games for it.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Baby's first IPAD", "Author": "Armando Chavez", "ReviewID": "RMQ5W0AB2BM2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Keeps my 2yr old busy for hours without sacraficing our iphones to keep him entertained.

We opted for the 2s becuase of the changeable memory available. We go through a lot of batteries, they last on average 3 days. We like that it is big enough to be comfortable but not to big to be bulky. It is durable as it has been droped a few times with no issues.
