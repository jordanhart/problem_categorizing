Not just one thing wrong with it but MANY!! At this time of year, when many products ordered are for Christmas gifts, this is inconvenient and highly UNACCEPTABLE!!! I've ordered the same tablet from this seller previously and was very pleased about the service and the tablet, it was better than I expected. And so I wanted to purchase another as a Christmas gift for my nephew. Needless to say, the second order from AFUNTA was a MISTAKE! This tablet was TERRIBLE!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND AFUNTA ANY LONGER. This first time I ordered, AFUNTA was given 5 stars and a great review. This time I have no choice but to give 1 star, there's no option for no stars. Also, the seller gives his email to contact him for questions or defaults but then has said email sending automated replies that \"customer service is unavailable at this time.\" UGH", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "poor", "Author": "Darrell R.", "ReviewID": "RGBLFB70MC6H9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "did not work. when its plugged it works and says charge 100%, but does not work on battery. bad product", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "cheap", "Author": "sho2kan1", "ReviewID": "R2RX1SWRGCR3N8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cheap looki g, my 8 yr old dropped it and the screen shattered instantly, you get what you pay for, my samsung galaxy is awesome", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I HATE THIS PRODUCT", "Author": "hazel osmond \"osmond\"", "ReviewID": "R1OTCEKO1FKIJB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this product is s***, I was very disappointed with i brought it for son as a xmas gift and never and not working not coming on all it is saying  battery need charge I regret buying that s***-+", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "good product for a good price", "Author": "Christy Roy", "ReviewID": "R3O2O8L07VTAVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet was for my 9 yr old son, decent price and the quality of the image is not bad.
