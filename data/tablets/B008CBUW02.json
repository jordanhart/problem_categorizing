The first one I had ordered for my birthday but it wasn't working out so I returned it. I then chose this one thinking it would be great. Four processors, plenty of space for apps, music, games, ect... However with all the research and calls I've made to Asus proved a waste. My issue was the touch screen would stop working. It wouldn't accept any touching and the whole issue was completely random. I performed several restarts, cold boots, and factory resets, however, none of them fixed the issue. The closest I got to fixing it was delaying the issue from coming back. Unfortunately the issue continued to get worse until it reached the point where the touch screen no longer works at all.PROS:-Extremely fast for playing games, music, surfing the internet-Excellent multitasking capabilities for downloading multiple apps, playing music, and playing games simultaneously-Crisp and clear pictureCONS:-Touch screen stopped working", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS TF300 B1-WH 10.1-Inch 32GB Tablet", "Author": "Isaiah", "ReviewID": "RBMKZCSC5CCHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent tablet.

The Transformer has a reasonable amount of processor power combined with an outstanding battery life and aesthetics.

I prefer to be able to use a more stationary computer as a primary computer, because of the (potentially) increased processor speed as well as significantly more hard drive space, a larger screen, etc. Many of the issues that I have had with the Transformer have been minor (in my opinion), while others may be more concerned with some of the issues listed above.This product could function as a primary computer for persons who:Use computers very lightlyNeed only access to word processing, internet use, social networking, etcAre intolerant of OSX, Windows, and UbuntuAs a sidenote, I would recommend the ASUS transformer (or TF Prime) over an iPad, or even other Android OS tablets available at the time of authoring because it is notably more powerful and in my opinion, more functional, as well as more reasonably priced.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "George Gutin", "ReviewID": "R202P4J3RM4V03", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The power cord plugin is at the bottom and it's not convenient when working.

This is a pretty good tablet, but the quality control issues of the screen pixels had issues for me.  I did check out the competing android tablets from other manufacturers, but this one had all the things I wanted and at a good price point. On my first tablet from amazon, the tablet had a small cluster of issues of dead/stuck pixels.  This can't be seen with certain background colors when on the net, viewing pics, or even watching a movie.  I returned the first tablet and received a replacement from amazon.  The second tablet had one stuck pixel on the center of the screen that can easily be seen with certain colors:  white, green, blue, and red.  In less than two weeks, another stuck pixel occurred on the bottom right.  (When holding the tablet in its longest vertical position)  This pixel would be easily seen with the display colors of red, black, white, and blue.  I have read issues on the transformer forums on some tablets with pixel issues, dust issues between the glass and touch panel.  (I didn't have the dust issues, just the pixel issues)  On the forum many have posted that they have had some stuck pixel issues and didn't bother them too much.  However, if I am forking out a good chunk of my hard earned money for an item, I expect it to not have any manufacturing/ quality control issues.  Also in the forums, there were mentions of the quality control issues being hit or miss.  I am returning the 2nd replacement and am stepping up to to the TF700T Asus Transformer Infinity tablet.  More than I would like to spend, but this is supposedly there flagship tablet and hope that there aren't any issues that were plagued with the TF300T.  Aside from these screen/pixel issues, the tablet functionality, design, interface was just what I wanted out of an Android tablet.  Btw.....the two TF300T experiences, they were both the white, 32gb versions.  One thing to note, I mainly used the tablet as a internet, netflix, photo/video playback and comics reading device.  I didn't maximize the brightness at any time.  The brightness setting was in the middle.  Also, FYI, there are videos on youtube that will display a full screen of a single color and then cycle to various colors if anyone ever wants to check to see if there pixels are displaying colors properly.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet.

Overall, I like and and could recommend it.  It has some flaws, but what computing device doesn't.I purchased a Kindle Fire about six months before this, hoping that I could find a cheaper way to enter the tablet rage.  I like the Fire, too, but found that the screen is too small for my aging eyes for the fairly extensive amount of reading I do online through blogs, websites, news pages, etc.  So I use the Fire more as an ereader now, with the flexibility to get online with it periodically, too.I shopped for some time and landed on the Asus.  The screen is bright and clear. The touch screen is generally responsive, though in some apps less so.  I also bought a stylus to help with those tiny hyperlinks on some pages, because I found that it was occasionally difficult to land where I wanted to.I was hoping to use it mostly for pleasure, but occasionally for business, and that's where it's been mildly disappointing.  I was hoping to connect it to a projector to show powerpoint files I've created on my laptop, and I searched far and wide for apps that would enable me to do that.  Finally found Teamviewer, and it does what I want, and the miniHDMI to VGA connector displays the screen, but despite playing with settings on both the Asus and the projector, it still squeezes the screen to make the display on the projector unacceptable.I use it often for reading online the various blogs and news sites I frequent, and have used some apps (such as USA Today)that make that easier still.It's never frozen up on me (as has almost every PC I've ever owned - even the ones I really liked), there's plenty of memory for some music, photos and videos to be stored.  I will say that I'm a little disappointed in the ability to playback certain types of video files - perhaps that's more a function of the software than the Asus.All in all, a user-friendly, enjoyable tool for getting online, doing a little business (though it will never replace my laptop), and I continue to discover new ways to use it even several months after purchasing it.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "Nehal", "ReviewID": "R1XW6VHJX0FU37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because well I wanted one.

This is the first tablet I have purchased so am not sure if it is standard or not, but this tablet does not have a USB port. You have to purchase the docking station in order to connect anything to this tablet through USB. That is kind of a drag because a USB port is a highly used type of connection that I will need to use a whole lot more than an hdmi port(connection that is included with the tablet).

This, however, is the first product from Asus I cannot fully endorse.  I ordered two of these at the recent sale price.  If I had paid full price, at least one of them would be going back.The good: Despite what many others have complained about, the screen is actually very responsive.  The transitions are nice and smooth.  The brightness, contrast l, etc., are all more than adequate, even with bright surroundings.  Yes, its true that its not good enough to view if the Sun is right on it.  Seriously, who does that, anyway?  The hardware specs, memory, processor, etc., are best in class.  This will not compete with a premium i7 core tab, but thats a whole other class at a much, much higher price point.  Hdmi out plus keyboard option with USB means this thing could replace an old, slow laptop, or at least provide you the flexibility of and with extended run times that would blow any Netbook away.  As for those of you who say there are wifi issues on this tab, you might want to check your router and/or ISP.  The wifi on this thing is better than on my Asus G75VW and HTC Evo 4g LTE.The bad: One unit has two stuck on pixels.  Not a deal breaker because pixels are so darn tiny nowadays, but still.  No excuse for stuck on pixels.  Other than the poor quality control on the part of inspector number twelve that missed two stuck on pixels, the tabs are actually well put together.  My real gripe is software/firmware related.  First of all, Asus really dropped the ball with the included software and related widgets.  Their widgets are just plain old bad.  There is also no Asus music player.  I have owned many Android devices.  The \"house\" brand music player is always the best.  Asus didnt even try.  You get stuck with that terrible Play Music app.  And, there is not a single good player in the store, you are SOL for music on this.  Major bummer.  I wish I could copy over my HTC music player and widgets to this tab.  HTC knows how to do it right.  Finally, there is a major (at least in my opinion) bug with the firmware that causes files to lose tag information and/or extention during PC to tab transfer.  Completely inexcusable.  1/3 of the songs lose some tag data during transfer.  Basically, the whole audio/video experience for me on this tab is a washout.Final thoughts:  If you can get this on a good sale, its worth it.

But since I use my phone bluetoothed in my car for traveling music and a media server for house music, I can get by with the tablet the way it is.

The kocasco tablet browsed the internet terribly slow, and after about two weeks of use, exploded in my girlfriend lap, it literally popped and started smoking. After that purchase i decide to make a more informed purchase. I researched the all the tablets and ipads and decided on getting the asus tf 300. This tablet is everything i wanted in a tablet and more. The touchscreen responds smoothly, it browses the internet quickly, and the clean crisp screen with wide veiwing angles make this tablet a pleasure to use. The downside are typing lengthy documents is a bit of chore (I'm typing this review on the asus). The keyboard available for this tablet is over priced.

The machine is for my 15 year old as her school now requires her to have a machine that can access the Internet and be used for e-books. The plan was to buy her a good tablet that could last for her 3 years in HS. Bought the tablet in August. It is a nice looking machine and I thought the screen resolution was very good. My daughter has enjoyed it very much. Unfortunately, about a month after we purchased the machine, my daughter brought it home from school and tried to power it up. The machine would not power up. It worked that day in school and she's not aware of anything that could have happened to the machine between leaving school and coming home that night to power it up. There does not appear to be any physical damage to the machine.So, at this point, I've put in a request to ASUS warranty repair. I am waiting for them to reply with a warranty repair number (RFA, I think they call it) and an address to whether we can send the machine to be examined.

The Asus unlock util for tf300t will only unlock the Icecream Sandwich. The Asus technical supports were not helpful at all.

Not a big deal because there's plenty of space on the tablet internal storage so it's a minor con in my opinion.Last week I got an Over-The-Air upgrade to Jelly Bean (Android ICS 4.1) from Asus.

Its a good tablet with good performance and it can even take 2-3 hours of being constantly played on by my nephews and niece.Why 4 out of 5 stars - because it could be a little bit quicker I think and because I got it with some apps which I have no idea why they are there.
