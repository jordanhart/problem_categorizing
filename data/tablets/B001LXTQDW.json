They are not for the serious gamer that needs a lot of intensive memory or extreme video. But as a good all around notebook with some pretty nifty features...It's da' Bomb! Touchscreens have been around since the early 90's, so the technology is not new, but it has come a long way since then.The fan is typical and not overly noisy. The AMD chips tend to run a little warmer than the Intel chips, but not uncomfortably so. Want a hot running computer...try an Alienware Area 51 notebook....THAT'S HOT!Folks have given Vista a hard time about not being very good...well it's the best Windows out there! Stop downloading viruses, installing third-party freeware, etc. A general rule of thumb that I use is that if I want software that works well with microsoft...then get microsoft software! I do not use Norton, McAfee or any of that other junk. I use MS One Care and it has worked for me...no viruses, no phishing, no adware.The Tablet PC feature of this notebook is pretty cool. I can use it to edit pictures, make drawings, and take notes. The pen/digitizer is pretty good and the overall cost of the notebook itself is not to hard on the wallet.The screen size is 12.1\"...take note of that all of you readers that are looking for LARGE SCREEN DISPLAYS. This is a small notebook. If you need a large screen look elsewhere. If the specs say 12.1\" screem and you purchase this notebook, don't complain about the screen being small. Take out the stander ruler, hold it diagonally, and imagine that area filled with a picture. That's how small it is. Not too hard to figure out.Touchscreens have been around since the early 90's, so the technology is not \"new\" but it has been taken to a new level.  Much like the iPhone and iPod Touch, you can do the same type of things with this Touchsmart notebook.All in all, this is a great notebook for school or small projects. Perfect for a student or someone on the go.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Be sure to purchase the extended warranty", "Author": "WingRider", "ReviewID": "RYMD54DMXQSG6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In April of 2008 I purchased the predecessor to the TX2 ( the TX2000). A couple of months after the warranty expired, I began to have spontaneous reboots and video problems and finally it became unusable.I contacted the HP support desk, via their online chat, and after all trouble shooting was completed, I was informed that the machine would need to be sent in for repair, to the tune of $400. I now have an $1100 dollar brick on my desk.A bit of research found that there are thousands of people in the same boat, with HP laptops that have failed in the same manner. The problem is with the Nvidia graphic processing unit (GPU). It runs so hot that the solder connections between it and the main board fail. My GPU would run over 212 degrees F and the exhaust from the cooling fans was 157 degrees F.Although Nvidia notified HP of the failing GPUs sometime in the later part of 2007 or the early part of 2008, HP continued to sell the defective laptops. Their solution was to issue a BIOS update that ran the cooling fans all of the time, which served to increase the life of the GPU, until the computer was out of warranty.You may be thinking the $400 dollar repair is a fair price to fix the laptop, so what is this guy whining about? Well, they are doing the repairs with the exact same parts that failed in the first place, so the problem is occurring again, just a few months after the repair.In short, be sure to factor the cost of the longest extended warranty into the cost of the computer, because after the 1 year warranty expires you are on your own. HP is not going to stand behind their product, even if they know they are selling defective units.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "L. Wright", "ReviewID": "R3E9NBL5SM8AUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for about a month now and it is great. It so great not having to use yout mouse for everything and it's fun being able to interact with the computer. People say there are all kinds of problems with this computer, but I have yet to find one. I can burn disks, watch videos, and write notes. There's even a special kind of word program and notepad that is on here. I would suggest this computer for people who can't type or have issues with their wrists. And it's also nice for college students so they can write and then automatically convert their notes to typed. IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS BUSINESS PERSON OR WANT THIS FOR GAMING, DO NOT GET IT!!! If any problems occur with this laptop I will write another review, but I doubt anything will happen.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "If I could, I'd give it -5 stars. Defective unit, and HP knows it!", "Author": "M. Coleman", "ReviewID": "R188MPHDL8K0UG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In the beginning, I was so excited about this computer! I bought it in late 2009 straight from HP and was overly excited about the, seemingly, infinite things I could do with this computer. I was excited about the technology--even before the the Windows 7 upgrade, it was cool. From the start, I had minor problems--the computer would shut off on it's own in a very odd way. Battery wouldn't be dead or anything, but it was frequent. The computer's fan was always on and LOUD. I always took care to ensure that it wasn't in a position to run hot, but the fan just kept on running. I called in to HP, they sent me through the Bios screen to, as I understand it, keep the fan running so that computer wouldn't overheat. Didn't help much at all. Then, not even a year after having the computer, a pink line appeared in the middle of my screen. I called to ask HP about it, they said there was nothing they could do about it--it was a problem with the screen. OK, big deal to me(because I, like everyone else here paid a whole hell of a lot of money for this machine--much more than the $525 it's currently selling for), but I let it slide. The battery needed to be replaced so quickly--I didn't even have the cheapest battery--it only lasted a little over a year. It showed signs of decline before that (a computer I used for school purposes and kept on power saving settings MOST of the time). I bought a new battery (I won't even get into the trouble I had with HP's customer service regarding that--that's a whole other issue), then a few months later, I'm experiencing my computer shutting off and making this odd sound (kind of like how cartoons sound when they run/zoom away--think road runner) while I would be in the middle of something. That went on for months before I was completely locked out of my computer. I only had the option to remove my files onto an external hard drive (which I also bought from HP--Simple Save), then restore the computer to factory settings (which took away the Window 7 upgrade).Well, I had it up and running for a little bit, just to have it go out one day after I closed it (put it to sleep) to run out somewhere for a moment. Suddenly, I remembered I had to do something else. I opened the computer to see flashing lights (I think the CAPS and maybe two other lights). I tried pressing buttons--no response. I tried turning it off (it went off), then turned it back on--same thing, just flashing lights. So finally, I decided to do an internet search by entering my computer's symptoms, only to come across a huge number of reviews/complaints of people with the EXACT SAME ISSUE. Not only that, they had done things the exact same way (computer went to sleep and they couldn't wake it back up). I read review after review--complaint after complaint. The most disappointing thing was that everyone had the same issue--HP didn't care. They would not fix it or even acknowledge it as an issue with these computers. Most people were like me and out of warranty.Well, HP wasn't going to help, so I went to good old, trusty Youtube to find a solution. Amazingly, there were several videos of people either replacing motherboards in the computer, or taking the computer a part and adding silver compound and a penny to rectify the problems, sometimes. Unfortunately, after CAREFULLY/METICULOUSLY taking my computer apart and trying the fix, my computer was not fixed. Although I was able to move the majority of my files on to my external hard drive, previously--I had since bought some songs on itunes in between updating my back up and when it died on me. I guess the only way I'll see those files again is if I purchase an enclosure for my internal hard drive or something else to get my files off. How disappointing is that?! The computer that keeps on costing! As someone who believed in HP products and had an HP desktop in high school and a lap top in college that lasted me quite a while, I am very disappointed in my experience with this computer and with HP's customer service when it came to resolving this issue. I'm also disappointed that HP sees this computer is defective, yet they've made ZERO strides to resolve this issue. Needless to say--after years of me and my family purchasing HP and Compaq products, we'll never lay a hand on another. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER! It'll be the worst mistake you've ever made!

Reviews have said before and I'll second it - I've suspected for a while that these laptops run way hotter than should be allowed.- Horrible repair service - I bought the three year warranty and it's spent almost an entire year in the shop - over 4 repair trips. Sometimes the repair place would check off that they replaced something they didn't touch - which I found out after marking some parts with permanent marker. The marks were still there when returned. Also you can almost never talk to someone who is not from India, which is normally not a problem, except when they can't even understand what you're saying the problem is.- Blue screens. About 3 months in they started, eventually getting so frequent the computer was unusable. HP has replaced (supposedly) everything in it, from the motherboard to hard drive to memory. Still blue screens.Overall, I would NEVER buy this computer again.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "At least it wouldnt hurt to lie less", "Author": "Vanuza", "ReviewID": "R3F4E36Z6DYYJO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dont trust this seller!
