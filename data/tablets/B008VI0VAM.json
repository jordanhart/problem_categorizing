{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cool gift for the kiddos", "Author": "RagingMom", "ReviewID": "R22WY3CQX4DPDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this in the mail a couple of days ago and wanted to try it out before I put it under the tree for my son.First, the packaging was awesome and the experience of opening it will be great on Christmas morning.Second, the start up was easy. I wanted to make sure it was totally set up for my son because he's going to be anxious to get going on the games. It was only a few steps and I set it up with a Google account.Third, I'm really impressed with the spending card. My son is 9 and while he's been good about asking before using my credit card for games on my iPhone, I like that he'll have his own card that I can pre-load and have him learn how to think before buying his games. I have a feeling he'll be choosier about now that he's spending his own money :)The only downside is that since this is run on wifi, some games won't work unless without a connection. Other than that, the MG feels sturdy without being hulking or heavy. The screen says it is made of gorilla glass so I'm hoping it withstands the abuse my son will give it. It feels stronger than my iPhone though and he's put that thing through tough times!", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008VI0VAM"}}
