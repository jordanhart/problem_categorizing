{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Usable With Home Owner Flaws", "Author": "George Allen Papapetrou \"Allen\"", "ReviewID": "R39O5H7I27H78P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Edit 20110314: I no longer recommend this to anyone. This product is Version 1 running Android 1.5. The new 7HT is Version 2 running Android 2.1.[...]The 7HT is the fourth Archos product I've owned. Aside from the Gen 1 Jukebox, 5IMT amd 5IT, I purchased three 7HTs.  Two as gifts for friends. Both my friends are technical types, not your average Home Owner to whom Archos markets the 7HT.Personally, I am very pleased with the 7HT.  It does everything I wanted it to do.  However, I'm a retired techie and I found workarounds for flaws which would hamper the average Home Owner.  I'm also a moderator on the ArchoFans Support Forum and focus on the 7HT forum.Flaw 1:As delivered the Archos 7HT cannot create new folders.  This flaw prevents using the 7HT as a Digital Photo Frame with the supplied App - Photo Frame.  Photo Frame treats folders as \"albums\" for displaying slideshows.--Workaround: Install an App like ES File Explorer which can create new folders.--Conclusion: Works fine for me now.Flaw 2:Archos provides the Aldiko eReader.  I downloaded two books before I installed an 8G microSDHC card.  After I installed the 8G card Aldiko \"lost\" the books I downloaded previously.--Workaround: Don't use Aldiko before you install a microSDHC card.--Conclusion: Works fine now and I have over 100 epub formatted eBooks in Aldiko now.Flaw 3:The Archos 7HT has an Unexpected Wake from Suspend every two hours.  I had a drop from 81% battery charge to 18% after 4 hours and 36 minutes when I had the Screen Timeout set to Never.--Workaround: Installed FastBright app to switch to a minimum 5% screen brightness and set the Screen Timeout to 1 minute.  With these settings I've experienced only a 3% to 5% battery decrease.--Conclusion: Works ok now. Only a firmware update will eliminate the Unexpected Wake from Suspend.Iffy:Out of the box Video playback did not work for all the videos I tried which did play on my PC under VLC and on my Archos 5IT. Some folks at the ArchoFans forum have no problems and others have plenty of video problems.--Workaround: Convert videos via a PC program. I've found one group of settings which work and am still searching for more.--Conclusion: Works ok for me since I'm more interested in eReading and less in video playback.Note 1:The 7HT does not support video out despite what you may read at Amazon or elsewhere.Note 2:A USB adapter, micro A male to A Female, is required to use the 7HT as a USB Host for thumb drives, USB keyboards, mice, and powered USB hubs.  These adapters are difficult to find as not even Amazon has any.  The USB receptacle on the 7HT is micro AB and the supplied USB cable is micro B for USB client mode.Note 3:Out of the box the 7HT has no support for WiFi file copies.  An App like ES File Explorer provides this.Note 4:I doubt if Archos will provide additional firmware updates to correct the \"flaws\" I mentioned above. They outsourced the Android development and are working on the new Gen 8 software.Note 5: (Update 20100923)In mid-September Archos did update the firmware. While I've seen no corrections for the \"flaws\" AF forum members and I have found the touchscreen to be more responsive and satisfying.Conclusion:If you're an average Home Owner and want the 7HT to \"work\" out of the box, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.  If you have a gadget or Android or techie background the 7HT should work for you and at $200 is a great value.  I recommend you join a forum like ArchoFans to get the most from your 7HT. For example, recently one of our ArchosFans members got the Google Android Market working on the 7HT.Allen", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "For my usage, better than the iPad", "Author": "Kamal Patel", "ReviewID": "R3FLOMZQ2SRH9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As others have said, it's a good value for $200.  But I take that a little bit further and say that I'd rather have this gadget than the $500 iPad.  Why?  Here's why.-It is smaller and almost half the weight.  This makes it comfortable to hold and view with one hand, which is difficult with the iPad.  I plan to hold on to it and watch videos while stationary biking at the gym, which would be difficult with a bigger tablet.-The screen is matte.  It has much less glare than the iPad.-I use it mainly to watch videos.  In this capacity, it excels, supporting more video formats than the iPad, and coming in a widescreen format instead of 4x3.-It does most things as well or nearly as well as the iPad.  Aldiko is a great ebook reader, you can download Swype to make typing super fast, videos and music play great, etc.-It plays youtube and flash videos if you use the Skyfire browser.Of course, there are drawbacks.  I wouldn't give it a low rating though because it's missing features that only come with $500 tablets.-The screen is resistive, and occasionally doesn't register your tap.  This improves with time, if you turn on the click-on-tap sound setting.-The Android marketplace doesn't work from the device.  To get apps beyond the basic ones, you must either install another marketplace (like Slideme) or search around the web.-The chip is supposedly slower to lower the pricepoint.  I haven't noticed this much.So for a student, or younger working type without much cash, this is an insane buy.  Tons of tablets will be coming out this year, but this one works perfectly fine and may still be cheaper than anything else coming out for a long time.  7 inches is a perfect size right in between small phones and big iPads, and I've enjoyed using it in various situations during the week I've owned one.Enjoy!", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "An amazing value", "Author": "Diknak", "ReviewID": "R1UGJQ6UC456AK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got mine last night and I am very happy with it.  I gave it five stars, not because it does everything under the sun, but because it is a great value for $200.  Some things I write below compare it to expectations from smartphones and tablet standards, but they should be taken with a grain of salt because of the low price tag.Likes: I love the form factor.  Archos has provided a proof of concept and I can't wait for the 7\" Android tablets to flood the market later this year and next year.  It is very light weight and awesome for laying in bed or on the couch while surfing, reading etc.  The form factor is just so much more enjoyable than a 10\" iPad.  The video quality is just stunning and will make an excellent travel companion just for this feature alone.  Typing on the device (with Swype) makes this a great tablet for writing short emails and getting on facebook.  The attached kickstand is very convenient and I'm sure it will get tons of use.  I just hope that it won't break since it is plastic.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the system very snappy and responsive since I was expecting a little bit of lag time due to the specs.  I would have liked to see more processing speed and more memory, but who wouldn't?Dislikes: Of course the resistive touch screen is the top of the list.  I would have liked to see capacitive, but market limitations just didn't make that possible.  I'm sure there will be a lot of 7\" tablets with capacitive screens released later this year.  I would have liked an accelerometer, but I haven't missed it yet.  I'm sure that I will run across an app that will make me miss it, but nothing so far.  I don't have to worry about the orientation changing unexpectedly when laying down, so that is a plus.  The 1.5 version of Android was a terrible mistake by Archos and, in my opinion, inexcusable.  1.6 should be a bare minimum at this point and I am going to run into a lot of apps that won't work.  I would have also liked the ability to charge the device over USB (you have to use an outlet).Other Thoughts:  If you are in the market for a great 7\" entry level tablet, this is a great buy and you won't be disappointed.  If you must have top of the line and can't see yourself happy downgrading services from your Android phone, then you might want to hold off until later this year.  I am part of the [...] community and that is making this device much more enjoyable because we have a wiki of confirmed supported apps along with other information.  Some people have reported defective devices, but it seems like a small portion of the population, so that is nothing out of the ordinary.  Archos has already released one firmware update, and I hope more come in the future.  With the limited memory and processing speed, a task manager is an absolute MUST have.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "The 7-inch LCD simply ROCKS!", "Author": "Jung Il Lee \"ProGolferDigest.com\"", "ReviewID": "R2W8Q83EGSEU13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first, I got this device and felt like returning it.  But after using it for like 2 days, I have found that you can view YouTube, other video sites (even porn, just goto the mobile versions) by installing the SkyFire browser.Also, I own a Nexus One, which runs Android 2.2.  The Archos 7 streams videos flawlessly than my Nexus One, I believe that's due to its added GPU processor.Other than that, this device is great because you can simply load avi, mov, even DivX files and you can play it back in crisp 720P HD.The resistive touchscreen was sorta cheapish at first but for the price you pay, I rather have the cheaper resistive than capacitative since you can browse websites without any pinch-and-zoom due to its large 7-inch LCD.Anyways, I hated it first when I just got the device but after using it couple days, I am lovin' it as it's replacing my internet browsing on my smartphone.Also, internet radio is great too since I can literally put the device anywhere in my kitchen, all while browsing the web too.  Multi-tasking is pretty good, although not super fast.Seriously though, this is the best Android Tablet you can get right now for the money.  I know there's a bunch of larger 10-inch android tablets coming out later this year but the price isn't going to match up with Archos 7.Even my kids love it since I can put some Spongebob videos and they can watch it without asking me to boot up my secondary laptop, then play it.One thing I really love about the device is its fast boot-up time and sleep mode.  There's virtually none so it's really great portable media player.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "eBook reader PLUS more", "Author": "S.

Having not owned an e-ink e-reader, I cannot make direct comparisons.  But on its own merit, the archos 7ht is a very functional e-reader.  I easily loaded my wife's ePub books and I can control things like font, font size, portrait or landscape view, multiple bookmarking, and the best thing for me is reversing the colors so that the text is white on a black page.  This makes reading in the dark very easy on the eyes, and probably extends battery life as well.  It also allows changing the brightness, which is helpful in various lighting conditions.In addition, I get a versatile movie and music player and a decent web browser!Pros:great form facturegreat battery lifegood screengood e-readerdecent web-browserversatile movie and music playerdroid marketplace is a bonus, as this isn't something my wife would even look atCons:touch screen inaccurate/insensitiveglitchy firmwareold techalthough it advertises playing movies at 720p, it cannot play a high bitrate movie smoothly.This is not a hassle-free product, but I wasn't expecting it to do everything really well.

Since having it for almost one week, I have tested just about every feature it comes with.  Like most reviewers, the touch screen is a little picky, but I like that feature as compared to my HTC phone which is hypersensitive and I make many mistakes.  The WiFi feature is really above my expectations and connects to my internet immediately.  I have done a lot of surfing with it and it never fails to impress me.  What I really like is the quality of the videos...simply outstanding. The music system is also very good and I like not having to deal with iTunes (all systems should be drag and drop).  What was most impressive was the bookreader.  It comes with a couple of books for you to load and the quality is really good.  I have loaded a couple of apps games for my grandson and the unit really delivers.  I don't want to forget the photo feature and the slide shows you can do with it. What Archos has delivered is really outstanding, especially considering the price.  If I want an iPad that connects to the internet, try $650 or more and the cost of a data package.  Archos really hit a home run with this one, especially going with the android OS.I recently had a company, named Boxwave, manufacture a screen protector for my Archos 7 Home Tablet.  I had tried several screen protectors, but the best one out there is made by Boxwave.  Unfortunately, they told me they did not have one for the Archos. However, they said if I would take the measurements and send to them, they would manufacture one for me. I have used their screen protectors on my phone and they are outstanding.  Also, I did not like the reflection of the Archos screen or the other screen protectors.  Boxwave manufactured one out of anti-reflective material.  I just received it last week and put it on.  What a difference it makes and the touch screen appears to be more sensitive than without it.  That makes a big difference to me.  I highly recommend Boxwave for the screen protector.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Archos 7 Home Tablet is a Good Value for the Price", "Author": "Gadget Guy 88", "ReviewID": "RESYEZOZ0ULJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Archos 7 Home Tablet is a decent surfing device if you're looking for something with a larger screen but don't want to spend a lot of money.  I have an iPod Touch and was looking for something larger for surfing.  This device is by no means an iPad and I knew that going in.  You are able to multi task such as streaming Pandora or iHeartRadio while surfing the web.  I use the Touch for some games (which I haven't played on this) and apps, but found myself more often than not wanting a gadget for surfing the internet that had a larger screen.  This device is also an excellent e-book reader and has an app where you can download a TON of free books!You can play Youtube videos if you install Skyfire.  The video quality is excellent and speakers sound good.  The app library is not the full Android Marketplace and it would be nice if it were able to access it.  You can find apps around if you're patient and don't mind messing around a bit.  I upgraded the firmware to a newer version first thing (it will erase any apps you had that didn't come with it so do it if necessary right away before downloading too many apps.)I wanted to experience Android and for once get in as an early adopter of a tablet rather than waiting.  The resistive touch screen interface can be tricky but you get used to it and can swipe, just not flick like the i devices can do.  If you buy it (and for the price if that's what you're willing to spend I say do it) just give yourself a few days with it before deciding if it's for you or not.  Engadget said you get what you pay for and I tend to agree with that statement.  I was willing to spend what this gadget cost and I'm good with it feeling comfortable that I have a nice surfing and media device with a larger screen.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value for the Money", "Author": "R.L.", "ReviewID": "RFY9HWD2YMLG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering that the Archos 7 costs less than half of what an iPad costs, this tablet is a great value.  It surfs the web, grabs your email, has apps and can do Flash.  The built-in Wi-Fi is easy to configure and can pick up signal easily.  The screen is bright...very bright...enough for outdoor use with ease.The only drawback would be its touchscreen.  It is older technology and not as sensitive as the iPad, but again - less than half the cost of an iPad.Watch out Apple!UPDATE 06.25.2010I finally had a chance to install the Skyfire browser.  It immediately doubled this tablet's value.  I now can view Flash videos, including Youtube and news site videos - i.e. CNN.The Skyfire browser was a little hard to find especially since the Archos does not have access to Android Market.  I had to search and download the .apk file from my desktop computer, copy it to a mini-SD card, and run the install on the Archos.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything you could want for $199", "Author": "Mcdonald Mirabile \"macmirabile\"", "ReviewID": "R2HHXZNAGDGMR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I have used Archos products for the last 8 years, I used some of their first hard drive based MP3 players and later the PMA-400, which in 2006 had wifi, audio, video, etc.  I've never been very impressed with their operating systems on their media players, so I was excited when I saw they decided to go with Android 1.5.Android 1.5 seems to work very well on this system, at least relative to their prior OS.  It's not as fast or as smooth or perhaps as stable as an iPad's OS, but in my opinion it's a small sacrifice to save $300+ (to upgrade to an iPad).  One of the best features of this device is its use as a book reader.  Literally within 15 minutes, I had downloaded an .EPUB file from Barnes and Noble's website to my desktop and then copied to the Archos mounted on my PC.  The preinstalled book application, Alkido, was able to easily import the file and within minutes I was reading.  HOWEVER, the only .EPUB files you can view through any Android based ebook readers are ones without DRM (digital rights management).  The samples from B&N; do not include DRM.  The actual books when purchased, however, do.  This means you CANNOT USE THIS TABLET CURRENTLY TO READ ANY .EPUB BOOKS DOWNLOADED FROM SITES LIKE BARNES AND NOBLES.  There are thousands on non-DRM books available for free which are easily accessed within the Alkido application, however, and this is enough for me.The screen size on the Archos is just about perfect.  The iPad is too big, the iPod/iPhone too small, this is just right for videos, web surfing, and certain book reading.  Speaking of web surfing, the interface is a little awkward at first, but you get used to it.  It's also maybe a tad slow surfing the web, though the appslib and slideme android application browers run fine.The video and audio playback seem to work well too, though I haven't tested any 720p media. The one final thing I want to mention here is the touch screen -- it's not close to the quality of the iPad, which I have used fairly extensively.  It's crucial to carefully calibrate it at startup or you may have typing issues.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too Basic...my Droid 2 does better", "Author": "Desy", "ReviewID": "R1QNA438AY92E5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this device, so that I could watch music videos on youtube, or anime (mkv files) while I work out. I wanted to love this thing, but I just couldn't make it work!Pros: Nice big screen, clear and crisp, speakers decent, fairly light weightCons:Shoddy design - I've seen a couple reviews that mentioned this, but it happened to me too. The back panel is made of thin, reflective metal. With 1x use, the heat from the unit actually WARPED the panel. There was a palpable space underneath the panel, so every time I handled the device, it made an audible snapping noise as the panel flexed. Super annoying, and I imagine eventually the whole panel would have simply fallen offCupcake - I've read this term on a few reviews as well, from the more advanced users. I didn't quite understand at first, but basically, it comes with an older version of the android OS. You have to be willing to MOD the hell out of this device to get it to do anything advanced (and the tech/geek forums were great resources). However, even after hacking/installing the free marketplace, I found that half the apps didn't even run reliably.Freezes - multitasking sucks, very slow between screens and frequent freezing. Once I spent 40 mins staring at this useless device while on the cross-trainer; I was unable to unplug my headset from the device because it was frozen on the Pandora app, but still blasting out 1-2 second segments of a song every 3-5 minutes - I didn't want to disturb the other people in the gym. The device wouldn't turn off.The reset button has a very tiny access - most large paperclips wouldn't fit into it, I needed to eventually use a safety pin.Movie player sucks - when I read that it could handle MKV and other popular video formats used by my favorite fansubs, I was stoked! The device failed at everything else, I thought at the very least if it could play my anime, I'd forget all the pitfalls. No go - supports mkv, but no subtitle functionality. Fail.Hot Hot Hot - this thing gets hot...Browser capability - couldn't get the youtube app from hacked Market Place, so i was stuck using Skyfire browser to attempt to watch videos online. More often then not, it did not recognize that there was a video on the page I was viewing. It's an ongoing issue, as youtube continually change the flash features on their site; skyfire just doesn't keep up with the updates timely enough...but hey it's a free android market app - that's expected. Access to the youtube app would have fixed this.Touch screen - not a big deal to me, but it was quite difficult to use at times with the slow and sluggish responsiveness. I have to re-calibrate almost with every use.So...I ended up returning it.

On usability, a resounding \"no\".The CPU is acceptably fast, the screen is nice and bright... butSCREEN.  Here's the big problem.  I had only used capacitive screens until now, and I figured that resistive screens probably got too much of a bad rap... but it's deserved.  Not only do you have to press the screen with determination, I found sometimes I had to repeat the press two and three times... and then the machine gets confused between a regular press and a long press (like a right click with a mouse). VERY annoying...!BROWSING.  The resistive screen makes browsing the web next to impossible.  Flipping the screen up and down, because of the need for pressure, usually ends up being interpreted as a press, switching to a different page.  THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST ANNOYING FEATURE.

Kietzke", "ReviewID": "R1SV058JF5WPYR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, some background: I purchased this tablet as an experiment to see whether I might want to invest in a better one later, or whether I need the power of a regular tablet computer.  I'm primarily displaying books that have *lots* of graphics, and scrolling and/or page turns have to be fast.  I normally use my netbook for this, but it doesn't open flat, and thus can't sit on a music stand.The first one I received kept shutting off randomly, sometimes before it even finished booting.  Installing the latest firmware and keeping it plugged in didn't help, so I exchanged it through Amazon.  The replacement works much better.The battery life is good.  I generally leave it suspended most of the day, with some reading, audio, and occasional wifi use, probably a total of 3-4 hours/day.  I haven't gotten the battery down to 50% yet - the only time I've even come close is when I was using wifi extensively.The touch screen could be better, but for the price it's quite reasonable.  I haven't had any significant problems using it - I have more trouble with the one on my phone.  There are occasional glitches where it will pop up the notification screen or the volume control, but I'm pretty sure that's the software, not the screen itself.  I've never had it do that while turning pages in a book, for example.The screen isn't too glossy, and doesn't seem to need a screen protector as long as you aren't doing anything likely to scratch it, like using a stylus.  The case I bought came with a free screen protector, which made the touch screen much harder to use.The clock ends up way off if you leave it suspended.  I found a reference to an older firmware update for the Archos 7 Internet Tablet that fixed this problem, but the latest firmware for the Home Tablet doesn't fix it.  Tech support didn't know when this might be addressed.  There doesn't seem to be any way to remove the clock from the status bar, so I have to try to remember not to take it too seriously :-)  And, of course, using the alarm clock is out of the question.The built in photo frame and photo viewer sort by file write date.  If you know what a shell script is, you should have no trouble working around this.  If not, this is part of the \"not for beginners\" stuff :-)  I have found that the photo viewer can be useful for reading short books that are mostly graphics where high quality is important, e.g. music - represent each page as a picture.  There is a limit on how many pictures it will read, but I haven't bothered to pin it down exactly.  There is a slight delay while it draws the next picture - I haven't decided yet if I could get used to using it this way for anything other than practice.If you have the brightness turned all the way down in the built in ebook reader, the backlight may not get turned on when resuming from suspend.  If you have configured it to allow you to adjust the brightness while reading, you can use that action to turn on the backlight.If you are using a file manager that allows you to open files, you can import .epub files into the built in ebook reader by clicking on them.  They are deleted from their current location once the import is finished.The pdf readers I've tried have been painfully slow - I'd be ready for the next page before the current one is finished drawing.  It doesn't look like pdf is a viable format for anything serious on this platform.Page turns in the built in ebook reader are pretty quick, but opening a chapter can take some time, particularly if it is large.  Navigating via the table of contents is awkward - you can't just open it in a side pane like you can on a normal computer, even though the screen is wide enough to support it in the default landscape mode.The built in html viewer works ok for continuous scrolling, although I wish I could put it into portrait mode.

Hayward", "ReviewID": "R8U8QLS7IV9S9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the Archos 7HT with 8gb Flash memory in Jan 2011 and promptly returned it. Why?Pros: There's much to love about the Archos 7HT. Size, weight, features all wrapped into a fast interface. The high-def video is superb. The sound when listening to music is excellent, but only if you use headphones. The Aldiko eReader is top of the line and provides access to one of the best epublishers on the market: Feedbooks.  Last, but certainly not least, is the price point of under $200 making the Archos 7HT (seem like) a real steal; however...Cons: Although the Archos 7HT runs Android, you don't have access to the Android Market and the average user won't know how to get it. Instead, Archos gives you access to the Applibs Market which leaves much to be desired as the choices are very limited in comparison.  The real deal breaker for me, and the sole reason for returning it, is the HORRIFIC and unforgiving sensitivity when screen scrolling. It just doesn't work. Period.  While trying to move a page around or scroll through a list, it will open a menu or press a link that you didn't want. I nearly tore my hair out over this defect. I knew the scrolling was sub-standard before I purchased it, because of all the complaints about I read in the reviews, but I thought \"How bad can it really be?\" It's bad. Real bad. Believe me. There is no work around to this defect. Using a stylus doesn't help, nor does downloading an app, which was suggested to me. I loved the Archos so much that I tried everything to get the scrolling to work, but my efforts were for naught. It's almost like driving a car with a steering mechanism that doesn't work properly. It has a mind of its own and you never know where you're going to end up. Take my advice: Stay away from this product.Kudos to Amazon for their excellent return policy!

I knew I would have to manually install apps that aren't in the Archos AppsLib application, since Google doesn't support this through the Android Market. Also, it's currently running Android 1.5, nowhere near the upcoming release of 2.2 for Android phones. They'll hopefully upgrade it to at least 1.6 soon, anything past that may be beyond the capability of a firmware upgrade.Other than that the only really sucky thing is that it can only recharge using the 'wall wart' power adapter, it doesn't recharge via the USB cable. So I'll pick up an aftermarket adapter and a compatible car charger so I can keep it juiced up at work and on the road.The resistive touchscreen doesn't respond like a capacitive touchscreen, you actually have to tap or push and drag to make things happen. Engadget whined about this quite a bit, but it's no big deal and you get used to it quickly. As a previous owner of old-school Fujitsu tablets, no big deal to me.Video quality is very good, displaying 720p and keeping up with a variety of video codecs. Audio quality is actually quite good as well, but don't expect anything resembling bass response. The two built-in speakers do an adequate job for their size, and connection to external speakers greatly improves things. There are multiple preprogrammed EQ settings, and the capability to customize your own.Enough for now, gotta go play some more. I'll update the post in the next few days with additional observations.

Younger", "ReviewID": "R2EALVAJOT606M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this tablet a few days ago. I knew what I was getting into because I had read the early reviews of this product. I got this mostly for using it on the go when I want to use the internet. I wasn't disappointed until I tried Youtube and Facebook via the included web browser. I had to do research online to understand the tablet better before. I also told myself \"It's only $199 so if I don't like it..I'll send it right back\".Two days ago, I installed the Skyfire browser which DOES use Flash and allows youtube viewing. (Take that, Apple!) This made a huge difference for me and it's one of the best web browsers I've ever seen. I have not tried everything yet but as a media tablet...Its GREAT! I just wish it used a different memory card but I can live with it. With my psp, I used my neuros memory card reader connected with my tivo to transfer my TV shows. I'm still experimenting with the tablet to see how I can best transfer my TV shows to it without a computer. As for a computer and TIVO, using TIVO Plus software or connecting it to the PC works extremely well. It would be nice if the tablet had a captioning feature but I'm not complaining.I can use Facebook just the same as on a computer with all the flash games via Skyfire browser which is great.  You can't do this on an Ipad. One Ipad owner I know is actually taking back his Ipad to get this tablet this feature alone.As for the screen, you get what you pay for. You can watch HD quality movies and there's great screen brightness control too. One reviewer said he gave up on the screen calibration and wanted to send it back. That's coming from a person who doesn't seem to have much patience. I use a smart board as part of my job and have to do screen calibration several times too, It's not perfect but it gets the job done.Thanks to the helpful tips that the previous reviewers of this tablet had written in their reviews, I use Skyfire, Slideme and other apps to make this tablet a far more useful one. I haven't gotten around to using the e-book reader that's includes because I still don't understand how to get e-books yet. The upcoming Kindle for Android is a BIG deal as I'd definitely would use it as soon as it's available.The wifi connection is pretty stable and good enough for everything I've done online. I haven't tried it on the road yet.My six year old already loves using the tablet to watch some movies and play some games. That's pretty good considering he has access to my PSP.Some cons: I know the tablet just came out but the tablet's Android OS is 1.5 which should be upgraded. I DEFINITELY think the tablet should be connected to the Android market so are you hearing this, Archos? There's no bag or protective covers out yet so I'm waiting for it. I also want to have a way to copy tv shows directly to the tablet as I can connect it to my HDTV via USB so far.If I can do all of the above in just a few days of owning this tablet then I'm impressed and am definitely keeping this tablet!", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK unit but touch screen is frustrating to use", "Author": "engineer user", "ReviewID": "R2NT7A77H15FT0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought the unit because of what you got for the price; however, got frustrated w/ the poor performance of the touch screen, and had to reset the unit a few times in order to start it, battery life was not as expected.

Hey!  This thing multitasks!! Take that, iPad!  And micro SD is so cheap!* the selection of Apps is limited by the hardware.  It's true that most Android apps are written for phones, which have control buttons, while the 7HT is controled completely from the touchscreen.* the Android version is outdated.  The most recent firmware is 1.5, and Archos probably won't update anytime soon.  I understand that 7HT hardware won't support the most recent versions of Android.This product does everything I wanted: web surfing, e-books, music, videos, photo-frame, social appsFor the price, I could not get a dedicated e-reader.  My 7HT is a splendid e-reader in landscape or portrait mode.  I am using e-reader software for Android to read my .prc files, and Aldiko to read e-pub files.  Note that Mobipocket format cannot be read on the Android platform!Internet surfing is fast, and pages load full width.  The Sk*f*re browser plays Flash Video, so you can visit Youtube.The default music player is VERY limited functionality.  However, I am enjoying Pandora Radio.

That's where product reviews come in and hopefully this one may help you make a decision.Let me start off by listing the good things I found about this product;- The Price: At $300 less than the cheapest Ipad the low price is probably the tablet's biggest selling point... and it's not like you'll have to give up a whole load of options to buy this.- Appearance; it looks cool (to me at least), the screen size is great and it FEELS nice. Make sure you carry a cleaning cloth to wipe away  all the smudges.- Nice multimedia options: you can read about the video/audio player/ web browser/ photo frame options above; I just want to make sure I mention that it  also comes with a nifty little ebook reader. Although not fantastic, these multimedia apps are quite decent and make this a good buy.- I'm going to say this as delicately as I can; I'm not saying you are BUT if you are the kind of person who prefers NOT to pay for your multimedia content (hint, hint, nudge, nudge), then this tablet is certainly right for you; I was impressed on how easy it was to transfer different types of movie, audio and text files (all perfectly legal, of course) and then getting to enjoy them moments later. See how long it would take you to do THAT on an Ipad!- Not enough storage space for all those files? How about this: a slot for a micro SD card! Still not enough? a USB port! I mean, really, how can you even think about offering a product like this WITHOUT even one of these options? Can you hear me, Apple?- Leg Stand; I'm being completely serious here. Even though it's cheap and plastic and will probably break off soon, I just love being able to prop up my tablet... in fact, add another half a star to my review!Looking good, eh? Now the BAD news;- Battery life? Not so good. Turns out that for some really weird reason it will wake up every couple of hours while you are sleeping and drain your battery. There are ways to reduce this drain but you cannot switch this feature off, ever...(pause for effect)... WHAT?!?!- I've heard a lot of good things about the Droid app market and about how it will eventually leave the Itunes version crying in the dust but I can't say I'm much impressed... I'm aware this tablet only offers a 'Light' version of the market but still, Itunes does not have much to worry about at this point.- The Touch Screen; ugh, what a nightmare. I spent half an hour the other day trying to download and install an app, knowing exactly what to do but being thwarted at every turn by this awful, awful system. And check this out: I decided to use it in bed and when I touched the screen, it stayed dark and one of the crappy songs that was included started playing with no way of turning it off! This machine has a mind of it's own and it apparently hates everybody. Anyone else find it ironic the Archos company is french?Good things, bad things, but is it worth buying?Let me put it this way: this is perfect for a teenager gets all his/her multimedia content from torrents and can it stuff into one of the pockets of his/her baggy slacker shorts. Anyone else? Hmmm, let's face it, you (and by you I mean we) would rather go with the Ipad and all the cool things an ipad entails... like how Apple products seem to just work... Well,  ask yourself this: Is reliabilty worth the extra 300 dollars for you? That's something only you can decide.

convenient kickstand and brushed aluminum and glossy black finish+The Archos 7 V2 (what you'll likely receive) DOES HAVE ACCELEROMETER+The Archos 7 V2 DOES COME WITH ANDROID 2.1 Eclair+900mhz

use external keyboards/mice and storage devices (grab one of those roll-up keyboards for long emails/chat.+SD slotCons:-Battery life is nowhere near what Archos claims, medium or high brightness settings kill battery fast.  Screen brightness on low is perfectly fine for indoors, but nearly invisible under sunlight.-Requires a bit of user knowledge to get the most out of it - i.e. having to install rooted firmware to have access to the android market to get most apps.-Occasional lock-ups will require you to push pin-hole reset button-Wifi signal sometimes seems weaker than it should be for the distance.-FLACs dont play (at least not for me) with included music player, but other music player apps will play them (like Mixzing)Overall:I think the Archos 7 is a great option for people who want a very nice personal media player with some internet functions.  It's obviously not your top-of-the-line, decked out tablet with capacitive screen and camera and all that, but it does what it says it does, and, for the most part, does it well.A lot of the negative reviews that you'll read are either from people who own a V1 (they'll be the ones that complain about lack of accelerometer and slow performance with certain things) or from people who are unwilling to spend a couple minutes on google and do some reading on how to get the most out of this device.  Out of the box, the Archos 7 might only be a 3.5-4 star, but with rooted firmware installed and access to the android market and all the many apps on it, it's a solid 5 stars to me (well i'd knock off half a star for battery life exaggerations but i cant).  With this device, the more tech-savvy you are, the more you can get out of it, so the better value it is.Bottom line, if mine got lost or stolen, i'd buy another one.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned it same day", "Author": "Wayfinder", "ReviewID": "R2KWK9U8B7MAZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Okay, I can't say this is a \"bad\" product... but I can only rate it one star.

We set it up pretty easily, it connected to our wireless flawlessly. This thing is pretty low quality, the touch interaction is poor at best, pressing on button elements work fine but trying to scroll a web page or any scrolling on this thing is torturously slow, and unresponsive. My EVO 4G is way better than this and faster, additionally because of fragmentation in Android, Netflix streaming service is not going to work for a lot of Android devices.The app service is very limited, it doesn't use the Official Android store. I ended up buying my wife an iPad, I can't see how anybody can say this is even close to the functional level or quality of the iPad, it's not. It is way cheaper but a waste of your money, wait for Android 3.0 which will be made for the iPad experience.There is nothing with the ease of use, quality, and reliability of the iPad. This is a perfect fit for the old adage you get what you pay for.The Blackberry Playbook looks to be the closest competition, and HP/Palm is going to release a tablet as well early next year. In my opinion Palm has the best interface and usability even more than the iOS devices. They just currently lack compelling hardware.

No hard reset, no amount of coaxing or cursing would make it come to life, so off it went back to the company for a fix/replacement.  In about a week or so we had a new unit, which my husband swears is a refurb.  This unit seems to lose the internet connection when the whim strikes (did not have this issue at all before).  So, here, are my pros/cons for this little unit....Pros: nice compact design, great to download my vacation photos and take to work or have with me, downloads music, plays movies, I can surf the net when my home computer is in use...perfect for me as I sit in bed.Cons: drops the internet connection for no reason that my techy sidekick husband or I can figure out, touch screen sometimes just sticks, though usually works ok.Overall if it worked consistently I would be happy with the unit, but I am often found cursing at the screen, so I give it a 3 star....I enjoy it when it works and when it doesn't, well, I have visions of a sledgehammer.....", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Android tablet? or high priced music player?", "Author": "Wix", "ReviewID": "R1UU6ZWVB2QE1E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Archos 8Gb Home Tablet is a promising product. However, I am sure people here aren't willing to dole out 200 dollars (more or less) based on potential only.A few of the really big drawbacks have been outlined here already. The Android Marketplace is unavailable and apps currently on the tablet are limited and kind of lame to be frank. To date, I have yet to successfully install Skyfire onto my tablet in order to use Adobe Flash 10 items such as Youtube videos even though I am usually more than capable of such tasks. (update 3/11 - I got Skyfire, then had to d/l youtube player from the marketplace. I now have youtube) Surfing is awkward. The product manual is lacking in detail and Archos leaves you to attempt to figure out way too much of this tablet, and not all of it is intuitive. The touch screen is responsive, yet sometimes clicks the wrong item or over/under responds to touch. A stylus isn't a bad idea.The battery life is good, the antenna for Wi-Fi is mediocre and hardly picks up reception in my house where my laptops perform with ease. The speakers are good and the screen resolution is satisfactory. The screen gets muddled up quite easily and requires constant wipedowns. Sometimes, the player wakes up for no reason and drains the battery!Some here have mentioned custom upgrades and firmware. These changes to your tablet can render it useless. I tried one and my tablet now hopelessly freezes everytime I allow it to power off, which causes me to have to redo the install, then lose all my data on the tablet. Not cool..One major flaw is the flimsy power and headphone jacks. I had to replace this item (shipping 10 dollars at my expense) after the power jack broke internally without warning. The plug does not completely insert into the jack and it appears it leaves the jack prone to being snapped off leaving you with no way to charge the tablet. It is not a problem that can easily be avoided so far as I can tell. As a result, my new Archos is perched on a table, not to be handled when it has items plugged into a port.Another negative is the inability to service or replace the battery in this device. So when the rechargable battery no longer functions you will be at the mercy of Archos to replace it, which will set you back 10 dollars for shipping to Archos plus repairs. A USB charger would have been a definate plus rather than relying on the wall outlet adapter.In conclusion, the Archos 8Gb HT is a sharp looking tablet which could have been executed so much better. At this price point I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere. In my opinion, the web surfing capabilities of this device have been hampered and do not justify recommending this as anything other than a high end mp3/video playback device.If you want an IPad like device RUN away from this one as you will be severely disappointed. I should also mention that I was given this item to review through Amazon's Vine program. If I am not happy with it- being given this for free in exchange for a review- then it speaks volumes to the quality of a product.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Idea, bad engineering", "Author": "Vinarian", "ReviewID": "RQISYD6FP79M2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "1. Touch Screen ***This is a touch screen ONLY device, the only hardware button is the power button. The touchscreen does however have good response for a restive (sp) screen. It is perfect for page turnswipes and taps. Initial configuration is a little finicky though, it took two tries to get calibrated.2. Storage ****Ok, so this is an 8gb device, but you can only read ebooks off of Android sd card, which makes no sense to me. However sd cards are dirt cheap nowadays, so that was not a huge problem. Not to mention that the 8gb can be used to store mp3s to listen to while reading...3. Battery Life ***** (outstanding!)(Wifi On and searching, but not connecting) The archos website touts 7 hours video and 44 hours music, I get about 6 hours video, but only 15 hours while just reading, so nowhere near eink, but a lot better than most other color screen devices. On the downside, the unit will NOT charge via usb, you must use the included multinational charger. Charge time is just over one hour.(Wifi on and connected)  When the wifi is connected to my home network, this device gets about 30 hours battery life for ereading - still about the same 6 hours for video though; I have not tested this device with wifi turned off yet.4. E-reader ****The device comes preinstalled wit Alkido which is an excellent ereader, though figuring out how to transfer. ebooks. may take a little getting used to. There ae great brightness settingsas well as nighttime color schemes for easy reading weather in bed or outside.5. Video & Music ***** (outstanding!)This is really where archose shines, The multimedia functions of this device are outstanding -- not to mention as i stated before, 6 hours of battery life for video - this is perfect for a plane ride, or even to catch up on newsclips on the commute (metro ride!) to work.  The speakers are excellent for being such a small device, very nice, crisp and loud - at least for video, slightly better quality than many laptops i have used.  For music I would reccomend headphones.6. Operating System **This device uses android 1.5 - and not the full version, the app store is not included, though a bastardized version run by archose is, what this means is that 90% of android apps will NOT install automatically, including Opera and Skyfire.  There are a few websites around that offer alternatives to android market of which about 75% of the apps that i have tried on the alternative sites will work.  Even in the archose supported Apps Lib, there are still some (mostly games) that will not run correctly on this device.  There are some major memory issues with the operating system - it is ESSENTIAL that some sort of memory management app is installed such as \"kill\" which will allow running apps to be stopped on the fly as there is no native way to end a program that is running.  There are also some programs that will store (temporary?) data in the app space of the archos which is only about 20 megs to begin with, such as the app \"funny joke\" (installable from apps lib) which after a while will have built up a 6+ megs cache which makes the unit incredably slow (the ereader will crash due to not enough memory at this point) untill the user enters the settings screen and deletes the cache for the funny jokes app - which can be a pain, especially when the device is already slow...7. Design ***While this device seems to be designed fairly well, there are two large flaws -- 1.) this unit CANNOT be charged via USB, you MUST use the included wall adapter, and 2.) the headphone jack and the power adapter plug are the same size - i shorted out the headphone jack the day i received the device by plugging the power into the unmarked headphone jack by mistake.  It would not have been difficult to include a different sized power jack...8. Durability **After 1 month of using the Archos, it will occasionally die and need to be reset (there is a reset button on the back if you have a pin or needle), not a huge problem, just more annoying than anything else, this seems to happen when the screen will automatically turn off sometimes when the feature is engaged - probably about 10% of the time the screen auto turns off.  The power switch will sometimes get activated without touching it, causing the Shutdown screen to display repeatedly untill the device is reset (happened 5 times to me now)Overall, I would rate this product 3 stars -- For a company that built such a good device, there are some fatal flaws that should have been resolved before release such as the shoddy engineering on the durability of the device as well as support for android 2.0 at the very least - if it would cost more money, I would have happily pad an extra $50-100 for a better product.To sum up -- this is a cheaply priced Devuce, if  you dont want to spend to much monney, this device is great, but you do get what you pay for!", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "It is what it is....", "Author": "Kelly L.

With tons of new tablets being introduced it seems a bit risky to spend $500 knowing that whatever you buy will be out of date almost immediately; the Archos 7 works well enough and is inexpensive enough that it's not the end of the world if it's lost or broken by the kids. All in all this unit works best if you see it as a video-music player with some light web browsing possible.Pros: Light weight, good battery life, enough applications that you can probably find what you need with a little searching, ok performance, not subject to a complete lock down like Apple products.Cons: Android takes a bit of time to learn to use (if you haven't used it before), the screen is not as clear as more expensive Archos products and is subject to the quirks of being a resistive screen, Android 1.5 and the lack of the Android Market makes you work a bit to find applications, like every Archos product I have owned expect some strangeness - occasional shut-downs, slow to update, things of that nature.All in all it may sound like I am down on this unit but for the price it really is a great Jack Of All trades and unlike people who buy an expensive iPad and have to deal with it being outdated when the next version is introduced, the cost of this makes it easy to upgrade.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Louise Murphy", "ReviewID": "R1JDEKAQ9LJNH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were disappointed with the Archos 7.

In fact if I didn't have my computer genius husband around it wouldn't be something I could easily use and I'm constantly on my netbook, Ipod Touch, smart phone, ect. This is because this tablet is glitchy as heck and has a somewhat outdated version of android on it.There's about to be a glut of android tablets on the market. This one has led the way but a lack of updating isn't going to make it user friendly. The built in software is adequate but there are a number of flaws. There are two music players on it, the better of which does not contain a random play/shuffle. The screen calibration never seems to calibrate correctly. The wi-fi is glitchy at best, dropping connection at random. The built in app store is not the default android marketplace but a custom built Archos exclusive which results in a lot of android apps not being available to the Archos tablet. The sleep doesn't function properly on it, either refusing to go to sleep or waking randomly and startlingly, sucking the battery dry. The only real way to conserve the battery is to turn it off. It does not charge from USB.On the positive side there is a good fan user base which can be employed to remove the restriction to get the default android marketplace and put Google apps onto the tablet. The browsers adequate which makes it a good portable internet device. It's solidly built with a nice kick stand.

It improves the battery life a lot!  As everyone noted, it doesn't have the Google Market app, but I haven't cared yet.  Everything I've wanted to download has been available somewhere on the web.  There are also several other web sites that offer library apps.I downloaded Google docs which works like a charm.  I downloaded Skyfire to get flash capability.  I downloaded Astrid to get a to-do list that syncs with Remember the Milk.The pre-installed apps work very well.  I have about 50 ebooks loaded into Aldiko.  I also have about 20 videos and about 4 gig of music loaded.  On the Archos 7ht user forum I downloaded AppManager and Advanced Task Manager.  ATM also acts as a task killer so there's no reason to have a separate app for that.When you attach the USB cable to your pc, you get a device called Archos 7.  If you also have an installed SD card, you get another device with only a letter identifier.  They work well enough that I never remove the micro SD card.There are times that the touch screen is difficult to use.  I've kept a 3-color ballpoint pen with one ink barrel replaced with a stylus for years.  When I use it to navigate, I get a lot of precision and don't have to press very hard.

I would not suggest this product as your first computer or even your WiFi connected gadget.  You have to be able to figure out how to problem solve because this product is not as consumer friendly as an IPad.  It runs the Android Operating System 1.5.  If you don't know what that means, then I suggest you look for a product with a more familiar OS.  Won't play CNN or Youtube movies.  No camera, No G3. WiFi only.  It's not the fastest machine out there.  As a matter of fact, it's a bit on the slow side, so don't expect too much from this 7 inch tablet.Next I suggest you read a little bit about the product and its limitations.Now the good.  It plays videos really well and they look very good on the screen.  If you want to play home movies on the tab, I suggest you bump up the color saturation, but for most Hollywood movies they will look very good.  I play mostly divx encoded AVI movies.  Photos too need a bit more saturation to look good on the tab, but once you find the right amount, the photos look really good. Web browsing is fairly fast and most websites load properly.  I mostly use the tablet to read forums and read articles off of the internet.  The 7 HT is a really good ebook reader. It will display any non DRM epub book, so if you like to read the classics, there are a lot of books that you can download off of the internet for free.  The ebook really was a nice surprise.  It can also stream music with an app called Deezer. The speakers are just adequate for listening, but the 7HT has an earphone jack.The 7HT is a really nice machine if you can live with a couple of limitations.  One thing I could live with is the price.  It is $360.00 less than the cheapest IPad, and it will do about 90% of what an IPad can do.

But using this tablet has been nothing but an exercise in frustration.  First, it's running Android 1.5 and 3.0 is out on devices now.  Second, the touch screen is SLOW in response and often I get no response.  Now I know that's because it's a cheaper resistive touch screen.  It drops the wifi connection over and over and I have to reset the device to get the connection back.The real kicker is that it does not use the normal Android market.  You have to use the Archos market and there are, of course, a limited amount of apps in their market.  I've also had it freeze up a number of times and was unable to get it working until I reset it, just like with wifi going bad.I spent a few hours one night just trying to configure this, add a few apps, and change some settings and, due to the poor touch screen, found it almost impossible to get anything done on this tablet.  I can't think of any use this tablet would work as, other than, perhaps, a display that doesn't need to be interactive.

E-mail works, set up imap accounts very easily.  Seamlessly connects to PC without issues.  I'm running XP, didn't have to install anything, it just showed up as two drives, one for the tablet and one for the SD card.  Touch screen is not overly bright, very easy to see.  Very light weight, easy to carry, battery easily lasts a day without constant use.  Much easier to browse web pages with a bigger screen than with a phone.  These are the reasons I bought this tablet, so I can't complain much.Cons:  No WPA Enterprise encryption support, cannot connect to university wifi.  Android 1.5, problematic, will not work with most .apk files I try to download.  No easy way to upgrade it to newer version of android, some custom roms exist, but don't work 100%.  If anyone has found one, please let me know.  No flash support, no youtube app.  New version of Skyfire won't install which gives flash support, have to use old version.Other thoughts:  None of the cons listed would have made me not buy this thing for about $40 less than what it was listed for on here (found one on Craigslist).  It is really good for what it is, basically a portable internet/media browser to use in your home (I assume this is why they call it a HOME tablet).  If you buy it for these things, it's great, not going to deduct anymore than 1 star for not being able to easily hack the thing to death, and install all sorts of custom stuff.EDIT:  I did find a custom ROM for this that works nicely.  Can be found at wiki dot archosfans dot com, title of wiki is \"Archos 7HT Firmware Himself V0.27 SamJr YAR!\".  0.28 Version is good, but need to install it exactly how it tells you using RKAndroid.  I can now install a fair amount of .apk files off websites, but not through the marketplace.  There is also a program called WiFiHelper, but it's kind of hard to find.

So beware if you think you're gonna be able to hook up this thing to your tv and watch videos, is not gonna happen. Anyways, I'm still keeping it cause it does all the other things I was looking for. It's a light, easy, portable way of surfing the internet around the house plus the music and being able to watch videos on the go on a 6 inch wide screen for $200 dollars made this a little neat handy device that I must keep. Ok, now for the review:1) You should know that the default keyboard is impossible to use because when you press a letter any letter around THAT letter is pressed but the one you pressed... got it? It doesn't click where you click... but you can download an app with a different keyboard with bigger keys and problem solved.2) You should also know that there is not a single internet browser (from the ones that are available to download plus the default browser) where you can watch flash sites or any kind of flash content on this device, the ONLY browser that allows you to play videos in flash format (only videos-you won't be able to see ads or content in flash format) it's called Skyfire and it ONLY works with some websites. If you visit a website with flash content you will see a gray screen, gray square, rectangle or whatever instead of the flash format. If there is a video in flash format on that website and Skyfire is able to detect it you will get a pop-up window were you can click play and watch that video. For all other purposes the Skyfire browser is very slow and crashes too many times but... is still in beta mode so maybe this will change, but for now, no flash, no flash, no flash. But if you're looking to watch youtube videos, Skyfire will work just fine and better than any other youtube applications, so that's a good thing, and for any other purpose the default browser works just fine and is the fastest.3) You should also know that the battery lasts forever (well not forever but about 6 hours of constant use), I use my tablet all day long surfing the internet, checking my e-mail 100 times per day, downloading files and videos through out the day and at the end of the day I still have about 30% battery left. Nothing like most cellphones that you have to keep loading the battery every day; and if you don't use it as often as I do you wont have to load maybe in 2 - 3 days. Is the best feature of this device.4) Finally, you should also know that this device has Android 1.5 and that there's already a 1.6 and 2.0/2.1 versions and that \"maybe\" we will NEVER see an update to one of this newer versions from Archos unless someone at the archosfans forum creates a hack for it allowing the Android updates; something they have already done for the Android Market which you can't access from this device... but now we can, so there IS access to Android Market on this device... another good thing, and that's all.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lovely toy", "Author": "wondershovel", "ReviewID": "R1QZW8HMR5LU1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't know if it can run every modern whiz-bang Android app but this tablet has a wonderful bright LCD screen perfect for showing off pictures and browsing the net.

I say this with all honesty of what I would of wanted to know before I bought the Archos. I am not saying people write good reviews on here to fool you into buying products, but the frustrating annoyance of this product could never permit anyone to write anything over 2 stars. This is the first review I have ever submitted, it takes a HUGE amount of good or bad to overtake my laziness and put the effort into writing a review. And I do so you don't have to realize after the initial 2 hour playtime we do with all neat gadgets, that you have just waisted whatever amount of money you put in to this. I paid 80 on Craigslist and still feel took..Basically all apps available are made for phones, thus they are phone size in the corner of the 7inch screen, video is scarce at best and quality of video is VHS. Games are of  a 2003 cell phone..So trying to find a use for it, I figure maybe an internet browser and I can use it to stumble through all nonpictured websites, but I would usually get tired of waiting or force closing and just pull out the phone to look up in less time.. I originally was shopping for another Sony Dash to watch Netflix with, as the Dash is fairly cheap and works for what I need, the Archos looked neater and I got it. I am okay with buying something that doesn't do what I thought or these days I am even getting use to something being poor quality and just not buying this brand name again. But I was to the point where I couldn't find anything to do with it, a stupid picture viewer would be fine even, but the quality was pretty poor. and this may just be mine, but the screen just turns on by itself all the time, forcing me to shut it all the way off and not wanting to take the turn on time, it just sits off, until I try to find an app or something to put it to use.This product seems like it was intended to be decent, and was forgot about.

For this it is excellent...it will even repeat all or one of the videos.  He liked it.  I bought a zippered pencil box at an office supply store for $3 and it fit very snugly in it.

There are custom firmwares, how tos and what not.But I did not do any of that. I am using it unmodded and am quite happy with the functionality. Out of the box, it gives you the ability to read your emails, surf the net, read books, read news from all over the world, chat with your MSN and yahoo messenger friends, play music or videos from the 32GB SD card or 8GB memory. A light weight device with a 7 inch screen that can do all that in itself is a pretty good value at the price mentioned. Key word is portability. Much better than lugging your laptop around. Oh and the battery on this thing seems to last forever.The ALDIKO reader that comes bundled with it allows you to download lots of free books to your device. Not only that, it allows you to add a custom catalogue to your device - such as [...] which lets you download thousands of free public domain books including those by Dickens and my personal favorites - P.G. Wodehouse and H.Rider Haggard.Now what else can you do with it ? As it turns out - PLENTY. But first delete, not update, but delete the appslib that comes bundled with it and reinstall the new appslib from [...]/latest.0. Taskiller app from appslib. Put it on the main screen (by tapping and holding just like iphone) and now you can actually kill apps that are running in the background and free up memory. If you kill all apps except the taskiller, it also solves the problem of frequent unexpected wake from sleep cycles that drain battery.1. Remote VNC and RDP clients - two apps available from appslib lets you control all the PCs or Laptops from your archos 7 device. For using the RDP client you will need to enable remote access on your PCs and for using the VNC client you will have to install something like tightVNC on your PCs/laptops.2. Youtube - That is right. There is a youtube version 1.3 APK available on the net which installs a youtube application on your archos 7 device. Version 1.3 was the last Cupcake (Android 1.5) compatible version of youtube. Regrettably, the myAccount feature in the app does not work. So your personal favorites, playlists etc are inaccessible but you can still search and play.3. Facebook - You can download a facebook app from appslib. There are more than one available. So take your pick.4. PANDROA - Well not really. I could not find PANDORA per se but from appslib you can download an application called SLACKER. Same concept as Pandora but better implementation. My favorite feature in this app is a predefined HITS section which has several predefined radio stations - Current hits, Love songs, hits from the 80s, 70, 60s, 50s, Country and others. It even has international stations.5. ES FILE EXPLORER - Search for it on the net. It lets you access files from all the network shares on your home network. Which means all your media, audio or video, is just a flick of a finger away. The current version of this software has some limitations. When playing audio files it does not automatically move on to the next audio file and when playing video, it actually transfers the entire video to the internal memory instead of streaming it.6. Skyfire browser - Search for it on the net. This browser lets you play embedded FLASH videos on websites such as MSN.com.7. Sleeptimer - Search for it on the net. This application, as the name suggests, lets you specify a time after which it will shut down the audio player. So if you like going to sleep while listening to your favorite melody..this is the application for you. Just a word of caution - It lets your turn off WIFI when it goes to sleep - DON'T DO IT - because then the wifi stops working altogether. I had to do a factory reset and load everything all over again.8. An application that produces white noise - ocean sounds, rain sounds, fan sounds and a dozen other to help some of you light sleepers fall asleep. Search appslib for the word \"sleep\" and you will find a bunch of these.9. The photo frame app that comes bundled with it can be used to endlessly slideshow your pictures, while the audio player is playing your favorite music.I am sure you can find many more uses for it and many more cool applications from appslib. This is all i have been able to do in my 2 weeks of owning this tablet and needless to say i am 100 % satisfied with it.PS - Check out Andromote (on the device) and XBMC (on the pc) combination also.

But because of the really cheap price, I still considered getting one.I work as a stage and rigging supervisor and we do outdoor stages and roofing system here in the Philippines. This is my 2nd touchscreen device, my first was a Garmin Nuvi 1410 GPS and I would say that the screen responsiveness of archos 7 is just similar to garmin GPS.I mainly use this thing for viewing photos, pdfs, sometimes as an audio player/ online radio, browsing the web (when I'm too lazy to switch on my mac desktop), and to watch youtube movies.PROS:1. Great photo viewer to show clients plans, designs, proposals, and old stage setups.2. Very handy during stage setups. It serves as the bluprint of our stage design that I follow and it becomes the checklist of things I need to finish.3. Fits in my back pocket because of its slim design.4. The item seems solid and rugged. For me, you don't have to be very careful on this device. This can handle itself with bumps, scratches that it experiences during my rugged stage setups.I dropped this thing once during a setup, It hit a steel truss then fell on a concrete ground about 3 feet high and its still working fine. If it breaks, I don't mind, I'll get another one. Its very cheap not like the iPad or galaxy tab.5. Great for watching Youtube (you need to download a modified youtube app to make it work), great for HD 720p movies. Accepts divx, mkv, avi, and almost any format I throw into it.6. Touchscreen is not as sensitive as an iPad or any capacitive touchscreens but surprisingly responsive. Maybe its because of my big and heavy hands. My sister hates this thing cause she's used to her iPad's too sensitive touch. I sometimes I use the other end of my ballpen as a stylus and its pretty responsive. But this thing works for me.7. I love the micro SD card expansion. I can expand its capacity up to 40gb8. Battery life is longer than I expected as long as you turn the wifi off.CONS:1. Slow on 3d games but not really a big issue for me. I have another dedicated device for 3d gaming2. The kickstand wiggles and feels very cheap.3. weak wifi signal strength you need to be near the wireless router to get great wifi connection.4. Does not charge via micro USB port so you have to bring the dedicated charger most of the time.5. Very crappy earphones included.6. Randomly restarts. it just happened now while I'm writing this review. This was the 2nd time it restarted by itself. the first time was when I dropped it.7. No bluetooth tethering with my phone. I wish it had a bluetooth so I may connect online using my phone anywhere I am.

I had to delete the apps lib and then re down load it to get it to work.For the Amazon price of $149, it can not be beat.

I did a bit of research and found that in order to view YouTube and other streaming videos you need some apps. I decided to get it set up and mess around with it a bit in advance of Christmas to avoid frustration on the day and was pretty pleased with what I found. The native Internet browser was pretty speedy and the sample video and music provided looked and sounded great. The apps that the company said were preloaded were there, but hidden in the Files section, but loaded with a couple of clicks -- an eBook reader with access to hundreds of free classic books, a radio service, an e-mail service that I didn't try yet, all loaded with a click or two.The official app library was there too and lets you view top apps and search for specific apps and download directly the Android apps they provide. I downloaded VideoBox, which lets you stream and download YouTube videos (worked pretty well once I figured out I could search it -- you can stream or download to view later, downloading was a bit slow).  There are tons of other apps on the Archos AppLibrary, but you can get others that it doesn't have from other sites. The Skyfire browser, which lets you view streaming video from other sites (though sadly not Hulu), was downloaded to my Mac from PandaApps, then transferred to the Archos with the provided USB cord in just a couple minutes. I was able to watch an episode of a TV show on the CW's website with no lag.  A Quicktime movie file I had on my Mac transferred easily -- just drag and drop, then open from Archos Files, and looked great.I also took the advice on tech reviews and downloaded a task killer to shut down apps not being used to keep browsing fast. All in all, a pretty good little device -- I work online and was able to access my work site and type easily on the on-screen keyboard, though it says you can attach one via USB. The touch screen worked pretty well, it calibrates on initial start-up, the only frustration is when scrolling down, it clicks on the items you're scrolling through instead, so took a few tries to get to what I was looking for on occassion -- a small price to pay.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Second unit purchase of Archos 7 Home Tablet", "Author": "R.

Everyone is wired(less) anymore and yet another screen that does the same thing as every other screen seems frivolous.  Considering I don't own a gadget that runs any kind of an app, I was curious if the tablet is even worth playing with. -Eventually after I was able to grab some WiFi I enjoyed what the limited but sleek and handsome Archos had to offer.  Most exciting to me was the idea of an Ereader while Aldiko is built in and you can grab some great old public domain material this thing isn't exactly the answer to the Kindle, plus a backlight screen that kind of flashed a little on the lowest light setting left me wanting more.  Next up the apps I barely know an app from an apple but I like games, and there are some fun free titles to be found on the service the squashing games seem to work best with this units inability to run many of the tilt driven games. digital music plays well on this unit and it plays FLAC files perfectly (a big plus for me).  The video looks spectacular but given the units somewhat limited intial memory  you will be deleting and transfering alot unit you grab a miniSD card.  The power on button stinks it took me a week to figure it out properly and the manual and documentation are kind of a why bother.  The ac jack and headphone jack are too close and can be confused for one another without close inspection.  GREAT SCREEN< BATTERY LIFE< CODECS seem to play every audio and video file I throw at it.  The browser works well and websites look great but I would use it only in situations where it was the only option.  The price is right and the screen is a beauty.  The real drawback here is touchscreen only controls that sometimes misfire, which a rubber tipped stylus seemed to remedy.

Everyone seems to be making a big deal out of these things nowadays (great, I sound like a grandma!).Anyway, it was easy enough to start up when it arrived and charged pretty quickly.  Right away I had a hard time with the touch screen, it would highlight something that I wasn't even close to or scroll through things way too fast.  I thought it was just because I wasn't used to it, but it never did get better.I tried some of the preloaded apps first.  I didn't like the email app because it seemed like I could only delete the emails after I opened them, maybe there is a way around this that I don't know about, but it was annoying.  I get a good amount of junk mail and just wanted to delete it right from the inbox without opening the emails themselves.I tried the ebook app second, tried to search for some books that might interest me, but it just seemed to be book and writers I've never heard of.Tried getting on the web, this worked ok except one site I frequent uses Java and it was not installed, nor do I know if it's even possible to install on this.  Facebook also looks funky on it.  It's ok for news sites or craigslist, but not too much else to me.I then searched for Apps in the App Library thing, I couldn't find anything I wanted and it showed were free Apps.  Nothing to buy.

Archos' version of Android 1.5 is a bit weak compared to 1.6 or 2.0. No Google Apps support, but you can still get 75% of available apps through other sources. Members of ArchosFans.com have developed \"unofficial\" OS builds that support Google Apps, but this voids the warranty.I got it to play videos and music, and it has not disappointed. The 7\" screen is heaven when compared to the Apple Touch (and it plays downloaded Flash videos). Battery seemingly lasts forever (not really, but I can spend the day watching videos, jam to mp3's, check my email 100x a day, do a bit of surfing and still have 30% battery power left).Wi-Fi connectivity is easy, so is email setup. I found the just released Opera Mini 5 does a far better job for both surfing and email, and you can sync data with your Opera desktop browser. Wi-Fi search is comprehensive, and if you have a home network it does a great job linking to it. You can map shared drives for file transfer (does not stream data)!Expansion is limited to microSD cards (max 32GB). Limit you app/email/e-book/etc collection until you get the additional SD card (get several if you can, it's easy to just keep adding music/videos/photos and data). Besides the case, accessories are wanting - nothing, zippo! USB cable (A to B) is file transfer only. Battery charging is by adapter only (although you can buy the USB charger for the Archos 3G and charge through desktop/laptop USB).Software is a bit wanting, as I mentioned. The Archos uses AppsLib (be careful as most developers do not provide details about their apps), do a Google search to get additional info before installation. Installed apps include: Aldiko (e-books), Alarm Clock, Calculator, Email, ColorNotes (notepad), generic Video Player, Photo Viewer, Audio Player, Sound Recorder, and Music (jukebox), and finally the crummy browser. Besides the App Window, there is also a 3-panel Homepage allowing plenty of room to layout your \"desktops\"!I guess my biggest complaint is the touchscreen. It a resistive screen, and calibration takes a lot of finesse! Take you time, try applying different pressures. If you get incorrect launches, or incorrect letters when typing, re-calibrate.Overall, it's a very nice product. It wasn't meant to replace your laptop. You need to understand what it does, and what it does not. Be weary of \"puffing\" sellers, go to [...] to get accurate info. Like any relationship you want to last, it takes time to get used to each other. Besides the cash, invest some time, the rewards are worth it.If you need something more robust and expandable, wait a few months more. Should be a slew of rollouts for more muscular tablets.

I also suggest going into the forums (archosfans.com) and read what even the fans have to say about it.First, it's a very good looking product.  I love how it looks and feels.  The price point is great too.  If it could do everything it's supposed to do, it would be a steal. Unfortunately, it does not.1) Video - I mainly use my Archos products to watch videos.  With a family of six, including several video game players, it's hard to get any time on the TV.  So I use my portable devices to catch up on my favorite shows.  The Archos 7 could not handle most of the videos I threw at it.  THe video was choppy and dropped frames.  The audio stuttered. These were simple AVI files previous Archos players had no trouble playing.  I re-encoded one video and it did better but it took about 45 min to encode.  (One annoying thing is I haven't figured out how to delete a video directly from the device.  You have to plug it in to your PC and delete from there.  The user manual is very sketchy and of little help for any of the troubleshooting.)2) Resistive touch screen - lots of reviewers have commented on this.  Unfortunatley it's true.  It's not very good.  If you're used to an iPod you'll be very frustrated very quickly.  Just scrolling down through videos was a hassle.3) Unexpected Wake from Suspend - this is a serious flaw.  The fact that it wasn't fixed with a firmware upgrade is very disappointing.  I should be able to suspend my unit and not have it wake up every couple of hours to drain my battery.4) Android 1.5 - the unit is using an earlier version of Droid.  Most the apps you want to get won't even run on this unit.  The appslib won't even connect.  I installed a few apps by downloading them directly from the internet.  Others I tried installing wouldn't work.  One said \"not enough memory to install app.\"  What a ridiculous error message, considering it's a brand new product and I had nothing on the unit yet.5) Surfing the internet is slow and frustrating. I'm comparing it to how quickly my iPod loads pages.  I would never use the unit for internet, which eliminates a lot of its functionality.Amazon is no longer selling this unit. That should be a HUGE clue. I expect they are getting a lot of returns.  Mine is going back for sure.  I'll wait for the Archos 8 or find some other product.  I haven't lost complete faith in the company, but this product is terrible.  I wanted to love it too.  It might be the first time I was truly surprised at Christmas.

Bad choice. It's definitely not for the mainstream user. It's quiet buggy and there are rough edges all over the software. No doubt, it plays several formats of video and audio but that doesn't redeem its other shortcomings. There is no excuse for the lack of a capacitative touch screen. One has to constantly keep calibrating it, and even then, it's impossible to accurately select what one intends to.This is a definite demonstration of how companies take customers back several years with each new generation of device, instead of releasing mature, robust products. This kind of thing immediately obsoletes all previous investments in software, accessories and more importantly, data. I'm not even going to mention the customization and familiarity that one grows into to use gadgets effectively and smoothly.Back to the A7HT... here, I have a \"new\" device, with an already aging OS (Android ver 1.5), and outdated hardware and little that can be done to customize and \"improve\" it otherwise, because most new(er) Android applications don't work on it. Add to that Android is tuned for mobile phone type devices with a different form-factor and functionality. Bad choice, Archos!Some things do work though... the browser is ok, email has IMAP support... and the video and music. But there is no native streaming support (other than via the internet... no uPnP or shared file systems). The pathetic 8GB memory compounds the problem (of the lack of streaming support).People go gaga over the screen. But not so fast, people. It's barely adequate and totally inadequate for viewing photographs; it's like those old color monitors from the 80s - patchy and blotched. The sound... my 5 year old iPod shuffle is soooooo much better.It does work well as an eBook reader, but there is no Kindle support (probably resulting from the older Android version).People say that's what one should expect for USD 199.

I did some research on Archos' website, and read some reviews here, and decided to purchase it.  It came quick from Amazon as always.  I opened the box up, turned it on, and was really impressed with the picture quality.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing to impress.Where to start:The Archos 7, has a 7 inch screen, which displays a great picture, but 7 inches is a little smaller than you might think it is, especially if your doing a lot of internet surfing.  The touch screen, which unfortunately is resistive, is a HUGE disappointment.  I understand that it keeps the cost down, but with everything moving to capacitive, it's really a let down.  You have to push the screen really hard to make a selection, and even then its hard to make a pin-point selection, i.e. a link on website.  It's very hard to scroll via a finger swipe, and I can't tell you how many times I clicked something I did not mean to click.  I knew when I ordered the Archos that it had the resistive touch screen, and I thought it wouldn't make much of a difference, but it makes a huge difference!  I think it has a 600mhz processor, which does ok, but once you start multi-tasking it gets bogged down rather quickly.  The virtual keyboard is OK, but again, with the resistive touchscreen, it is very difficult and SLOW to type something.  Also lacking on the Archos is the Android operating system it runs on.  Archos ships these units with Android 1.5, which is becoming a relic with 2.1 already out, and 2.2 around the corner.  I havn't heard anything about an update coming for the Archos, but it would be a lot better if they upgraded to the newer firmware.  Also lacking, is access to the android apps store.  Instead this unit ships with Archos' version of an app store called AppsLib.  It has a fraction of the apps that the android store has.  There is also no Youtube, app, and Flash is not supported in the 1.5 version of Android, so you cannot watch Youtube, or any other flash videos for that matter.That being said, the resolution on the Archos 7 screen is pretty stellar, videos and websites look great, as do mobile books and pictures.  The battery life is pretty good as well(and could only stand to get better with an operating system update), lasting about 7hrs with light use.  It also sports a kickstand, and mini sd card slot, along with a usp port(all be it mini usb), which even the Ipad doesn't have.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the good does not outway the bad in this case.To put it simply, if you want something you can surf basic webpage's with, read mobile books, and watch movies on the fly, for $200 this device might be good for you.  On the other hand, if you went to see an Ipad, but thought you would find an Android alternative, it may be too soon, and the Archos 7 just can't match up.

It is a great price. You can buy the external keyboard at the web site.  I can only give it two stars. I bought the Archos 7 Home tablet to play You Tube videos to use at the gym for when I perform my cardio work outs. I figure that all tablets had an available flash player.  Much to my chagrin, the Archos 7 Home tablet does not play You Tube videos. The Archos 7 Home tablet does not have a support for the Flash Player. This means that CNN, and Amazon vides or any videos from the Web will not play on the tabletl.  The app that is available for the Archos 7 Home tablet, just for You Tube videos, is grainy and has a very small viewing window. I deleted the app. The WI FI app that is available does pick up on the wireless networks at Union Station Washington DC, but does pick up on the wireless networks in the library. I have down loaded two of the Wi Fi and both failed. I deleted both of them.  The touch screen is tricky at best and the Archos 7 Home tablet has shut down on me numerous times and had to be recalibrated.  In order to play the You Tube videos, I have to down load the videos and save them, convert them to a .mp4 format and then load them in to the tablet! I had to convert over 13 GB of videos. That meant I had to install convertor software to accomplish this. This was more steps and additional software on my PC. This is NOT why I bought a tablet! Please, do your home work! If you want a tablet that plays videos and connects to available WiFi networks this is not the tablet for you. I have to admit that the video play back is excellent.  The eReader is a tad off. I was reading the `Invisible Man' and moved to the next screen. I realized that the sentences did not match. I had to turn the Archos 7 Home tablet vertical and could see that five sentences were skipped when it was horizontal positon. So, I moved to the next page while the Archos 7 Home tablet was in the horizontal position and I realized that a hyphenated word was skipped. So then, I had to turn the Archos 7 Home tablet to a vertical position. I had t keep turning the Archos 7 Home tablet vertical and horizontal until I finished my first H.G. Wells novel and I have not used the eReader again.  The Archos 7 Home tablet manual reads that it has 7 hours video play and that is not true. The video play back is just over three hours before the warning to recharge the battery. I have two and half hour one-way daily commute and I have to charge the battery when I get to work and when I get home. What is scary is how HOT the battery gets when charging and while the videos play.The plastic kickstand only works in the horizontal position. It looks and feels breakable. I do not use it.If you are a gadget-freak this is not he tablet for you.  I am now shopping for a tablet with the features I need. Hopefully, I will find one in the $400 range.

As you've been reading, the screen is very unresponsive. This makes typing tricky, you have to type one key at a time, like typing into an old typewriter. I'm not sure if its the screen or the processor, but scrolling on webpages is also sluggish. Even after the firmware update, the browser crashed really frequently. Because scrolling locks up so frequently, attempts at scrolling registers as a tap and you will unintentionally click on links. Because of this, I nearly formatted my micro-SD card.The photo viewer can take up to 30 seconds to load all the photo icons viewable in one page- this is pretty slow and makes it unusable. I'd say a 1/3 of the time when trying to open a photo (5 mp) it crashed. When it finally opened my photos, flipping from photo to photo was relatively smooth.I purchased this mainly as a pdf reader since my phone is too small to read off of. It does have the ability to read pdf's, though not well. The available pdf reader apps from the appslib store (all that you can use rather than the android market) are the worst available. Only 1 pdf reader functioned correctly, and it was only able to read pdf's when opened from the browser. To date, Adobe's reader cannot work on the device, and won't install even if you track down the installation file.The email app works well, whoop-di-doo. So do a few board game apps. Other things you don't care about- its the perfect size for switching between holding in your hand or reading on your lap.Movies and mp3's play really well- HD video (in whatever format the files are when you download them straight from youtube) played perfectly and smoothly (but there is no flash support, so don't think about watching videos on youtube).

It features 8 Mb internal memory, microSD card capability, a beautiful screen, and the Android operating system. It lacks access to the full Android marketplace, has some odd design elements, and (in my experience) has a few quality issues. The device is worth the cost, if it fits your needs.If you want more details, read on!----------I was excited to get this \"home tablet\". It is advertised as being suitable for a person who does not want the inconvenience of a PC / laptop, but needs more than a iPod or other small mobile device.Design:The device is made in France, and it shows in the design elements. It is beautifully made, with a satin steel backing, a large 7 inch wide-aspect screen (720p HD capable), and glossy plastic that somehow does NOT show fingerprints. However it also has some features that may be a bit odd to American consumers. For example, the device charges with a red light, but when charged the light turns YELLOW, not green as one would expect.Archos decided to use a custom USB port, even though there is ample room for a standard mini-USB port. Perhaps it would have spoiled the look of the device. Whatever the reason, a standard port would have made replacing the cable easier.The power system has some odd quirks. The supplied small power unit (with multi-national plugs) fits perfectly into the top round port on the side of the device. Unfortunately, that port is for the earphones! The power port is below the earphone opening; this works fine, but the power plug only goes in about 2/3 of the way, and falls out easily. When plugged in, the device powers on, instead of requiring the user to switch it on. I suppose this is useful in some cases, but it was annoying when all I wanted to do was charge the device - I had to wait for it to power up (about 20 seconds) before I could power it down!Speaking of the earphone port, the included earphones work well and sound nice, but the length of the lines after they split off of the main wire is very short. The wires actually press into my throat a bit, and are almost too short to use. I would expect to buy an aftermarket headphone for this model.The dual built in speakers are barely adequate, and I found them to sound somewhat tinny. OK for most uses, but not spectacular.The device has a support stand to allow it to be propped up for viewing - using one leg. This is not terribly stable, and since the single leg is on the opposite side from the \"menu\" area of the device (upper right corner), it is pretty easy to have the unit come down smartly onto the table or whatever. Caution is advised when using it vertically.The top of the unit sports an on-off-screen lock slide switch which is SHARP, and I don't mean nice looking. It comes to a point on the edge that the user will push, and is uncomfortable to use. There is an indent in the middle of the switch, so those people with fingernails will want to use it that way. Otherwise, be prepared for discomfort when sliding the switch either on or off (the switch has to be held against the force of the spring to function). Right next to the switch is the opening for the MicroSD card. When fully inserted, the card extends about 1/16 of an inch - just enough to make one hit that instead of the power switch. I have no idea why they didn't make it flush with the top surface.The unit gets a bit hot on the bottom when charging, which you will do pretty often - I found the battery to last about 2 hours in most circumstances. You could listen to a lot of music if you switch off the screen, which consumes a lot of power. It gets a bit hot underneath when the unit is charging, a bit less hot when it is running, but nothing too uncomfortable.The device has a resistive screen, which means that one has to push a bit hard to get a response. This is as opposed to the capacitive screen found in the iPhone, for example, which is requires less effort. I found that I had to swipe my finger a couple of times on many occasions to get a response. I don't know if this is due to slow computer response or the screen. It is sufficient for the needs of the device, but may bother some people.The documentation was VERY minimal, just a few pages with some of the basics. It came nowhere near explaining how to use most of the features of the device.Functionality:The device runs Android, which is a Linux derived OS. It works well, but for someone coming from a Windows environment it will take some time to get used to. The home screen has three \"windows\" for holding icons; one swipes the finger left and right to go between screens. A small tab slides out to reveal the applications installed.It plays media files well and synchronizes with the latest Windows Media player - so if you use the media player on your PC, your files will be transferred when you sync.The web browser is a custom built offshoot of Google Chrome, and works OK but is a bit basic. I liked the way they offered a multi-window view of open pages.The device includes access to the Archos \"Applib\", which has maybe 500 applications, and has a number of good games available for download, all free. Other applications are available but not as useful - they are pretty specific in nature. Some of the news programs were interesting, but one can get the same news (and more) off the Web. I found that the left hand side of the AppLib screen had what looks like tabs, but they only occasionally work. The Applib is being updated; I sometimes see new applications, recently including the Dolphin browser (a bit better than the stock one, but not so good as Skyfire).Access to the internet is via WiFi only; no 3G or other capabilities. In some ways this limits the usefulness as a purchase, but it also means there was no need to design in any compromises found in a more mobile device. There is no GPS capability (hopefully you know where you live!).There are some DRAWBACKS to the software:There is no task manager, so I was unable to switch between running applications, unless they were the sort of applications that showed an icon on the top bar (some did, some didn't). The question became how to close those apps. One of the \"AppLib\" programs turned out to be an application that closed other programs. I used it frequently. But overall the device works pretty well.The built-in file manager does not have a way to select multiple files, or any way I could figure out to create folders. One of the downloaded applications did have folder create functionality.The built-in browser will not run flash, and there is no U-tube capability, so many websites would not show video or other content. It is possible to download the SkyFire browser, but one must do a Google search on \"skyfire download to PC\", because almost all websites refer the user to the Android Market to download - which won't work on this device. After that one can click on the download install package. Skyfire does render pages and videos well.I found that many of the .wmv files downloaded from the web would not play on the device, even though they played on my computer. AVI files were fine. It will not play .rm files either. For music, MP3 files were fine.I could not find a way to make the media files go to the mSD card besides manually copying each folder to the card. After that it is possible to refresh the media list and find the files. This is tedious, and there should be a way to default storage to either the internal memory or the external card.The device does not use the latest Android version 2.x, and the CPU is basically adequate, not powerful. I had to wait a few seconds for some applications.There is NO access to the tens of thousands of Android applications in the Android Marketplace, and I was constantly finding web sites that mentioned software that I could not download. This is the biggest problem with the device, in my opinion.The 8 Mb internal storage is laid out such that there is a relatively small partition for the applications. One of my applications was leaving large temporary files in the applications file system, and the device warned me that I was low on memory. The internal memory was over 6 gigabytes - but not available to install programs! Anyway, there will be a hard limit to how many programs can be installed. But with only one \"program\" directory (accessed via a tab interface on the home screen), it would be cumbersome to scroll down to view the programs anyway. The device is designed such that one is expected to create shortcuts on the main desktop to frequently used programs.The email was easy to set up, but only shows about 10 emails at a time before one has to view the next set. I used both IMAP and POP functionality successfully. I didn't seen any capability of Exchange email, but that would not be expected in a home device. The AppLib has an application called K-9 that fixes all the omissions. It supports exchange, but I did not test that.Build quality:The device is pretty heavy for its size, and appears to be solidly constructed. Nevertheless, my unit malfunctioned for a day - it continually brought up the screen to shutdown the device, even though the hardware switch was moving freely and not stuck. I had to use the small reset button on the back to power on the device if I had powered it off. Eventually it stopped doing this, and I was able to use the tablet. So I avoided warranty repair, but now I wonder what else might go wrong. UPDATE: My device kept acting strange, so I finally did a \"hard\" reset to factory conditions. This appears to have fixed the problems.BOTTOM LINE:Is this device worth the cost? Overall I would say yes, if you are looking for this sort of capability at home. I found it quite useful in checking emails and doing basic web browsing. I mostly use the web for shopping, online banking, and news sites, so it fits my needs. I'm not sure I would use it for movies, but for playing music it is nice.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Glimpse of The Future?", "Author": "Jleblan1", "ReviewID": "R3706P46I9L3VD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me begin by saying this a good, but not great product.

If you are looking for something that will work like the Ipad this is not quite it, having said that everything the table is supposed to do like playing videos, music, pictures, reading books, ect. It does it quite well, and it only took me a few minutes to learn how to use it (even adjusting settings and installing apps) or loading media. I was looking for something that would give me a little more than an e-reader and this is exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately I retuned my Archos because there were several issues that I felt would not get resolved by simply exchanging the unit, because even though I'm not 100% sure from what I've been able to read, these problems may extend to more than one single unit. I really wanted to keep the Archos because I do like it a lot and because there isn't anything else out there to replace it with, I hope they come up with a better version of this tablet because I would buy it again.Pros1. Light weight, and the screen size nice2. Screen is very bright and sharp, very good resolution (but very reflective during the day) some people said they had a problem with the responsiveness I didn't feel like that was an issue3. The pre-installed apps worked very well I was able to watch videos, listen to music, and read books without having to install anything else.4. Battery life is not bad if I had to guess it is about as much as stated on the description5. The browser and AppsLib are pretty fast and the whole thing is easy to connect to a router.Cons1. The screen picks up a lot of glair during the day, not good for reading or watching a video outside during the day.2. This version of Android does not support the Android market, even if you download some apps from a different place they may not work with this unit.3. No flash player support, for what I've read there will probably not be any flash player on this item, unless Archos updates the OS which is not likely.( you can use the Skyfire browser but it is not an ideal replacement for flash.4. One issues with the hardware is that, the unit gets pretty hot relatively quick while using it and very hot while charging it which can become uncomfortable.5. My particular unit crashed with the first video I watched, I had to press the reset button to get it going again6. If you watch HD videos (higher than 720 dip the sound doesn't sync well7. It seems the tablet turns on by itself which kills the battery, and you cannot turn it back on even when plugged in, without pressing the reset button.

That being said, it's not a bad little device for the price.As a newbie to Android, I found the interface and browser a little confusing if not intimidating. But, after working with it for a short time, it's not so bad. And, while with the basic browser the Archos 7 (running Android 1.5) comes with cannot run Flash - which means no video sites like Youtube, a download of the Skyfire browser fixes all of that. Setting up the device to store and remember email accounts is fairly easy as well.Downloading and installing applications is a little more complex than expected. It seems that most application creators for mobile devices aren't very clear on specifications and installing procedures. And, the technical support at Archos, or seeming lack thereof, as well as various user forums, are not very helpful.  So, it takes a lot of experimentation and guesswork right off the bat.The Archos 7's video playback quality is very nice. And, unlike many other portable devices, the large LCD screen is a major crowd pleaser.  And, with the 7 inch screen comes larger versions of web-based content and a virtual keyboard that unlike most mobile devices and smart phones, is actually adequate for typing. The large LCD also allows for great picture viewing and the ability to setup photo slideshows much like you would with a digital picture frame.The touch screen itself is of mediocre quality. In some cases it is too sensitive but for the most part it may take several touches or a heavy push to read the command it is given.And finally, on the multimedia front, what gadget would be complete without a music player? Undoubtedly the best asset of this little machine is its sound quality. It's impeccable! I've personally never found any device better in this regard and feel that I would be hard pressed to do so.Pros Overview:Affordable.Amazing sound quality.Very good photo and video display.Great size overall.Holds a charge for a long time.Some very good bonuses inside the box - 35 free mp3s and outlet adapters for different regions among them.Cons Overview:The base browser and interface leave a lot to be desired.The touch screen is not as reactive as it could be.Long charging time.The support stand it very difficult to pull out for the first time.Technical support is horrid.", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not ready,and rushed to market", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R2HU3CTD33NTZN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first one I received had a cracked screen.

My first impression was that the build good quality and design. For what you pay for this unit its awesome. The screen is not the best I have seen, but not to bad either. The tablet is not super fast, but it does what its supposed to do ok. If I need speed I will use my laptop. It does not include apps like facebook or twitter from the start, but there is no problem finding the apk files on the internet and installing it on your own. Archos version of the market is tragic. It does not have much good apps and is badly designed. But again, you can find about any apk file on the internet.The biggest disappointment with this tablet is that even if it has 8 gb internal memory. You can only use about 30mb of this for apps. The rest of the 8gb is used for a virtual memory card. I was totally bummed out by this. I know this is a problem on android phones with older version of android. But this thing has 8 gb internal memory. Why could not Archos give us 200 - 300 mb for apps. There would still be much space left.The touch screen is a old technology and is not really responsive. So you must get used to clicking 2 - 3 times before something happens some times.Looks like most of what I write is negative. But for what you pay for this unit I still think its money well spent. If you're going to use this for basic web surfing, reading ebooks, watching videos and playing music, this is a good buy. If you want a tablet to have 300 apps and games installed on it, I would not go for this tablet.

Combine the slow speed with the very unresponsive hit or miss touch screen and you have a recipe for frustration. Page scroll flicks can be misread as selections and other times are just ignored. Touch a tab and maybe it'll go to that tab and maybe it won't.What it does do well is play youtube videos and it does a pretty good job with web surfing if you're not in a hurry. My internet connection is fast enough to take full advantage of 802.11g wireless but surfing is far from snappy. The screen is pretty darn good for its size and excellent for the price of the product, but virtual keyboard input can be a little frustrating. It works but takes a bit of patience.

I get 2 to 3 hours usage from the battery,even with wifi enabled. I was shocked to find out that the tablet lacks Google Market,but the Appslib store and downloadable Slideme market have good enough apps for me. Mind you Appslib needed a good update.I even found a working Youtube app. Although the ads say it has Youtube it doesn't out the box. But on the web you can find a working app of Youtube.Another thing that shocked me is you can not add alot of apps to the device. It only has 24mb of internal RAM for apps sadly in Cupcake. This I hate.I added only my fave apps to the device anyway.And lastly another thing I hate is the device will freeze up from time to time if you use more than one app at a time ,even though it has a 600mhz processor.It is similar to my old Nokia 770 Internet Tablet I had. It had a 400mhz processor and 128 of RAM and 2 gigs of storage. The Archos has 8 gigs of space and 256mb of RAM.So it is faster.My other ePad has a 600mhz Via processor and 256 of RAM. About the same.The battery has died on my ePad though and I have to use it plugged into the power.Touch screen on the tablet is not too bad,but you have to force it at times. Although if you use a fingernail it is better. It lacks multi-touch but I hardly use that anyway. It lacks a webcam for video chat but does allow for audio chat.All in all,the Archos is not bad. It has a decent music player,Aldiko ebook reader is ok,video player is ok,and if that isn't enough there are custom Roms with more RAM and even Market.For the price it is a stable device.If you can live with the occasional freeze up and only a small amount of apps ,than it is ok.I highly recommend using a custom Rom with the tablet.I think I made a wise decission buying this.I got a better tablet than my old Nokia 770 and it has better battery than my ePad.Still this is not a iPad.

It's mostly not that difficult to set it up, go online, that sort of thing, thanks to the very helpful instruction booklet anyway. However, as many have said, its best use is for watching videos. Trouble is, your videos have to be the right format. That means you may have to convert some of them by getting a video conversion program. As it turns out, there aren't many videos I am able to convert, either. It would be awesome if you could watch all the DVDs you buy on your Archos, but they are fixed so that you cannot convert them. Some people know how or have the equipment to be able to get around this, but not myself. All I can use the Archos for is watching material I once downloaded from file sharing programs. I guess you could transfer most bootleg DVDs too. Folks talk about watching YouTube on their Archos. That would be very pleasing to me, but the Archos 7 doesn't come ready to do this and you have to find a way to get around that too. I still haven't figured it out. So, basically, I'm very limited to what I can do with my Archos. I can look at pictures and a very small selection of videos that I converted and transferred to the Archos by my computer. It's neat, but it could be a lot neater. Being able to watch YouTube at least would make me very happy. At least I can check my e-mail and surf the net for text stuff. Anyway, the package is great if you are tech savvy and can work around those problems. It comes with a recharger and USB chord, and also a set of ear buds. Over all, it's cool, but I wouldn't be too happy if I had paid the full price for it since I haven't gotten around the YouTube problem yet.

After extensive testing by my two teenagers and I, the best uses for it are as a movie viewer and a primitive game machine (focus on primitive like \"connect the dots\").Pros:Nice screen size for personal viewing of pre-loaded movies. (NOT over the net since the link is too slow and there is no flash)Accepts SDHC flash cards so it is straightforward to load aforementioned movies from your PC or Mac.The screen does look good (but not super)It has an integral \"kick stand\" to prop it up on a table in landscape modeThere is an apps web site and many of the apps are free. (Con: you wouldn't want to pay for most of them anyways)Included email and browser functions nomincally work, but ... (See below)Cons:The touch screen is a bit insensitive - barely tolerable. It can, and periodically needs to be, calibrated.The user interface is occasionally frustrating. Even after customizing it, there are items that don't end up being intuitively accessible.The wi-fi is slow. It feels like 802.11b. I don't know if the issue is the link itself or the processor, but it's faster to browse the net on my Blackberry Tour.The processor never feels snappy. For instance, photos display acceptably fast, but just barely. If you use this as a photo viewer, make sure you trim the photos to the Archos screen size because you don't want to wait for this baby to re-scale he photos as you view them. It will be just too slow.The power charger plug is not well attached and falls out a little too easily. It falls out easily enough that this is NOT just a safety issue to keep it from being dragged off the table, it's too loose.The Archos does not play flash, and it doesn't do Quicktime, and it has other format limitations for sound, movies and photos. If you are not a bit computer handy, you are going to be pretty limited. If you are handy, you are going to end up doing a fair number of format conversions.Does not support Mac. You have to transfer files using an SDHC reader/write or use the whole unit as a mass storage device connected to the Mac's USB port.The included headphones are of poor quality and should have been excluded and traded off for a motion sensor or camera capability or something we care about.The browser is vestigial. I ended up downloading Opera Mini v5 beta to replace the included one. Opera's caching system for mobile devices makes the Archos seem acceptably fast for many popular pages. Of course, if it's not a cached page, it's back to slow, slow, slow again ... The included browser is so bad, I would only use it once to help download Opera MiniThe email application works, and is just better than nothing. If you get five emails a day, it would be fine. If you get a 100 emails a day, this is just not going to work for you. One example: you can only select or delete ONE email at a time.BEST FOR LAST!! THIS THING CRASHES A LOT! It crashes enough that you will not want to rely on it for typing long emails, etc. Like I said earlier, not a bad photo and movie viewer, as long as you convert them to one of the formats this supports.SummaryThe Archos sells for about $200. Save the money for something better, like an iPad ($500). Or, get an iPod touch. Heck, you could get a laptop on sale for $399 with Windows and get more functionality as well as a better game and movie experience. Of course, it wouldn't be as portable as the Archos 7, but it is more likely to work and be able to be adapted to what you want to do.For our part, this item is being used as a movie viewer and to play \"connect the dots\", but it would have been returned for credit if it was not received as part of the Vine reviews program.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could have been nice", "Author": "M.

The touch screen does not support multi-touch.Lacks an accelerometer so it only works in fixed orientations.The Wifi required SSID Broadcasting to be enabled to connect to any network, even when hard coding the network info, and the reception was absolutely terrible even when 2 feet away from  my router.

The Archos media player is probably the only good part, because it works well, indexes media nicely, and adds support for file formats not normally supported in Android.Sadly, that is where the \"good\" ends - the screen is dreadful, the touch portion is a hassle, the kickstand is a weak piece of plastic, and the USB host feature requires an additional cable.Performance is sluggish, the Archoslib market is a very poor replacement for the Google Android market (which you can't load onto it) and the selection of available apps is poor. Yes - you can load your own apps onto the device, but why put more effort into this?I do think Archos deserves praise for the Archos 7 - and I think Android has a future on tablets, just not products from Archos. They have a poor history of product support, and they tend to abandon products very quickly (just ask anyone with an Archos 9).The worst part of the Archos 7 is the Android 1.5 operating system - seriously, you are over a year behind the trend with this, and lose out on a bunch of features. And sadly, knowing Archos, you'll never see this thing move on to anything beyond 1.6.All in all - you really do get what you pay for. There are not many alternatives (other than the $[...] one I mentioned), but there are many on their way.

Unfortunately this is also it's down side. With this ability many manufacturers put out cheap crappy hardware and hope people with buy it up and make a quick profit. However the consumer then considers the OS and the hardware to be one and the same and Android ends up with the bad rap.

At the time, the reviews were mixed, but I went ahead and thought I would save my dad a few bucks and put this on my list.We went to Best Buy to look at one in store.  The store model would not turn on.  The sales rep told me they had some trouble with the sample model due to \"in store abuse\" and he was calling tech support.  I went to a different Best Buy and that store's sample worked.  It seemed to be a decent option for the money.  I should have taken that as a warning...Well, I received it yesterday on Christmas day.  I charged the battery and used it for 2.5 hours.  Then, the options for shut down just appeared... I repeatedly hit \"cancel\" and it continued to pop up...  I then finally said \"shut down\" and that is the last time it turned on.  So, after 2.5 hours of simple use (I didn't even download any apps...), I had a $200 paper weight.I promptly returned it to my local Best Buy this morning... and by the looks of the other reviews, I am not the only one.I have learned, Tablets are indeed \"You Get What You Pay For\".

If you are interested try appslib.com and slideme.org to view applications available before you buy.The Archos 7 is light, quite sizable and serves my needs for surfing net late at night without having to boot up my laptop.  Its also great for checking email although typing is quite cumbersome on the android keyboard.The apps make it handy, I like to check the weather, check whats on at the movies and stuff like that.It can also play video and music and display photos.  All these functions I use on a fairly regular basis.So for my needs its perfect: surfing the net, checking mail, listening to music, showing off pics of the family and using a handful of favorite applications.What makes it really neat and the main reason i bought was to read ebooks which I borrow from my public library and read.  The are in ePub format and are DRM protected.  I looked through appslib and slideme and found several ebook readers and ebook downloads (including wheel of time my fav); however, there was no kindle, no adobe digital editions, and no nook.  So I was stumped, until I went to the overdrive media console website which is the software my library recommended.  I used my ARchos 7 internet to browse to the site, clicked on the android download for overdrive media console for ebooks, and installed the application.  It installed perfectly, I opened it browsed to my library [...] and downloaded the 3 ebooks from my account. Books installed fine.  Overdrive does audio books too, which my library also offers.The only other negative thing about the Archos 7 is the learning curve using the screen, initially i would keep clicking on something when I was trying to drag the touch screen.  It was a little frustrating, but it got easier and now its hardly a problem at all.

They really limited you to only a few small things to enjoy, including a small amount of APS.It will not become a toy for our 3 year old, as he has fallen in love with his sister's Ipod touch.  but again we have hit a snag as it seems to say we have to space left but we have virtually nothing on the device-  It is CRAP.....*******I am a not very techie person, my hubby is a techie type.We also do not own any smartphonesDay one thoughts...Out of the box, it looks realy nice and was A comfortable size to hold.It started up and ran quickly.It was easy to navigate around the apps screen, and was easy to connect the Wi-Fi.Once I started playing around though I seemed to hit walls of limits right away.The \"radio\" that comes with it, deezer is useless IMO.I found once I started trying to go to websites I would freuently get errors.DOing a little research I discvered Downloading Skyfire to the device seemed to be a key to getting past these limits.I found out to DL the APK version to your computer first and then drag it into your Archos file while it is connected to the computer.Install it and VOILA the web is now open and ready to use. (my first day and I was enjoying the Vevo website featured on Skyfire).Skyfire lets you view websites in desktop OR mobile format.Hubby pointed out that too bad they did not make this a 3G item like my Kindle is.  That way you can surf the internet from anywhere not just YOUR Wi-FI spot, or trying to find hotspots.Before DL skyfire he was realy disappointed with the tablet as a truely mobile internet device.  It would only be good for DL your own music videos, ebooks, or apps, I was OK with it being good for that, but skyfire really gave it that extra enjoyment.I think it is worth the time to find help sites for the Archos 7 to help you get as much as you can out of this little device.I do find surfing the internet a little frustrating as what you would think is a \"home\" button on the top left brings you back to the multimeda page not an internet home page.This is also where the \"cranky\" touch screen can be a bit ummmmm irratating.Yes the touchscreen can be a bit \"cranky\", my first touchscreen device so I am still happy.My next goal is to figure out how to get some movies or shows on here for my 3 year old to watch while we are out and about..  That is something totally new for me.Update:Still trying to get mpeg 4 videos to play on my device.

Nothing I did could make it see any file on the card not even installing them via the sdcard folder in internal memory.Then there was the touch screen.  I knew beforehand it was a resistive screen, not capacitive, and that was fine with me.  What was NOT fine was the unresponsiveness of the screen.

Lack of volume rocker. Thats done by software only, ugly icons on the top of the screen. No real buttons. The menu, back, search, and home are also touchscreen only. If the particular app you are using doesnt display them you will be locked into it forever.Widescreen only. No accelerometer to tell it you switched orientation. And no software control to tell it to go portrait.The lock/power on button is solid. It has an easy access microSD slot, which is good if you plan on playing movies.The thing is heavy, even for its size. Should be more high grade plastic and less metal. Metal is fine on my Droid because the whole device is so small. On the Archos its a pain.Turned it on and asked for a calibration but the touch screen is junk anyway. Calibrating frequently fails and even after doing it, the screen often misreads my taps. Resistive and not terribly accurate. Typing on the virtual keyboard is a nightmare. No way I'd use thing thing for regular email.No gmail app, just the regular email app and all accounts must be set up manually. Reader looks meh. Can see attachments but cant download them. Thing is too big to comfortably use the virtual keyboard either one handed or two handed. And since theres no way to get 3rd party apps I will be stuck with their crummy keyboard.Screen is horrid. Only 480x800 which is worse than my Droid. Poor color as well looks like low quality 16 or 18 bit. Default wallpapers are OK and you better like them cuz it doesnt seem to want to allow downloaded jpg's as wallpapers. The stupid photo frame and photo viewer apps work poorly. Touch screen hangs up a lot, rarely registers my clicks. Many apps hiccup when they load so I cant tell if the thing is frozen or if it just didnt know I wanted it to do something.Web browser is painful and slow, I dont think it is getting max use out of my wifi and the page renderer is garbage. My Droid is much faster. Over wifi, pages that take 10 seconds to load on my Droid take almost a minute on the Archos. Can download pics but its clunky. Wallbase.net is way too heavy for it, frequently freezes. But I got a couple nice widescreen pics. Now I just have to figure out how to make the image viewer use them as wallpapers. I may need to go back to the home screen to do it.Youtubes web page does not work for vids, but thankfully I can see plenty of ads.No app for Youtube in the Archos App Library either. Archos claims this thing supports 802.11 b/g/n but stuff loads too slowly for it to be any faster than b.I can download mpg's and WMV's and WMA's and more, but the player cant run any of them. They advertise this unit specifically as a media player. Do they expect me to convert everything I own to the two formats they do support? That micro Zune player I tried out last month had better file support than this thing.The apps page is limited to some basic multimedia stuff and rotten games and a really rotten newspaper program. No Market so I dont know why they gave me that warning at boot up about how my experience may be different with 3rd party apps.Playing around in the settings menu I noticed there isnt nearly as much as on a real Android device. No password that I can find. No way to see which version of Android I have, though looking at the stupid Tab it has to be 1.5 or 1.6. No way to check for system updates so I guess Archos planned for this thing to stay as it is without any support.Not impressive. I'd rather have a superior smartphone than an inferior tablet. There is nothing good about this device except for the large screen and since it has fewer colors and lower resolution, its not a benefit but a liabiltiy. The lower res and poor color on a bigger screen is so much more obvious. Cant do much for multimedia so its no good to take on car trips. Cant play any vids or stream them so its not an entertainment system at all, (despite the claims on their website)If it were faster, more stable, and easier to use it would be a decent news/weather/email device but those functions are poorly implemented as well. If it weighed less I'd be inclined to take it around to show people how crummy it is, but I dont even feel like doing that. If it were much smaller like my phone it would be OK for taking to the gym, since music apparently does work.Games arent fun because its not good for two handed use or easy for one handed. They put the speaker right where your hands normally hold it so you cant hear much anyway. Moving images look horrible in games. The few video that do play look rotten and stutter constantly.Recommend everyone avoid. It was a nice experiment because it was on sale. But theres not much here even as a novelty. If anyone ever gets a tablet make sure it comes with Honeycomb 3.0 and full support of the regular android Market. Or Android 2.3 at a minimum. Also, hardware buttons are nice too. And the ability to shift between landscape and portrait. I did eventually install a custom firmware to unlock the official Market, but given not much works on Android 1.5 that wasnt a huge improvement. Dug around the internet for a long time and no one has bothered to improve CPU speed on this unit or make a firmware that allows later Android versions to be installed.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste your time with this tablet", "Author": "Jax2FOE", "ReviewID": "R1FAC5ZFI8MF1L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet is only good to surf the web, watch movies and listen to music.

I suspect most if not all 5 star reviews are from people that want this unit to have higher ranking.  Look all that recommendations and how many negative recommendation I got.$199 price might have been pretty good but now there's tons of alternative android tablet such as m001 zto apad epad iped etc. which are cheaper.  Funny thing is it seems all of them are unreliable.  For example zto was on amazon for few weeks and no company is selling it now.  m001(and relabeled units)are getting bad reviews too.Lucky for me, I bought 8.9\" cinepal for replacement.  It does not have internet, but it is solid and work very good as video player.  I have many computers, netbook, and smart phone so don't really need internet with it.  If you want a video player go for cinepal.If you want internet tablet, wait until android 2.2+ tablets with 512mb ram if you do not like over priced ipad or convertible tablet netbook.Dell mini 5 \"streak\" is 5\" tablet/smart phone for ATT coming out later this summer too.Some people thinks usb charging is good idea.  I think it does not make any sense for a HOME tablet. Usb is not design to dish out lots of power so even in ideal condition it might take 6-10 hour to charge which is not desirable for most people.
