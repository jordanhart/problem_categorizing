[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

This will be the third kindle in my household. I currently own a basic e-reader kindle and my fiance has the second generation kindle fire. Let me just say, this one blows all the rest completely out of the water. The display is sharp, the speakers are simply amazing, and the performance is outstanding for the price.Display:The display is crystal clear and is full HD. Just think about that for a second; it has the same resolution as any full size HDTV! On a 7in screen, it really shines. If you hold this side by side to an ipad mini, the display on the fire HDX wins hands down not only in resolution and color, but also clarity.Speakers:This is what impressed me the most about this tablet..... The speakers: Full Dolby HD that have great bass and a nice clear sound. These speakers are better than most laptop speakers. They go loud enough to fill a room and do not lose any of the sound quality.Performance:Performance (at least in my experience) is on par with the current generation ipads. My parents have an iPad and the fire HDX is just as responsive and snappy. No doubt this is due to the new chipset inside. Gone are the days of stutter, missed taps, and lagging swipes. The HDX even does multi-tasking (something that was missing of fire's and fire HD's of past).Battery:I've gotten all day use out of it. Based on my estimates, I will meet the time Amazon advertises, based on my daily usage of games, web browsing, and music. The fire HDX comes with a power cord!!! (Finally!!!). However, this power cord is just adequate. It's only a 5W charger instead of the 9W. As long as you don't need to use the HDX and charge it at the same time, the supplied charger is good. It takes almost all night to fully charge w/ the 5W included adapter. If you're a heavy tablet user, I'd buy the 9W charger.Mayday:This is the best feature of this tablet. It works just as you see on tv! I had an issue setting up part of my HDX. I hit the mayday button, and 10 seconds later I was chatting with a live person! I was shocked that it was exactly as you see on TV! This is perfect for anyone who is new to kindle, or to the world of tablets. I can see this being a definite benefit.Overall:The fire HDX is the best kindle to date. The performance is second to none, the display is great, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a tablet, and the mayday feature is icing on the cake! I think the price is right on the mark for what you get. It's a great value tablet and a great performing tablet all in one.One note of caution:The charging port is on an angle and if you're not careful, I could see this being an issue down the line. If you try to lay the HDX screen side down, you will bend and put stress on the charging cable.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big bang for your buck", "Author": "Kendall Giles",

the buck, the Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033.Here's what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033 tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3\u2033 x 5.0\u2033 x .35\u2033, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920\u00d71200 pixels, the 7\u2033 screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream\" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 \"Mojito\", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24\u00d77, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "BATTERY DOESNT LAST, AMAZON.COM SENDS REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT", "Author": "Jeanne D Day", "ReviewID": "R33FG0IPX75104", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This kindle fire HDX has not held a charge since it arrived early December.

Ricucci", "ReviewID": "R1DBW18TQ7Z7ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 11 days of using the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB -- and now editing slightly thanks to a couple of helpful Amazoners:What I LIKE about the HDX:- Slim, light, more mobile & easier to handle than the Fire HD which was heavy/unwieldy for my arthritic hands- Gorgeous display, crisp and beautiful- Easy setup, very simple even for a senior lady like me- This model includes a charger. Yay!! (The Fire HD did not come with a charger.)- Responds quickly, very intuitive- Email program is great, nicely laid out & easy to set up all my accounts -- my Mac account, my MS Exchange work account, my Gmail accounts- As an Amazon Prime member, I have a huge selection of movies, TV & music available at no additional cost- It's just a smooth operation, does what I want it to do simply and very quicklyWhat I DON'T LIKE about the HDX:- No way to know when device is fully charged; no green light as on other Kindles; you have to turn it on and unlock to see whether it's fully charged- Speakers on the back means you have to be careful and aware of which way you're holding the device so your hand isn't covering one of the speakers; I don't think the placement is all that great.- The micro USB port at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, is at an odd angle. Often when I go to charge the device, it takes me a couple of tries to get the plug into the port. Seems strange, something which could have been done better.I really like the Fire HDX, much better than the Fire HD and I know I will very much enjoy it. As an all-around device for music, videos, email, web browsing, games, keeping up with news/weather/sports on-the-go, etc., I can definitely recommend the HDX. It's not perfect (does anyone know a device which is?) but if the HDX does what you need, you will love it!UPDATE on 12/5/13 -- I've now had the device for about 6 weeks and am using it heavily, much more than my previous Kindle. It keeps surprising me in terms of the things it will do and the way it fits into my work & leisure needs. I don't know if I just got lucky, but I swear there is no blue haze on my screen. BOTTOM LINE: I'm very happy with the HDX. Now if I could just discipline myself to put it down....", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet For the Amazon Ecosystem", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RBHK0EOJ7QRS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Amazon Ecosystem.  I buy my movies from Amazon Instant Video, I pay for the Cloud Music service, and I've been a Kindle reader since the first generation.  I've had iPads, Nexus and Surface tablets, and while they offer most of the Amazon services through various Apps, none are as cohesive as the Kindle Fire.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this years model, as I absolutely loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 last year, but I wanted a smaller tablet, and the specs this time around were rather impressive.The first thing I noticed about the Kindle Fire HDX was not the screen (although it is rather impressive), but the weight.  Make no mistake, this tablet is thin, and this tablet is light.  It makes movie watching and reading a pleasure, even one handed for a long period of time.The screen - a nice upgrade over last years model, it's bright, vivid and the text is crisp, which is helpful, especially for reading.  I did not notice any blue hue that some people complain about.The sound - I didn't notice a huge quality difference over last year (and I liked last year's), but moving the speakers to the top of the device and slanting them makes a huge difference, especially since I hold my tablet and the bottom and would constantly cover last years.Speed - I noticed a huge speed increase over last years model.  The interface is fast and fluid, and I have not noticed any slow down so far.What I don't like, or what they could improve upon:Rear facing camera - I was hoping the 7\" model would have one like the 8.9, but not so.  I use my tablet for Skype so the grandparents can see their 2 year old grandchild, and it's much easier to use the rear camera to chase her around the room, so I was a little bummed about that.  Hopefully next year.HDMI out - I was disappointed to see it didn't make it into this years model.  I travel quite a bit, so it was nice to hook the Kindle Fire up to the Hotel's TV and relax at night.  I bought the NETGEAR PTV3000 to use the Miracast Feature, but it would have been nice to use the cable I already had.Apps - It has most of the ones I'd want on a tablet, but access to Google Play would be nice (without rooting)Long story short (too late), if you live in the Amazon Ecosystem, this is a great tablet, especially for the price.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Longer A Huge Fan of Amazon Nor Kindles", "Author": "HK", "ReviewID": "R2S0EAN0Y6ZSPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my fifth kindle.  I have also owned the original kindle fire and loved it til it suddenly stopped charging- even after I was very careful in taking care of it and did not use it extensively.  Kindle support informed me that some of the original kindles had this issue.  When I heard the new kindle fire hdx was coming out I had high hopes that Amazon would have solved the issue of the battery port giving out prematurely, but within a month of receiving it, I started experiencing the same issue on my new kindle fire hdx!  Sometimes it would charge, other times it wouldn't.  I was so disappointed in this similar repeat of history, I decided that I would simply return it for a refund and not risk more money wasted, so I put it aside and stopped using it.  My biggest mistake was waiting for the hustle of the busy holidays to pass before calling Amazon thinking Amazon is so great with returns, another few weeks shouldn't be an issue!  My other mistake was not realizing the interpretation of their one year warranty was completely up to the whim of their representatives.  Their one year limited warranty states as some options, that a new device may be given as a replacement, and also that refunds may be given- and does not state when or when not.  I fully trusted that Amazon would come through for one of their loyal prime customers; I mean we've all read about Amazon's great customer service in the past and in others' reviews!  However, my New Year has now been completely soured by my latest experience with Amazon, and I will never view Amazon nor it's kindle products the same ever again.  On New Year's Day I called and asked for a refund because this had been my second experience with kindle fires having charging/ battery port issues, and it happening again to such a new product that had just came out- I didn't want an exchange until I was sure this would not happen again.  They refused me a refund because my thirty days had passed.  In the end after several more requests for a refund, I settled for an exchange of a product I no longer trusted in.  The order invoice said a new kindle hdx was on its way, and I was willing to give it a second try because what other option did I have?  I packed up my new condition kindle with its power charger and the original box- thinking what a shame- still brand new if it wasn't for the charging issue, and dropped it off at UPS.  Today the replacement arrived.  I was so disappointed and shocked to open the amazon box and find no packaging at all including, no original kindle box, and just a refurbished kindle without even a charger- just a dusty cord!!  I had sent everything that came with my kindle in its still new box back to Amazon!  Not only had I received a refurbished kindle as opposed to a new one when I had only owned my new generation kindle hdx for a little over two months (I received it at the end of October), but now I felt like I got an even shabbier deal because Amazon didn't even have the decency to  package my replacement in its original box with a fully working charger!  When I called customer service I was upset for the above reasons, and one of the kindle support reps spoke to me in a very patronizing tone and yelled at me and threatened to stop helping me if I continued to be upset.  The biggest reason for my upset and frustration was because I had really trusted that Amazon would be reasonable and willing to work with me and help me out.  Every time I was put on hold was a ten to twenty plus minutes wait and in the end, the \"higher ups\" were also completely unwilling to help me - still no refund or no promise of a new kindle, just \"a repeat of \"no we can't\" , \"no we can't\"... \"We can't issue a refund\"even though if I had received the new kindle just even a little later when it was expected to ship out, I may have qualified for the extended holiday return policy that starts with November shipments. The patronizing agent told me it was my fault for not reading the whole email sent with the label which would have told me to keep all of the accessories and only send the device- why would I keep the accessories when I thought I was getting a new replacement?!  And how is that ethical to keep part of the product? When I went back to my original email later, I did not see any small print about keeping the box and all the accessories, though I did fimd on the amazon website that it is not necessary to send in the charger or manual.  I would still think a refurbished electronic device would come paired with a charger if it was originally offered with the device?!  The friendlier agent I spoke with on New Year's promised that Amazon always takes care of its customers, so don't worry- if I have further issues with the replacement to just call back.  At that time, I ended the call still agreeing with him about Amazon looking out for its customers.  And even on that day, I had called - expecting a full refund, and though not getting it, believed Amazon would at least replace a two month old bestselling device with a new product for a very disappointed customer.  However, today after an hour long run around and dismissals and no one willing to truly work with me, I am no longer a fan of Amazon.  It's too bad because I used to rave about Amazon and kindles and what I believed was true about Amazon customer service being one of the best out there.  When customer service stops coming through for you or the company stops caring about its individual customers, it's time to stop believing in its products.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous device, but some things you should know....", "Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2ROLCJAJ0O1C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device is a breathtaking movie watching device, but falls short in other areas.  Some will feel like \"nits,\" but I wanted to mention them, since they were surprising to me, and they are things you should know:Screen:  Gorgeous.  Movies are breathtaking, full of depth.Movie watching:  While watching a movie (streaming or downloaded), you can tap the screen, hold the progress bar, and scroll forward/backward in the film with a preview screen which shows you exactly where you'll land when you release your touch on the screen.  Great!  XRay for movies is also a nice feature, and in some cases, gives you \"goofs\", so you can check out the filming mistakes on your own!Sound: Incredible.  For movie viewing, this is really like having a mini theater in your lap.  I stand the device in an old Kindle Fire cover so that the sound is projected towards the front by the folded back cover.  It feels like you are in a theater.  This is the first device I've ever used (been satisfied with the sound) without headphones, and if you aim the sound toward you, it's stunning.  I've watched about four films, and I wouldn't think of using headphones with this device.Mayday: Great feature.  I used it twice.  I had an agent available in less than a minute, and they stuck with me until the issues were resolved.Setup/Glitches: I had one hang up/reboot.  Your device will do a software update while booting for the first time, which takes at least 10 minutes.  Note:  I have some video enhanced Kindle books.  They would not run on this device, however, they ran on my older Kindle Fire, hence one of my calls to Mayday.  I expect there will be some inconsistency in older/newer generation devices with some materials.Storage:  16G is really 10.6G, so expect it to go quickly.  I would order the 32G if I were ordering again.Downloads:  A nice feature.  I downloaded a couple of short television episodes in order to test this.  The downloads took longer than expected, however, based on my service and typical download times.Why I didn't give it five stars:The high definition of the device makes some text and images too small to see/read, so this is not a viable web browsing device for me.Integration/Intrusion: Great for Amazon, not so great for the user/device owner.  I'm very disappointed in one thing: When you download a book sample and try to read it, there is a yellow button in the bottom third of the screen that says:  Buy Now.  When you purchase a book, a bar/box appears across the bottom third of the screen (when reading) asking you to try the audiobook (similar button)...and the audiobook sample is already downloaded to your device!  This is:  1. very intrusive to the reading experience.  The bar/box blocks a portion of the book's text (the bottom third of the page).  You have to tap the screen to remove it.  Also, if each time you download a book, you are downloading an Audible sample, this is simply a sales tactic at the expense of unnecessary bloat to the storage on your device.  This is really disappointing from a company that understands exactly what the purity of a reading device should be. I find these sales pitches in the middle of my reading experience to be annoying!Reading:  Not great on this device.  There is a purplish border around the screen when reading which I find fatigues my eyes.  I read easily on my iPad, Kindle Fire Gen 2, even the new Paperwhite.  This will not be my first choice for a reading device.Form factor:  Very nice, and easy to hold, except for one thing:  the micro USB plug is at an angle to the device.  It is very difficult to insert the plug on my device, and also difficult to remove.  I'm not sure about the viability of that connector in light of the force needed to insert and remove it.No Battery Indicator light:  This may seem like a small thing, but I find it very annoying.  When you plug in the device, there is no indicator light to tell you when the battery is charged.  I couldn't believe it!  In order to know if the device is charged, you have to turn on the device, and check the screen.  I called Mayday to confirm this, since I simply thought I was missing it.  Now when I plug the device in, I check to see when the plug loses its heat to know that it's charged.  Seems ridiculous to me.Overall:It really depends on what you want to use this device for.  As a pure movie absorbing device, it's 6 stars!I recommend ordering with more memory.  I was going to order the Kindle Fire HD with 16G of storage.  Then, I realized that the price difference after upgrading the memory in the low end device was only $60 to the 7 inch HDX with 16G, so I decided to go with it, in light of the many other differences in the specs.  I think that was the right decision, but I don't expect the memory to go very far in light of the other issues I've mentioned.I need to do more reading, and check the device connector, and keep an eye on the memory before deciding whether or not to keep the device.

Kindle was already a part of my life, it made the books and therefore my contact with the English language (which is not my mother tongue) easier for me. Since I had so much personal content on it, I felt as if someone invaded my private life and totally messed up my little daily rituals.Although I reported it to the police and had Amazon freeze my old device for me (I can't thank them enough for their promptness), it did not turn up, so my husband and I decided to buy this new one. It has just arrived today, but from what I've seen so far this one is much, much better.My first impulse was to look at the books (by the way, it came with the majority of the books on my account already installed, which is again something I am thankful to Amazon for) and the screen seems better than the old one. To be honest, that was my main concern - I was a bit nervous as I knew it was smaller than my old Kindle Fire, but it turned out ok. I even went outside and read with the sunset reflecting on my screen and everything was easily readable.The second thing that I noticed about it was the speed - not only it's much faster and I downloaded all my music and some of my videos in a heart bit, but I'm also extremely happy that my Jillian Michaels exercise routines are downloadable and can be played off-line - now I will be less upset when our Internet company schedules their maintenance!The sound, as far as I'm concerned, is clear too, and I don't mind the way they put their off and on and volume buttons in the back - I got accustomed to them very quick.I also like the fact that the device is now compatible with Youtube videos, that used to be a constant source of frustration for me on the old one. Back then having a kindle seemed to me like setting your priorities - I wanted to choose my books over the youtube content, and I had to deal with not being able to play many other things. Now I don't have to make that choice anymore; this kindle incorporates the amazing Amazon reader and a tablet. That is very nice and I don't think there's anything similar on the market at the price!I haven't tried the apps or the games enough to comment on them, but I will update my review if I find it necessary. Maybe I'll find something negative to say, although that's very unlikely :PIn other words, thank you Amazon, I love my new device! I'm glad in a way that I had a reason to buy this one right off after it came out!Update 10.25.13: It's been two days since I got the Kindle and I'm still perfectly content with it. I've seen people around complaining about the blue / purple haze around its border - in all honesty, I had to read their reviews to realize it's there. And now that I see it, I think it really gives more depth to the screen. It doesn't impede my reading at all, on the contrary...I've also downloaded some of their games and apps and everything runs smoothly.I even used the Mayday button once; as I expected the Amazon specialist was impeccable in their reply and helped me immediately. However, the Kindle is so easy to use that there's almost no need for Mayday :)I still think this is the best device you can get out there for the price. Go for it and you won't regret it!Update: 11.06.2013 While trying to Skype on the new Kindle, I found out that this one is a little too sensitive to movement compared to the previous model. Every time I moved the camera it would make a clicky sound and the image would freeze. Somehow I have the feeling that the way it receives the Internet signal is slower or something of the sort. The former Kindle seemed a little better with that I didn't have any problems moving the camera while talking on Skype.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sublime!", "Author": "Travel Fan", "ReviewID": "R2KDJ0C1SL0DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a chance to enjoy my new Kindle HDX 64GB, Wi-Fi only for a few days now. The packaging was great and worry free. I could tell that Amazon took care to make sure that my new toy would arrive safely. My first Kindle was a keyboard kindle which I loved. However, when the previous generation HD came out, I could not resist the call to enjoy color again. I had missed seeing my book covers/pictures in color. I loved all the HD had to offer, the games, internet browsing and being able to check my email while on travel. It was a great little device, but alas, when the HDX came out, it just had a little more of what I was looking for. I bought it for the lighter weight, the extended battery life, higher resolution, etc.. the same reasons everyone else bought one. I traded in my HD with Amazon and this is where I have to praise Amazon for their excellent customer service. My mother had also asked me to trade in her HD along with mine, so we sent them in one package. We followed instructions, submitted the trade in and waited patiently. After two weeks, I could see that they had received the package, but nothing was happening. After contacting Amazon, they responded within the hour and discovered that apparently our items had somehow been lost. At any rate, they could see that they had been delivered and gave us an immediate provisional credit. Later, they did find one of the devices, but to make things right, they gave an additional credit for that item on top of letting us keep the full provisional credit for both devices. Now that is superior customer service! Hard to find that anymore. They were prompt, courteous, and resolved our issue (and I dealt with three different customer service reps). Anyway, on to the HDX. This is a spectacular little device. It is much lighter, more compact and easier to hold than my HD was. It is also quite a bit faster, whether checking email or browsing. I also enjoy my reading experience. Of course I have to mention the blue haze issue. After reading previous reviews, I have to admit that I was a little concerned. However, I need not have worried. It is a non issue to me personally, I had to look really hard to see it and I find that it is actually easier on my eyes than a stark white page. I do not see it at all when browsing or checking email. I have downloaded some music and find the sound quality to be at least as good as what I experienced on my previous gen HD. I can't wait to view my newly purchased HD LOTR trilogy on this device as the screen so far has been highly impressive. I also decided to purchase the HDX with 64 GB as I found that the 16GB in my previous device just wasn't enough to accommodate the downloading of several movies for when I travel. I would highly recommend the higher storage capacity for anyone who is wanting to download movies, especially those of HD quality. Also, I have used the charging port several times and have not been bothered with the angle at all. In fact, because of the angle, I have found it easier to plug in than with my last device because I had to hold that one exactly level in order for me to be able to insert the cord. I have only one more thing to say about the HDX and other Kindle tablets. They are not IPads, nor will they ever be IPads. If I had wanted a tablet with the features of an IPad, I would have bought an IPad. Thank goodness I do not want that, which means I can get everything I want for a lot less money than I would have had to spend on an IPad. I have more money to spend on stuff to put on my Kindle. This puts a smile on my face. Kindles are in a category all their own and I love them! Thanks Amazon---------------------------------------------------------Jan 26, 2014I would like to modify my previous review a bit. After using this device for a while, I still love it. However I have noticed considerable eyestrain when reading a book without a lamp at night. My eyes would burn and water. Since then, I have purchased a Paperwhite and have no more problems. So now I use my Paperwhite for reading, it is lighter weight anyway which is better for that purpose, and my HDX for everything else. When I travel though I will still just take my HDX for simplicity and the sync feature makes it easy to continue reading where I left off on my Paperwhite. I still consider both devices to be a good investment.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon has outdone themselves!", "Author": "wanda", "ReviewID": "RBJ4GF80COQYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third KF - I had the first and second versions of the non HD Fire.This new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is simply amazing. I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle. You won't regret your purchase!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Purchase, Fully Recommend", "Author": "I Shop Too Much", "ReviewID": "R2QJ79PRC99V0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first glance the Kindle Fire HDX is everything I had wanted, not to say that it still is not what I wanted...mostly.The Kindle Fire HDX earns a stable 4/5 stars, if it were out of ten however; it'd be a clear 7/10.*Device & Apps*The device itself is fantastic, the speed of the Linux OS mixed with the 2.2 GHz quad-processor really does make this the fastest 7\" tablet I've seen, there is no doubt about it.  In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.

Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.

I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

It is just as user-friendly as an iPad.  I know you are comparing to an iPad, and 'you' know you are comparing to an iPad.The things I really like vs an iPad:HARDWARE* The speakers and sound quality are better, you will be amazed at hearing sounds 'over there' from this small device* It has a nice soft feel, the backing feels almost sponge-y* Far more affordable, yet not 'cheap' - this is good hardware* The screen is beautiful, especially for watching video* The power cable is a standard usb cable, & you can charge this tablet almost anywhereSOFTWARE* The interface is faster at switching between apps, & you can find your apps more quickly* Free software everyday - often overlooked, Amazon provides you a free app everyday (just add up the value)* Books are much more thought out and useful on a Kindle, especially when they are so accessible from the carousel* VERY cloud-friendly, everything is saved in the cloud (and easier to manage than an iPad)The things I do not like vs an iPad:HARDWARE* The battery is not great, it's good but not great* The power button at the 'bottom' of the tablet is in the wrong place (by 'feel' you can get lost deciding which side has the volume buttons and which has the power button)* Auto-brightness will drive you insane as it flickers between bright and darkSOFTWARE* The app selection is too limited -- in essence, you are limited to a subset of the google play store* If you use anything other than a Windows computer, you are asked to use the 'Android Transfer App' to transfer files to the tablet - DO NOT USE IT, it will cause problems on this tablet.  I am convinced it caused my first Kindle Fire HDX to lose its ability to start up.  I attempted to side-load my music again to the new replacement tablet and it almost stopped responding as well.  Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!). I'm hoping the soon-to-be release helps with this.I appreciate many of the features of the new machine, but Amazon giveth and taketh away.

I initially chalked the original up to a random defect, but I have read the others are having the same problem, so it seems less random. This is very disappointing as I love everything else about this device. Everything else. It's fast, light and the screen looks great (except for the bleeding). The backlight bleeding is a deal breaker. I am sending my current one back and hoping that the next one will be perfect, but I am not confident. If the next replacement is also bad, I will give up until Amazon fixes this issue.Follow-up: I recently received an email from Amazon telling me that the blue/purple light is normal and makes the screen nicer. This is a silly answer as it disrupts the experience so badly and makes reading on the device nearly impossible. This is the same type of shenanigans Amazon pulled with the Paperwhite. An obvious defect becomes something they intended. Don't believe it. I have never seen a tablet (or almost any other device) where you can see the backlight around the edges. If Amazon wants to challenge me on this, I will gladly post pictures of my Fire HD and HDX side by side to show just how much this answer makes zero sense. This is a defect not a feature. Own up to it Amazon.Second follow-up: Amazon is now publicly saying that the backlight bleed is not a defect and the fact that my third Fire HDX seems to back this up. Sadly I will be returning mine. I acknowledge that the blue light is not really noticeable when playing games/watching videos. However, reading and browsing the web is a truly poor experience with the blue light.

The Nexus 7 (2013) has a slower processor 1.5 GHz Quad Core to the Kindle Fire HDX 2.2 GHz Quad Core. This is the only reason I am rating this product with a 3 star rating.The sound is great but in a side by side comparison to the Nexus 7, the Nexus 7 has a bigger and crisper sound, but in all honesty not much of a difference. It may be a matter of preference.A lot of technology blogs are giving the Kindle Fire HDX a better rating for the screen quality but with the brightness settings set at max. The Nexus 7 (2013) has a much brighter and cooler picture than the Kindle Fire HDX. (Again a matter of preference both 1080p displays).The HDX only has one front facing camera compared to the Nexus 7 which has two. Albeit the front facing camera snaps great images, the Nexus 7 has two equally great cameras in the front and back.The battery life is a better than the Nexus 7 but both lasted around three days with average use.I also find myself fumbling to find the power and volume buttons. The buttons are placed on the back of the Kindle HDX and more often than not I have to rotate the tablet a couple of times to locate the power button.Another thing I just cannot get over is the Special Offers version 16 GB model. Everytime I turn on the device an Advertisement for some random Amazon product greets me. I find this a bit annoying. As a huge advocate of online privacy, I do not like this type of marketing scheme especially for the price of $230. The Nexus 7 (2013) costs exactly $230 without ads or added bloatware. I have actually seen deeper holiday discounts on the Nexus 7 (2013) than the Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased my Nexus 7 last week at Staples for $180. Similar discounts are available with a quick search of DealNews.com or Slickdeals.com.The Amazon App Store is lacking many products that a college student like I use on a day to day basis. For example: Skydrive, Black Board Learn, Gmail, Youtube, Falcon Pro (Twitter client), and Outlook 360. (This is not Amazon's fault its up to developers)Comparing the Accessories for both tablets. Amazon seems to have a monopoly on the cases because I was not able to find cheap cases for the Kindle Fire HDX. Ebay and Amazon have excellent hard ergonomic covers for the Nexus 7 for less than $10. Amazon is selling a case for its Fire HDX for $50. The cheapest case I could find for it was $20 from Belkin and that product did not really protect it.In closing the Kindle Fire HDX is not worth the price of $230. The one thing is has going for it is the actual Kindle side of it. I read Mockingjay on it and enjoyed holding the device in my hand. It is light enough that your hand never gets tired of holding it. I will return this item and exchange for a lower version of the Kindle family that is strictly for reading.In comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) default reading apps, i was able to read ebooks easier on the Kindle Fire but PDF's were much easier to read on the Nexus 7 which now uses QuickOffice as an out of the box reader. The QuickOffice app had more settings to adjust large PDF files and customize the text color and background. I was amazed the Kindle Fire did not have these options available. As any college student will tell you, professors are out of their minds and assign scholarly articles from JSTOR or Google Scholar that are 30 to 50 pages in length.

Responsive. Runs games, or video streaming, HD TV streaming - with no lags.**DesignThat hardly depends on personal taste. Myself I like it. Easy to hold even with one hand. Not slippy. Light. Good thing is that Power and Audio buttons are well situated. If you hold HDX and watch something, or listening music while reading and wish to adjust volume - easy to find buttons as your fingers are exactly there.**Screen/Reading experienceIt is marvelous for reading. I do have Kindle reader as well and mostly read on it, but sometimes have to use Kindle Fire - for EPUBS f/e and I should say KF HDX screen is amazing step ahead. Of course, for reading not as good as EInk screens, but really better than reading on smartphone  or IPad Mini or Notebook. Do not have Nexus, thus can say nothing about. Can't compare here.Only bad thing with this screen is that it's glossy. Terribly glossy. If you love dark backgrounds and pick that option in apps, or if you read and prefer white letters/black background - forget about. You would see yourself in the screen like in a mirror. But for white (or any light) background/black letter thing - as I have said above reading experience is superb!Of course for movies and games HDX screen is superb as well. Rich and bright,  well calibrated.  Vivid colors. No complains here.I do have some applications for note-taking (handwriting) like 7Notes and HDX is good for that. With a stylus you can take notes or draw something - would not say that's exactly like if you have a pen and paper but quite close.**AudioSpeakers are well situated so you never hold it with your hand. And the audio is good - loud and clear. I do also have bluetooth speakers but no real need to use them. Well, maybe somewhere in a noisy environment.Back, where speakers are located has an angle and that's smart - if you lay HDX on table, speakers are not covered and audio is good.**BatteryHolds about 10-11 hours (Amazon says 11). But when you read, it automatically picks energysave regime, well done! Nice option really and very useful.Charging takes about 6 hours. Bit less.But HDX charger output is 1A, when HDX can be charged at 1.8A - thus, better to use other charger it would be fast. F/e 1st Gen KF charger output is exactly 1.8A.**Web browsingWith double antenna it finds Wi-Fi easily and holds it well.Silk browser is getting better. Works well, quick enough but still below Chrome. Of course Silk is the only browser on Amazon appstore, but sideloading is possible. :)Streaming is smooth. You can watch online TV from some other web-servers, of course watch Youtube, Dailymotion... No lags. If you have access to some HD TV online broadcast services - HDX is good for that as well. Buffering is very quick and after it goes like a charm. HDX great hardware gives you all benefits here.**HDX Keyboard/FontsYou can read books, surf web in any (or almost any? - don't want to make a mistake) language and you can type as well as HDX new keyboard gives an option to download lots of additional languages. And keyboard supports path-tracing like Swype. Works really well. If you love Swype keyboard, HDX one is close to that standard.**EcosystemDepends you are a long-time Amazon customer or new here. Are you a Prime member or not. Myself I am with Amazon for several years now. Buy from e-shop, also reading on Kindle (reader), later when they release KF tablet I got it... thus, HDX integration with Amazon services is an important thing for me. You access all your books. All your documents you store with Amazon. Cloud Drive is integrated. Videos, music streaming. You can now download Prime videos as well.Needless to say, that buying from Amazon e-shop or siblings like Zappos or MyHabit is easy and nice.As for apps - of course Amazon Appstore is way behind it's e-shop. You may not find lots of applications you wish to have. Hope Amazon would work here and call more developers. But again - don't forget, you can find an application somewhere else and sideload to HDX. Of course - that's not an ideal, but still a solution sometimes.And MayDay. 24/7 Online support. Have not used it yet. :) But that may be helpful when you need.**Cons/Things you should consider, while orderingTraditionally: No Google Play (but some Google apps like Calendar, Music or Gmail can be sideloaded and work - pls., see comments for details). But you know, what you buy.No rare camera but for me that was not crucial while making a decision as I do not really gonna to use it having smartphone with better camera.As for blue light around screen edges - lots of people do complain. For my eyes that's barely noticeable and not irritating while reading or browsing.If you refer to \"We want you to know...\" topic on HDX page, Amazon says, that \"All displays have some level of light emission around the edges... Most LCD displays use white LEDs. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"Thus, if you buy HDX, you have to live with blue glow. Future software updates would leave that intact I guess.Fire OS is almost no Android OS. Hard to feel Android here. And native launcher is much different from any other Android launcher. If HDX is not your first KF - than you know it, but if HDX is your first tablet form Amazon, you may feel lost from the beginning.  I felt this way when I received my 1st Gen. KF... finally I ended installing an alternative launcher. Sorry, Amazon. :)But I should say, that for HDX Amazon made some nice changes - f/e option to see apps. in greed view. That's nice.**Special offersYou see Ad ONLY on lock screen, as soon you slide to unlock - ad banner disappears. Not annoying at all IMHO.In conclusion - great hardware, well build and if you are with Amazon ecosystem and do not need Google Play etc. - this is an extremely nice tablet.___Accessories:**CaseJust got Slimline Case from Poetic (which is on sale right now on Amazon). Fits HDX well. Awakes tablet when opened, like Origami case does.

The screen is beautiful. It has 323 pixels per inch as opposed to 216 for the HD. Apparently 107 pixels per inch is enough to bring a device from high definition into extreme high definition.Whatever the numbers really mean doesn't mean a whole lot to most people. This screen is dazzling and it will not disappoint you.StorageA 16 gig HDD isn't too terrible for something that costs $229. The main issue here is that if you intend to use the feature allowing you to store 1080p movies then those 16 gigabytes will fill up rather quickly. It is also apparent that the operating system and support software will also take up a portion of that 16 gigabytes. As with nearly all devices of this type one can assume that it is likely that you will never be able to increase the size of this hard drive.Form FactorKindle Fires have always been build like a tank. They were able to take a beating and are more difficult to crack than other screen-based items. Unfortunately, this comes with the price that the Kindle Fire was rather bulky and clunky. This time around we get a nice slim device that also seems durable. It is comfortable to hold in your hand without feeling cheap. The width went from 0.9 inches to 0.6 inches (33% thinner!) and the weight went from .86 pounds to .66 pounds.New Operating systemRecently, the Kindle Fire operating system has started to become a bit more difficult to use. Things seems to be a little bit less user friendly, though it did have a lot more features. I got to see an older generation in my family struggle when the OS got an upgrade for the Kindle Fire HD.The New Operating System is called Mojito and it is based on androids JellyBean. This feels more iterative than a revamp but some things about it definitely work. You still have the carousel with Mojito, but you can view more apps at once which definitely makes this feature more usable. Silk now feels like something I might actually want to use. I feel that this has has the biggest upgrade with the new operating system. The Keyboard here feels much smoother and pages definitely seem to have loaded faster (though i guess i should thank the increased specs for that one). This is also helped along by the fact that the touch screen is far more accurate. I can't be certain of who to thank but this is definitely a smoother, more pleasurable experience.New FeaturesAs we know there are many things to like about amazons Kindle. People can go back and forth comparing the size, quality, and price of this item to that of an iPad. Here are a few argument winners that will help to sway people into the Amazon ecosystem.Prime Viewing...now watch Prime without internetYou will now be able to download amazon prime content directly to the hard drive of your Kindle. This means you can enjoy a long car trip or a plane ride without using 3G service. This is a great upgrade and truly has this item stand apart.X-RAY just got better (sorta)Now with X-RAY you can bring up imdb.com information on people that have just come into the screen. This is partly and old feature but it will become new again with trivia. This is just the trivia that is already provided on the imdb.com website, but it is a fun addition. There are also instances where you can follow certain lyrics line by line. At the time of the review I have yet to try out this feature.The idea of adding more to X-RAY is nice. Anything that makes watching a movie more immerse is a good thing. Unfortunately, this kinda feels like something that you will forget about very quickly. Though, there is a push for this kind of content nowadays (SmartGlass) so maybe it could become something we all naturally all use, time will tell i supposeMaydayTo me, this is the thing that really drew my attention.  This is definitely something that is meant to be used by my parents but it gives a warm to the product. A savy electronics user may never need to use Mayday in order to find out where the home button is but it would be fantastic if this type of feature is forever integrated into devices by other companies. Hopefully, this free service will be a game-changer for customer service.Why Only Four Stars? (small drawbacks)The new Kindle Fire HDX is a fantastic piece of hardware. It is light, beautiful, and fast. Unfortunately, this device feels as locked down as previous Kindle Fire models.The the entire Kindle Fire line boasts that it is compatible with 80,000 apps. This number looks really high but there are nearly 10x as many apps on the android store that are not compatible with the Kindle Fire. Kindle items are Android devices of sorts, why can't they run every app available?In addition to this there still does not seem to be any way to create your own home screen wallpaper. I have seen with previous devices that even with the ads turned off you still cannot choose your own home screen. The images they have provided are stunning, yet there is no customization. There should at least be a way to set your home screen to reflect the image of the book you have most recently read.Holding the device is wonderful, it is light and the face of the device is beautiful. The back has a rubber touch to it and the side has a nice angle to it. The power button and the volume rocker are on this angled surface which is nice, but it's not entirely impossible to feel a bit uncomfortable at first. One thing that is curious to me is that the speakers have been moved to the back. They have a nicer speaker set this time around but it seems unusual to me to be projecting that backward. In addition to this is seems possible to me that some people might naturally want to hold the device with their fingers covering these speaker holes. Clearly, these are minor issues that may not amount to much once you get accustomed to it.If you have come to this page looking for a way to figure out if you should get the 7\" or the 8.9\" I have one insight for you. I have never held the 8.9\" but one instant difference is that the larger device has a rear facing camera. This wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me but i thought it might be important to note this.These few issues are very petty and, in the long run, they are insignificant. I am just shocked that such a fantastic device has such unusual restrictions. I cannot imagine that this would ruin the device for any buyer, but I felt it would only be fair to make you aware.This device is beautiful and deserves a spot in your home if you are looking for an upgrade. I love the look and feel of this device, I will just be sitting here hoping that the next time around we get a stock android device, though maybe I should just be happy that this thing will keep a huge smile on my face for a very long time.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 64GB and Prime downloads \"SPOILER\"", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Usagi Driver\"", "ReviewID": "R3TQF9CKUT20N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HDX is magnificent, just read all the raves.

Allemann", "ReviewID": "R13RFVFJ44AQL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a long time Apple Fan. I own a Mac Desktop, an iPad and an iPhone. I like to use my phone strictly for phone-related uses--making calls, using the map while traveling---that sort of thing. It is just too small for watching movies, playing games and such. But I wanted a small 4G LTE tablet of some sort that was light and would easily slip inside my purse. I wanted one that I could take with me when I traveled out of town, made road trips with my hubby, or when I'm killing time waiting for my son at his music lessons. My iPad is full-size and connected to a keyboard case, so I didn't want to keep lugging that around. So, since I am an Amazon Prime member, and after much thought and research, I finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\".At first I was concerned that I might not like it. One thing I don't care for as an Apple user is how restricted their apps are and how geared they are toward all things Apple. I was afraid that I might be repeating myself by buying a Kindle---that this tablet might be locked up in all things Amazon with no access to Google apps, youTube, Gmail, Chrome, or other apps that might not be available in the Amazon app store. However, I've found that the Kindle Fire is not locked up after all. I learned that even though there are some really great apps in the Amazon store, not everything is there that I might like or want. Yet, it was very easy to install a third party app called 1MobileMarket, and with that I have been able to side-load apps that I can't find in the Amazon app store. One app I was abler to download for example is Chrome, which of course is a Google app. It works great! I was able to sign in on Chrome with my Google account and watch all the youTube playlists and favorites that I had accumulated in my Google youTube account. I was also able to earmark Google as my search engine of choice on the Silk browser. In the Kindle email app, I was able to incorporate both my Hotmail and my Gmail accounts, and it handles both of them seamlessly. While I'm on the subject of side loading, another app that you might want to download right off the bat is the free app ES File Explorer. It's a full-featured file and app manager which is similar to Finder on a Mac or Windows Explorer on a PC. It's been really valuable in helping me find and organize apps and games, etc. after I've side-loaded them to my kindle. I highly recommend this app before you get started with side loading.Now on to my music collection. I have a ton of songs that I've already placed in my iTunes account and I didn't want to have to buy them again in order to listen to them on my Kindle. So by using the (free) Amazon Cloud Player and the (free) Amazon Music Importer, I was able to upload all the music that I had put in my iTunes account to the Amazon Cloud. The next time I turned on my Kindle Fire HDX, then went to Music, there were all my songs right there for me to listen to and/or download to my Kindle. I then found a really great feature within the Music app. It is called x-ray. I found it by accidentally pressing it as I was listening to a Diana Krall song. While I was listening to the song, and when I pressed the x-ray icon, up on the screen came the lyrics to the song, following along with Ms. Krall as she sang (similar to karaoke words streaming on the screen). When the next song came on, the lyrics to that song came up on the screen. Cool! The sound is amazingly strong for such a small tablet! As is the video display. And speaking of videos, I have several instant videos that I've purchased on Amazon, and they display and sound beautifully on the Kindle Fire HDX! I also have several videos on my Mac computer, and by using the free app Android File Transfer which I had downloaded onto my Mac, I was able to connect my Kindle to my Mac with the USB cord, and simply upload those videos to the Kindle library storage.Day by day I'm learning more and more about my Kindle and how fun and easy it is to use. But on the second day after I had bought it, I ran into a problem while trying to get into the app store. I couldn't figure out how what to do, because I couldn't get the App store to open. I just kept getting a black screen. So I pulled down the Kindle menu from the top, found and pressed the Mayday feature and within a matter of seconds, a young man with headphones on popped up on the screen and asked in a friendly voice, \"Hello! How may I help you?\" I told him the problem, and then watched my screen in amazement as he opened the necessary screen, forced closed an app, and then got me into the app store. Within moments he fixed the problem right before my eyes. So impressive! (By the way, although you can see them, they can't see you---in case you're wondering)One problem that some have mentioned, is the blue/purple haze around the edges of the screen when one is reading an ebook on this Kindle. Yes, I guess it is there, now that I looked for it. But I really don't find it to be a distraction, because it is very slight. However, you have three different page color settings to choose from that might help if this really bothers you. You can choose to have your book pages be white with black letters, sepia pages with brownish-black lettering, or black pages with white letters. Since I prefer the black pages/white letters setting (as I mostly read at night), the faint purple haze around the edges of the book pages aren't an issue for me because it simply doesn't show at all under the black color. Speaking of the eBooks section, many (most?) of the books have a feature on them called Text to Speech. While reading a book, you simply tap on the Play icon, and the book becomes an audio book, and you can listen as the book is read to you while you go about doing other things.So to summarize, I am a long time faithful Apple user, but I have to say that I am really liking my new Kindle Fire HDX. Don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying this little amazing tablet out for yourself. For all the \"problems\" that I've seen mentioned here and there, there's none that are really an issue (in my humble opinion) as you get to know your Kindle Fire. I can honestly say that the more I learn about this little tablet and all the wonderful things it can do, the happier I am that I took the plunge and bought it!", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "My new favorite toy", "Author": "asortafairytale", "ReviewID": "R3701V3BUK0UM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about a month ago and wanted to give myself some time to play around with it before writing this review.Let me just say, I'm really enjoying it. It's the first tablet I've ever owned, so I can't compare it to anything else, but I am really enjoying this little toy. I've downloaded and listened to a couple of audio books while driving to and from work. I'm addicted to a few game apps that are eating up WAY more time than they should, but that's what they're for, right? I also have the Weather Channel app that I check each morning before I get ready for work.One of my absolute favorite features is the quality of the screen. I have the Netflix and Hulu apps and the screen is so freaking amazing. So crisp and clear. Honestly, it's better than the screen on my laptop. I still use my laptop for laptopy things - creating Word and Excel documents, or going online if I need to have multiple browser windows or tabs open/do multiple things at once. But if I just want to sit and watch a video, I prefer this Kindle over my laptop.I've also read a couple of books on it. Not my favorite, to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of reading on a backlit screen. I have a Kindle Keyboard that I much prefer reading on. But this isn't too bad and I enjoy it more than I thought I would.I definitely recommend this Kindle and can't wait to continue using it for a long time.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with hdx7", "Author": "HAMPOTIN", "ReviewID": "R1OXGXR7OWRSIY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let start by saying I am a Huge fan of Amazon and Kindle.i have the Kindle reader which is fantastic.but the Hdx7 was a shocking disappointment.I had to call Kindle on mayday every other day to reboot this unit to get it to work.after five days of this I sent it back,and as usual amazon was great with the return process.

Something that looked nice, didn't cost too much, and had some good reviews. I had no idea this sleek,little, black tablet would become one of my favorite electronic items in the house.I had used a relative's older Kindle HD off and on, so thought I had an idea about speed and what to expect.  Nope, wrong.  The new 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon processor is blazing fast.  Tapping on an app, and it opening, is near instant, HD movies play seamlessly with stutter and pixelation being an extreme rarity. Web pages load quickly, and the touch-screen is responsive, yet not so sensitive you will accidentally open an app by brushing against it's icon.The button placement and size, to me, are ideal.  With the older Kindle, it was easy to think you are pressing volume, but would be pressing on/off.  Not to mention they were tiny. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides on the HDX. Mine is in a case, and neither button has accidentally been depressed.If you are looking for a gorgeous screen with vivid detail and color, the Kindle HDX is impressive.  The 1920x1200 display handles HD content with ease, ebooks are crisp and clear; it really is stunning. Additionally, the black level rendering is superb for such a small unit. Brightness can be set manually or you can let the Kindle adjust it automatically based on lighting conditions.Located on the back are two speakers and there is also a mini-jack in case you want to use headphones.  For as thin as the HDX is, the sound quality is good.  While the speakers cannot compare to a Home Theater, they reproduce sound clearly and with little to no distortion, even at maximum volume.Battery life has been more than adequate for my needs, yet I have noticed that how long it lasts can vary depending on usage.  For example, I started off with the battery at 100% and streamed movies for four hours straight; it was at 70% at the end.  Conversely, I played a popular game on it for 30 minutes, and the battery went from 100% to 82%.  Every time I play it, I know to expect a 10% draw in about 15 minutes.  Also, any app that uses a lot of memory or constantly runs in the background can affect battery life.  A Memory Manager can help turn off apps in the background and prolong the battery.My normal usage consists of heavy email, medium amounts of web surfing, lots of reading, and a few hours of streaming, mirrored to the TV.  Adding it all together probably equals between 3-6 hours per day.  The lowest the level has been was 33%, and that was after using all day and forgetting to plug in at night, so it stayed in sleep mode until the next day.Below I will address some concerns that seem to be common:1.  Dropped or poor WiFi Signal-- I have had this happen only three times in three months of ownership.  Once, was due to the router needing to be \"flushed.\" The second time, I cleared the cache in the Kindle, and the third time I have no explanation, but a simple rebooting of the HDX fixed the issue.2. Blue glow around the edges-- If I had not read about this, I would never have noticed it.  The only time it is visible is on an all white background, such as an ebook.  However, to me it is very faint and neglible unless you are focusing solely on the edges.  It is due to the edge lighting using the blue LED's and using the auto-brightness or manual adjustments should minimize impact.3. Screen Flicker-- This does happen on occasion, yet only with certain memory and color-intensive apps.  Every time it has self-corrected within a short period, and have never experienced it when streaming a video or movie.4. Ads-- I did not pay extra for no ads, but do not see them as a problem.  They only appear on the lock screen and do not interfere with performance.  Additionally, you can view them all on one page and sometimes a special buy will show.  If you absolutely do not want ads, the payable option exists.5. Laggy/Slow performance-- As with any computer device, the cache can become full and should be cleaned regularly.  Anytime my Kindle HDX seemed slow, a simple cleaning remedied the issue.  One note--certain apps can affect performance and I recommend checking after installing various apps to see if they hinder the device. The cleaner I use is Clean Master and it also acts as a memory manager.6. No Google Play--It is true that you cannot download from Google Play, however, there are other reputable android sites that you can use.  Youtube and the Web have plenty of resources to help.  You will need a File Manager, which can be obtained in the Kindle Store for free.  I use File Manager Free along with 1MobileMarket for any android apps not available in the Kindle Store yet.7. No Youtube-- I use Youtube all of the time on my HDX, whether through Silk or through the app on my Bluray Player.Some other Features and Benefits:1. I have three email accounts synced with my Kindle HDX.  It makes it very easy and convenient to turn it on and have instant access to all of them at once.2. For me, it is preferable to not use the carousel.  I appreciate that I can just swipe upwards and have all the apps I put on my home page arranged cleanly just like desktop icons.  Additionally, by holding an app and dragging it to another you can create \"folders\" to customize the appearance.  For example, have all your games in one  folder icon, all of your productivity apps in another, and so on.3. My Kindle HDX can control two cable boxes, my bluray player, my AV Receiver, act as an independent cable box, stream movies with Amazon Prime and Cable On-Demand.  Once the Home Theater is on, all I need is the Kindle to control all of it.4. Using the Netgear PTV3000, an app, and the Kindle HDX has eliminated the need for me to have a cable box for each TV.5. As time goes on, I keep finding more uses for the HDX.  It is amazing how much this small tablet can do at a fraction of the cost of others.6. It is an incredible e-book reader and library.  I love how convenient it is to have so many books in one place and be able to take them wherever I go.The Kindle HDX has become the most-used computer in the house. It does everything I initially wanted and much more and is still working great after three months. If you are looking for an incredible value in a tablet, then I definitely recommend it.

I have looked at them for a long time and wanted one when the first `Fire' came out but just kept putting it off.  When I finally decided to take the plunge and get one I had heard there was a new updated one about to be released and waited for the newest version.I've had it now for a week. It's a great little tablet at a great price. It is slim, light weight and looks great!  The screen is beautiful, great picture quality and the processor is very fast.  Mine was almost fully charged when I received it, so I basically just had to pull it out of the box turn it on and `GO'.  It was already registered through Amazon. It seemed to do a quick little update and all was set.  Plus it is great it came with a quick charger adaptor, as it seemed all the previous versions never did.At the moment I mainly will use it for reading books, playing some games and occasional internet use. I like all the other options of things you can do with it, even if I don't think I need it at the moment.  At this point I am not sure if I will use it for streaming movies as it sounds many like to do. It's nice to have the option to do it. Maybe in time I will look at doing that and give up most of the movie channels I pay for on my cable tv.Some are complaining about a purple haze border around edge of screen.  I can see that now, but to be honest, I had to go looking for it after I read it in the reviews.  It is not very noticeable to me.  I just don't see it as a big deal and  I wouldn't consider this such a major flaw to give it a negative review or send it back.  It is a faint, and I mean faint, haze.

Will be returning the tablet to try the Nexus 7 or just go and buy a Mini 2/Air.I'll keep it short and easy to read and list the pros and cons as bullet points (I was hesitating between a 2 or 3 but I think Amazon is on the right track so 3 stars):Pros:1- Very clear and beautiful 1920X1200 resolution screen (A bit higher resolution than 1080p which is 1920X1080). Even better than your HDTV since it's this high of resolution on a smaller size (higher PPI)2- Excellent speaker volume and location. Doesn't get blocked when using the hdx in landscape mode (the iPad and Nexus 7 have the speaker placement issue)3- Mayday is actually very useful for someone that isn't tech savy. I was able to get connected every time I tested it within 10-15seconds. I would assume the wait will be longer during holiday season.Cons:1- The first and biggest issue for this and any tablet is APP selection. This one is missing many of the latest and greatest apps that are on the Apple App store and Google Play (including Time Warner App, some banking apps, big mobile games)etc...The Amazon app store is currently estimated at 75000 apps while both the Apple and Google App stores are each over 1 million apps and have many dedicated specifically to the tablet (specially the Apple App Store)2- Buttons placement of On/Off button and volume Up/Down are horrible and size is way too small for my normal sized hands.3- Although it is smoother than the last Samsung Tab 2 I've used, the interface still feels a bit clunky at times. It's not butter smooth like the IOS on the iPad (believe me, even my iPad 1 was smoother than this)4- Apps crashed too frequently, even when going in the prebuilt Shopping and App store apps5- Needs better quality control. I understand this is probably the first batch of the tablets and usually every first few batch of a gadget have some issues but I really think better quality control would alleviate most if not all issues. My HDX has some screen flashing as if the backlight is getting adjusted up and down consistently.

I was bored of Apple (I have an iPhone and MacBook that I love but still...) and I didn't want just a tiny computer. I wanted something that was an entity all on its own. Something that could do it all but in a new fun way. My main requirements: camera, good price, and toddler friendly. I liked that the kindle fire hdx not only met all my requirements but far exceeded them also. It has FreeTime for kids which is well worth it alone, my daughter has unlimited instant access to hundreds of books, videos, and games with her favorite characters. You can get a subscription (4.99/month for one child 9.99 for a family) or just set up the child's own profile and fill it with the plenty of free kids apps available. I love that it's an android operating system. The apps are everything I need, yeah it's not hooked up with Google play or anything but I haven't found that to be a problem. Every app I wanted and am used to using on my iPhone is still available and all of my daughter's favorite apps are still here too. The picture and clarity of the screen is amazing and I found it to be much nicer than any of the other tablets I looked at.

My husband can't even believe how great the graphics are. I am thrilled with my purchase and couldn't be happier. I also love that it's Amazon, a company I trust, and provides easy access to anything I want to do. There's also an app that connects to your local library early so you can \"borrow\" books directly onto your kindle. Kindle is also a major name so everything already (for the most part) has kindle compatibility. I really can't say it enough: I love our kindle. It's perfect and amazing and just what I wanted.

Besides, I have all of my bookmarks and notes that I haven't learned how to transfer to the Fire HDX. We chose the 7\" size because it's easier to carry in a purse or pocket. Keep in mind that the screen takes up the whole dimension, so it's a larger screen than the Kindle that has the keyboard at the bottom. It's really easy to read. We had our Kindle Fire in the car the other day and needed to look up a contact. That's when I discovered that it's like trying to read my phone's screen in the sunlight. Impossible. So I ordered anti-glare screen protectors. I hope that takes care of the glare. While we do love the Kindle Fire KDX Wi-Fi, I've noticed some problems that maybe aren't a problem to others. I had my Fire with me at church and wanted to jot down on my calendar something that I need to do on a date coming up in a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a Calendar icon, so I opened it to the date I wanted and discovered it wouldn't let me type my note. Why would it be necessary to have the calendar linked to the Internet if I don't care a thing about synchronizing it with my computer? I just wanted a nice little place to jot down the date of something. We don't use smart phones so I didn't think about this sync thing. I guess I just want something simple and old fashioned. At any rate, I had to wait a couple of hours until I got home and could link to the Internet simply to type my note on the calendar.Since this is high definition I was kind of excited when I saw the camera icon. I figured I'd get much nicer pictures than on my 7 year old digital camera. So I clicked on camera and saw myself. I read directions to see how I change the camera to showing what a regular view finder would see and had to chuckle when I found out it's just a one-way camera. Therefore, I took a picture of my Christmas tree by turning my back to the tree and holding the Fire over my shoulder so I could see what it saw. I got a good picture, but that's an awkward way to take a picture. So I guess I won't be using it for much more than Skyping.Things we love about the Kindle Fire HDX: the special offers (which I thought would be annoying) only show up when the device is off, so you don't have to interrupted by pop-ups. Wonderful! It's like the pictures you see on the old Kindle when it's off, only it is advertising instead of pictures of famous authors. It's quicker to manipulate between items. For instance, if you are reading the Sunday School lesson and want to go to a scripture reference, it's just a click away, then an arrow click back to where you were. It's faster to move between pages, chapters, etc. with a swipe of the fingers rather than clicking the page buttons on the old Kindle. (But we still love our old Kindles and will not be getting rid of them anytime soon). We love the bright picture and the fact that it can be read in low light (unlike the old Kindle which has no backlight). The high definition is really pleasing to the eye.We haven't tried Mayday yet, but from the commercials that feature appears to be a real boon to people who are not truly tech savvy (like we're not). I think this is a gadget everyone can find a good reason to own as it is much cheaper than an IPad and most other tablets. It looks great and works intuitively. Everything that's really important to us (and the reason we wanted it) is downloaded onto the device, making it unnecessary to be online away from home. The only thing that might have been nice and could be the reason we may someday opt for smart phones is that we can't use a barcode feature whereby you can skip printing a coupon and instead have the barcode on your device for the restaurant or store to scan.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "An electronic product for all ages", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3CZU05PRY4IVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Kindle reader 2nd generation to the HDX 7 - I truly enjoyed and used my kindle reader.

This Kindle Fire HDX is the first kindle I've owned personally, although I've gotten to borrow Kindles from others (originals and Paperwhite). This is, to date, the BEST tablet I've ever used. It's fast, responsive and never seems to drop the connection. I haven't gotten to use a 3G feature yet, but this tablet finds a WiFi connection where my Surface Pro, other tablets and even my powerful laptops can't get it.It's got great apps, the screen is stunning (looks better than the last iPad Air or Surface Pro 2), and its drop test rating is one of the better ones.

After reading so many unsatisfied reviews, I was quite skeptical about its operation.  Well, was I ever surprised!  The Kindle arrived perfectly boxed and in great condition.  Set-up was as easy as pie; no trouble connecting to wifi; in fact, no trouble at all.  I am a 71-year old great grandmother who has absolutely NO experience with a Kindle.  So, if I can do it, so can you.  I am a voracious reader and was anxious to see the \"blue haze\" so many people talked about.  Personally, I cannot understand the complaints.  Yes, there is a very faint blue border, but not enough to bother mentioning (to me).  I am absolutely astounded at what this device is capable of.  I spent several hours experimenting and I realize there will be a learning curve, but I'm having fun with it.  I've used a Nook for the last two years and have slowly grown discontented with its performance.  When placed side-by-side, the Kindle wins in weight, brightness, speed and features.

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage. Hope that was helpful! It might've been common knowledge, but I would not know, as this is my 1st tablet ever, as mentioned previously.To use miracast for your Kindle Fire HDX and television, I recommend:NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000)B00904JILO", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prime video download a joke", "Author": "Patriot1", "ReviewID": "R3MLJ9YWG0SFQP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the HDX for three reasons.

I had qualms about trading it in to purchase the new Fire HDX 7, but wanted the extended battery life offered.The HDX is beautiful, fast, and functions beyond expectations in all features, except, as an e-reader. I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support. First, the good: brilliant color, speed, much improved speakers, and the button placement is ideal for on/off and volume. \"Mr. Hyde\" appears in the reading, at least on my device, in a slowly-advancing glowing blue border! I know- the notice has gone out that this is \"normal\" and part of the advancement in true color display, but my device border is irregular, blotchy, and prevents any enjoyment of reading despite adjustments of brightness, font, etc.Amazon customer support is stellar, but I've had some difficulty conveying the fact that this display is unacceptable. Past experience with support has been very positive, so I won't let Jekyl and Hyde dissuade me.More to come....**10/30/13 Kindle support consented to sending a replacement. This second HDX does not have the unevenly lit border, but is \"shadowy\" even with the sepia background, which I find easier on the eyes. The HDX doesn't come close to the reading experience of the Fire HD that I traded in, but I'll live with this because any other e-readers I've tested have backlit displays that are far worse!I would advise you keep your Fire HDs if you enjoy reading. So, \"Happy Halloween, Mr. Hyde!\"***02/06/14 A major drawback has emerged: rebooting before connecting to wi-fi. Check the forum for this because scores of owners are waiting for a fix for this.

My first tablet was an iPad 1st gen. I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down. Since then I've owned the following: Google Nexus 7 (original), Amazon Kindle Fire (original), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\", Motorola Xoom (original), HP TouchPad (WebOS fire sale), PanDigital Novel 7, few generic Chinese eBay (all of which sucked BTW), Barnes & Nobel Nook HD+ (still have, gave it to my mom when I ordered the HDX) & now the just released Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 32GB.Honestly I didn't know what too expect with the HDX, all the specs were awesome & it's kicking serious butt against the Nexus 7 (2013) in various benchmarks, but I was still kinda nervous. I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience. I haven't figured out how the HDX pulls this off, but the sound is phenomenal.You definitely notice the quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, as this thing flies!Amazon's re-built from the ground up newly minted Fire OS 3.0, is a work of art. It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime. You can easily find anything & everything you may be looking for.Amazon's app store is rapidly catching up to Google Play & I have been able to find all the apps I use from the Google Play store.The integrated apps, such as e-mail, calendar etc. was surprisingly easy to setup with my Gmail & Google Calendar.Amazon has most definitely hit a massive homerun with the HDX line. Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX. And YES, the HDX really does have the best & highest quality HD display currently available.After seeing what the Snapdragon 800 CPU & Adreno 330 GPU are capable of, I now see why Google is using both in the upcoming Nexus 5.

I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.

She didn't understand a word of English, she made me go through her checklist of trouble shooting, even though she had a record of me speaking with tech service.

She only sent me the shipping label because I got angry at her for spending so long on the phone with me and we were getting nowhere.Amazon sent me a new kindle.

I tried to sync documents to my kindle and I followed the website's directions, downloaded the android transfer app to move the documents from my computer. Nothing happened. I called tech service and the first thing the guy tells me is that the kindle doesn't use android. Why would amazon link the android download to their kindle support page if kindle doesn't support it.

Movies, print, and pictures are very impressive.Speakers are impressive, a near surround sound experience when watching movies.Easy to consume Amazon products.Con'sApps, their are not many apps available.Apps locked up several times requiring a complete reboot of the device.Kindle Free Time has a very limited selection and does not feel justified for the price.Regarding applications failure. I loaded several language learning applications from the app store, Babbel, Duolingo, Learn French Deluxe, and Busuu. They ALL eventually locked up and required a reboot. The device appeared to completely lock up and I held the power button down for quite some time.ConclusionThe Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a great device if you plan to only consume Amazon products. It has some room to mature here, such as more intuitive searching for products on amazon.com. But I would grant this device a 4-5 stars for that experience.Regarding apps, it was only a 2 star rating. Smart devices are all about consuming any type of content on demand. With the several different apps failing the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is not yet there.

No unnecessary features attached to the browser. Just bookmarks, HD video, and fast surfing.Videos/Audio/Apps:The Kindle Fire HDX has a Dolby Digital Plus audio engine which allows for the device to separate the background noises from the person speaking or the music. At full volume, I find this hard. But, with the speaker placement on the top of the device, sound is very clear and loud, even with a case. And with a 1920x1280 resolution at 323 pixels per inch, this is right below the Apple iPad Mini 2 at 324 ppi. But, chances are you will not even notice it. Graphics are amazing for games like Asphalt 8. Downloads for videos and movies do not take an hour, unlike my iPod Touch 4. Yes, the Amazon store may be small, but it has its share of cool apps, including Skype built in (on the Cloud; I'm getting there)Amazon Cloud:Ah yes, the Amazon Cloud. Lets say you bought a load of books on your Kindle Paperwhite. Already on your Kindle Fire. You just have to click on \"Books\", download it (which takes a small amount of time) and there: you got your book onto your Kindle Fire HDX.Same for apps and all that stuff. When you get on your Kindle, you already have Skype, Yelp, iMBD and the Oxford Dictionary. Just have to download and you have Skype on your HDX. You have free, automatic and unlimited cloud storage. iCloud can only claim free cloud storage of up to 5 GB. There is also Amazon Cloud Player, which means you get to listen to your Amazon music on your computer.Special Offers:Not disturbing but helpful. I find myself using these for app deals and videos on Prime and stuff like that. Yeah. It is not intrusive or boring mostly. But it is something I would NOT spend money to remove.Home Screen Layout:With the carousel and the drag down screen thingy, I find it helpful for display but not much else. I like the organization at the top with categories such as \"Books\", \"Apps\", and \"Games\".Customer Service:I like the immediate protection of May day but have not used it. The service on Amazon.com is very helpful in fixing my Kindle Fire. By the way, if your kindle ever gets frozen, just hold the power button for 20s and the Kindle automatically turns off. No important info is lost.Reported Problems:The blue haze \"problem\" is present, but it does not affect me at all in a bad way. When I see it, I find it hilarious and just keep playing/watching. For all the people hating it, DEAL WITH IT.Buttons are on the side, but you just have to feel around for them.Charging is slow with the USB, so Amazon recommends the PowerFast charger.Apps crash a lot: Watch out. Just a minor problem.I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING: Buy the 32 or 64 GB version (5.32 GB is used by the device already) with WiFi- adding 4G LTE is +$100 to the price and Special Offers included.

I have not been able to do so or find an easy way to do it that would always sync without having to manually input one at a time. The emails all sync without any problems (@mac, @comcast, & @gmail) but I still have to get use to the Kindle email and play with it some more before I'm really comfortable.The Amazon Prime membership is the way to go, I actually cancelled my Netflix and saved $100.00 a year.

But it's held captive within the Amazonecosystem of applications.Amazon, tear down these walls!Funny how there's reviews all over YouTube about this tablet.But they don't mention that YouTube app won't run on the Fire HDX.Ironic huh?FIVE STARS WHEN THE WALLS COME DOWN.

Just a couple minor negatives.", "Author": "WaltJ", "ReviewID": "R1HICL8KPYHW4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this item for my wife, to mainly use for travel, and as an e-reader.  Her iPad was just too big and heavy to carry around.  The picture and video clarity is awesome.  And, even though it won't accept Flash, Amazon has their own experimental streaming player that works pretty well with our cable service, so she can receive streaming movies and tv-shows.  As an e-reader, the print is crystal clear, and the \"pages\" are nice and bright, which is a major improvement over the original \"newsprint\" looking Kindles.  The built-in automatic battery-saving feature, when using the e-reader feature, is also a plus.  The main disappointing feature is the camera.  I guess I assumed it would be like the camera on the iPads, but it isn't.  There isn't a lens on both sides.  While the Kindle HDX does take pictures and videos, you have to turn the screen away from you to do so...which makes things a little difficult.  It appears that the primary reason for the camera is for using Skype.  Also, one thing that would have been helpful is for a PDF version of a FULL instruction manual to be downloaded right on the Kindle desktop.  As it is now, you have to go online and read through a list topics to try and find answers to questions....or use the Mayday Button.  There is a PDF manual online, but it is only a Quick Start manual.  So, there are many new features that the new HDX has, that we are actually discovering by way of the TV commercials for the Kindle HDX.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Long Time Apple Ipad User Amazed by Kindle HDX That Costs a Third As Much", "Author": "Pod", "ReviewID": "R3BOWQ0UMNGPF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the HDX.  I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing technical support", "Author": "Larry Sassaman", "ReviewID": "R2I5UIE6Y91PM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HDX in early Dec. 2013 and until last week was very pleased with the Kindle's performance.

However, this HDX is also much slower in downloading books, etc.  My original Fire can download a book in seconds, whereas this one takes many many minutes.  I'm not sure why.  I have to say if I only had one Kindle I would keep my original Fire and skip the HDX.  I don't see many advantages to it other than the camera and definitely many disadvantages.

I wanted to experience Android - and this Kindle is Android with Amazon's \"skin\" on top.  I considered a Nexus 7, but customer feedback worried me about it being possibly too fragile.  Price on the Kindle HDX was hard to beat - and the features -screen, and CPU and memory are front-line.What prompted me to write a review?  I bought the Kindle 16GB, WIFI only version- and have been using it about 4 weeks. Tonight I set my 4G iPhone up as a Personal Hotspot - and hooked up my Kindle to the Internet, using the Apple iPhone's WIFI broadcast.  Speedtest showed the Kindle at 5.79 Mbps download, and 10.57 Mbps upload -I was very surprised at the speed it achieved and that upload measured faster down download!Tonight, I also started Pandora, and synced the Kindle to a little bluetooth wireless speaker, and got some great sound.  The Kindle's internal speakers are good on their own (and 2x better than the Nexus 7 if you listen to them side-by-side).  I've found all of the apps I've wanted (Evernote, myfitnesspal, flipboard, feedly, skydrive, zillow, lastpass, and others in the Amazon store -I also sideloaded a couple of apps, a virus checker and maybe 3 or 4 other apps - can't remember which ones right now).  Tried Google Chrome on the Kindle, and I find that it really isn't any more stable (in my experience) than is Silk.  Synced all of my e-mail contacts in from Google to my Kindle Contacts app, and also synced all of my Google calendar entries (from Google/iOS) to a Kindle app called CalenGoo - which seem to be working to keep everything in sync both ways.  Photos I take with my iPhone are synced into the Kindle and can be viewed or edited, and they even show up in a subdirectory on my PC in the Amazon Cloud Drive. Music uploads into the Amazon Cloud have been difficult - only 1 music directory (artist) at a time (from iTunes) - something I haven't finished struggling with.  I agree there is a very faint, light blue border (mainly on the left and right side) on white pages.  If you look you see it, but it is barely noticeable, and to me at least, not the least bit distracting.  I just don't ever notice it to the extent that I remember it  - I just don't \"see\" it unless I go look for it. Its not a defect, just part of the screen illumination design.This review has been all over the place - but I just wanted to give people a hint of what is possible (and there is a lot more I'm sure). I've had a few small glitches  Sometimes the browser (either Silk or Chrome - seems too sensitive and wants to open any sidebar advertisement that I happen to slightly touch.  Scrolling can be either too fast, or sometimes just right.  I can't find a quick way to jump to the top of the screen as I can in iOS.  But, I find the Kindle to be fun, and I pick it up all the time instead of my ipad (it's too heavy) or iPhone (the screen is too small).

The Ipad requires an Apple PW EVERY time you want to download an app, and you have to make sure you remember it EXACTLY, because if you don't, the system won't let you in, and there's no way to store your password so it will fill in automatically.

I really had a hard time choosing between Kindle and ipad. I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them. You get a PERSON in AMERICA when you hit the mayday button, and it literally takes less than 10 seconds to connect to them. It really made me think I have to get one of these for my gramma. Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to.

And the improvement in videos is, to these old eyes, really obvious. Web surfing is significantly faster and crisper.Moreover, there are dozens of little tweaks in the Kindle environment that seem to address practically everything I found annoying in the HD, from the new option to ditch the home-page carousel, to a key that dismisses a stubborn keyboard, to a more functional and appealing video store look.

As a device for browsing the web, viewing movies and, most especially, reading, it is the best device I've ever tried. It is not without its failings when compared to other tablets (or even the iPhone), but overall I like it. The review that follows is more of a semi-organized narrative vs a table of pros/cons or an organized feature list with scores.Rotation (for apps that support it) is really fast and seamless. The place where rotation doesn't do what I'd expect is email; more on that below.The response time when turned on is what you'd expect. It would be nice if it was easier to stop other apps from running; even iOS 6 has a straightforward way for this (much better in iOS 7). Amazon stuck with the slow & clunky Settings/Apps/Running method that has been in Android seemingly forever. Some apps get pretty unhappy with you if you force them to stop. You can reboot for a clean start, but that makes start-up pretty slow. A pity that while keeping this Android feature they disabled some other key features (see below for Apps issue).Books and even newspapers display their text and pictures beautifully. The paging is snappy unlike my older 2nd Gen Kindle, and for speech-enabled books, the speech synthesis system is decent. I LOVE the X-Ray feature. It is not perfect, but I assume it will just keep getting better.Silk is a decent web browser, but not as smooth as its name tries to imply. It is fast, but doesn't work with some important websites; and when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. Take Google Maps for instance. The display of Google Maps just plain sucks. No doubt about it. My iPhone handles Google Maps much better (and has a Google Maps app). No, I don't plan to take my Kindle on the road as a map device, but I would like to use it instead of my iPhone when a computer isn't handy; but that is not to be. To make things worse, there is no Google Maps app in Amazon's store. And to add insult to injury, you cannot install apps from Google Play unless you root your Kindle. That just plain sucks. This takes thousands of Android apps and puts them out of your reach. Amazon already has a \"don't install from other app stores\" switch there. When I turn that off, the Kindle HDX should just work with Google Play... I do not understand why Amazon made this choice and the Kindle HDX is poorer for it.I don't have many apps installed (some that I want to install I cannot -- see note above about Google Play). Some that I did install are ill-suited to my Kindle (e.g. Audubon Birds) as they have a fixed orientation and don't understand rotation. I'll probably stick to books and movies (and newspapers), which no doubt suits Amazon just fine.On the question of e-mail: the Kindle's email support looks pretty, but is pretty non-functional for me. I have an Exchange account plus some iMAP-only accounts that I setup. The Exchange account works really well, except for the Kindle's UI (see below) and some odd configuration things. For instance, no matter how many times I changed my notification sound, the HDX insisted on playing a different one. I even tried using the MAYDAY feature to see if the support gurus could help. I got my HDX on the first day they were available, so the support gurus will still learning the device and did not offer up anything I did not know. In the end I turned off notification and rely on my iPhone to alert me.The mail UI is disappointing in that when I rotate my HDX to landscape mode to gain reading space, the HDX instead insists on showing an Outlook-like 2 pane UI. I thought there was no way to change this, until another user (thanks, Judy) pointed out that a 3-dot menu shows up when a message is selected. That menu allows you to switch to fullscreen mode while viewing the message.WORST THING OF ALL with email: The HDX would randomly mark some unviewed messages as read. This took me many, many days to figure out, and caused me to miss some time-critical messages. How do I know it's the HDX? It started after I setup my iMAP accounts on the HDX; it stopped when I deleted them (another ding vs. other devices I've used: no way to disable the account just for testing -- you must delete it or use it).It is nice that installing my Exchange mailbox brought over my contacts & calendar, though I really don't need yet another device chiming to remind me of meetings. So I use this more as a quick check when reading so I don't need to get my iPhone out.The virtual keyboard is ok, but only just ok. It isn't smart about things like automatically engaging the shift key after punctuation or on a new line (I thought I disliked that about the iPhone at times, but the HDX made me realize how handy it is -- sad that my year-old iPhone has a better typing UI than my new HDX though). The spacing makes it easier to type on than a phone, but I miss the iPhone's features (perhaps just because I've become used to them). I do like the running display of word choices that show up as I type.A general configuration gripe: why is there only 1 sound type to be configured? There are notifications for: email, apps, calendar... why just one sound? And why don't changes to that take hold? Sigh, yes it is a smaller detail but one that impacts the \"fit and finish\" of the device. It's not like Amazon hasn't shipped out a tablet-ish device before, so this disappointed me.Movies -- now this is a REALLY nice feature. The speakers on the HDX (especially with the origami cover in place -- separate review coming on that) are just ok; I'd plug a nice headset in to listen. It is very cool that you can download prime movies onto the device and go on the road with those. What I do not understand is why the HDX has no way to SEARCH for downloadable prime movies. Instead, you need to browse, movie-by-movie, to find the ones that can be downloaded. C'mon, Amazon... really?? I haven't watched a movie on my HDX yet but will on a future road trip. I just hope the battery holds up.The UI for viewing photos is marginal; there is no good way to search for, sort or group photos. You just need to scroll through them and try to spot what you want. Worse, when you copy pictures across the USB interface (yay for a USB interface -- with the display, the only other technical advantage the HDX has), the picture's creation date is tossed. The HDX sets the creation date to the date the picture was copied; I can see NO advantage to anybody except for the careless programmer who didn't have to add that feature to his or her spec. Once you find the picture you want though, the display is what you'd expect from the HDX. Again, if I really want to find a particular picture quickly, I guess I'll just go to my iPhone. I am not even sure I'll keep moving pictures to my Kindle.Music: don't use it. My iPhone syncs with iTunes and I also have an iPod. Moving all of that to Amazon's cloud or my HDX would require conversion from Apple's format. Just not worth the time. Some of my music was purchased from Amazon, and those songs are available. But it is a small subset. Top it off with marginal speakers in my configuration and, well I just don't use it.I am yet to try Skype, but I suspect it would work very well.The HDX comes connected to Amazon's store. That makes it easy to buy books or movies. If I ever remember to carry my HDX into my basement to watch movies, it could be an easy way to select a For Rent movie when I want to watch it through my XBox. Too bad the swipe-to-TV feature doesn't include using the Amazon XBox app... then I'd always take my HDX downstairs with me!That leads to another oddity: for some Kindle management features you have to leave Amazon's store app and use Silk (or your laptop or iPhone) to go onto the web. Why is that? I can buy stuff from Amazon (including expensive, physical merchandise), but if I want to add an email address to my \"approved for documents\" list I need to go sign-on via Silk and browse around their website to find that feature? Doesn't make sense to me.Now the Mayday feature -- it is a really nice idea. I am fairly technical, and when I ask for help it is usually on some detail (like why won't my changes to the Notification sound stick?) that is not easy to find in the documentation. Unhappily for me, the Mayday reps, while very eager to help, did not yet know the HDX very well and I was often put on hold while they went to research things. So I'd go back to reading something and sliding their little window around on my HDX... which got old pretty fast. It is, though, really nice to have that help available when they are able to help. I can hardly wait to try hitting Mayday on Xmas day just to see if they can handle the load ;-)So why did I give this device 4 stars? Because it replaced my older, 2nd gen Kindle and as I said above, it rocks in that role. If you want to view this as an iPad competitor, I think it fails as a general-purpose device that you'd take on the road instead of a laptop; hell my iPhone does a better job of that than this new HDX. But that isn't why I bought it.

The price range of the new Ipad mini was a tad to high for me.The Nexus 7 2013 is the Hdx's adversary. Most of the spec's are similar like the screen and battery life.

I  started watching a nature documentary and was transfixed. Movies, tv shows, games, everything looked great on this device.The device was lightweight, had a fast processor and decent memory. I bought the 64GB but they should have made a 128GB since a single 1080p movie with dolby surround took up 9.5-10.3GB when downloaded from my amazon account. You only get 54 GB to start with because of the operating system and whatever else they put on.I could download Prime TV shows to watch offline when travelling, a great feature! The website said you could download Prime movies as well, but I could not find any that gave me the download option.The device came with a charging block (unlike the fire hd I bought last year).It was for these reasons I gave the unit 2 starts and not just 1. Keep reading to find out why!Second, the not so good:When you plug in the charging cord and the headphone, they are not flat and parallel with the unit. They stick up at about a 15 degree angle. Not a big deal, but it made me nervous in case someone accidentally set something on top of it while it was on the counter or desk. I think the damage would be catastrophic to the unit if that happened.The battery life is not great. This unit sucks down the battery faster than my fire hd does.Lastly, the terrible:I received the unit and spent the day loading it with videos and goodies for an upcoming trip. The last thing I did was sit down to watch a movie I bought specifically to watch on this unit's screen. I noticed a static buzz underneath the soundtrack that was annoying. I experimented until I found that the buzz was happening everytime the unit accessed the internet. Since the movie in question was streaming, the buzz was constant. I tried a downloaded movie, no buzz. I tried surfing the web with nothing on and everytime I clicked a new link, the buzz would be there until the new page was done loading. So, I called Amazon and they sent out a new unit (recieved the next day, thank you Amazon!).The new unit did the same thing. I tried some more experiments and found the buzzing happened with all my ear buds (cheap ones and expensive ones) and did NOT happen with my headphones (both cheap and expensive were clear sounding). The rest of the unit was so cool, I figured I could work around this even though the only reason I have expensive ear buds is to travel with my fire hd. So, I spent another day dowloading tv shows and other goodies to prepare for my trip. I was sitting reading a book and downloading a movie when the unit flashed a warning that I had used up 90% of the storage and did I want to delete something. I clicked no and the unit shut off. I knew the battery was a little low so I plugged in the unit for 20-30 minutes. I tried restarting the unit and nothing. I held down the on/off button for 20 seconds like the website said to and got a brief \"Kindle Fire\" screen flash but nothing else. I called tech support and we basically tried the same thing again and the tech said that they could replace the unit, again.So, I am sending this unit back and getting a refund. I've wasted 2 whole days dealing with this. I have 2 different covers on their way because the origami cover was terrible (see my review for the cover for that story) and I still have to deal with returning those.I'm very annoyed with this whole process because I feel like this was a great product that got rushed through testing and production and was just not ready for consumers yet.

Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0JZDWPQSSDE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the kindle. It has a great price, awesome screen, and with an advertised 11 hour battery life (up to 17 hour if just reading according to Amazon) I figured this device was the perfect companion.After a few weeks of testing and timing, I can confidently say that for the vast majority of user scenarios, the battery life is significantly worse. In fact, I have no idea how exactly Amazon came up with the 11 hour number.But lets start with the basics pros:- Screen is really nice (yes there is some slight blue light bleed around the edges, but Amazon has a complete explanation of why that is - and it's used to have the great color accuracy/gamut that the display has). Honestly, it was very little to bother me at all, and welcome the increase color gamut. The screen is superb.- Kindle Free Time: this is absolutely great. I can let my daughter play with the kindle with some serious restrictions. (what apps can be accessed, how long she can play, read or watch videos (3 distinct timers). She can't do purchases or anything else. I can't believe nobody had done something like this before. It's really amazing.Cons- Neutered android means that a lot of very popular android apps are not available, and you have to resort to side loading them, and not all work that well. I really wish they allowed a larger percentage of the Google Play store apps (all preferred)- thick border around the edges, where the display could be extended to be even more usable without increasing the size of the device. It's around a 1.5 inch diagonal of wasted space. The iPad min in contrast his just a 1/4 of an inch or so.- And the worst offender which causes this to be a 2 star product instead of 4 stars, is the misrepresented battery life. Partner has an iPad2, (10 hour claim) and it generally lives to those expectations, lasts all day off the plug, great.The Real Battery Life of the HDX which claims to be 11 hours (up to 17 reading!!) is closer to 5 hours.Here are the tests I did during the last 3 weeks:The first day, I downloaded several apps and got it setup, read some books to my daughter, and watched a movie. I used the mayday button to ask about sorting apps by age of your child (can't be done as of now). It couldn't have been more than 4 hours, and the device was already at 10% charge (down from a full 100% charge) so I was really disappointed, and started doing a series of tests:Things to note:* Wifi only model (3g would suck the battery even more)* brightness was set to 50%.* I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and this is the first Amazon product that has really let me down with their claims. I owned a kindle keyboard, and now a paperwhite 2 - both of which I love. Customer service has always been second to none. Basically, there is no reason for me to \"bash\" this product. I am a tech person, and I am aware battery life varies quite a bit by usage, but this is a serious issue not just a small variation. Amazon failed to deliver big time on their battery life promise.Test 1:* 3 hours of mostly reading (kids books, so they had colors and things, my daughter flipping through the pages)* 1 hour of videos (she was unfortunately drawn to Barney)* Half hour of games (some simple puzzle games, nothing 3D intensive or anything requiring full use of the graphic processor)* Battery was down to 20% and I started surfing the web and others until it ran down in 1.75 hours.So basically, during a reading heavy session (17 hour amazon claim), the device failed to last 6 hours.Test 2:- Charged it overnight, let my daughter do whatever she wanted with it (using the awesome Kindle Free Time). She mostly watched videos and flipped through some books. She also opened a game or two (Again simple puzzle games, no 3D battery intensive games). She had breakfast in between and then lunch. And then brought the device to me because the battery was dead. The device lasted just over 4 hours...In contrast the iPad, where she likes to play with 3D puzzles and several other 3D apps (Mr Potato), she plays with it several days before it ever runs down.  I can confidently say that playing with apps, the iPad lasts at least twice as long as the kindle fire.Test 3:- Sporadic use throughout he day. I figure I'd try a really subtle scenario.- Light web browsing (not more than 30 minutes)- Some videos (1.5 hours)- occasional book (only 5 minute spans, or flipping through pictures)- The device was on the sleep state most of the time.- Battery life was at 30% that night. So 70% of the battery was lost during some 3 maybe 4 hours of use.I will do a strictly video test and post it later.But nothing I have seen indicates that any normal usage will get you anywhere near the 11 hour claim.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "P.

Both devices are extremely well designed. I can compare them to a Galaxy Tab 7\" and they come out far ahead, particularly that Amazon has realized the \"natural\" position for a 7\" tablet is horizontal, not vertical. The screen is amazing, which you'd expect from the stats, but for a tiny 7\" device, the speakers are actually quite capable. Sadly the HDX seems to have some hardware issues.The first thing I noticed was it frequently wouldn't connect to Wifi. I had the same issue on the wifi at work and at a third location. We also have several other devices, including the previously mentioned Kindle Fire HD, that don't have the issue. I decided to google the problem and found dozens of threads with similar experiences, including people who'd returned the device and had a replacement with the same behavior.The second problem I had was that the battery would drop as much as 50% overnight when left in sleep mode. That's just not acceptable to me. Again, we had the Fire HD to compare it to and the battery drop there was only a few percent. I tried deleting applications that might be activating the device while it was asleep, a factory reset, but nothing worked. Again, I found threads on the Kindle support forums with dozens of people experiencing the same issue, including those who got replacement units.I'd suggest just buying an HD, which is what I'll be doing the next time they go on sale.

Here's my history:- Amazon Kindle DX (hated it b/c it was too slow, clunky; sold it on craigslist after 3 months)- Apple iPad 2nd gen (loved it at first but when I tried to use for productivity, it was horrible; sold on craigslist after 6 months)- Apple iPad mini (after playing with it at a store, I didn't feel it was worth it so when I got it as a gift I immediately sold it on craigslist and got the Canon S90 camera instead)Despite this disappointment with tablets, I thought the Kindle HDX was a good value at its price point and would make a great gift for my wife. So I pulled the trigger and let me tell you, my wife is so happy (I'm a bit tempted to get one for myself). The screen is crisp and rich in colors, the OS is fast, form factor is perfect for personal viewing, super light (very important when watching a 2 hr movie), all previous electronic Kindle books look great on it, and the chambray cover I bought for her looks great. Also Amazon Prime membership makes the Kindle HDX have so much more value than the more expensive Apple iPads. We live in Korea and travel a lot so my wife is looking forward to using her new Kindle HDX on long transcontinental flights (now that they allow you to downloads some of the content).In order to lift the geolocation restrictions, we purchased witopia VPN ($50/yr) and setup the IPSec protocol.

I believe some places like Samsung Galaxy have a screen protection program they do. Amazon really should offer a better broken screen replacement program or at least let people send them in to get the screen replaced on theirs at a low price vs having to replace it at $149 just so they can turn around and resell yours at a $129 profit.Kinda sad program they have currently.Anyway..................I would suggest looking into other that are much more durable.

The original Kindle fire worked great and did what we wanted. While we have all the \"i\" devices from Apple, the footprint of the kindle was easier to deal with and overall it was a great product.The two HDX however have caused me nothing but frustration. One has FreeTime for my 6 year old, and the other doesn't. Let me go down some of the issues that have annoyed me greatly:#1 - The Kindle for my daughter has issues with staying connected to WiFi. It will drop connection and go into a constant state of searching for an access point. There are a total of 6 access points in my house, overkill yes, but I'm an IT guy... just goes with the territory. Going Airplane mode, Turning on & off WiFi, etc does not work. Only a full powercycle fixes the issue.#2 - FreeTime REQUIRES a password, and the only way to get to some of the kids apps is going into FreeTime. I trust my child, she is very mature for her age, she doesn't NEED a password MANDATED by Amazon. This is simply an annoyance and should be the choice of the parent.#3 - The Kindle with FreeTime also WILL NOT allow applications to be used when outside of WiFi range. It gives an Internal Service Error when trying any application in or out of FreeTime. I've researched the forums and this is a known issue which has not been adequately addressed by Amazon. I have tried every one of the suggestions, flushing the cache on the AppStore service (and one other, can't remember the name), deregistering & reregistering, reloading completely. I'm not sure what they have done to tie every app access to the app store, but this is a huge flaw and only seems to happen on Kindles with FreeTime installed (per review on the forums).#4 - Total Lockout of Google Store/Google Framework - Due to the 'pissing contest' between Amazon and Google, no Google apps can be installed. While the email app will pull your mail from GMail, you cannot load the actual GMail app, Google Maps, YouTube App, etc. You can force a sideload of an app, but it will be massively hindered because the Google Framework cannot be installed.#5 - Relating to number #4 - NO native YouTube app. My children watch a great deal of YouTube because they love MineCraft. However, because YouTube is a Google product now, they don't play nicely together. I've seen several times responses on the forums from Amazon folks saying to load one of the three third party apps which supports YouTube. Two of these are limited to only their selection of videos and have forced ads which my children don't need, and the third which actually allows access to searching (in a horrible non intuitive way) immediately started throwing up ads for ADULT WEBSITES. Great for the kids, eh?#6 - Also relating to #4, lack of access to the VAST number of Android applications which are available due to lockouts. While you can sideload after unlocking one of the settings, it still reduces the effectiveness of the applications due to their tinkering with parts of Android that truly don't need to be tinkered with.#7 - The 'Carousel' (the gigantic scrollable icons on the screen) is nothing but a history of past applications used. There is no way to keep your favorites in place, there is no EASY way to clear it. If the device was mine I would hate it as a privacy issue. Overall it forces you to use the text menus at the top more than anything else, or the search function to find applications you want to use. I personally just hate the interface.We debated long and hard between going with the mini-iPads, Kindle Fire HDX, or the various Android pads. Now that I have all of these for review, I would lean heavily towards something like my Samsung Galaxy Tab or other pure android device of quality. There are simply too many headaches totally caused by the effort to make this device proprietary and denying applications made by the developer of the OS, Google. Overall I've highly disappointed, this could have been a great product.For the Positives : Great screen, great size, better price than apple products.Once again, love Amazon as a whole... but I've tried to make these work for my family and yet my children run and get their 2 year old iPods which have tiny screens just to avoid using these.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely exceeded expectations.", "Author": "Frank L.

Kindle fire uses a modified version of google's android and limits you to Amazon's appstore which is mostly a watered down version of google's play store. I would consider this a con but there are some distinct benefits of the amazon app store. The first benefit is that amazon provides you the ability to use their amazon prime streaming service along with the major apps such as netflix, plex, ETC.Kindle Fire hardware- The kindle fire has top of the line hardware for a budget tablet. The quad core snapdragon 800 has great graphics capability along with great multitasking capability. The HDX technically has a better CPU than the 2013 nexus 7 and a much better CPU than the galaxy series. The screen has great colors and decent brightness with pretty decent viewing angles.Kindle fire battery life- I believe that the kindle fire battery life is subpar when compared to my nexus 7 and my wife's ipad mini. I typically get about 6-7 hours of streaming video whereas I get about 10 hours with my nexus 7 and about 11 with the ipad mini.Kindle fire durability-  The kindle fire is the only tablet that I've ever had a cracked screen with. The screen cracked just towards the edge because I stepped on it. I don't know if this is because I'm a fat bastard or because the screen is abnormally weak. I believe it was a combination of my fat bastard qualities as well as the thinner screen. I have dropped my other tablets and I have stepped on my nexus 7 and slatebook before and they haven't broken yet.Value- No doubt the HDX has great value. The hardware and software are top notch.Which should I choose- If you are a big google supporter then I would recommend a nexus 7 or a samsung tablet. If you are strictly using it for media such as netflix and amazon prime, no doubt you should choose the kindle fire HDX.all in all the tablet is great but there are some limitations which may or may not be the deal breaker.

Having received an HP Slate (Microsoft based tablet) at work, which I was allowed to keep when they replaced the HP's with Apple iPads (which I used for about a year).I wasn't even in the market for a tablet, but I had purchased a mobile hotspot plan through my wireless carrier (the hotspot was free with a 2 year contract) and was offered $100 off any tablet as a promotion for purchasing the hotspot plan.I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and am certainly glad I did. The Kindle performs flawlessly. It has a great picture - perfect for watching MLB TV games, offers a number of fantastic apps. (I especially enjoy my talking Bible, as well as many Bible trivia/quiz apps, and Hangman).I love the Kindle library choices and also love the fact that my Kindle can read my books to me. The Kindle HDX 7 also features excellent sound, so much so that I have yet had to use my external speaker.I find the HBX 7 the perfect size for carrying around - it is light, compact, and the controls are very intuative. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the Speaktoit Assistant app is not (yet?) available for the Kindle Fire HDX. I have this app on my smartphone and find it very useful.I have on occassion used the MayDay button, and found the customer service reps. & tech support people very helpful.I should mention that my wife has the previous generation Kindle Fire HD 7 which has also performed flawlessly, and my daughter has a Google Nexus 7\" tablet by Asus - which is also a fine tablet, however IMO not quite as well thought-out as the Kindles are. In fact for my needs I prefer the Kindle HDX Fire over the i-Pad, it's that good.I originally was going to use a case with a keyboard for my Kindle, but found that the touch keyboard performs flawlessly & there is no need for an external keyboard. (In comparison the touchpad keyboard on my HP Slate does not perform anywhere near as well as the Kindle's), and with the HP, I use a small external keyboard.I've owned my Kindle Fire HDX 7 for 4 months now and find it does everything I would expect it to do and more. I am surprised at how quick this little dynamo is. Kudos to Amazon for making such a wonderful little tablet. I should also mention that it has excellent battery life compared to the other tablets I have owner and/or used.I'm a completely satisfied customer, and keep Bibles and Bible Handbooks as well as a few other books in my Kindle library, and find it wonderful to be able to store all of  these on such a small tablet.

The mobile data appealed to me.Soon after I bought this device, I had an issue with an invalid SIM card. I worked together with both Amazon and AT&T; (the service provider for my 4G LTE). It was determined that the device's sim card reader was broken and the entire device needed to be replaced. I had to buy another device. I was given a discount on the condition that I send the old device back. I complied, therefore spending about $600 for the device.Now I have the new device. The sim card only works part of the time. I have to frequently reboot the device in order to get the sim card to work. Also, the Wi-Fi also stops working at times as well. I would have sent this device back for a refund, but I would have only gotten part of my money back. Therefore, I am now stuck with a device that does not serve the purpose for which I bought it.I have become accustomed to using the Kindle Fire product line, so I am not familiar with Apple's products and their effectiveness. However, considering the fact that I have now spent well more than anticipated for a device with mediocre network capability (at best), I believe that an iPad would be the better choice.If you are looking to use this device primarily offline, it is wonderful. It has a fairly stable operating system, the appstore has grown exponentially since its launch, and the display is beautiful. However, if you are looking to use the mobile data and Wi-Fi heavily this device is not likely a good fit for you.

Yes, most of my stuff revolves around google for the same reasons so many out there are also tied to the google eco system.

Games are extremely smooth and everything just works perfectly. That is, except anything that has to do with google. Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware. Their hope it to hook you into their ecosystem obviously but that leaves us google users having to find other options when it comes to keeping a single tablet with us. Example - I really do love my HDX tablet but I don't bring it to work with me. Instead I continued using my old Nexus 7 for the daily routine. The real odd thing here is that having access to google services on the HDX would not change my spending habits with Amazon.

I plugged it into my HDMI input on my Samsun plasma tv, found the connection procedures and shot the display over to my tv, after about 30 seconds or so it connects and everything works perfectly! I have a couple of little complaints about the Kindle in general. When I download movies to watch when I am not in Wifi mode, it takes a REALLY long time to download and if you try to download them in full 1080p, it takes even longer. I have settled for 720p on most movies but still takes a while. Also, when I fling movies to the tv, it does show in HD but there is fairly obvious pixelization so it is not as good as watching a Blu Ray disc. It also cuts out just a little bit every now and then but no big issues there. I got my email synced to the Kindle and that works fine. I also ordered Amazon Prime so I could watch free movies and tv shows but I would say less than half of them are actually free, which is pretty annoying. I will not pay $2 or $3 bucks to watch an older tv show when the reruns are free on tv. It would be nice if they had an option to watch them free with commercials or to pay for them. The same for older movies, we were going t Ho watch some older Christmas movies this year and several of them were not on HD Prime so you have to pay for a lot of older movies too. I am still getting to learn all the modes and I have not played any games yet so can't really reply to those. I do wish I had spent a few more bucks on the Kindle with the larger memory though, if you download a few movies, they will eat your storage space right up. Hope these comments help anyone considering this. Also, I went with the 7\" Kindle instead of the 8.9\" because I just could not justify paying almost $200 extra bucks for just 2 inches of extra screen when everything else seemed the same. I am quite happy with the 7\" screen as I use it on my train rides to and from work and I think the bigger one would be more cumbersome. Plus when I use it at home, I can fling it to the big screen.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality Control Issues / Yellow Tinted Screen", "Author": "Thomas Didymus \"Old Duck\"", "ReviewID": "R38IITFOA5PLJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE (01/03/2014) - My third replacement HDX arrived yesterday, and the white of the screen still has a yellow tint to it, but at least this tint is relatively consistent. It does appear to be just slightly more yellow on the right than the left, but it's not blotchy / spotty like the HDX it's replacing. I did an experiment to verify that I'm not imagining this tint - I set the Kindle overlapping my Macbook laptop screen, and side-by-side the difference in white is quite noticeable. However, since the tint is consistent and not blotchy, it doesn't take long for my brain to \"tune out\" the yellowness and accept the white as white while reading. I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I'd give it 4 stars, because I like the tablet as a whole, except that it took me three tries to obtain a Kindle HDX with a \"tolerable\" screen (I'll be keeping this latest Kindle). If you were to put all three HDXs I've used side-by-side, each screen would be noticeably different than the other when reading text on a white background. That just should not be the case.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I would give the Kindle Fire HDX four or five stars if not for the problems I've had with the screen. I'm on my second HDX and have just requested my third. My first HDX had something akin to \"dead pixels\" - a brown spot under the glass that looked like someone focused the sun on that spot with a magnifying glass. I returned that device immediately, only to get a replacement with a different but even more distracting screen defect that I can best describe as \"muddiness.\"I've owned a variety of laptops and tablets over the years, including the previous Kindle HD, and I've never encountered a screen that looks like you're viewing it through a thin layer of dirty water. The uneven \"dirty\" white is mostly noticeable when reading black text on a white background - which is most of the time when using the browser, news apps, or even just reading a Kindle book.When I noticed this right away on the new HDX, I remembered the story of iPhones having a similar problem due to a screen adhesive that takes time to dry, so I kept my current tablet for close to a month, using it every day with the hope that this muddiness would go away on its own. It has not. It is HIGHLY distracting, and despite the crisper resolution, I find myself wanting to return to my old Kindle HD. I've requested a third HDX to replace this, but how many of these tablets must I go through to find one with even a decent display?Just in case you think I'm fussy, I have no problem with the blue glow on the sides. The glow is in the margins and doesn't overlap text or video. If the glow was the only issue, I'd still give this tablet 4 or 5 stars. Like I said, I have lots of screens in the house to compare this to, and it's obvious that Amazon's flagship tablet should be at least on par if not better than the average everyday LCD screen.Others have had similar problems (search \"yellow HDX\") , and yet others, including professional reviewers like Ars Technica, have NOT mentioned these screen problems. This and my own experiences lead me to believe that there is a breakdown in Quality Control / Quality Assurance in the manufacturing of these devices. At the very least, it appears that the manufacturer of the screen itself is letting substandard displays out onto the market. If that's the case, then you are \"rolling the dice\" when you order the HDX. I'm about to roll the dice one more time, and I'll update this review if / when I receive my third HDX.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'll keep it short and simple", "Author": "jordan burks", "ReviewID": "R3V552VVOWGBLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantanstic tablet.

The resolution is ridiculously gorgeous. The charging port placement now allows for landscape use  while leaned against a surface. The 'mayday' customer service video call feature is fantastic with crazy fast response... which brings me to my reason for 4 out of 5 star review... I've found that when I have my Kindle charging while watching a video using headphones then remove the headphones the sound is all *bleeped* up.

I freaked out the 1st time not understanding so used the 'mayday' feature which was great but my tech guys voice was.. barely audible. I was able to make out what he was saying by giving him a close up of my ear canal and he did help me find the fix, to power down, not just turn off, then after the turn on it was fixed, YAY...

I use it for music, games, checking my email, social media, reading, and watching movies on Netflix. If you want to do it, you can probably do it on this device.-Gorgeous vibrant colors-More responsive touch screen then the kindle fire HD which means better control over whatever you are doing (especially important when I'm gaming!)-Physical buttons-Loud speakers-Quad processors make it run very smoothly (much better then the HD)-Came with a wall adapter and charges faster then the kindle fire HD-Updated email app easier to work with then the kindle fire HD's-Updated photo app makes focusing the camera easy-Music player is better organized and more functional-Rubberized backing makes a great grip, though this has not changed-Better accessories then Kindle Fire HD right out the door (I'm looking at you, origami case!)-Lock screen ads lead to FREE stuff and coupons! Why would I pay $15 to lose out on saving money??Cons:-Physical buttons placed in slightly strange places if you use the device primarily in portrait mode (I only switch to landscape if a game I'm playing needs it or I'm watching a movie). I've had the kindle fire HD for almost a year so I'm used to the buttons being in a set place so if you're upgrading that's something to keep in mind.-Charger and headphone ports are slightly slanted so when plugged in the cords jut out in a strange way-The infamous purple/blue light (I personally don't mind it since everything else is so gorgeous but you definitely do notice it while reading so I'm including it in cons I guess as a warning to others)-I preferred the curves on the back, if it ain't broke why fix it? BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade. I may update the review as time goes on because I DID just get the kindle for Christmas, but I've been a big fan of Amazon and Amazon Kindle tablets for years now.Edit 1: I've had the kindle for a few weeks now and I still adore it, but the buttons are quickly becoming a big hassle. I don't have 50 dollars to kick out for the official cases but because of the sudden change of the buttons locations finding different cases is extremely hard unless you search through amazon itself. For those who like ordering from amazon this is not really an issue, but those who would like to find a bargain without paying shipping on a case this is a downside.I was split on the button at first because I understand they wanted to change where the buttons are but because of the fact that I can never remember where the power button is and the case issue that's definitely a con.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, the screen and sound are amazing", "Author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\"", "ReviewID": "R3AR2BBRDJ0499", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally read on my Kindle and this HDX is great for reading, yes there is a hint of purple around the edges but frankly once I start reading I don't even notice it, probably would never have noticed it but for other reviews.

All of them love their tablets so that is the biggest ranking for this feedback.  We have used mayday and had fast and convenient service even on Christmas morning.  Overall these are excellent tablets, however, there are some drawbacks for parents:- You can not add passwords to each child's profile.  (If you have multiple children, they can easily prank each other by modifying or deleting content from another child's profile so be prepared for drama.)- The child or parent must enter the parental controls password every single time they exit from freetime. If you envision them being able to use freetime, but also to be able to exit freetime to use skype, youtube, the camera, or any other features outside of freetime app, this is a BIG PROBLEM.  The password they have to enter to exit freetime is the same parental controls password that prevents them from making purchases. Making the parental controls useless if you want your child to be able to use the tablet outside of freetime.-  There is no way to set up your children on your amazon account without them also having full access to all of your amazon account information, order history, and all of your other Amazon content.  You can get around this by setting up a separate email and amazon account just for children's kindles. but it is a hassle which still requires a credit card, or prepaid visa credit card if you anticipate using any apps.-  Very popular apps are not always available on kindle and this can cause big drama.  Two of our children got Furby Booms and expected to be able to use the Furby Boom App on their Kindle Fire HDX 7s.  The Furby Boom App is NOT available for Kindle Fire HDX.

Two years ago I bought the first Kindle Fire and have enjoyed using it however after reading the many reviews over the past year about the Kindle Fire HDX I decided to upgrade.Primarily I use my Kindle for email, listening to the radio, reading, and having the ability to listen to music at the same time.The personal docs is another feature I enjoy as I send my favorite recipes to my Kindle and can easily share them or do my grocery shopping for the ingredients without having to make a list.  I like the lighter in weight, sharp screen with brilliant colors, longer life battery, and better sound quality.  The screen does have less glare, but not as good as the e-reader.The original Kindle fire allowed me to download music directly from Amazon but haven't figured out how to do that with the Kindle HDX, also I had the drop box on the Kindle Fire but am not able to download the app on the new Kindle HDX from the cloud.  I take pictures on my smartphone and they go directly to my laptop computer, and Kindle Fire, and of course stay on my phone; a real convenience.  I am able to go on line to dropbox.com and view my pictures that way, just not as convenient.

I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 year old, who was obsessed with my iPad. I was going to purchase an iPad mini, but I thought the freetime feature would be perfect to avoid arguments about time  allowed and the price is hard to beat. First thing I noticed when I opened the device and held it is that it is very lightweight...this does make it easier to hold, but it also makes it feel a little flimsy, which was worrisome considering it is going to a child (albeit a very conscientious child who takes good care of her things). Set-up was a little obnoxious, but nothing terribly difficult, it took about 15 minutes all told. The screen resolution is indeed fantastic as all the rave reviews state. Also, the subscription service for childrens content is amazing, I highly recommend it for the variety of content (books, games, videos, etc.) available for a steal (less than $3 a month). While the Freetime feature is great to set time limits, allows access to great subscription content, and is very easy for children to navigate, it does have a few flaws. It consolidates all Apps into one group, so while you may want to limit time spent on games, you may want to allow your child access to things like an alarm clock feature or Skype. There is no means to differentiate between apps, and once their time is used, they will not be able to access anything which falls under that type of content. And to be honest, I still have to deal with my child's attempts to negotiate more time as she knows that the Freetime feature is customizable, so while it may be helpful for younger kids, don't expect it to eliminate an older child's attempts to garner more screen time. Second, the camera feature is really only for video-chatting purposes as it only faces the individual, so taking photos is pretty much out of the question. Finally, our first device froze irrecoverably after three days of use...major bummer. Amazon was amazing and promptly shipped us out a new device free of charge, and while this could have been a total fluke, it happened, and I have serious doubts about long term longevity of the device. BUY A WARRANTY if you need this to last more than a year or two. So having had the device for about two months now, I feel confident in saying that IF price is your determining factor and you are looking for a gift for a younger child, go for the kindle. If not, the iPad mini is probably a better bet for overall build, functionality, and versatility for an older child.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX = Epic Win", "Author": "Dairenn Lombard", "ReviewID": "R1NDUAFBCNASNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, owning a tablet for me seemed like a little bit of an oxymoron.  I am a power user--so I need a full-sized keyboard, a mouse (or trackball since space is at a premium for me usually), a huge screen and lots of storage, memory and processing power.  A laptop with that much capability costs nearly twice as much as a desktop, so that's what I use.  But more and more, I've been wanting to watch videos, browse photos or maybe quickly check e-mail and social media when I can't be near a computer because of privacy concerns or workplace rules.  So, I bought a laptop, but no matter how light, thin or small they get (with the old, short-lived netbooks coming quite close to what I needed), it was never convenient to whip them out on the bus or train, or while waiting for them.  Not to mention prudent in certain parts of town, unlike a tablet, where it might look like you're just reading a book in the right case.Before the Kindle Fire, your choice was an iPad or so-called \"affordable\" tablets that left you jealous of iPad users.  For me, the value proposition was poor--nearly $700 with no expandable storage, replaceable battery, the ability to use the on-board storage via USB for transferring or backing up data without the use of iTunes, and other edge-case use case scenarios that doesn't apply to the average Apple user, but did to me.  Then, with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, I at least got USB access to the onboard storage, and the ability to load apps that let me watch my video files and browse photos in slideshow mode, and at 50% of the cost.Plus, while other Android tablets like the Galaxy by Samsung and the Nexus by Google are becoming increasingly valuable offerings, I am actually a fan of the Amazon content ecosystem.  Google Play, to me, just doesn't seem to be \"there\" yet.  And I already benefit from iTunes on my iPod and desktop computer.  The Kindle gives me my favorite way to enjoy movies and, in particular, my favorite TV shows.  And Amazon's selection is vast (rivaling iTunes and beating out NetFlix and especially Hulu), especially for TV shows and music, having the biggest music library thanks to AutoRip on catalog items not even available at iTunes.  Even their movie rental system works better--being cheaper, less prone to experiencing spontaneous failures or other errors and integrating wonderfully with their entire system.  For example, movie recommendations can be based on past DVD (or even VHS) purchases, if you've been buying things from them for that long.It's easy to view rented movies on a full-sized HD TV (it was even easier with the mini HDMI output on the previous model), but today's LED HD sets are largely able to Wi-Fi their way onto the Internet, so this missing feature will largely go unnoticed, even for a tech head like me.  I understood going in that the purpose of the Amazon Kindle family of wireless electronic devices is to serve as an easy, convenient, user-friendly access point of their content whether it's e-books, newspapers and magazines or music, movies, TV shows and games.  The edge here is that you can have this remarkable value proposition at a far less expensive price point--even on the 8.9\" tablet.Of course, what I didn't like when I got the original HD 8.9\" was the nasty performance, particularly apparent during use of Silk, the Kindle Fire web browser.  The CPU was so obviously lacking in power for handling the majority of web pages I was visiting to look at pictures.  At first, I thought it was the sluggishness of 54mbps Wi-Fi compared to the 1 GBit/Sec. wired Ethernet connections available to my desktop and work laptop computer, but with this upgrade, I discovered that is not true.  The #1 benefit to upgrading from the HD to the HDX model was, by far, the fact that it is snappy.  Everything took forever on the old Kindle Fire HD.  On this device, I am flipping between apps, bringing up pages as fast as allowed by the bandwidth that I and the web server have, transferring files over USB at true 2.0 speeds without slowing down to calculate how many files have to be copied first.  Most important of all, apps do not crash all the time on the HDX like they began to on the old Fire HDs.  Pages routinely crashed Silk, even more so after the upgraded client, which supported a bunch of new features that I liked, but had maddening stability issues.And it wasn't just the browser.  The built in Amazon video app for playing movies streaming or downloaded from Amazon natively were forcing a hard reset of the device from time to time.  Sometimes, several times in a row.  My tablet was beginning to fall into disuse because I was beginning to expect any video playback was going to cause crashes.  Couple that with running out of space for loading new videos, and it was looking bad.Not so with the Kindle Fire HDX.  FireOS 3.0 is stable!  I opted for max storage at 64 GB, but, to keep it affordable, went with the smaller 7\" device, which ended up being significantly lighter and therefore easier to handle with one hand instead of two, and super fast to take out and put away in my bag.  Even though it's 2.9\" less diagonal viewing area, I barely notice the difference when browsing photos or watching video.  Especially since the color accuracy and sharpness of the 1080 (up from 720) HD-resolution video was instantly noticeable, even though it was over two weeks since I'd seen the display of the old HD 8.9\" that I had traded in.  I see the blue LED on pure white screens around the edges, but it doesn't bother me.  It actually looks pleasant to me.Between the stunning video display quality, super fast performance, stability, and expanded storage, I can now barley keep my hands off this thing.  I want to use it every chance I can get.  They really came through on this upgrade and feel as though the after-trade in money I spent was worth every penny.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well pleased with HDX.....but?", "Author": "MR TREVOR HUGHES \"Trevor Hughes\"", "ReviewID": "R1HV3PT052W8HR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Five stars for everything except instructions, the lack of even a basic manual means that you do not even know that to turn it off completely you have to press and hold the button for instance.However there is a good book available on the kindle \"Kindle Fire HDX User manual by Daniel Forrester\" which I have found very useful.

I wanted the download movie option, that was my justification, but also an added Kindle for where I eat breakfast and use the old HD Kindle for downloading podcasts and news; speaker volume is good on both this and last unit, vastly superior to first Kindle.  The performance is far superior in terms of speed, and in spite of the limitations others mention about downloading movies, I am okay with the limitations, use it to watch movies on plane trips or when there is no wifi. The unit is lighter, thinner and overall it has a feel of being well built, though so did the others. Reading it in bed is a bit easier, and it clearly picks up internet wifi better.The HDX is light years ahead of the first version, I have all three.  The first version works fine, easy to read, but the HD and now the HDX are major upgrades from the first one. I love the fact many books can be read out loud with a good voice and accuracy, which I use while eating.It is hard to imagine what the next upgrade will offer, and what their encore will be to motivate me to upgrade again.  It seems this is everything one could want, but then again, I thought that with the last HD Fire I bought.

We set up Kindle FreeTime and it has been a huge hit with our 3 year old.  We started a free trial of Kindle FreeTime Unlimited that gives her access to thousands of books, games, videos and songs.  Some of these are junk, but many are items we have purchased for other devices in the past or were considering purchasing for the Kindle Fire.  There are Boynton books, Ivy & Bean, episodes of Sesame Street, Dora and Mr. Rogers, as well as Cut the Rope, Monopoly, Life, Bejeweled 2 and other great games.  You can find a list of what is available on Amazon.com (currently over 1500 items).  While the videos are not a big draw if you subscribe to Prime, like we do, Prime members get a discount on the monthly subscription fee, currently $4.99 / child or $9.99 / family.  Prime members only pay $2.99 / child or $6.99 / family.  At $2.99 per month, I feel that Kindle FreeTime Unlimited is, by far, the best feature of the Kindle Fire HDX for us.  If you are a Prime member with children under 10 years old, I would give my strongest recommendation to the Kindle Fire HDX.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that balances form, function and price.  There are some key differences that set this tablet apart from the iPad Mini 2 and the Nexus 7.  The Nexus 7 has a slower processor.  The iPad Mini 2 has a 7.9\" screen with higher resolution but a much higher price.  The Kindle Fire HDX has no rear camera and the screen has a bluish tint on the edges from the blue LED lighting, but neither bother me.  The Kindle Fire HDX has the least apps available of the three, but all the android apps I like are available.  On the plus side, the Kindle FIre HDX is very user friendly thanks to it's clear and smooth interface and mayday help feature.  If you are an Amazon Prime member or purchase music, ebooks and videos from Amazon then the Kindle Fire HDX is a very seamless way to enjoy your content.My setup consisted of pressing the power button, selecting my language and wifi access point, entering my wifi password and confirming my Amazon account.  It took about 50 seconds.  I was immediately impressed by the screen's resolution, vibrant, accurate colors and wide viewing angles.  The screen automatically adjusts for ambient light, not just with changing brightness but also changing contrast.  Speakers sound good for a tablet, but i wish they weren't rear-facing like every other tablet.  The tablet is incredibly responsive; everything is instantaneous.  Wifi is fast and gets good reception throughout my house without dropping the connection.  The tablet isn't too heavy and feels comfortable thanks to the contoured back with good grip.  I'm not really the kind of person to use the mayday feature, but I see it as being one of the biggest selling points.

Then out came the iPad mini...just way too much for a perfect size. I literally carry my reader with me everywhere. So I began looking for a smaller device that was more economical. As I had hundreds of Kindle books versus Nook books, I chose the Kindle Fire HD. It works great and will be going to my daughter now...why did I get the new version? I liked that I could download from Amazon Prime...It is a little thinner and just a tad wider so it doesn't fit into a Kindle Fire HD case...odd...but that's okay.I did not have any issues with booting it up and receiving my media onto the device. I didn't even notice the blue haze around the edges...had to look for it after reading the reviews...seriously, folks are upset about that? I have never used the Paperwhite version so perhaps if I had I might have noticed it more.It is a little lighter in weight which is easier on my hands.

Something not addressed is the lack of HDMI and the inclusion of Miracast.I like it the HDX. What I don't like that there is no micro- HDMI so I took off 1 star for this. I really liked being able to plug into any screen to watch movies, etc. Now we have Miracast which is unproven and seemingly being forced on us by Amazon. There's not alot of options and if I want my TV's to work I need to buy at least 3 adapters.My question is specific to the Miracast function. Has anyone used a dongle to use the Miracast function? If so what product did you use? Amazon support not to helpful as the Indian call center does not even know the differences between the HD and HDX. I finally got to speak to someone in the U.S. and they sent me to this page http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201370390 where they recommend the Netgear option.Updated 10/25/13I officially miss my micro HDMI. I set up the aforementioned NetGear which does what it says and was the recommended product by Amazon. Good (not excellent) overall picture quality when watching videos, but there is some lag especially when you have to transmit to the Netgear and download simultaneously. This may be better if you took 30 minutes to download a movie 1st, but i have yet to test this. This current hardware spec running through micro HDMI would have been outstanding in my opinion. Miracast is OK, and I'm sure future tech releases will solve latency issues.

Feels really solid and well built. Appstore relative scarcity is not an issue since you can easily sideload APKs if you have them. But...1. When first reading about the purple border \"feature\", I figured it was overblown or exaggerated and wouldn't be an issue. I mean, I have a gen 1 Paperwhite and the faint light blotches seem negligible to me. However, the bluish borders on my HDX are neither subtle nor negligible in size and you can bet I'd be unhappy about them even had I not heard about them first. It is really distracting on anything with a white background. I read at least 10 industry reviews prior to purchase and I didn't see this mentioned once (apparently it was an aside in one review I missed). I have to think this means there is some variance between units and I got a bad one, while the reviewers saw the best examples.2. There's also some non-trivial screen flicker, particularly when I'm in the Settings pages. It's as if it's trying to auto-adjust the brightness, but I have mine set to manual.3. This is minor one, but how can a device whose stated purpose is multimedia consumption not have a graphic equalizer built into the OS?I'll probably wait a bit to see how this all shakes out, but I'm sure I'll be exchanging/returning mine. I'd be completely happy if the screen issues were resolved.***************************************Edit 10/25: Just had an interesting chat with the very courteous Mayday rep \"Cody\". I asked him if the blue haze is supposed to be the same width along all edges of the screen of all Kindle HDX's, and he said yes. I then told him the haze was wider along the long edges of my screen, and he said he's heard that as well (oops). I then asked him if the haze is supposed to be the same width and brightness along each of those long edges (where it's most visible), and he said yes. When I told him that the haze is much wider/brighter along one long edge than the other - the bottom edge opposite the camera, he didn't have a whole lot to say (oops #2), other than this is not considered a defect that warrants a replacement. I then asked him if every HDX exhibits this to the the same degree, and he said, \"they're supposed to\". When I asked him if they actually are all the same, all he would say was to repeat that they're supposed to be.It might sound like I was being a jerk, but it really was just a calm discussion where I wanted those specific questions answered, and there was definitely some waffling on their part. And they are going to replace mine, due to the screen flicker. But if you call with just the haze issue, be prepared to return rather than replace.

I bought the 64GB because I wanted space to download movies and apps because my 3yr old can't stream movies do to our data usage issues. Even though I PURCHASED these movies and DOWNLOADED them to my kindle, my three year old can't watch them now unless I take the kindle to a place that has a stronger internet connection than my cell phone and go into each of the 50 or so movies to 'reset' them because the kindle will start giving her an error message that she needs an internet connection to watch the movies (even though they are downloaded on the kindle!!). Also... even when connected to the internet, I often go into my purchased movies and don't get the option to play the movies. I have to go in and out of the movies a couple times to get the 'play' button to show up. I have also found this unit to be slow and unresponsive.I initially purchased this Kindle in Jan 2014. In less than a week I was calling support because it kept crashing. I had to reset to factory conditions and redownload everything twice in the first two weeks.

They refused to send me a new one as replacement so I am now stuck with a piece of crap somebody else already sent back.One of the features I liked most about the old Kindle was Kindle Free Time... this is now crap. You have to have an internet connection to even use it. Kindle Free Time is advertised as a safe way for kids to use the Kindle without worries about them accidentally going on the web or purchasing things.

She is constantly getting error messages and accidentally buying stuff because she hits wrong buttons. I have to watch my bank account very carefully and call Amazon to reverse everything she buys.

I originally bought my kindle so that I could play my amazon instant videos on the go without having to lug my xbox or laptop around.  I am now switching over to google's marketplace because i do not want to have to use a kindle.  Here are some of the reasons why I sent it back.1. Kindle Fire HDX is not able to access all websites.  I was on the phone with customer service trying to resolve the issue and this is what they told me.  I was trying to access 'stocktwits.com' and my kindle could not navigate there.  Apparently this is the case with various sites.  I frequent stocktwits regularly, so this was a big deal for me.2.  Since kindle does not support adobe flash, you have to switch between \"desktop\" and \"mobile\" mode to get videos to play on various websites.  No rhyme or reason to this, but an annoying step to have to take.  This again is customer services solution to videos that wouldn't load on certain sites.3.  The screen is not customizable.  This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but you'd be surprised at how annoying seeing advertisements each time you unlock your screen can be.  Customer service informed me there is no work around for this.4.  Kindles apps are not well supported.  I tried downloading the etrade app, and it didn't work.  the app would download, but it wouldn't work.  Etrade customer service informed me that they haven't fully developed the app for fire HDX's yet.  Not high on their list of priorities I guess.  I'm sure this is the same with many other apps.  I also could not download the stocktwits app.5.  There is a blue haze.  I know this is much talked about, but it is there.  It didn't really annoy me very much though.6.  Amazon uses the kindle to advertise to you like crazy.  My facebook feed had amazon ads at the top of my page.  my google email immediately became swarmed with amazon emails.  they suggest apps and items under the carousel.  they advertise each time you unlock the tablet.  i mean enough is enough!7.  I'm not impressed with the ease of navigating the device.  I think android is much more intuitive and user friendly, not to mention you have much more versatility since android is open source.Are there Pro's?  sure, but not enough to outweigh the cons for me personally.  It is a relatively snappy device.  The cost is low as well.  I think there are child protective functions if you have kids.If you are need to save money financially by going with the Kindle instead of a more expensive Android or Ipad (don't know much about Ipads), then a kindle may be for you.  But I was buying this strictly for access to amazon instant video, not so much because of price, and I was disappointed.  I really tried to make myself like it, since I love amazon as a company, but I am returning it and switching to Google movies.

The picture show vibrant color and inky blacks.  Plus the stereo speakers are much better than the others.  I have Amazon Prime and if your sole purpose for owning a tablet is to watch movies and shop online at Amazon, then THIS is the tablet for you.  iPad Mini and the Nexus don't compare to this Kindle for these purpose.However, there are downsides that became dealbreakers for me which led me to make the decision to return it.Dealbreaker #1:  The web experience is very sloppy.  It's not as smooth as the iPad Mini.Dealbreaker #2:  The camera quality sucks.  When using Skype, the picture quality is dark and very grainy. And, there's only one camera.Dealbreaker #3:  Your home movies do play on it.  But there is no easy way to rewind or fast forward smoothly.  Again, very sloppy.In the end, if your primary purpose for owning a tablet is to watch streaming movies and shopping online at Amazon, then you can't find anything better than the Kindle Fire HDX.  Internet browsing and the camera quality is where it falls short SEVERLY.** You just have to find what's important for you and what you are willing to live with for the price you are comfortable paying. **", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Reader On The Market Today", "Author": "Throbbin' Hood \"Carlin's Ghost\"", "ReviewID": "R5JPKT5RISRBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted a tablet for a while. I've also wanted to upgrade my Kindle Touch, which seemed very slow to me, response-wise. With iPad being pricey the kindle seemed like a natural choice. I considered getting the paperwhite, but thought a little extra would get me a lot more. I underestimated myself.As an e-reader this kindle does what you expect and more. I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.The web browser is great. Nothing mind blowing, but I didn't buy this to surf the web. The ease of navigation in the Amazon store (be it through the Amazon app or the Bookstore app) is supreme. Books and other items can easily be bought and books download immediately.I can't express my love for this tablet enough. It is definitely one of my favorite purchases in a long time.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

(I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.  It\u2019s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.  You must use it the way they want you to and accept their terms or don\u2019t use it.  Imagine buying a TV and not being able to watch certain channels, having automatic ads or commercials come on when you turn the TV on and finally, in order to use the TV you have to accept the fact that they will share the information you watch with certain advertisers.

I've been using a regular classic Kindle for book-reading for several years and I find the HDX 7 to be almost exactly the same size, slightly heavier, but just as convenient to use and transport - and with a wealth of great features! I purchased the upgraded version with 64GB memory, wireless only, and paid the $15 for \"without special offers\".  Great deal!  Colors are superb and the unit works fine with my AOL email & Facebook accounts.  Reading on-line news and FB text is a little challenging because of the small print but \"pinch & spread\" takes care of that pretty well although the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX would certainly be a bit better in that regard.  Book reading is fine, no problems, and the faint blue \"corona\" along the edges of the page is pretty inconsequential as far as I can see.Battery life is very good (especially when doing mostly book-reading) but if one is using a lot of battery-eating graphics a daily recharge will be a way of life.  Needless to say, my old Kindle shines in this respect because the battery typically only has to recharge once a month, but then the Fire HDX does *SO MUCH* more!Audio for music is adequate volume (although not ear-blastingly loud) through the speakers and great in headphones, and I find the audio quality excellent.  Controls are easy to learn and seem pretty intuitive to me.My only minor complaint is that the on-board camera faces the user, not the rear of the device - which is fine for Skype or taking photos of oneself if you're into that sort of thing - but then, who the heck uses a tablet for taking pictures, anyway?  I watched a fellow tourist doing that with his iPad when we were in Iceland and I thought - and still think - that it's a dumb way to take photos (I'll stick with my easier-to-carry and fractionally expensive digicam, thank you very much).FWIW, I'm 72 and strongly believe that any \"senior citizen\" who isn't embracing today's technology is missing out on a *LOT* that can keep life fun and the brain active. I've been using a compact netbook for several years while traveling but a tablet like the Fire HDX is a great and not bank account-breaking way to enjoy reading good books, catching up on email and news, following sports scores, using social networking, etc., etc., and all in a much more compact package.So, don't be an old fud, get with modernity!!!  ;-)", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" Tablet on the market!", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "R37ZK1X4Y66SO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best tablet out there.

The clarity of the pictures on this is amazing.  It's almost like watching a movie on BluRay.  That is how fantastic I think the picture is.  I am a Prime Member and  I like being able to download Prime movies and taking this with me and watching it at any time.  I can download a kids movie(s) and take it along for the kids to watch while traveling in the car.  I have the WIFI version and I don't have to worry when I am out of range of my WIFI connection.

Because it was an opportunity to try it for free, I activated the Whispersync Voice.  I was amazed at how easy it was to switch from text to audio and back to text.  Kindle  Fire HDX  keeps perfect track of the furtherest point you have read no matter which function you are using, text or audio.  I can listen to audio on the Kindle Fire HDX and pick up at the point I left off with text on my Kindle Paperwhite.  I think Whispersync Voice is one of the best features there is on this device.As I continue learning how to  use more and more functions on this, the more I love it.Bottom line, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX over any other device I have used.

Admittedly I was initially disappointed with the purplish edge.My advice if your HDX has that issue is to use your HDX for a few days.I now only notice it if i'm looking for it.* Everything is faster on the HDX.The internet is blazing fast on the HDX.Mine holds the connection well at home and at free wifi locations.* Navigation is much improved.On previous models you sometimes had to tap multiple times to get the screen to respond. Also typing was wonky.Most of the navigation worries seem to be a thing of the past.* It's nice and loud.Here is what bothers me a little :* Charging port is horrible. It goes in on an upward angle. Does not feel or look stable.Makes me wonder WHY is it designed like that.* Battery life is less than the previous model(2012 Kindle fire HD) Does not last long on standby.* I wish the power button and the volume were NOT located on the back of the HDX. I prefered the previous button locations.* I used the Mayday button to ask a question about printing from my HDX.Specifically I wanted to know where on the HDX could I  access the print screen amazon shows a shot of in the product tour video. Well my advisor answered fast but when I asked my question she kind of rolled her eyes and made an exasperated sigh. She then said hold on.Her screen went from a live shot of her to a graphic of a pair of headphones.Then another voice started talking to me.

The first, which I ordered before Christmas 2013 (a 16 GB machine, wi-fi only), had to be returned because of the blue halo-ing screen issue. Although I liked it, I already knew that if I tried the Kindle again, it would also have to have a larger storage capacity. So when Radio Shack had Kindles marked down for New Year's, I bit the bullet and grabbed a 32 gig. I am happy to report that the new machine does not have the screen issue and seems to work fine.My impressions of this tablet are that it is the perfect companion to tote around in lieu of its larger far removed cousin, the iPad. (True, the iPad Mini is just as good for a 7\" tablet.) Although one is a modified version of Android, and the other is iOS, they pretty much do the same thing, which is give the user the ability to consume media, albeit on different levels. It is true that Apple does have a larger app selection, and that some Google apps are totally shut out of the Amazon ecosystem--but I haven't found that to be a problem because the basic apps I want to access: News, Netflix, internet and a few others are available on both platforms. I also have no problem issue with the fact that the device only has a front facing camera. I don't Skype or use a tablet camera anyway, so it's a moot point. Both my phone and iPod 5th gen have cameras that work just fine when I want to snap a pix. People who complain about the lack really should research before they purchase an item. There are multiple review platforms on YouTube that show the actual device in real-world situations. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse when you have access to the internet.As for how the Kindle HDX functions, I will give it a thumbs up. The display is crystal clear, the sound is decent and the ability to access the content I want works just fine. It is true the tablet is linked directly to Amazon, but this isn't a problem. I am not a Prime member, but may go ahead and join later on. I also don't mind the screen saver-come-advertising, which often offers great deals in books I am interested in. It's not as annoying as I thought it would be, and I can always pay the 20 dollars later on if I decide I want ads removed.Overall, this is a nice little tablet to tote around, and covers everything you want at hand if you're confined to a situation where you want the basics without carrying around a laptop or larger iPad. Put on a nice case, throw it in a bag and go. You've got books, movies, email and internet on hand. Perfect in every way.One more thing I might mention. Yes, it is compatible with iTunes without having to purchase conversion software, and you can transfer your entire library to the Kindle with a few clicks. Sure, it takes a simple workaround, but the music transfers fine, even if you've purchased most your music through Apple, as I have.A+ to Amazon for creating an affordable, fun little tablet.

I received such poor customer service that I went out and replaced the Dell with the Apple PowerBook, their main competitor at the time. And, I never looked back. I have been a part of the Apple ecosystem for more than a decade now, and couldn\u2019t be happier. The design, the experience, the quality. Yes, I know, I\u2019m trapped in their rigid world and the man is holding me down.When they came out with the iPad the public said, huh? We don\u2019t need this, and then gobbled them up by the millions, because Apple had figured out what we were about to. People don\u2019t like to relax with laptops. Open that thing up and you feel the need to do something. It\u2019s because of the keyboard. It\u2019s an input device that is waiting, begging, for your attention. But a tablet is pure consumption. No work required. Just sit back, read a book, play a game, watch a movie. They adopted the Gillette model of business: They didn\u2019t sell the razor handles to make money, they sold the razor handles to sell you blades. The blades here are the apps. And Apple made millions off of the apps. Then came the followers with cheap, poorly made tablets to try and compete and each got smacked down in the process.So here I am with a first generation iPad, yes you read that right \u2014 first gen, and I\u2019m looking to upgrade. I\u2019m thinking the new iPad mini because I want a smaller form factor for flights. It\u2019s before Christmas and I\u2019m in BJ\u2019s. The Christmas lights are blinking and everything is warm and bright. I spy an Amazon Kindle Fire on sale for $99. That\u2019s interesting I think and I move along with the tasks at hand. The thought sticks in my mind and I start investigating the Kindle line. I\u2019m already in deep into the Amazon system; Being a writer my wares are mostly sold there, I need to follow Goodreads daily, and for movies I\u2019m already a Prime member. I take a hard look at how I use the iPad. Email, check. Browse the web, check. Watch some movies, check. But mostly I use it to read books and magazines through the Kindle app. I abandoned  iBooks  years ago. I should support my biggest professional partner, I think, and then start really looking at the Kindle line. Amazon, too, follows the Gillette model. They are selling the HDX almost at cost so that it is easier to buy books, apps, and anything else that Amazon sells.So I dig. I read. I go to Best Buy to showroom the models. And I\u2019m surprised. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re damn good. And they are half the price of the iPad with the same specs (64GB). I make a decision I didn\u2019t think I would two years ago when the first one came out\u2026I placed my order with Santa for a Kindle Fire HDX and waited for Christmas.Fast forward to now. Of course I got the Kindle as Santa is a close friend of mine and I have been giving it a stress test probably only seen in the Amazon Lab. Along with the Nexus 7 (Not Microsoft. Microsoft still doesn\u2019t get it, they want to make you work on the damn things.) there is a serious threat to Apple\u2019s market share. It is a beautiful piece of kit. Sleek and light with a rubberized back that makes it easy to hold while reading. The Kindle Fire is my new best friend. It took me a day or two to get used to where the buttons were but now I can\u2019t imagine them in a different place. The performance is amazing. HD games feel like they are on a console and reading on it is a joy. I know there are some complaints about the blue hue around the edges of the screen. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m okay with it. Those that keep returning theirs because of the hue are, in my opinion, a bit of the Princess and the Pea. Myself, I\u2019m impressed and ecstatic about the device, and can\u2019t say enough about it. If I find something, I\u2019ll post it here but don\u2019t hold your breath.Will I give up my MacBook Air? Not a chance in hell. iPhone? Possibly. iPad? Yes. Kindle Fire HDX?

The video quality was awesome. It was the video that they had on the demo model that was crap. Yes the new HDX models have that blue border when reading books. The solution to that is changing the background color to back with white letters. If there is one thing negative I can say about this particular model its the size. While using it to browse the web, I realized maybe the 8.9 model would be a touch better just bc it is bigger. But if you are used to using a cell phone to browse the web then its not really an issue bc u would be used to swiping around a web page. And one more thing. Why not put a second camera on this thing like the 8.9? That would make more sense. That would make the HDX 7 awesome! IMO, the only choice you have to make is which HDX to buy.

Since half of my media contents are purchased from Amazon, I thought it was time to look at the Kindle HDX, the only non-Apple tablet I would consider because of the specs and size.I was not disappointed with the size, both dimensions and weight. The tablet was easy to hold and I actually found the placement of the buttons in the back easy to get used to and use. I did notice the blue haze around the screen, but that did not both me.The reasons why I returned my unit were:1. I can only access half of the media I owned. The other half is on iTunes.2.

May", "ReviewID": "R2AQU6NH2GG4A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the seven-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (64 GB, Wi-Fi, Includes Special Offers) today and have been using it now for about four hours. This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

I was interested in the Samsung Note 8 (played with for a little bit at Best Buy). But Amazon offered me a 30-day free trial with a Kindle of my choice and I found that this was too tempting to pass up! Being an Amazon Prime member is awesome and it's truly the best way to get the full Kindle HDX experience! My 30-days are almost up and I plan on keeping my Kindle HDX. Here are my reasons why:1. MayDay. How awesome is this! I used this feature because I was having issues with one of my apps. The attendant came up as soon as soon as I pressed connect and was very patient and understanding while I was trying to explain my issue. Eventually I did have to get on the phone and speak with someone else but the attendant stay with me even while I was discussing my problem with the rep to make sure the rep understood what the issue was. This is by far the best thing about this device hands down!2. Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member then you already know that you can get free movies and shows but if you have a Kindle device you can also get free books through the lending library (this was new to me!) and there are a tones of books to choose from. Going back to the movies and shows, I like that I have the option of downloading them onto my Kindle for travel (great feature for kids!) or going places where I know I won\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi.3. Shopping experience. I shop a lot through Amazon (which is why I am a Prime member) and this device just makes it incredibly easy to do just that. I think the Amazon coin option for purchasing apps is a great idea and have used them on a few apps for my kids.The only down sides of the Kindle for me are:1. There\u2019s no true YouTube app. I love YouTube and watch it pretty regularly. There are ones available in the kindle store but the best one I found so far (vTube?) doesn\u2019t quite function the same as the Google app on my iPhone. You have option of viewing YouTube through the Silk browser but a dedicated app that functioned more like (or better than!) the Google app would be ideal.2. You can\u2019t customize your home screen. You have this huge carousel thing at the top of the tablet\u2019s home screen and some (random?) apps that are at the bottom. I would like the option of at least customizing this screen since it\u2019s the first thing I see when the tablet unlocks.3. The ads are annoying. I wanted to see how I would respond to having the ads on the tablet to know if it was worth spending the extra $15 dollars to have them taken off. It is! It\u2019s annoying! My kids have seen some ads geared towards kids and ask for the stuff! We watch Netflix, Amazon, and ITunes content exclusively specifically to avoid advertisements and this has reminded me why we do! Pay the $15!For the price and all the extras you get with being a Prime member, keeping the Kindle HDX is a no brainer for me!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "Marco from Brazil", "ReviewID": "R2PI0Q488IQPY5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good product I bougt an apple mini retina and altought the apple mini retina works perfectly and smoother than the kindle , I probably prefer the Kindle because the screen is awsome, less expensive and is closer with a pc operation , I can use apps from oputside amazon app store which is very good but limited sometimes.I bought the 64gigs that is much less expensive than Ipad mini and in my opinion a great a value for your money.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glad I waited until I get get this upgrade", "Author": "nopics_please", "ReviewID": "RVYXWE8X1DQUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so far I'm very pleased!

The lighter weight of this tablet is fantastic and feels great in my hands.

The eink has no back light and it is strictly black and white.I had no problem copying all my books and documents from the old to the new using my computer.  I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.  The app I was having a problem with this person had never seen before but yet stayed with me and helped me figure it out.  I had expected him to blow me off, after all how can he possibly know the intricacies if every 3rd party app, but he found a solution.  Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.  At this point I would really like to just return this Kindle HDX and wait until they work all of the bugs out of it and try buying it in about 6 months, but once again, they won't take it back for a refund.

I already have the Samsung galaxy 10.1 tablet with google, apps, so I was not going to miss the fact that this one did not.  The picture quality, like others have stated is fantastic, along with many other things such as Mayday, which I have not tried.

No problem.One of the criticisms I've heard is that you are bound to the native apps on the Amazon store.  The Silk Browser is a much improved native browser.  Loads fast.  Works well.  Like my contacts and calendar I wanted some continuity with my iPad and Mac environment, so I side-loaded the Chrome browser.  Works perfectly.  Instructions for side loading and using CalDav are all readily available online.  However, if you are not comfortable with computers, stick with Silk.  It's good, it's integrated and it's straightforward.  However, if you like what you like...you can side-load.I'm surprised at  the sound. Given the size of the speakers in this small form-factor, the sound is surprisingly good and at a decent intensity.The one feature I'd like to see is an improved method for organizing apps.

Amazon pushed me to Google movies and other tablets with business features.However, the new ability to download for no additional cost much of its Prime content for off line viewing for up to 30 days for each downloaded movie/show and the new wireless video display via Miracast was too much to pass up, or at least try.Incidentally, I bought the new Nexus 7 at the same time but returned it because you can not stream movies download to the unit.  One is required to delete the saved Google purchased movie from the unit and stream via the internet.  GO FIGURE.  Im not required to do this with my other android tablet.  FYI, you have to perform the os upgrade for the Nexus 7 to stream.I bought the 16GB, 7 inch HDX.  I did not notice the purple hazing some have reported.  Sixteen gigs seems to be okay because you have the option of what quality movie you download.  I think I will be able to save 15 movies or so, more than enough for a weekend.The display is excellent, the unit charges rather quickly and battery life good so far.I used a Netgear Push2TV to connect wirelessly to the TV.  It works great even without the latest Netgear update.  I didnt even notice a lag.  Only gripe is you have to enter into settings, then display and then connect, versus other units have a mirror connect when you swipe down the notifications.  You can disconnect more easily.NOTE OF CAUTION IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE CONNECTING:  All of these Netgear Push 2TV 3000's are not created equal.  I have three of these units, two that I have had awhile and connect to WIDI, though I have given up WDii and Windows 8, but wont connect to Miracast. These units say they have accepted and been updated, but they arent.I bought another unit two days ago and while it wont update, it works with both Miracast and WIDI (Windows 7).  If your screens simply instructs you to connect your PC/Tablet/Phone, you have the right model.  If you are asked to switch between Miracast v Widi, probably not gonna work for you with Miracast.  Hope this helps.I streamed documents and powerpoint, too.

I can honestly say that there is no other tablet that provides the value for the cost.Screen: 5 out of 5In order to really appreciate the screen, you need to download at \"best quality\" an hd show or movie from amazon prime. Then you need to compare it to an hd video on another tablet. The screen color and clarity is absolutely amazing.Sound: 5 out of 5Coming from an Apple device owner, I never expected much for sound quality from tablets until I got the kindle fire hdx. The sound is crystal clear and loud! I don't quite understand how it works because I have tried covering the sound ports but the sound is still loud like it may be coming from around the screen as well. Try it, you will be impressed.Build Quality: 5 out of 5You can tell that this tablet has a magnesium frame built in. There is zero flex when holding or moving the tablet around. Compared to the Nexus 7 which also has a rubberized grip, you can tell that the nexus 7 is plastic and the kindle is metal on the inside. The build quality rivals the iPad mini.Processing: 5 out of 5Phenomenal speed doing any task you can imagine. Everything is instant with no delay at all. Loading up videos on youtube is much faster than on an iPad, which is most likely due to the dual antenna wifi for the kindle hdx. There is zero stutter playing hd games like Fifa Soccer 14 and watching 1080p videos.Battery Life: 5 out of 5This was the one aspect I expected to suffer being that it is an android based device. Battery life never seems to live up to what the manufacturer claims because android seems to just drain the battery. I have been using the device for a couple days and so far, it really does live up to the claims. After watching several hours of video I still find the battery life around 80%. Charging is also quick. I expect that it will only take a couple hours to go from 0% to 100% charged.Overall: 5 out of 5This is THE tablet to own for 2013-2014. Amazon has set the price of the kindle fire hdx to dominate the tablet market. Unlike other tablets such as the nexus 7, the kindle fire hdx doesn't sacrifice build quality to bring the cost down. This tablet should honestly be $329 starting like the iPad mini, but Amazon is pricing the tablet to acquire market share and make back money from app, video, book, and Amazon purchases. Even if your not a prime member, you should buy this tablet and become a prime member because it is very worth it.

I've owned Kindles in the distant past and have not been impressed with e-readers or tablets in general.  I'm an old-fashioned book reader and really didn't think I'd like an e-format.  Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.  I have to travel soon and the thought of lugging my usual pile of books was not appealing.  I have been absolutely blown away by the functionality, ease and intuitiveness of this little device.  I used it right out of the box and put it through a good workout.  In the few days that I've had this, I've already received a $3 offer for free music (which I snapped up right away) and a free book (which I learned comes once per month - cool).  I've downloaded free books - classics that I've really wanted to read.  I've watched my Prime Videos and Netflix and the sound without headphones is remarkable!  I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.  I like the Silk browser, and for what I need it for (checking and answering email), it works.  I don't game, so I don't know much about these functions.  You save a bit when you order with \"the special offers\" included and they're not annoying at all - in fact, that's how I learned about the free books.  In hindsight, I'd probably go up in size to the larger Kindle if I ordered again.  My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!  I also recommend getting a cover for this - it's a good investment.  I saved a bit by buying off brand, but you might want to invest in a true Kindle cover to protect your device.

Not only does its features allow for a comfortable read, I can carry all my books with me!

It is lighter weight and I like the on off button on the back.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.

There are some good basic apps on the Amazon app store, but there are several apps that I really wanted that are not available there.

All of the Fires have some flaws, that is to be expected.  BUT and heres the BIG BUT.  The fire, first and foremost is supposed to be for reading.  If it does not do this one simple thing well then why have it?  The blue ring literally hurt my eyes, to the point that I had to set on on dark mode to read.  Why have a Reader that hurts to read?  Every one that I have ever seen reviewed had this same issue. I figured that \"they\" were all being picky.  No sir, it was horrible.  I couldnt watch movies either because on any screen that was white, there was that blue tint.  In the end I returned it and am now using the first gen HD7.  I am thankful for Amazons return policy and the great customer service, but am appalled that they thought this was a good product.

I'm so sick of searching message boards every time I have a problem with an electronic device or electronic service of some sort.  When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

Mizell", "ReviewID": "RUV69N8BOQ6Q5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a casual user, mainly for Internet, news, e-mail, weather reports, games, and some other things of interest.I've had the tablet for 4 days now, and have found no problems at all.As for the reports of pages on the e-reader with the blue edges - If I hadn't read about it in reviews, I wouldn't have noticed it at all. It's barely there, and certainly not an issue.While I cannot go to the Google app store, I've had no problem finding what I need.  I found a nice Gmail app (Tab for Gmail) on the Amazon App Store. The Silk Internet browser works just fine.  I was able to get my favorite games (Flow Free and Candy Crush Saga), and there is no shortage of others.When I started up the tablet and input my Amazon log-on info, it synched up with all the books I've obtained in the past from Amazon, and had on my Kindle e-reader (old version with the keyboard on it).Setting up my e-mail accounts with the provided e-mail browser was quick and easy.So far, I haven't had to read directions, but I did buy an after market instruction manual from Amazon, which I intend to use.  Amazon has a Kindle support page on their web site, with loads of good info.  Though I've not had the need for it yet, the Kindle Fire HDX has the \"Mayday\" option for free, instant help from a real live person.The speed of the tablet is very fast. Moving from one screen or app to the other, or changing pages is FAST.  No problem with connecting with my Wi-Fi at home, or at work.The display is excellent, and very sharp.  We also have an Apple iPad Air, 10\" size.  The display on the Kindle Fire HDX is just as sharp as the iPad.  I see no difference.I spent the $15 and turned off the \"Special Offers\", and disabled the suggested apps thing just below the carousel view.  There are instructions on-line if you Google something like \"turn off special offers on Kindle Fire HDX.\"  No problem.  All gone.The tablet comes with a $5.00 credit at the Amazon app store. They call it \"coins\", and you get 500 of them to use when buying \"paid\" apps.  Once spent, you can re-up the coins for future use.Things you buy, like paying for apps, books, and everything else you might like, goes against your \"one click\" ordering account on Amazon.com.  Very handy, making it quite easy to spend money if you like.There is a good variety of cases/covers available for these tablets, many available on Amazon.com.  I have the Poetic Slimline case, in black.  Great case or cover, for a great price.I haven't found any negatives yet, and I don't regret getting the Kindle Fire HDX at all.  In many respects, I like the Kindle Fire HDX more than the Apple iPad (which is a great tablet - but about 3x the price - for one with 32GB). The price for the 16GB version is very reasonable.  I lucked out and got mine for free, using up my credit card bonus points I had earned.The battery seems to hold up quite well.  I'd estimate that I ran mine about 9-10 hours before charging it back up from only 5% left.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Kindle Fire HDX, but HATE customer service for Electronic Arts/Origin.", "Author": "Robin Setliff", "ReviewID": "R2R7ZCSPM7USE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire HDX, but absolutely hate that you can't get any answers from Electronic Arts/origin regarding a forgotten password.

I have to say I love it. My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

The screen is brilliant and beautiful, except for a few features which are not so pleasant.The purple/blue bleed people talk about, its real.  It is annoying and distorting.  I only read books in night mode, where the background is black, so the blue doesn't show up.The second issue is that in a large number of non-native apps, the screen flickers.  Sometimes it is just a little bit, once in a while, but in some apps, it can get to the point where it is so consistent that it gives an almost instant headache and makes the app unusable for more than a couple minutes.  I did find, however, that just hitting the power button and then turning it right back on again (so that the screen turns off but not the kindle itself) can temporarily get rid of, or at least greatly reduce, the flicker.Honestly, the display issues really make it feel like a cheap tablet.  Which is disappointing.  My wife has a first generation nexus 7 and I wish I'd gone for a second gen of that instead of the HDX.  We've found no issues with that tablet in the year-and-a-half she's been using it.A big upside is the ability to download free prime movies and tv shows (the downloadable ones are a much smaller subset of the free prime videos, but as someone who watches little tv, there's plenty there that I've never seen that will last me for a long time) which means having the ability to watch movies on the plane, in the airport, or in the train without internet.In all, the kindle is a good entertainment device for videos, but the screen issues mean it falls short of expectations in other areas, including reading and writing, which I'd expected to use my kindle for quite a bit.

My old tablet looks like crap after seeing the quality of this Kindle. It is very \"user friendly\". I thought I might need to buy a book to help me figure it out, but it is pretty straightforward and there is a help function built in. It is sooooo faaaaaast!!!! I am loading apps in 1 second compared to 10 or 15 seconds. I guess that is the difference between the dual core and quad core. I already had most of my apps from the Amazon App Store, so that was a bonus. This tablet comes pre-installed with the Amazon App Store (which gives away one free app of the day FAOTD every day). Transferring to the new tablet was almost seamless. You have the option at setup to become an Amazon Prime member, which would be good if you like to watch TV episodes or movies (one free month, then pay). Amazon Customer Service is fantastic too!! Maybe some of the people that complain about it would complain about anything, no matter what! I found Amazon Customer Service knowledgeable, kind, FAST with helping.

Secondly, the camera is a big disappointment unless you do nothing but selfies as it does not have a back camera. On the upside it is easy to navigate, the screen colors are very vivid and Amazon does offer a lot of apps, some I just find useless or don't want to install. The Mayday is also a great feature unless your device is completely frozen.

First, it IS a fantastic device.  Incredibly versatile, lightweight, with an amazing screen.  I have always had (it's probably me) trouble using Apple products, as for me, they simply aren't as intuitive as others, and I don't like I-Tunes, so the HDX was a logical choice.  It is very reasonable in cost, and for those who need it, the Mayday feature is sure to be a big hit.  I've used it two times, (could have easily found the answer to my question myself, but wanted to give it a try) and the help Amazon gives IS all it's cracked up to be.  Very convenient. This device is super fast, and dependable.  I won't carry a cell phone, but with this, you can load on a free app from MagicJack, and you're good to go!  Free phone calls are always great, right?  So, why not five stars? As with most tablets, there are the occasional hang-ups while online, mostly while trying to view a video, say from Yahoo.  Can be frustrating if you're not ready to just let it go.....just don't need to see it that badly.  It can lock up the device.  Some videos DO work, but not all. Not a biggie though, just disconnect, get back on, and move on.  Hey, this can happen on my laptop, and who amongst us hasn't experienced that?  This aside, this thing is so easy to use, if you can work your laptop, or desktop, you won't have to learn a thing......no jumping through hoops like I-Tunes to load music......just drag and drop it from your laptop, and voila! Very intuitive. I bought, and suggest the 32gig model, just to be certain you'll have plenty of memory, as you cannot upgrade the memory.  The sound from the built in speakers is nothing short of amazing, and of course through the headphone jack as well.  Maybe I should have given it FIVE stars.  One last thing......I almost was set to pay for the 'NO OFFERS' (which you can also do at a later time if you don't do it when you first buy the Kindle) but was glad I didn't. The offers are GREAT, the screens shots are brilliant, and you find yourself looking forward to them when you power up.

When reading ebooks or viewing an all-white page theres a blue tint at the edges of the screen. A quick google search shows that this is pretty common and has to do with the LED backlight.

The new Fire is harder to read a book on because of the glare of the pages.  Much prefer the old one's easy on the eyes screen.  I don't like the dictionary at all.  You have to page through from a to z to find the word you want.  Waste of time.  I don't much care for the games that are available.  I like word games.  I play several every day such as crossword and Scrabble on my old Kindle.  The choice of games on Fire are mostly juvenile ones with sound effects which are irritating and most of them will only let you play a game or two without paying the company who created them more money.  On the old Kindle you pay for a game up front and play to your heart's content.  I also don't like how frequently it needs recharging - even when it's just sitting around doing nothing it needs a recharge in no time.  I do like that I can pick up my email without starting up the computer. I can check it while I'm sitting around watching TV, etc.  However, you can't trash the email on your computer from your Fire, so you end up trashing it from the Kindle, then when you get into your computer, the emails are still there and you have to go through the process again..  I also don't like the front only camera.  It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.  Perhaps going up to the next level would have been better, but that was a great deal more expensive.  I'd say this is an okay device if you like to play the games a lot, don't use the dictionary very much, either don't read a lot of books or have young eyes.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.

The color screen is crisp and, as a color screen, is more suitable for technical volumes than the B&W; Kindles. The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough. I appreciate being able to jump to a browser to research something I encounter in book I am reading. The Silk browser is much improved over previous instances. The mail app is also good enough for casual use.I don't watch videos on the Kindle so I can't comment on the performance at that task.

This is because the HDX 7 has a great high definition display, is easy to use, and seemed to have better connectivity to the internet than did my old Kindle Fire. Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect. I had not tried connecting in other environments other than in my home where I have high sped internet through a cable company. Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle. This was very disappointing as I had been reassured by the Amazon chat tech that the connectivity problems had been significantly improved (in the HDX 7'). For this reason, I made the decision not to order the 4G internet (Verizon) with it and ordered solely the WIFI connection for it. I am returning the device in the morning.

The processing speed and memory are among the best for 7\" tablets.  The screen is fantastic, and even the sound from the speakers is impressive.  Another great feature is the ability to view Prime Instant Video.  Access to free movies and TV shows (some of them are even downloadable for off-line viewing) is an added bonus of having an Amazon Prime subscription.The tablet is also great for kids, or individuals who aren't very tech savvy.  Its very intuitive to use, and the parental controls are fantastic--even allowing parents to set a designated period of time that their kids can play with the device.  If you are a parent, someone who is looking for an easy-to-use device, or someone that simply wants to watch videos, read books, and play simple games, then the HDX might be your tablet.However, I was looking for a more traditional Android experience and I just couldn't get past the Fire's heavily modified Android operating system.  First, the operating system offers very few customization options.  For example, you cannot change the background screen, have access to widgets, or customize/organize your home screen as you would for other Android devices.  I also use the Swiftkey Keyboard on my Android smartphone, which has helped productivity when sending text/email, however, the keyboard on the HDX cannot be changed and Swiftkey is not available for the HDX in the Amazon Appstore.The real nail in the coffin for me was the inability to access Google services.  This means you won't have access to the Google Play store, which has a vastly improved app selection over Amazon's Appstore.  You also cannot access Google Hangouts which I use frequently for text/chat messages as well as video calls and videoconferencing.  Further, I use Google's Chromecast to stream video to my television. The Chromecast app is unavailable on the HDX.The tradeoff of purchasing another Android device over the HDX is the inability to use the Prime Instant Video.  Amazon has provided an Prime Instant Video app for Apple devices, but has not (and I suspect will not) produce one for other Android devices.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over this because I didn't find the selection of free movies and TV to be all that impressive.  The selection of free movies that were downloadable to the device for off-line viewing was even less impressive.  Most of my video viewing on the tablet was through HBO Go, Hulu+, or Netflix.All in all, the HDX is a decent tablet with great hardware that unfortunately stumbles on its software.  If Amazon were to offer a Kindle device with the same hardware, but with a more traditional Android software experience with a slight Amazon spin (a la the Samsung Galaxy Tablets), I would certainly be willing to pay a higher price for the device.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's Only O.K.", "Author": "fearn0evil", "ReviewID": "R2CIX400A3M8VY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its alright.

The Send To Kindle app is such a neat thing, I've been able to send documents straight from my Mac to the Kindle over wifi, which is so simple and genius. The only thing I haven't figured out quite yet is if the battery always drains as fast, or if there are apps running the background and I'm just not sure how to turn them off completely. It's a simple thing to do on my iPad Mini. Between the Mini and the Kindle I prefer the interface of the Mini, but the size and screen of the Kindle.

I have even downloaded Craftsy classes and view those seamlessly as I sew right along! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Kindle!!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Kindle Fire Hands Down", "Author": "David Cripe", "ReviewID": "R1NWRE8PDA313L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Kindle Fire HDX during the cyber-Monday special of $179, which was totally worth it as that price.  My family has owned the original Kindle Fire the past two years roughly, and this one is way above that version.  Is it better than the Kindle Fire HD version?  Depends, but probably not if price is your biggest factor.Pros:1) iPad Contender - Seriously.  The iPad in my opinion is way overpriced for what it does.  The Kindle Fire HDX is just as capable at handling most of the same work flow with a couple of differences.  Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.  If Google Play was standard, then Apple might be worried.  Right now though, Amazon is crippling their own success.2) Fluid Performance - Smooth as butter.  I have played around with everything available for the past two months and it handles it all with excellence.  Games, work, reading, etc run flawlessly (app issues not withstanding).3) Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.  Made the original Kindle Fire look like a 10 year old non-HD television.  I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).  Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.  I actually kind of like it.  If you read a lot on white backgrounds, then it pops out more than normal.  The haze falls to the background after I begin reading the first page of something, and I never notice it much any more.4) Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!  :)  No cord carousal here.  If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.  For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!  Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.  What a concept Amazon!  That might catch on with other electronics (sarcasm).5) Bells and Whistles - This thing has it all (mostly).  Dual-band WiFi, HD screen, Amazon support (best in the world), light as a feather, etc, etc.Cons:1) Amazon App Store (sort of) - No Google Play?  I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.  I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.  You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).  Just irritating to me for some reason as everything else has it straight, so your mileage may vary.3) Mayday Button Gimmick - I am a computer-savvy person.  I don't need help on where to press the power button or tweak the brightness.  If you are buying this for grandma or a person that never has used much technology in the past 10 years, then this is a life saver for you (no more annoying phone calls).4) Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.  I just wish I could get the Kindle reader battery life of 4 to 8 weeks.  :)Overall:This is finally the Kindle to put Amazon in striking range of Apple on the tablet front.  If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.  If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.  If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!  :)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R22FZPHTPJ6OYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "New owned a Kindle or a Tablet and got this for Christmas and I love it!

The woman who \"reads\" to you doesn't have some weird voice, but you know it is mechanical. It is not annoying. Music sounds really good even playing it without headphones. I use it for almost everything: email, browsing, games. The games are bright and responsive. I have not used MayDay as I am figuring things out.  The battery is more than satisfactory and I have found it to last most of the day and part of the night. Email gives me some trouble and I learned quickly to check it before hitting send. You wouldn't believe what I sent to someone. It is a good candidate for \"Damn you autocorrect\". We had a good laugh about it, though. At any rate, I recommend the HDX. I just couldn't wait for the larger one, but I find the 7 inch is just fine. Thanks Amazon. People have complained you have to use so much Amazon items.

I also have saved pdf docs of patterns and tutorials on it. My HDX works beautifully, in the standing case, on my jewelers bench for various metalworking guides and for offline use.In my kitchen, the HDX is  a recipe book,  with recipes from the internet via wifi as well as files saved offline.Basic Pros -- The images & sounds are  crisp and clear,  which is a significant improvement over the original Kindle Fire.- Easy to use & navigate for the slightly less tech savvy (I'm an art geek not a techno geek and comfortable with Apple products.)- Kid friendly, my 2 yr old niece and 8 yr old nephew enjoyed an interactive story on it as well as the usual kid games and apps.- A lot (1000's) of free Kindle books, lower priced reads, samples, and the Prime lending library for a monthly freebie.Basic Cons --My 64gb 7\" model doesn't  have  a rear facing camera but it's not enough of a con to knock a star off. I use a DSLR for my art pics and my iPhone 5s for my out-and-about snapshots, so using the HDX for an occasional selfie or web chat is  great.-The battery life isn't as good as it was on the old original Kindle Fire. Since this version does a lot more, it makes sense, and because I charge it daily.  I don't have issues with it dying on me in the middle of activity.- Overall this Amazon addict is pleased! -My  new lightweight Kindle goes everywhere with me.

I had the first kindle reader and I just got used to the software. Long story short, the kindle hdx was a completely spontaneous purchase and I couldn't be more impressed. Score sheet:Pros:1. Price. $200 for the 16gb model with ads. With cloud and prime, more than enough for us for a reader/surfing device.2. Screen. The clarity is awesome. Colors are solid. Really just a must see.3. Speed. Crazy fast and really responsive. Really slick.4. WiFi. Two antennas and better range than anything else in my house.5. Layout. Love the screen and the carousel is ingenious. Just a tweaked android os but Amazon did a great job making it all work.Cons:1. App store. Weak. Not as bad as I thought but needs help.2. Battery. Solid but not stellar. Haven't compared side by side but I really feel like the 3rd gen iPad has 20% more and it's almost 2 years old.I guess that's it. It's not flawless but if you like Amazon, are a Prime member, and you need a fast little internet friendly super fast tablet, this should be high on your list.

He gave me the option of a Kindle or an iPad so I choose Kindle because I wanted something different; we have a few Apple products already. Unfortunately when I received the Kindle, there was an issue with the volume buttons on the back. They only worked half of the time. When they did work they were kind of glitchy and the times that they did not work, well, you would push the buttons numerous times and absolutely nothing would happen. So Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. Once again, this Kindle had a problem as well (maybe I have horrible luck?). This time the area that should have displayed AT&T; 4G and the signal bars read \"INVALID SIM\". It would not work. So I went to AT&T; and got a new sim card and it still did not work. I returned both Kindles and decided to not receive a third.Things I did like about the Kindle: I liked the size. I didn't really want a big tablet so the size of the 7 inch was perfect. I liked the back side of the Kindle. The iPad's back are metal so I see them as being more likely to slip out of your hands but the kindle's back made for a better grip. I like the display. Also, the speakers on the back of the kindle were great! It has a nice surround sound like quality.Things I did not like: the hardware issues.Overall, the Kindle itself was nice but problems with the hardware were not okay. I did not want to keep having replacements shipped to me until I found one that worked 100 percent. I believe that once Amazon does some more work on these devices they will be really great but until then, the Kindle is not the tablet for me.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy, happy, happy", "Author": "Unknown", "ReviewID": "R35CNOEDGHIAWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an \"android\" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a \"fix\" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7\" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need.

I was worried whether I would get enough use out of the device to justify the cost (First tablet), but no longer.Pros:The shipping was quick and on time and the packaging was excellent.The device was received with a full charge on the battery. the charger appears to be of great quality.Camera/picture quality is great. I Skype a lot.The battery life is very good thus far. I can get about 12 hours of steady web use, 8 hours of constant streaming, and have left it idle for 3 days off charge and still had 99% battery life. I can take it to work for 14 hours with sporadic work related use and end the day with 30% battery life.The device functions smooth and quick. The processing speed is top notch.The display is so clear, HDX is great for viewing pleasure. No problems reading books in sunlight.The speakers are very clear and can get quite loud.Navigation is easy, not confusing at all.Amazon's free app of the day are usually high quality apps.Amazon also has these kindle customer only lightning deals that offer some serious value.Cons:The Device has, on 4 separate occasions, refused to respond from sleep mode. Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

Without any changes from the factory set up, we had to charge the tablet once every two days with about 45 minutes use each time.  Unacceptable.There is a lack of educational software compared to Android and Ipad.The software for kids is okay.  There is quite a limit on what they can do unless you subscribe to the special kids software for $2.99 a month.Like most tablets, there is edge bleeding from the backlight.Other tablets offer desirable features like GPS, SD card, a rear facing camera and better software for a better price.Amazon does not carry cheaper cases like ebay does.SummaryAs an educational device with occasional video viewing, the Kindle HDX has fallen short of our expectations.  The OS is limited and the kid time application sacrifices a lot of capability without buying an add-on program.  If it were a tablet for me, it would be fine if I could find something to extend battery life.  I can see most people enjoying this tablet.

She was on the phone for several hours( at least 3+ hours and 3 separate calls ) with tech support before they figured this out. I understand that the registration process is intuitive for most generations BUT a simple fact sheet with a tech support phone number would have been very helpful.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was  a Christmas present to myself, and it was a great price to boot.  I found the setup to be ridiculously simple (already having an amazon account and another kindle), but I think that even first time owners will be pleased.  The videos on HD are very crisp (using a high speed router and Xfinity), and optional \"Amazon Prime\" for $79 a year provides the owner not only with free 2 day shipping on all \"Prime\" items purchased, but thousands of movies and shows are included.  There are a good number of \"apps\" available (many are free), and hundreds of free games.  For the price, this tablet certainly provides a quality interface with the internet and is more convenient that sitting at a desk or carrying a laptop.  I have also found many books and guides (borrow from Prime or purchase) that will help users to get the most out of their Kindle.  If you love videos or reading, playing games, \"Skyping\", or even phone calls (yes, there is a way to do that), I believe that you love this tablet.

As a 5th year student I really didn't want to (nor could I afford) a new laptop that will be replaced by a professional computer in a year or so. So, I thought on black Friday why not try for $180. I own the 2012 kindle fire and thought it was this seemed to be a good choice. I got a Bluetooth keyboard for this to make it a \"real laptop\", because I mainly write essays and it does well. I like this new kindle so far. I can type with a Bluetooth keyboard on word apps which helps a lot for the normal college student. I am not a tech geek or anything, just needed something to get me by for the last school year. I had a normal 15\" laptop then a netbook that both died out in college so I really didn't want another expensive computer and this is a good replacement. I don't plan on this being a forever replacement and I don't think other people should either. I use it to type and play games on it. The kindle is really thin which I love. At first I was hesitant because I was fine with the 2012 fire but I needed something better to write essays on. Now I think this is new one is fine. Overall, if your looking for a basic tablet that can do things like write in polaris app (or in king soft, whatever) and play app games this does very well. If your looking for a tablet that is more photo sharing, personal details, bigger screen, etc this may not be for you. I haven't had a problem with it and advise a person to get Prime with it, you can download movies and watch them without internet (great feature).Down sides:Yes it's a kindle, you can't have a screen photo and they're adds but for the normal person thats not much a bothersome.The power button and a volume button are on the back of it. I find it a hard transition coming from old fire to the new one. It beats me why they'd put them on the back. I find the power button on back a little bit of an annoyance but new fire users may not. This also makes it an issue because if you have an old kindle fire you'll need to buy a whole new case and NO OTHER KINDLE FIRE CASES WILL FIT IT! (You have to specifically buy an HDX one). I bought one thinking they would but nope. Normal CASES cover the power button on back; I still use the non-fitting case because I don't want to spend more money on a case.It is only 7\", no surprise there. But it is on the tiny side for tablets. I didn't mind in on the 2012 kindle fire and I don't now. If you have a giant cell phone it may seem odd because they're close in size but I don't have a high tech phone so this really doesn't bother me.This version does have a front facing camera, I don't know how many MP.

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3RK1YPEQMC4EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to like? This is probably the best piece of hardware out there for the price hands down. I have 2 iPads, iPhones, iMac. I love the Mac environment and iOS.  The hardware is obviously quite expensive, but if you use the device even 1-2 hours a day I would pay the extra and get the iPad. If you don't use the device regularly or if you're an Amazon-o-phile and your whole world revolves around Amazon, the Fire is the only logical alternative IMHO.  I prefer my iPad in almost every way, but I like the small size of the 7\" to carry to town, mall, church or whatever instead of hauling around the iPad. It's an amazing price, and that's the best feature about this device.  I love the nice PPI resolution, which makes me feel right at home while reading.  The speakers are the next biggest stand-out feature that I really love about the HDX.  The first time I sat down to watch a movie on it, the sound literally blew me away!  It made the movie twice as interesting to hear the amazing surround sound or perhaps even 3-D sound if that's possible, awesome bass, great range, nice to hear it coming from both sides of the device when in landscape mode, all things I would expect from the more expensive iPad, but dont find! Also plenty of power if it's anywhere near close enough to see the screen.  I just have to gripe about the Amazon tweaks and control of the Android OS that just doesn't feel as customizable or as intuitive as plain old Android OS or obviously iOS.  Again for my purposes of mostly reading books, and the occasional movie, or browsing, this environment is actually just fine, but not my first choice, perhaps after using it long enough I'll learn to actually appreciate it, we'll see.  I wish it could be thinner and lighter of course, but I'd rather have the longer battery life that it does have vs. being lighter weight, with technology where its at right now.  I'm thankful for the wake sleep feature with the right case. I love that it has BT where a lot of cheap tablets in this price range tend to leave it out.  So far I've found all the Apps in the Amazon App Store that are important to me, so the App limitations haven't really bothered me yet. They seem to have a really good selection.  I do like not having to worry about bugs or viruses by only using Apps that are patrolled by Amazon, kind of like Apple does. It gives me a nice feeling of security.  Over-all, I can hardily recommend the HDX to anyone that doesn't use iTunes, or have an iPhone or Mac.  And to those looking to just get their feet wet in the tablet experience using it only occasionally. If you plan to really be using it a lot, I would instead highly recommend paying the extra money to get an iPad mini or Air, it's well worth the extra investment.  However this is a great starter tablet for kids or to just dabble yourself a little bit to see if tablets are really all they are cracked up to be!  I didn't get on the tablet bandwagon for almost 2 years, thinking they were just a passing fad, and were terribly limited compared to netbooks... well, after I saw they weren't going away after all, I got one, and I have never regretted it since!

It was very easy and quick to set-up and your having exploring and having fun. I am considering enabling the parental controls to limit my time on it!I purchased the 7\" because in my mind, I could not justify the jump in cost to get the equivalent 32GB in the 8.9 HDX fire. I also wanted something that would fit in my purse vs. having to carry something else around. I was a bit concerned about the ability to read text on such a small screen, but it really isn't an issue because the screen gives a very crisp picture and there is a magnify feature. Don't get me wrong, if you need glasses to read, you will still need glasses to read ;) I am very happy with the speakers for music and movies, etc.. You get a healthy volume with a quality sound that others in a room can easily hear.There are some neat features that I don't believe are advertised. One, is on the keyboard. There is a microphone symbol that when it is selected, transcribes your spoken word into text. Also, I was confused about whether a anti-virus or malware app would be required. The community forum had a number of conflicting opinions on the subject, so I chatted with kindle support. The representative assured me that the Kindle is already designed with all the security algorithms necessary. She added that there are apps available for anti-virus and malware if anyone wanted them. In addition, she advised me that the browser has a option called Security in the options menu, which will provide you a warning if you are about to Enter a potentially harmful site.Bottom line....

I have the old Kindle Fire and a Galaxy Tab 3, 10.1. Amazon did a great job with all the little extras they added to the HDX. If you have an old Fire a side by side comparison will have you loving the HDX. It is lighter,  faster, easier to maneuver around the system, the presentation/organization is cleaner, and the screen itself seems to keep off fingerprint smudges better. Another favorite is the ability to put books in collections. A set back on this ability is not being able to change the listing of the books within the collection's pop up window. The only available view is a grid view, and it's hard to see the books in this view.I would say that the volume output on the new Fire HDX is better than the Galaxy Tab 3. You can easily understand the conversation on videos and hear the musical notes on online radio as long as you don't become too picky about the notes. Picture quality is better than the Galaxy Tab 3 too. The colors are clearer, image is sharper, quite comparable to one of the better HD TV's on sale today. I was very surprised at discovering this. The TV we have takes quite a bit of power, now I just watch Netflix and Hulu on the HDX and get the same quality, less electric consumption, but not the big screen.Good battery life if all you're doing is reading or listening to music. Expect to plug it in more if you surf or watch videos. If you are planning to use it in sunlight, you'll need a lot of patience, but that is not the reason for buying the HDX. If most of your reading, watching and surfing activities are indoors, then you'll be fine.I bought a Fintie cover for it, the Fintie comes with 'buttons' that go over the HDX's existing buttons. These make pressing the power and volume buttons easier, and allows for better touch recognition too.Does it take the place of a laptop? Absolutely not. I do not believe any tablet will ever take the place of strong processors and lots of storage for people who 'work' on laptops.

When I use the wi-fi to do downloads, everything on my wi-fi slows to a crawl and my Internet movies on Amazon and home computer freeze till it is done.  I think my phone company only offers 100 Mbps with my current package.

They are positioned in A way vest suited for holding the device landscape, while I would personally prefer them to be positioned in more of a portrait manner.  Another plus to the device is the Appstore has grown a lot since the first kindle fire.  It has most of the games that iOS has.  The only thing it lacks is a a program like word, excell, and PowerPoint.

As soon as I logged in with my account all my kindle content synced up! I got the free trial so I had picked the kindle with the ads and I did not feel like the ads were bothersome at all. They mostly showed up when the tablet was in a 'sleep' status so I saw them when I was turning it back on. I even clicked on some out of curiosity since they are items I would be interested in. I did not add any extra apps so I just used what was already installed. It was a bit of a learning curve since I have been using an iPad but I was able to figure it out without much trouble. The browser is user friendly and the menus are not hard to use (once you figure out where the controls are). I mostly used it to watch movies and shows from amazon since I have Prime. I loved being able to take it around the house and not have a sore wrist! It is very light and the screen felt pretty hardy so i didn't worry about scratching the screen or the possibility of it dropping. The screen was crystal clear so I thoroughly enjoyed watching movies and shows on it ( the imdb inserts during shows and movies were a plus for me). I thought its size would be a disadvantage but it felt just like a regular size tablet. I liked that I could easily carry it in my handbag without feeling the extra weight or bulk! Battery life was decent. I was able to use it continuosly for at least 3 hours before it got critically low, although I noticed that even plugged to the wall it would somehow still be on and wouldn't be 100% charged? (could have been tks I wasn't physically turning it off during charge time) I assumed that maybe it was because ads popped up during this time. I had a hard time returning it but I wasn't quite ready to part with that amount of money right then. I still want to get one for sure!!!! So basically to sum it up, this tablet is a small, delightfully light, hardy, crystal clear, fast (in my opinion), and handy tablet. If you use Amazon a lot, it is a great tablet to have! I buy and rent e-books from Amazon, and have purchased most of my music from here too so, it was great to access all my content from it! I didn't think I would want one but after test driving it for a month now I really really do want to get one!

So far only Weather Bug and Pet Rescue Saga are the only ones I really miss. I wish I had chosen the option of adding a Verizon line rather than having to rely on my mobile hot spot for WiFi. I also miss having the ability to turn off the screen auto-rotate feature. The charging cable is a mini-USB which is convenient, since it's interchangeable with my phone.

After much research I purchased the Kindle fire HDX mainly because it advertised the ability to easily control access to content for children.  In fact, on the Kindle Fire HDX website under the \"Kindle for Kids\" section it states \" Parents can create a profile for each of their children and choose what books, apps, games, and videos they want to give their kids access to.\"  This sounded great and exactly what I wanted for a media device for the kids.  However, upon setting the new Kindle up I found that the maximum number of accounts possible is 4.  We have five children and thus this obviously does not allow us to establish an account for every child.

After reading reviews and doing product comparing on tablets, I decided on a Kindle Fire HDX.First impressions:I loved the look and feel but since this was my first tablet, I wish Amazon would of included more information and instructions.  It took me a few minutes just to unlock the screen.The plugin came with an adapter and I was thrilled because I didn't want to have to use my computer to charge.  The angled way that the cord goes in is a nice feature but made me uneasy the first time I inserted the power cord.Setup was very easy once I remembered all my login and password information.Charging time was about 6 hours which isn't too bad but I was quite impatient waiting.The first app that I downloaded was Candy Crush.  That process was easy and only took a few minutes.After a month of use...I love it.  The picture quality is excellent.  The sound quality is better than you'd expect.  I play a few games, browse Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest with ease.  You'd think you were on a computer with as fast as things load.  I've watched a few things and was really surprised by how good it looked.  I've also visited websites that aren't \"made for mobile\" and was thrilled that they work perfectly.Although I love my HDX there's a few things that I wish were better, improved, etc....Battery life.  I mainly just play a few games and browse a few places but the battery seems to drain kind of fast.  Just doing a few simple things each evening and I have to charge it every other day.  I couldn't imagine how often it would need to charge if I used it throughout the day.Availability of apps.  There's so many apps and games that are only available for Apple and Google so I wish there was more compatibility with Amazon and the Kindle Fire.Ability to watch YouTube videos without an app would be nice.Ability to play Java or Adobe Flash games or videos would be wonderful.Some questions...Care and maintenance.  What's the best way to ensure overall battery life?  Should I let the battery drain completely sometimes?  I have a case.  Do I need a screen protector?  What's the best way to clean the screen?With winter now here, how does the HDX do in cool or cold weather?  Should I keep it at a certain temperature for use or let it warm up before using?  What about summer heat?Like with computers do I need to clear the cache sometimes?  How do I maintain it?  Is there maintenance like on computers that should be done?  Are Kindle Fires at risk for trojans, virus', malware, adware, etc?  Is there a firewall?  What can I do to protect my HDX?Overall, I am VERY happy with my HDX and I'm glad I chose it.  I would recommend it to anyone that was wanting a tablet.  There's many things it can do and it is good for almost anything and anyone.

I bought it on the first day of Cyber Monday when it was 50$ off and honestly if you know how good the HDX is as a tablet in itself...it is totally worth it.I was alittle scared when I received my package today because it looked squashed. Amazon can't help the parcels journey but they put the Kindle in a tiny box with no protection like  bubble wrap etc. I turned it on to make sure everything worked and it is fantastic. The processor is super fast ( Better version of the new Nexus' 7), the screen is beautiful ( better than the iPad Air ) and it is barely 11 oz. in weight.I read alot of negative reviews about a \"defect\" with the lighting on the screen. If you do your research, the Kindle uses blue LEDs instead of white. The blue backlight in the device allows less power consumption and it provides the screen with a vibrant crisp image.The bottom line is, If you are getting a tablet as a gift this season, right now at this price, it doesn't get any better. The Kindle Fire HDX is a tablet that is proving to out do Apple and Google. If you are tech savy you can side load Google Apps or even root the device now.

Google Nexus 7 (2013)7.) Nvidia Shield8.) ASUS Transformer TF-101First, let me say I think the Kindle Fire platform is really nice when compared to the straight-up Google android experience.  Amazon does a great job of bridging the technical gaps for a user wanting to use a tablet and not have to constantly enter their email and password.  The Amazon docs, photos, music and video compare better in use to Apple's iCloud experience and makes the Amazon prime a solid investment.  Additionally, the horsepower of the Kindle HDX is amazing and makes this tablet for the holiday 2013 season a solid gaming platform.  My own benchmarking of the Kindle Fire HDX shows that gaming performance and CPU performance place this unit within the same performance bracket as the current generation of iPads and the Nvidia sheild.  Which is saying something when the HDX is half the cost of an iPad mini and 2/3rds the cost of a Nvidia shield.My disappointment comes from the screen on the Kindle fire HDX.  The HDX's screen shows a very visible and noticeable blue ring around the display's edge.  I've measured the blue ring to be one-eighth of inch along the long edges of the screen and slightly less on the short edges of the screen.  These blue edges really become notable when you are reading a book or browsing a web page that have white page backgrounds.  The blue ringing is much less noticeable when viewing the carousel page (which are grey) or running a app that uses something darker around the edges.I can not recommend the Kindle Fire HDX to my friends, family and colleagues because of what I consider to be design defect in the screen.

The new features in the Mojito OS are terrific additions and make owning a Kindle Fire much more rewarding.  Its everything you could want out of a tablet...except for two things.There's no HDMI port.  It didn't even occur to me to look for this, the old Kindle Fire HD has it, so I guess I thought it would be a given.  Instead it relies on Miracast.  Miracast is supposed to be like a wireless HDMI standard, but you have to buy a $50+ device to make it work.  The other thing missing from this is USB hosting, which is present in every Android 3.1+ device.  I wanted to use my Kindle Fire HDX to upload photos from my camera to Facebook and the like while I was out on vacation by using a Micro USB SD Card Reader.The no HDMI thing doesn't bug me as much as the USB thing, I really wanted to be able to look at my vacation photos on my Kindle Fire HDX while I was out on vacation.

But, if you plan on doing just about anything else, the Kindle HDX is an excellent choice.  You'll never notice the blue edges, except for maybe web pages.What blew me away most about the Kindle was the sound.  I have had every iPad since day 1 and have always just accepted the speaker quality.  I'll still use my iPad simply because of all the Apps I already enjoy, but for movies and TV shows I'll go to the Kindle every time.  Amazing sound.  Why can't Apple do this with the iPad?Bottom line is:  Buy it. It is well worth the money.  I bought the one with the ads and they don't really bother me at all.

The set up was very fast, love that the charger is included this year. The Kindle came already registered to me, saving time in setup. I have not set up email yet but previous versions worked fine. The wi fi connected very fast, an improvement from the HD model, where at times I have had to turn the kindle off and on to get a connection.  This is slightly smaller and lighter than the HD version. That is not a plus to me because I like the wider edge on the HD. So an old case will not fit. What I do not like is the rearranged buttons for power and volume! They are located on the back side and the kindle will require a specialized case in order to access them if it is being used in the case. They also did away with the HDMI port ! I use that feature on my original HD model frequently. Also the cable port is at an angle and off to one side. This is probably because the device is so thin. It compares to the I pad mini, but the mini has a larger viewing area.  If you have last years model I would keep it. If you do not own a Fire yet you will not be dissatisfied with the HDX.  I have not tried out the camera, I am already spoiled with the I pad mini camera which is wonderful, so it does not make a difference that the Kindle has one.

Since then I have tried out different tablets, smart phones and computers and over the years I have been buying more and more Apple products (I currently have the 5s, Ipad 3rd Gen and MacBook Air) and I still think Apple makes a hell of a product but my wife and I also still enjoy our kindles.  I am also a Amazon Prime member so when I saw the new Fire HDX and the good reviews I thought I would give this \"mini\" a shot.  So far everything has worked very well and the first thing that pops out if the graphics...  they really pop and it is eye candy.  The second thing you notice is the speed, this little guy is fast and while I agree the application store is a little limited it does well with what is available (and I am sure since Amazon is selling a lot of these things that the developers will make many more and ensure popular Apps from other devices are also offered on this...  might just take a little time for them to show up).  The third thing I noticed is the OS is clean and user friendly.  Some people might think its basic or limited but they have a very common sense approach on how to get to all the content.  when I was using this I was thinking... if I was going to get a tablet for my parents or non tech savvy friends and family this would be it.  With the clean easy to use OS and the mayday  option I could see this being a cost effective option for many people.  I end up being the tech support person for my family when anything breaks or has an issue or just end user questions so I think this device would take care of most of that.  Also after trying this out the last few days I now notice the weight of my full size Ipad and while at home I still enjoy using my Ipad the HDX is what I grab when I walk out the door.  Its does everything I want when I am out and about but in a much smaller lighter easy to use bundle.  So if you picked this up for the Cyber Monday deal of $179 this guy has a lot of bang for the buck, if you already use a lot of apple devices I am sure the Apple Mini is just as good though it costs a little more but if you want to try something new, want something that is a little more cost effective or easy to use for the more technology impaired (or if you have Prime membership) then this is worth the shot.  Amazon also has a great return policy if for some reason you decide the HDX is not for you once you give it a shot.  I think it's a keeper and I might end up getting a few more for my Parents and In-laws as I think this is something they would enjoy and could handle that would cut out the ongoing IT support I usually have to provide ;-)", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible value, and just plain incredible.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3PTBYQ85CD7V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in awe.

I also like that I have access to all the books I've bought in one place. It's a lot easier to carry this around than it is to carry around a heavy book.Cons:I'm not so fond of where the power button is. It's kind of awkward to find. As well as the charging port. It's at an odd angle and I have to actually pay attention to what I'm doing when I plug it in.The apps from the Kindle store are few and far between. There aren't a whole lot of them.

There aren't as many apps for the Fire as you have for iPad, but I'm guessing that's just a matter of time before they fix that.I mainly bought the Fire so that I could add my very extensive book collection to it. For reading I've been using the Kindle Touch 3GB, and I have more books than I have space. I found it tedious having to add and delete books all the time. I thought the Fire would be a good step up.If you have a couple hundred books, the Fire is perfect for your book collection. But if you're like me, and have been using Kindle for years and have a 6K+ collection, you might be disappointed.First, you have to click on every single book to import it onto the Fire. There is no batching. I really wish they could have had an \"add whole collection\" option. Importing is tedious at best.Second, you can't just import your old collections and believe that all books will automatically place themselves in the correct collection. First of all, I now have collections from my very first Kindle on the Fire. A Kindle that has been deregistered from my account for ever.The collections that did import correctly, are a mess. Books are missing, or the wrong books are in the wrong collection.Then there is the books that aren't in a collection. If you're viewing your books as collections, you can't find the books that aren't in a collection. It is simply impossible to figure out which book is in a collection and which book needs to go in a collection. I like to organize my books, and collections were the perfect way to do so. On the Touch, that is. On the Fire, it's all a big pile'o'crap, and I can't figure out what's up and what's down.So far, bookwise, Fire has been a huge letdown for me. I was really excited about getting the new HDX with the 64GB hard drive, thinking I'd finally be able to put by books in order. Not so much.As far as reading experience, the Fire is very good. The screen is clear, the text easy to read, and it doesn't hurt your eyes like the iPad does. Which is the only reason I give the Fire HDX 3/5 stars. I really hope Amazon updates the OS real soon where you have the option to import your whole collection with just a few clicks. And most of all I hope they fix the collections issues.

I'll update the review as I get to know the HDX as time passes. I use the HDX daily for 2 hours on average reading and surfing. I use a PaperWhite 3G at work and at home and have used previous E-ink Kindle generations for daily reading in the past. Kindle Fire is growing up fast. The vastly upgraded device response and fluidity are already well commented on. The extra speed when surfing the web and navigating the HDX are again a big step up, good work. There is very little display reflection, improving reading once again this gen. Text is totally, faultlessly sharp.A very cool software feature in the Kindle app are the extra Wikipedia and Translation boxes that come together with the dictionary definition box, totally cool. Silk works better, taking many opened tabs in its stride and making the most of the display size with the cool article mode and nicely working full screen option that takes away the tabs and adress bar to move the page upward. I always found the iPad 4:3 display ratio appealing, but the Silk features mentioned above make the 16:9 ratio enjoyable for web surfing while keeping the device as small as possible.The form factor is again much improved with the HDX generation, no apologies necessary anymore. It's much more manageable than my previous generation HD 7; noticably less circumference and a third less weight. The physical buttons are very tactical, unlike those on the previous gen., and the sometimes mentioned \"angled\" USB port feels and looks solid, not at all awkward. The bezels are smaller and the plastic outer enveloping rim much more so giving a very tight, high quality appearance compared to the previous gen.In my opinion, Amazon have at this generation arrived at a wonderful compromise between \"boutique\" (like iPad) and \"utility\" (previous gen. HD) moving steadily toward the iPad. Also with the HDX, there is a better compromise between Amazon presence (say, like an Amazon website-type environment) and an open Android presence (like any generic android tablet) with the HDX showing beautiful, eerily sharp lockscreen wallpapers, app icons matrix and book covers, with removable recommendations which, removed, leave an \"Android or iPad like\" home screen save for the background, which is (in my opinion) nicely dark with classy icon shadowing.Battery life is at least as enduring as on my previous gen. HD. Sound is as good to my ears.UPDATE:I have some clouding, showing a brighter spot of about an inch in the centre of the display, which is visible on an even background like when reading. I can only get rid of it when switching to white text on black. The slight blue border bleeding is also present, but doesn't bother me at all.UPDATE 12/3/2013: I've requested and was right away permitted after a short live chat an exchange HDX to arrive in a couple of days, amazing stuff!UPDATE 12/5/2013: I received my replacement HDX today. What a miracle of logistics; from across the Atlantic traceable almost to the hour. Even my return HDX I can track. Boggles the mind. Well, I must say the clouding is less with the new one, but I can still see it. My daughter (painter artist) shakes her head and says: \"You exchanged it for that?\", when I show her the \"faulty\" one. Must be me then. I'll accept it as a HDX character trait.UPDATE 12/14/2013:The HDX performs excellently, the smaller size and mass, and the very sharp, defined characters are more appreciated as time in use passes. The new ability to sort cloud content in collections is much appreciated. Silk occasionally froze. Disabling page load acceleration solves that.This device is a big improvement over the previous HD; better ergonomics again, better display, less glass glare, much more zip, diminishing the E-reading gap with the glorious PaperWhite. My PW is certainly used less for reading since the HDX is here. As we live in the real world, I think the price:quality ratio is very important, and the HDX has made that ratio more favourable again for my ends, which are: reading E-books, internet news and watching news videos with the best possible display quality and low weight and size at a good price. Weighing the above factors, the HDX-Amazon combo is unbeatable. What I would call a Serious Tablet.Job very well done,Recommended!UPDATE 1/5/2014:For an Epub reader app, I can recommend Aldiko, downloaded through their website via a sent link for the free, non-ad reader. Really hassle-free, with only the basic options for good reading, not playing. The only caveat is crashing of the app with large .Pdf's. But it's not really needed for those; the embedded Kindle Reader app is superior for handling .Pdf. No need to waste space installing the Adobe Reader.For a good enough productivity app, I can recommend the King Soft Free version through the Amazon App Store. No ads, no hassle, easy connection to Google Drive.Good File Manager app: Free no-ad ES File Manager through the Amazon app store. (You can get easy access to your Cloud Account by adding in ES through documents/network/add (+ key at bottom, pick your account)Good Task Manager: Free no-ad ES Task Manager through the Amazon app store.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX is even better!", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"Chuvasia\"", "ReviewID": "R1FRVSKFODHZFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being able to download Prime instant videos is sweet!

Overall, I am very very please with this purchase.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a Great Effort...", "Author": "lucidDream", "ReviewID": "R4POGWZTQFV5W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" yesterday. I've owned nearly every generation of the standard Amazon Kindle and use the Kindle App on my iPhone (and on my wife's iPad). I thought about getting an iPad for myself, but I was just looking for a backlit device to read Kindle books on with text-to-speech. The grad-school text book I'm reading on Survey Methods is pretty dry and I was hoping to listen to it in the car (it's not available on Audible). The latest Kindle Paperwhite doesn't support text-to-speech so I went with the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I tried to read was a course handout (PDF). The font-scaling on the PDF document was blocky, inconsistent, and difficult to read. This wasn't the case on the iPad, even on the iPad mini without a retina display. With low lighting in the room it was hard to ignore the uneven backlighting towards the edges (dark and/or purple fringing on all four edges).I switched over to the Kindle and went to read through an actual Kindle Store purchase. I reversed the colors (white text on black background) to make the screen easier on my eyes and make the backlighting issues less pronounced. There was immediately noticeable color-shifting on the white text towards purple. I tried to ignore it and kept reading. I went to try out text-to-speech in the middle of an all-text chapter and it wouldn't play. I turned the page and tried again and it played fine. There doesn't seem to be any logic as to which pages will/wont support text-to-speech.Pros:More feature rich Kindle app than the iOS versionText-to-speechCons:PDFs don't scale wellScreen backlighting near edges (I've never seen a backlit display where the issue was this pronounced)White-text color-shiftingWith the above issues I can't recommend this as a Kindle device. If you're looking for a tablet this is really only an iPad alternative if 1) You can tolerate the display issues and 2) You don't mind using an OS designed to be a reading device first and general-use tablet second. I would almost call this a secondary tablet device.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this tablet", "Author": "Reflections", "ReviewID": "R3E5T9MQSZLT8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect tablet for me since I travel a lot, need have a tablet that is light and compact, with huge amount content that can be loaded for the time on the road.

Buttons are much better than last iteration and can be found by feel easily. Sound, like KFHD, is great. The display is awesome and the difference in speed is remarkable. I have had all three generations of Kindle Fire and will most likely keep buying as they continue to improve. BUT, I have been happy with each one.  Just as Apple lovers say you couldn't give them a Kindle Fire, you couldn't give me an iPad. Both are great products but appeal to different people. I did keep my original Kindle Paperwhite rather than upgrading but may jump on the next one depending on the specs. I think the idea of the May Day button is great but I haven't used it. Since I'm on my third Fire I've just not run into anything I need help with yet. If I do need help I'll be glad it's there.

I honestly think the iPad Mini Retina and the Fire HDX are in a performance class all of their own!DISPLAYThe screen is super sharp and has incredible contrast all around, color accuracy is very high but, the backlight does have a soft blue glow around the edges.Now a note from my Eye Doctor, Increased intake of blue light into our eyes has raised the percentage of people who have degenerative disorders with their eyes and they recommend Yellow Filtered Lenses to protect your eyes.  Research Macular Degeneration and Blue Light to see for yourself and keep in mind, this is not exclusive to the Fire HDX but, their decision to use Blue Lighting makes it worth mentioning (this has always been an issue but, mobile devices and increased use of computers make it a much larger issue).SOFTWAREThe interface of the software only has one feature that bugs the check out of me and that's the Carousel, everything else with the OS and apps actually works very well and I'm pretty impressed with what I'm seeing! Oh and Silk works great if you stop it from accelerating page loading because, it crashes often with that on.Mayday is also a pleasant surprise and I've used it a few times for some quick answers. It was way easier than googling the answers and even my Apple friends were really impressed with it.Another issue was that Amazon noted that you could now download Prime Videos to watch on the go but, they neglected to mention that it is only a small selection of movies that can be downloaded so you're forced to stream them and that creates larger issues with Battery Life (see the Battery Section).Not having a YouTube App underscores a larger issue with the Fire line...  The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!  This is a real issue and you would think that Amazon would want to stress the importance of getting these apps to work right out of the box!The Interface also has support for posting to Facebook and Twitter but, no Google+ and I'm not sure why Amazon is so intent on being Anti Google with their devices.BATTERY LIFEBattery is decent for every day tasks like Facebook, web browsing, emailing, reading books, playing a few games, and watching an occasional video clip.However, streaming movies from Prime resulted in a Net Battery Life of 5 Hours and that's half what Amazon claimed!OVERALLNo YouTube and using a blue back light has left me rating the Fire as average and I honestly think Amazon might have made a mistake with this screens back lighting. Everything else about the tablet is spot on and well worth the money they charge for it.For the record, even though I consider it an average offering, it is the best deal for the money and sadly, the other offerings might actually be worse than the Fire (the Nexus 7 FHD certainly is far less stable as is the iOS 7 based iPad line).Okay, two more notes that happened to me today...1st, the Tablet randomly decided to reboot itself while I was reading an ebook and that's twice it has done this in the kindle App.2nd, While I was tethering the device just decided it was going to download a very large firmware update without telling me it was doing it and needless to say, before I realized it my monthly data allowance was done!  I guess the only consolation here is that it might have actually fixed the first issue!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 11/25/13The latest patch from Amazon appears to have remedied the lockup issue and I'm very pleased with it.Since the locks were happening however, I purchased an iPad Mini Retina and honestly, I find the fire HDX to be more responsive and fluid overall and the display is noticeably more vibrant on the Fire HDX.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Krista  Timm", "ReviewID": "R2ECGWOAO5WR6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a first kindle fire they released and I loved it but now I love this one more.
