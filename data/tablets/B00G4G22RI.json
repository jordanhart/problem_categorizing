It comes in weighing a little over 1lb.I upgraded from the iPad 3 and you can defiantly feel the difference. When reading with the iPad 3, after a few minutes my arms would be tired of holding the iPad up. With the new iPad Air, that is not the case anymore. I can read for much longer now and my arms don't feel tired. The unit is also easier to hold (much thinner than previous versions of the iPad)It\u2019s built of high quality aluminum just like every other iPad is and constructed to last.PerformanceThe new iPad air is fast! It has an A7 processor in it which is defiantly an upgrade from the previous iPads. The Wi-Fi is even quicker to connect and I notice I can achieve more of my potential in bandwidth speed using this iPad. The new front facing camera makes video chatting much better and the M7 chip makes editing and slow motion shooting fun and a breeze.StorageI upgraded from a 16 GB iPad 3 to a 128 GB iPad Air. Why you ask? Well because I do a lot of traveling for work and Apple is notorious for sneaking in extra stuff on your hard drive that takes up space. My iPad 3 came with only 13.8 GB useable space and after a month I had 3 or 4 GB of \u201cother\u201d storage that no one could figure out how to remove or clear.I mentioned earlier I travel a lot for work so I enjoy watching movies on the plane rides. With my old iPad I never had room for all my movies I had to use a wireless hard drive  (Seagate Wireless Built In Streaming STCK1000100Just to watch my movies. Now with this new 128 GB hard drive I can fit tons of movies on it and I no longer need the old wireless hard drive. (One less thing to lose on travel)Final thought:For people who have an older iPad (like I did) then this is a no brainer buy this new iPad you won\u2019t be disappointed! It is much lighter than previous versions. Wayyy faster! And still sleek and built to last as every other iPad is. The new storage options give you the ability to carry more pictures, movies, books , games with you and the battery life is superb coming in at 10+hours. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It might be a little expensive, but if you buy smart you'll have this tablet for a long time with no problems.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad crashing problems, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY Major Fiasco", "Author": "P.

By Apple. If you go in their forums, there are plenty of (new users) people reporting crashing problems. Then you have the level 6 and up users denying there is a problem. Many posts are being censored and deleted by Apple.The 64 bit processor needs more memory than a 32 bit CPU - so in effect, the ipad air has LESS memory than the ipad 4.Do yourself a favor and dont buy the ipad air. It is already obsolete. If you must have an ipad, buy the 4th generation one, or wait until the next one comes out.

The specs are about the same as the New Ipad (iPad 3) and iPad 4. I would definitely get an iPad Air over an iPad Mini, even with the Retina Display, as what made the Mini desirable was the smaller weight and size. The Air is really light, more manageable for someone who uses it continuously.All in all, if you can afford it, it is a great gift, to yourself or seomone else (you really like :)).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Review from an Android user!", "Author": "Jason Wang", "ReviewID": "R3MRBK7OU4EGHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased as a long time android user because I needed something for textbooks and the 4:3 aspect ratio works a lot better for text books than 16:9 (I tired the Nexus 10 for a week as well)..Here is my review after  a week:The first thing I noticed was how light and compact it was, coming from the Nexus 10 I was surprised how easy it was to hold with one hand (although you still wouldn't for long periods of time) and how compact it was for a 10in tablet. The tablet is as fast as anything out right now, to be honest I don't play games but in terms of everyday use everything was fine...but at the same time every iPad that I've used before felt fast as well, I have heard of some issues with tablet optimization for iOS7 but I haven't encountered any. The screen is bright and sharp, text is really easy to read vs a higher PPI tablet (nexus 10) I really couldnt tell a difference with the extra pixels. The color on the iPad is very good once again this is to be expected as Apple always makes high quality devices.The only Cons I can't think of is the speaker placement and feel of the glass (as mentioned in other reviews). The iPad has \"stereo speakers\" which are located on the bottom, I really wish they would have put one on each side instead of both on one side. Watching youtube or netflix in landscape is kind of weird since all the side comes from the right side, kind of defeats the purpose of stereo speakers imo since I never watch fullscreen videos in portrait mode. The nexus 7and 10  have  really good desigsn for speakers that I wish Apple would've adopted.The other con is the feel of the screen, to be honest it feels a bit cheap...compared to previous iPads and the nexus devices the feel of the screen on the iPad air is the worst. It feels like plastic and it just doesnt feel solid when you push down. I'm sure this is a sacrifice that Apple had to make in order to reduce the weight to me the benefits of having a lighter, smaller device outweigh the feel of the screen (something that I'll eventually get used to).Other notes: I haven't used the camera, sorry but I never use the camera on a tablet to take pictures but from what I hear from reviews it takes pretty much what you would expect from a camera on a tablet. I probably wouldn't upgrade if I had an iPad 3 or iPad 4 unless your someone who has to have the newest tech or is absolutely miserable with the weight.If you do want to purchase it you can get it for 479.99 + Tax, go to Walmart's website or you can have any other retailer price match it.All in all this is an excellent tablet besides the minor gripes...the only Android tablet I can see competing with the iPad is the Nexus 10 v2 if it ever comes out...and while I preferred the Nexus 10 for media viewing, real stereo speakers and OS, reading textbooks felt a little cramped and since I'm using this tablet primarily for \"school\" the 4:3 factor fit my needs better.So there it is proof that you can be a fan of both Android and iOS :)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R3RZ0F8IARVY1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Nexus 7, and while I enjoyed it immenseilly I was ultimately disappointed in how slow it eventually got (speedy at Christmas, snail slow come April despite factory reset and other attempts to speed it up. Bought my brother a new nexus 7 that summer only to discover its speed was on par with the Nexus I currently owned. Very bizarre). I was skeptical whether or not I would enjoy a tablet experience, so the Nexus 7 was none the less a great first tablet. It could do anything any other tablet could without putting a dent in your pocket.I decided to get the iPad Air this season, specifically the wifi 32gb space gray version.Never owned an iPad before, so I can't really tell you how the models compare,However some things I note, the screen is rather large (duh) which does make typing with the onscreen keyboard difficult. However the screen real estate and quality is stunning, and if typing is a huge issue for you there is the iPad mini and other tablets. That's the trade off, and this is always a choice you have to make between 10 inch vs. 7inch tablets, no matter what brand you're looking at.The glass does feel rather thin, and I am concerned about its durability. I have read that the screen is durable however, and this perception is due to the lightening of the device causing the screen to sound thinner. Supposedly I will be able to confirm this with a case, as the addition of the case will give the tapping of the screen a deeper sound. Apparently it all comes down to acoustics - though a specification on glass thickness versus previous models would be nice.The design of the tablet is exquisite, definitely some top of the line material choices. The tablet has a VERY sturdy feel.Lots of free apps come with this tablet, which all work excellently and efficiently. There is no hesitation between tasks, and the speed is phenomenal.Overall I noticed the quality of apps and how they work on the operating system is MUCH better with apple than it was with android. However, the apple App Store isn't very easy to navigate. Google store is much more user friendly.No widgets, makes customizabibility limited.Multitasking is an ease with this tablet due to gestures. I love how well the gestures work. You can swipe between apps.Battery lasts insanely long, mine averages 12 hours of use.Hasn't overheated (vague warmth can be felt), even with gameplay.Sound from speakers at bottom of iPad sound full. Other tablets I've played with have a tin-metal quality sound emit from them, as though the speakers strain to emit a hearable noise.All iPad Airs, according to Apple's website, come with a complimentary one year limited warranty.Cool front AND back microphones work together to cancel out noise when using skype and FaceTime. Sounds very clear and crisp, I recommend you check out some videos on it.Overall I would say an A+ tablet. I mainly listed some concerns and observations, but that aside this thing is amazing! I love and, it from what I've heard of previous models, I'll hopefully be using this tablet for years to come (number one selling point for me is that apple devices function excellently passed a year).Update December 3, 2013:I've noticed a bizarre memory leak that occurs whenever I watch videos using Apple's video app (love them digital copies). I was testing the video streaming and after I noticed entire GBs were gone! After shutting down the app and fiddling around I realized that the iPad stores memory it buffers and keeps it hostage. However, after going back to the app and quickly loading the same movie and exiting before it begins to buffer the memory reappears. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised that if you watched movies completely through your memory would be restored each time. Still this is a rather large flaw on Apple's part, and I'm not sure if it occurs with any of the other video streaming apps. I'll be sending them a message to see if they're working on a patch for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet just got better", "Author": "G. Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "R1M0P0IQSS4RK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the first iPad was released in the spring of 2010, it was accompanied by a cacophony of jokes about its name and its size. Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T; 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T; cellular data.Until this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?The iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.Beyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that  every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.Over 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file.  I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that  I could bring  either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.My weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet.

Plus, the rounded edges on the back make this really comfortable to hold for long periods.I'm glad I went with Apple, because the quality is unbeatable. For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab 2 and right away I noticed the weight of the iPad Air. It felt like a feather compared to my tablet. The display is crisp and VERY sharp, I was amazed by that. The only thing she had an issue with compared to my tablet, was that the speakers on the iPad are placed at the bottom and not on the front facing you, like it is on the Galaxy Tab. We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience.

I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad.  Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for.  I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible.  When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet.  The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised.  Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case.  Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great.  Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats.  Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star.  First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory.  I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet.  Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in.  The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised.  Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful.  You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem.  You wait, and you wait, and you wait.  Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifes Toy", "Author": "victor a. quaranta jr", "ReviewID": "RMRD11B7V8WY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is very thrifty and seldom ask for anything.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice hardware for the price! Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do. Google's ecosystem feels almost seamlessly integrated while Apple's ecosystem felt more separated.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb", "Author": "kalip", "ReviewID": "RQPH5B045CWYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second iPad, I purchased an iPad 4 around a year ago.This iPad air is all I thought it would be and much more; it's muchthinner and the 64-bit A7 processor makes it faster it is also quite narrower although the screen sizeremains the same 9.7 inches.The retina display is  stunning and the battery life is great.

I need to be on the computer for 7-12 hours a day.I already own a MacAir, which I love, but as light as it is, it still weighs about 3 pounds ( still, I highly recommend and love my MacAir!).Anyway, I also have an ipad 3 and an Ipad mini, iphone etc., you get the idea. The reason I am mentioning this, is because I have a bad back and that is the only reason I have been updating devices. I am trying to find the \"perfect\" computer for my use. If I can help even one other person out there in my situation ( and save them a ton of money I had to spend <g>), I will be happy! :)First let me tell you a little about the Ipad Air...IT ROCKS!!Although the speed on the Air is much faster then my Ipad 3, whether syncing with iTunes, browsing the web or just getting emails, the speed was not the reason I upgraded. I am not a game player or a number cruncher so the speed of the ipad 3 was just fine for me.What did get my attention was the weight! I had already bought the new ipad mini, which is super cool and a lot of fun.I actually intend to keep it. However, as good as it's screen is, I cannot see me using it 10 hours a day. If I had 20 year old eyes, it might have beat out my Air! ;-)The a Ipad 3 was about 1.7 pounds. That may not seem like a lot, but for me it could not be a one handed device. I needed to put a case on it, making it 2 pound device. Compared to the Ipad Air, which is about 1 pound, that was almost a 50% reduction in weight! The reason the reduction is so much, is I do not feel I need a case with the Air. I have covered it with clear coat all over and that is it. I do not seeing it slipping out of my hands. However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty. Besides, isn't the reason we spend so much on these because they weigh so little and are aesthetically pleasing?It is too beautiful to cover up. So far, no regrets at all, but I need to find something to lean the Air against while lying down.If my review helped you, please click \"helpful\" below.

I have to admit I read all about the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and I bought it two weeks ago. the specs were awesome for the price. the only thing is a lot of the things I needed were not compatible with it. then my granddaughter tried to facetime with me and of course I couldn't because  Kindle doesn't have facetime. I told we would both have to download Skype to teleconference with eachother and she said forget it. too much trouble.  then I'd have to buy new extra chargers/cables etc. just too much incompatibility. so I returned it and bought this and I'm thrilled and happy with it. if I wasn't used to Apple products I would have kept the the Kindle. just being honest as I don't want anyone to think that the Kindle wasn't good", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed first time apple customer", "Author": "Ginfx", "ReviewID": "R3PXX0AJCUBKMP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to purchase my first apple product. This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out.  Sadly it will be going back.  iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp.  Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed.

The need for both color for children's books and my own need for a white background to provide contrast when reading were my primary motivators.  The price and versatility of the Kindle were better than other options available.  I do not use my device as a media player, but that seemed to be a nice option.  However, my spouse insisted I look at the \"Apple iPad Air\" before I made any purchase.After looking at the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and the \"Apple iPad Air\" side-by-side in the big electronics retailer, I had to admit it, he was right!  Clarity on both devices was excellent, particularly as I intended to use the item primarily as an e-reader.  However, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" kept freezing up; the blue shirted employees said that was a frequent occurrence.  The \"Apple iPad Air\" connected easily to WiFi and navigation was smooth and seamless.  The ability to use many of the same programs I have installed on my PC is a plus.  Downloading books is quick and the \"Apple iPad Air\" does not bog down so that it seems painfully slow when I try to change from a book to the main menu page.  Using the \"Apple iPad Air\" is intuitive, even for those individuals - like me -who are not especially tech-savvy.  Based on recommendations and the fact that I would use the tablet when traveling, I purchased the \"Apple iPad Air\" 16 GB with the ability to connect to AT&T.;The principle downside of purchasing the \"Apple iPad Air\" is its initial cost.  Individuals who are debating between purchasing a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and an \"Apple iPad Air\" should look at the two side-by-side; consider their primary uses and personal preferences; and evaluate the price difference in light of those factors.

For some reason, iPads are popular among moms and grand moms for taking wrestling videos.  She then transfers the videos to her MacBook Pro, writes them to an optical disc and gives it to the coach for analysis.  Video transfers are achieved when she syncs the iPad Air with her MBP.  She keeps it protected in a pink Otterbox, which gives the iPad a completely different look and feel.iPad Air is thinner and lighter than previous iPads and comes with a sharp Retina display.

I do know she keeps it close at all times, and though she doesn't qualify as a geek she's worked in software maintenance most of her professional life.

Apple constantly thrives to improve there products, and this one is no exception. The new IOS coupled with the blazing fast 64-bit a7 chip makes this one of the fastest tablets I have used! The ease and simplicity of this tablet makes everyday emails, messaging, projects,etc. no problem. This is the only tablet I have looked forward to using.Now for more serious activities like gaming and other intensive applications, the iPad has no problems what so ever. The graphics are very smooth, almost life-like.  From the outside, this is the most beautiful tablet hands down. From the chamfered edges to the sleek aluminum back, this is a high quality device. Most other tablets are made out of cheap plastics, not this one. Everything feels well made and solid. Even though apple chose to use metals and other high end materials, the iPad remains one of the lightest and thinnest full size tablets you can buy. Another high point for the iPad air its the battery. It seems to go on forever! After using it throughout the day, I end up with 70 to 80 percent battery! Its unbelievably how much juice this thing holds! Some miscellaneous things about the iPad that push it even further over the top are the decent cameras and the excellent microphones and speakers. The speakers have a good base tone and very clear high pitches. Overall I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a device that can do pretty much anything.

Instead I spent $3.00 for a 6' USB extension cord to extend between the charge module and lightning cord. It works fine and will keep the battery at 100%  while I am working.

You have very little customization options. Yes, you can change wallpaper and move icons around the homescreen, but that's about it. No making the device an extension of your personality like Android.*Speakers. For being the most popular gadget on earth, why are there not stereo speakers on this device (one on each end of the tablet)? This is a serious design flaw that makes watching videos a huge drag because sound is muffled especially if the device is leaning on your lap.*Multitasking is a joke. These devices can only perform one task at a time. Apples competitors such as Samsung and Microsoft have already addressed this in their tablets, why hasn't Apple?*Screen Casting. This is not equipped with Miracast or have an HDMI out port. This means if you want to show your devices screen on a TV, you can't without buying a bunch of overpriced adaptors and cords.*Maps.

Up until then, I had never owned an Apple product. I have always had Windows pc\u2019s and I have an Android phone (Galaxy S4).I read that people just love the iPad\u2019s and thought it would be time to try out an Apple product. I bought it from T-Mobile to get their free data promotion. Now that I\u2019ve had one for about 3 months my overall opinion is \u201cmeh\u201d. It\u2019s ok.I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s light & portable. It\u2019s great for watching movies and listening to music. However, there are limitations that make me wonder why the devices are so popular. For example, Swype doesn\u2019t work on iPad\u2019s and if you\u2019ve ever used Swype on an Android device you know it\u2019s a great feature but one I consider very basic. True multi-tasking doesn\u2019t exist and you just don\u2019t realize how much you\u2019ll miss it until you don\u2019t have it. You can\u2019t print, for example, pages 1,3,&10 of a pdf. Instead, you can only choose a range, such as 1 thru 3. I still remember one of my first calls to Applecare+, where some young woman explained to me that you can\u2019t do a search in a pdf. She actually suggested that I add hundreds of doctors that were in the pdf to my contact list so that I could then find individual doctors. I quickly ended that call. The Apple browser, Safari, is slow. Chrome, on the other hand, is fast. These are only small examples but in general, the iPad seems to be much less flexible than my Window\u2019s computers or Android phone.As an aside, the support on Applecare+ varies widely. I have been connected to people that seem knowledgeable but have also had plenty of people that knew less about the iPad then I did, even after only 1 months use. Many of the young women referred to my iPad as an IPhone and didn\u2019t have a clue how to help me.They are also expensive. I bought the 32GB version and thought it was a rip off to pay $100 for the extra 16GB.Now, my iPad Air is 3 months old and needs to be exchanged under warranty. After 10 minutes of use it can\u2019t access the web anymore. Regardless of whether you use a browser or an app. They had me reset it back to the factory default but it didn\u2019t fix the problem. It's stayed in a case and never left the house. It's been babied. I\u2019ve never had any device fail after only 3 months use.I really wanted to love this device and thought I would based on other people\u2019s feedback. It just hasn\u2019t worked out for me though. It\u2019s adequate, but not great, and hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't plan on enjoying you headphones..if you enjoy music.", "Author": "Gery", "ReviewID": "R124IJA0MRHZN6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Air pad problems....I have 2 iPhones, iPad 3 gen, new air pad.

I was a previous Iphone user that moved on to Android because I didnt like the size of the 5.  I have two kids so consumer level usability is high on my list especially with a son that has autism.My choice came down to a samsung or the ipad since the nexus 10 2 is still MIA. :)  The samsung had several things going for it.  MicroSD, customization and control, mutliple user profiles but to be honest their overlay is a huge turn off and the plether backing with fake stitching just looks horrid.  I would say that the plastics are fine but why bother with fake stitching? I spent time in a B&M; and the feel was good, but visually as a whole it felt less...high end even with the price being in the same range as the IPad.  With several cloud storage options and knowing that I would be using it for light work related items and sharing it with my kids to some extent the MicroSD while nice was not compelling.  I do wish apple would realize that multiple user accounts would be helpful because that is one of the things that almost moved me to the samsung.  Both screens of course are amazing and I have to give it to the samsung on using a better aspect ratio for media, but the samsung felt klugy when trying to use it in portrait.  So with all this being debated in my head for a few weeks back and forth I decided on the IPad.  As an aside, I love the build quality and would have seriously considers a Kindle Fire HDX but the lack of the google play store put it out of contention.  It is one thing to have a walled garden like apple where just about any app you can think of is available, but it is quite another to have a walled garden like Amazon where you either have to root or sideload to simply get some basic useful apps.  If the Kindle Fire HDX had google play store, this might have been an entirely different review. :)Two things have stood out as I have delved back into the walled garden that is Apple...One, It may be a walled garden, but it is a gorgeous garden.  The app quality and availability is outstanding. If they allowed Google Play Music I would not have any issues at all with the app store.  I think that the tighter development control that apple institutes on its apps is a double edged sword in some respects but I have not had anywhere near the amount of bugs that I find in the android store apps so in that respect I appreciate that 98.7% of the time when I download an app it just works.  I use it with several google services including chromecast and have been very happy with the results. On a side note, the hardware and build quality is meticulous and the IPad itself is even more impressive after prolonged use, but that has been discussed and beaten like the proverbial dead horse.Two, battery life.  Apple seems to know how to eek out the battery life with more finesse than some competitors.Overall I like the IPad Air much more than I thought I would.  I bought it knowing from a techie nerd stand point what I was giving up with the ecosystem and I have had no regrets at this point.  I can use it for work emails and presentations and come home to play netflix or games with the kids.

Even now, I get annoyed at some Apple-isms, the way Apple does some things, and try to stay away from it for the most part.  But I do believe it's typically more stable than it's technological counterparts, and easier to use for newbies.  Which is why we bought an IPAD 2 for our 8 yr old a couple years ago.  He took to it right away, it's intuitive enough.  There have been some slight issues, but it's still going strong.  Now 10, we just bought him this IPAD AIR... his 2 yr old brother gets the \"old\" IPAD 2.  And yes, the IPAD is intuitive enough for even a 2 yr old!  The screen on the AIR is so much better, clearer, sharper, and not just because it's \"new\".  Its resolution is just that much better.  Bought a cheap full body case until I could find a better one... trying to decide between the Otterbox (love the protection, not so much the hard cover design and that it doubles as a stand)... the Griffin Survivor (flimsy stand, landscape mode only)... or the Pelican Vault (no integrated screen protector, but I can put a protector on, and it is rated against water splash)... Lifeproof too expensive for what it offers... The 16G in the IPAD 2 was ultimately not enough after a year or so of use... Even with no \"movies\" or \"music\", games are much larger now, a few big games, and there is little left in a 16G device.  Without removing games, we didn't have enough memory left to upgrade the OS... so we opted for 64G this time... Though not an Apple fan, my 2 sons love them, I seldom have to \"fix\" anything with them, and so I rate it 5-stars!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "charles a. winthrop", "ReviewID": "R20V3OWBNO61S9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my wife loves it she likes it more than her ipad one.

First off, Safari crashes ALL THE TIME. I've only had one or two crashes on my old iPad so this took some getting used to. Secondly, there is the \"white screen of death\" where the iPad will just reboot itself for no apparent reason. Again, Apple products just don't behave this way so this was a huge disappointment. Finally, it is long past time that iOS add a real file system for saving files and sharing them between apps.

I've found that to be untrue. My Kindle Fire HDX screen is MUCH better--it seems to be a harder, slicker surface, so fingerprints and such don't stick to the screen. Putting the Tech Armor screen protector on the iPad helps. 2) The app store is filled with a lot of junk, and there are so many apps there that it takes a lot of time to wade through to something that actually looks useful. Many of the apps are almost duplicates of each other. On the plus side, and the reason I got the iPad in the first place, there are some apps that are written only for the iPad.Second, the positive: this thing is a true battery miser. I can go a couple of days between charges, more if I'm not using it heavily.

I know the air has the much talked about retina, but to be honest with my eyes it's hard to tell the difference between the clarity between the #2 and the air.

I don't use safari as a rule, not even on my MBP, being more comfortable with chrome. I never noticed my ipad 2 having an issue with chrome, but the air does and crashes four to five times a week when chrome is being used.

It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note.

I had cracked my screen and it seemed as if it was slowing down over time, probably due to the updated operating systems putting more stress on the aging processor and memory.So, I saw a good deal on a used model appear on Amazon, and decided to go for it. For little over $500, after I traded in my older model, I had a brand-new, or close to it, iPad Air. The first thing you'll notice is the weight. It is at least half that of the previous models. The bezel thinner on the sides and the new thunderbolt port on the bottom. I also love the addition of stereo speakers, as I own one of the biggest recording studios on the East Coast and love to try out the music I produce on a multitude of sound systems. This allows me to hear what I've done in stereo, on a lower common denominator, so as to know what my music sounds like coming from the speakers of a system millions of people own.The next thing I noticed, is the screen seemed quite a bit brighter then my iPad 3. This could just be because of the aging screen tech under the glass, or some other factor. But it definitely helps for reading, even at half power, in darker and lighter situations that I have no control over. Next up, the speed at which everything operates. Not only loading software and apps, but in switching apps and multitasking. There is just a zip to everything now.The biggest thing I noticed, the Internet is 10 times as fast as it was in my prior model. I'm going to guess the MIMO has something to do with that, along with the two antennas. Giving a stronger signal, which in turn allows for the fastest Internet possible. I have 50 Mb Internet, and I now feel like I'm using every bit of it in doing something as simple as loading webpages or downloading videos, games and music. When I load a webpage, everything appears instantly, no more loading in of different aspects of that page, everything is just there. I think it is the first time, and Ive owned  hundreds of computers over the years, that I've noticed any webpage load so instantly.Games look every bit as good as they can, due to the increased processing power of the CPU and GPU. If Apple would only make a proprietary gamepad for the iPad, they would have a true contender for a great video game system on the market. Some of the games, especially those from Gameloft and EA, have every bit the quality that you see from any game on modern systems, bar a few effects here and there.Even music production can be done at high-quality, for the home or studio producer, with decent results. I've heard some songs recorded completely via the iPad, that you would've sworn were done in multi-million-dollar studios. They are that good. Which goes to show, great music is made by a great producer and not the equipment behind him.So, to sum things up:Positives:Great, bright, high resolution screenSmaller and lighterIncredible portable powerGreatly improved internet speedStereo speakers built inAwesome games and production softwareCheap accessories from third party vendorsNegative:Price, though I imagine we would sacrifice some quality at a lower price pointOverall, you will not find a better portable computer for the price. Anything Windows is going to have issues. Whether that be with drivers, malware, viruses or some or the other issue that goes along with owning a Windows machine. Sure, they are more powerful and will allow you a greater depth of software, but you make trade-offs with that power in size, weight and ease-of-use. So, if you have the means, definitely get the iPad Air. The upgrades are truly worth the extra cost over previous models.

At 467g the Air redefines computer portability and is so lightweight it's hard to tell whether you're carrying it in your bag or have in fact forgotten it, without looking to check. The Air has a fast A7 chip and the screen is a useful 9.7 inches; it's a breeze to use. The design of the graphics is so intuitive that any child or technophobe can master it and feel at home in a few minutes, which makes it the perfect entry-point into IT for someone who has so far avoided computers.One of the clever things Apple have done is the creation of the individual `Apple ID' which means once you enter your ID & password your iPad, iPhone, iPod and Mac immediately share all their files, and everything you created or stored on one device becomes available on them all: photos, music, reminders, address book, documents are all shared. This is probably the most brilliant idea ever in the IT mass market to create brand loyalty among consumers and `locks you in to the corporation for the duration'.Now, the bad news: the software crashes from time to time necessitating a reboot, which is annoying and inconvenient. This fault is acknowledged by Apple, as the software has a few bugs. Also the wireless reception is not all it might be, as it sometimes (mysteriously) fails to connect to even a moderately strong signal.Apple's pricing structure does not reflect the cost of manufacture but is driven by a market segmentation strategy, so the price really cranks up if you want an iPad with more memory or which can use the GSM phone network. The best value is the 16G Air without Cellular, which only connects to the internet via WiFi. 16G is a lot of memory by the historic standards of portable computers and you'll only find it insufficient if you want to store a lot of big files like films or powerpoint presentations.You'll need a carrying case to protect it (scores of different designs are available) and maybe a keyboard, which if you're doing a lot of writing and document creation rather than just surfing the internet is the one essential accessory, as without a separate keyboard the usable screen area is reduced in size. Around one million downloadable apps for Apple devices means you can personalize your iPad and make it into more or less whatever you want. The Air design is aesthetically a work of beauty in its simplicity, cleanness of lines and proportion, and despite some irritating niggles is a pleasure to own and use.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Always love Apple", "Author": "Patricia Coykendall", "ReviewID": "R2Q8KB9C8ZHKQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All said it would be and more, had the I pad 2 and this is so much faster and lighter", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Maryanne", "ReviewID": "RX8WHXEP7PHLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I honestly love this tablet like crazy!

The screen is also great, maybe it's not the best on the market but I can barely even tell the difference and it's still exquisite. The processing power is also outstanding and I couldn't need anything faster. Internet is very fast as well. All in all, I've always wanted an IPad and finally when I got it, I was not upset at all and it was actully a million times better than I expected.So, in my opinion, if you want it enough, and your willing to make a big splurge, get it. :D You won't regret it, it's da bomb. But if you really haven't wanted this much and your short on money, maybe you can give the other cheaper tablets a try.

I bought the original iPad, iPad 2, and iPad 3 (which I returned because of heating issues and thickness/weight and went back to the iPad 2).I was ready to buy a new iPad because my iPad 2 16gb was filled up.  So I decided on the iPad Air. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was that it really is much lighter than even the iPad 2.  The screen is the same size, but the frame is narrower, so it's smaller overall.  I have the white 128gb wifi version.  Set up was problematic though, which is why I've taken away a star.  When asked to put in my home wifi password, I received a message that it was entered wrong. Repeatedly.  Well, it wasn't wrong because it's the same password as my other wireless devices.  Nothing I did would make it take the password, so I called Apple tech support. After being on the phone with the technician for at least 45 minutes, nothing worked. Turning my modem and router off and on did nothing. Changing some of the iPad's settings, again, nothing. I felt disappointed, frustrated, and let down by Apple. Finally, the tech set an appointment for me to take it into the Apple store and see if they could get it to connect to their wifi. Before we hung up, the tech suggested I connect the iPad to the iTunes on my computer and do a complete software restore and see if that would resolve the connection issue.  I did this, which took about an hour, and FINALLY was able to connect to my wifi. The connection has been stable so far.Other than the above initial connection problem, I am really loving the iPad Air. Sharp retina display, thinner and lighter, and faster connection (I use the Mercury Browser, not clunky Safari). The white frame with silver edges is really nice looking. I read a lot of ebooks, so the lighter weight is very much appreciated since it can be held comfortably with one hand. I also listen to audiobooks and this iPad has two speakers instead of one. They're located on the edge of the device, not the back, so you don't have to have the iPad back side up to get unmuffled sound. The sound quality of the iPad Air is superior to the iPad 2, and the volume can be turned up slightly louder. I've only played one game so far, Plants vs. Zombies 2, but it plays great. I don't use the camera and really wish Apple would make a version sans that option. It feels cool when holding--the iPad 3 I had got too warm on one side, which this one doesn't do. I haven't had any other problems and I think this is the best iPad yet. As far as the initial wifi connection issue I had, I'm going to assume this was a fluke with my device, and not something a lot of people are experiencing (although I have seen a few mentions of this on some of the Apple forums).", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its perfect", "Author": "Benedito Eloi Maya \"Maya\"", "ReviewID": "R3PBL8USTW8GYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "They Sent me a used iPad......WTF????", "Author": "Marcus Scott-Morgan", "ReviewID": "RUZ0K3ME024YE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cant believe these guys had the nerve to send me an iPad air with no factory seal around the unit.I then proceeded to charge the iPad for the first time.

I was led to believe that document file transfers would be easy between my MacBook Pro and the iPad. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. The two machines cannot be directly connected.

You even loses page numbers when transferring Microsoft Office docs--a pretty basic function. The ironny is that MSOffice is designed for MAC! There are third party workarounds that are very cumbersome. So much for MACs elegant design brags.  The alternative is the Cloud which also only syncs docs made in iWork. As for photo transfers, unless you have the same bandwidth as NASA, forget it. Apple--wouldn't it just be simpler to create a USB connection?

First, try to buy the product through Amazon.  If you get lucky you will avoid 38+ dollars in taxes.  In my state I get charged that anyway.  I bought mine a few weeks ago and I now regret my decision.The ipad Air, full size not the mini, is expensive for what you get.  The much talked about retina display really isn\u2019t much better than Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s normal display.  I take a lot of photos and even at full zoom I can\u2019t make out much difference.  The Apple ipad Air does NOT come with an SD card slot, and if you want to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb you will be looking at over $100 additional dollars.  Many of Apple\u2019s competitors have the SD slot and cost less.Apple sells an SD card \u201creader.\u201d  You can download from the card to the ipad but NOT the other way.  And the ipad SD card reader will run you $30 plus dollars.  You must buy other $30+ dollar accessories if you want to use a USB memory stick for example.  I purchased a non- Apple SD card triple reader (USB and SD for example) for about $9 dollars.  The machine complains at me but it still works (but, once again, it only loads to the machine not from the ipad as a normal SD slot does).An SD card reader would have been easy to install as part of the iPad, and this gives their competitors an edge, especially when one is taking photographs and trying to download them immediately to examine on something other than a 2 inch screen.  As I shoot RAW (large files) photos with my Canon this inability to use an SD card is a real pain.Downloading music from Amazon to iTunes isn\u2019t any picnic either.  My wife has an android device from Dell running Jellybean and she downloads everything with zero problems.  Plus, she has an SD card slot which really helps.  Her screen is as sharp as mine.Finally, the OS systems.  Jellybean has about a million apps written for it while I have about 200 - or that is how it seems to me.  Her system is faster than mine AND her system is intuitive and mine is not.  I\u2019ve had to read over the Apple manual for ipad three times trying to get things done.  Maybe my largest gripe is I bought the Apple thinking several Apple machines could sync up and trade information easily including photographs and music and documents.  Wrong.  I\u2019ve tried numerous syncing ideas and none of them work.  I started using Pages (an Apple word processing program) instead to Word to get it to transfer.  Finally, I saved it to the cloud and managed to get the document to the other machine.  Photographs that are in the photo stream do transfer; however, getting the photograph into the stream when it was not automatically placed there by the ipad doesn\u2019t work.  And finding photos to look at in the ipad, when the ipad did not take the photo and the photo is on another machine (with the photo stream on and home sharing on) the photo still does not come up.  Very frustrating.After using the ipad and watching and using Jellybean and Android in action I think the Android devices are a much better deal.  Get one with an SD card slot.  I am certain Apple has designed their machine so the user cannot get extra storage on the machine (as an SD slot would allow) and must buy a more expensive machine if they handle large files.  If you like buying music at Amazon good luck getting it to iTunes onto your machine if it is an Apple (Yes, I have Amazon cloud player).  My wife got her music downloaded in about a minute.  It took me an hour to get one of Mozart\u2019s songs I had purchased downloaded to my computer.In retrospect, since the programs do NOT sync up as advertised, the machine has little storage unless you pay an enormous additional price, the retina display is not revolutionary, and the number of programs are minimal compared to Android I wish I had purchased an Android.  Samsung seems to be on the cutting edge there, although my wife\u2019s Dell is performing just fine.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad Air", "Author": "Oscar Crumby", "ReviewID": "R1LFVGKI48DRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a tablet.

Hopefully in 2014 the next iPad Air model will put the S T E R E O speakers on the FRONT of the device.UPDATE 12/4/2013: I just came back from The Apple Store to make it \"official\" that I have used an iPad Air.  Yes the iPad Air is thinner than previous iPad models and it may be faster.  Honestly I didn't see much of a difference in speed between the iPad Air and the iPad 4 while surfing the web.  That said I still see no reason to get an iPad Air if you already own an iPad 4.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Really, Really Wanted To Like The iPad Air", "Author": "MARCIA", "ReviewID": "R2UL04RH6CL3X1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really, really wanted to like the iPad Air, but It just wasn't for me. I was looking for a replacement for my 2008 white Macbook, which I loved. The iPad Air is NOT, repeat not a laptop replacement. I don't have heavy computing requirements, but the brand new iPad couldn't do a number of BASIC things my 5 and a half year old Macbook does with ease.The most important is multitasking. The iPad can only do one thing at a time. Only one window or app can be open at a time. Seriously? iPad doesn't do flash player, so any number of things (like watching certain youtube videos,etc) can't be done.I found the touch screen to be inconsistent. I was constantly having to enlarge links to be able to click them properly. I was also disappointed with the small amount of included apps.Now the good: If you want a portable device to check email, browse the web, take pictures,etc and you tend to do one thing at a time, the iPad may work for you. The retina display and the fit and finish of the iPad are excellent. It is light, thin, fast, and beautiful. Siri is included and works well.I love Apple products, but I found the iPad to be underpowered and lacking versatility. If you're looking for a laptop replacement, I couldn't recommend it. I ended up returning it and got a Macbook Pro instead.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I want to give zero if I could!", "Author": "Hao Wang", "ReviewID": "RC2HQ6Q43B1F4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can they get the permission of selling on Amazon?!

This was cool years ago but with tablets out there that allow multi screen and other amazing stuff...I gave it a go guys, and I really wanted to not be bias in my review. Hopefully you were able to see that. I think if you like the other Ipad's you will be happy with this for sure.

Those reviews are biased and only bring up the minor upgrades from the old ipad and base the comparisons off of those few things. And the only two really bad things they had to say about the ipad Air was that it didn't have a fingerprint scanner and it didn't come in gold. The 80's called and they want their gaudy flashy gold bling back.Most of these reviews will only focus on those points and will not mention all the other advantages the Surface 2 has. And for the few reviews that do mention the other features the Surface 2 has, they still favor the ipad because the camera was nicer or more apps. Really?I will use the Surface 2 as comparison because it will show how ridiculous the bias is regardless of capabilities.What the reviews usually leave out or down play.Surface 21. Full office software. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.2. Wide screen optimized for wide screen movies. When held in portrait when you are surfing the web for example, you get a a longer list so you don't scroll as much.3. Sd slot. Easy to download or upload data on the fly.4. 3.0 USB so you can easily backup files to a hard drive and not have all your eggs in one basket. Or transfer files with anything that has a USB plug and also charge your phone. Ipad? No, unless you have the adapter and you can't charge your phone.5. Can print to almost every printer.6. Hdmi port7. Flash support so you are not limited browsing the web.8. Built in two position kickstand.9. Thin keyboards that double as covers. Can get them background lit, flat, with real keys, and a new one coming out with built in battery to recharge your Surface at the same time on a charge. Battery in tablet is good already though. Some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the Surface and adds to the cost. Ridiculous. You do not. It will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document. With an ipad you don't need one because what use would it be for? Sure there are apps. but they are limited to what you can create or edit. You have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it.10. Hook up to your t.v. or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen.11. Do a split screen on the tablet.12. Run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music, watching a video and doing something else like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode.13. Wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t.v, stream videos, pictures, etc.14. Drag and drop files.15. Can set up individual separate accounts on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet.Now these are not all the Surface 2 offers. I am finding new things still.The ipad Air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks. It's faster and lighter. Still does the same thing as before, nothing new.ipad Air1. Powerful processor. For doing nothing new. Future fingerprint scanner? Tablet will still only run apps. as before.2. Lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard.3. Upgraded camera. Put it down, your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play. Use a real camera.4. No USB or sd slot. Need adapters for just about everything. And with the Surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables. On an ipad you can't do both. You either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something. And if it is dead, you have to wait until you charge it first. Also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the Surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable. And the cover/keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight. And justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not valid. It is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not support mouse functions. You are stuck with third party hardware that is Apple specific whereas with the Surface you can use anything that supports micro SD or USB. And having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad.will not be cheap. People gripe about the Suface cover/keyboard costs too much. Well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost $40.00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost $100.00 that you have to carry seperatley.5. Having to convert simple files with Apple software a hassle.5. Tons of apps. Android not far behind. And Microsoft growing. How much apps. does one need?6. What good is the Reina display if it isn't widescreen? Picture is actually smaller than 9.7 with the black bars.7. Only compatible with Apple products i.e. cant print unless it is an AirPrint printer or stream to t.v. unless Apple t.v.8. Slightly upgraded camera. Put it away! Your blocking my view! And people with a 4.8 inch phone look ridiculous? At least they are not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9.6 tablet that takes two hands. Kind of contradicting.The ipad Air has more negatives than positives, so how can it be better? Android tablets have more features even than the ipads. I guess if you want one just for games and apps, then an ipad or a higher end Android tablet might suit your needs. People are not weighing in that the Surface 2 can do more than just play games.Now back to the Surface 2. There was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do. It didn't take long though. Look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of. There different ways to open, close, move, split screen, multitask, etc.The tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it I admit. But the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as I didn't think it would. I don't have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also. And even if I put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle.The boot up time takes a little while when completely off, but remember it is opening real office programs. When in sleep mode it opens up quickly.I went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge.The tiles are nice because it is real time data so I can glance at them without opening up an app. for email, weather, etc. On Apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up, Android you can use widgets.With a real browser and Flash I can use full websites rather than a mobile version. And also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs.As I mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn't be.The only two cons I find on the Surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long. You have to be really close to an outlet of some sort.And the main con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don't have the full gigs of memory stated. So might have to get an sd card. Yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs, but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can't do what the Surface 2 can do.If you are waiting for a ipad Air Pro to come out. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come with a Retina display, finger print scanner, nice camera, etc. You will have to wait for the Pro S, Pro S1, etc. to get one feature at a time and not several at once. I mean come on, cant even throw in a simple camera flash. The ipads shouldn't even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run Office software. There should be a category for Dumb Tablets that only run apps, a category for Smart Tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not just limited mobile versions, and Extreme Tablets for ones that can run full blown Office suites.If your a die hard Apple fan, please back up your arguments with something valid other than ipad rocks or a childish angry comment.

First of all, it took over six hours just to set up the iPad Air, because it wouldn't receive the information that was being inputed. Very frustrating. After three calls to Apple tech support, we finally got the set up finished and were able to use the unit. Next, we were told that the SIM card from our cellular data provider would work with the iPad Air. It did not. So, my only option was to pay AT&T; or any of the other three providers $50 per month for cellular. That's a rip off. It's no coincidence that all four of the cellular providers available for the iPad Air charge virtually the same high price for coverage. So, the IPad Air is very pricey for a tablet, it's very time consuming to set up, the cellular coverage is very expensive. So, we returned it and got our money back.

I assumed I'd like their products as I had a high opinion of them as a company. Most of these reviews are full of how great they are and tech data. I'm 52, I'm not dumb, I can work a PC, I've got a BMW, a Bang and Olufsen system, a couple of homes and the rest.Well it's an education; we're all used to be expected to work stuff right out of the box, but if you're an apple novice, if you don't have a smart 'phone (I know that's putting me in a minority but why would I need one when I've been out the workplace for ten years?), if you still use CD's for music and DVD's / blu ray for films, well take my advice and don't bother. A nightmare to set up, impossible to put right if you get it wrong; mines back in the box three hours after delivery and there it will stay. I'll put up with windows instead.For all you guys who want to do loads of stuff, well good luck to you. I just wanted Amazon, Google search and my mail live on a screen next to my seat in the living room and was prepared to spend $500 to have that in a nice package. It didn't deliver, and no I don't want to have to go around to my local Apple store and ask some guy pursuing an alterative lifestyle how to do it. Much easier to make do with the $150 Acer notebook, even if it does need to be on a mains lead most of the time.Farewell Apple; if it had worked I'd have bought a pricey Mac, but that ship's sailed and I'm $2000 ahead.Phil", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "A joy to use!", "Author": "Sandra E.
