The seller said yes. But it was not true.  I had to switch Internet service to a wireless hot spot. So in product discription it said support 3g doogle not true. you would need a hotspot wireless internet. So on good note you can copy files from other devices to put on this tablet. The picture and sound is nice and clear and bright. On bad note The built in camera is s***ty you would need a lamp or bright light near to take a bright clear picture. The internal battery is week don't last long. I always use the ac adapter plug.  If you big on tablets. And know what you need and portability this is not for you. But if your like me new to the whole tablet use this would be a okay choice to start out with.  Overall it's worth the great price!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disapointing", "Author": "Jonathon Gear", "ReviewID": "R50RA3SQ93TQU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product was not good at all. First off I paid extra for two day shipping as it was a Christmas gift to my wife and it did not arrive for 4 business days. Amazon was very quick in refunding my shipping costs so I have no Problems there then after my wife opened her gift and started using it. This tablet would shut itself off after a few minutes of use and would not restart. When it did work for a little bit it would drain the battery very fast. It had to be plugged in to use it and it would still shut itself off after a few minutes. Ended Up returning the Product for a refund two days after Christmas!", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with my notebook", "Author": "Sharon Jones", "ReviewID": "R15ZTL3VZ3NLI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now this notebook is just the right size.You can read the words when you're reading online or just rrading in general i can watch movies listen  to music I had a smaller notebook book i like the size and the quality of this one happy with this.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Decerica Smith", "ReviewID": "R23HMCGG6AEUK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Need to put a warrent on this product in case something happen to it.
