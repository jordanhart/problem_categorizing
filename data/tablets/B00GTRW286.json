I bought one for my wife at Christmas time and liked it so much I bought one for myself a couple of weeks later. I showed it to a friend of mine and he bought one too. The screen definition is pretty good. App opening and response time is fast enough - no lag on anything. If your expecting a Nexus 7 that costs $250...well your not going to get that. But for under $100 this is a great tablet and can hold it's own in benchmark comparison tests (it's not high on the list of top performers...but hey...it only falls @ 30 seconds or so behind. My conclusion...if your looking for a cheap tablet this is one of the best and I recommend buying one. Also..we tried to buy one at any electronics store just after Christmas and they were all sold out and all pre-orders were already purchased so we had to order one on line and have it shipped to our house as the only option.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "A terrible product", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R3M611NHFI5MDI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first day I had this tablet, it had trouble charging and I had to position the cord just so, so that it would charge.  I thought it had a short in the cord so the next day I tried a lot of other cords in my house that fit, but none of them would charge it.  It also had a terrible life span and memory.  This is a terrible product and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  It will make you very sad, especially if you had been sitting at your window all day waiting for it to get there.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$153.35", "Features": "7\" HD Andriod 4.2 Tab Blue", "Name": "EGQ307 8 GB Tablet - 7\" - 1.50 GHz - Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-uUTUOKYL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GTRW286"}}
