After 3 months using, my screen turned bad, got a line in the side. Because of that, I lowered down my stars to 3.Let me tell you how I rate them.First star - comes from the price.  Less than $80, it is a steal! Kindle and any other tablets out there cost at least $100 bucks, this one is very good in price.  If you have read my other review with other 7 inch tablet, this one sure is a winner, smooth and fast.  Other than book reader, surfing is okay, video is good as well .Second star -  google play, not getjar.  Many many apps are available. My other tablet which I return  are bad because of bad micro usb slot and getjar does not let you install certain app. This one is using google play. It is much better.Third Star - Not bad in screen resolution, and volume (although it can be better), but price like this and it is very good!Fourth star - Camera .. I didn't expect this.  It has only front view camera for video chat use (I have tried skype and it works fine with headset (oversea video chat!),without headset, it is a bit noisy .. by the way google talk and vtok will not be working).  However, you can also take picture, camcording with that.. Not super high quality, but still it is available!Fifth star - You got a power adapter, and a usb cord (mirco to regular- that can serve as charging purpose too) and a converter.  You can put your usb stick on to the usb slot and va la, you have usb drive just like pc.  Of course, if you can spare few more bucks, you can get micro usb, Nice!Of course, the memory is not super fast, but for price like that ..

Eilar \"JTwig\"", "ReviewID": "R1X3368KDBI7V3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my 10-year old as a Christmas present. So far it has worked great, though it does rarely freeze up (just turn it off and back on to unfreeze). My son loves it, and my wife is even thinking of getting one so we won't have to share our Kindle Fire. My only complaint is that the battery at full charge only last about 2-hours, which is not a problem while we are at home but when traveling it might be a hassel.It does seem to boot-up slightly slower than my Kindle Fire and the screen image quality is not quite as good, but its download and streaming speeds appear to be the same. It cannot use the Amazon app store, but the Android App Store has a lot of games that cost money on Amazon for free (Angry Birds Star Wars for one). Also unlike my Kindle Fire it does not require a credit card to activate the tablet or the Android App account, which means I don't have to worry about my 10-year old accidently purchasing a bunch of apps. If he wants something that cost money I have found I can usually purchase it at the Amazon App Store, and have it download directly to his tablet.Overall we are very happy with our purchase, and may even get more for our other children.UPDATE 05/02/13: The tablet is still working, thought it is starting to experience \"glitches\" such as freezing and scrambled screen images. My son has found that they both are fixed by turning off the tablet and restarting it. My biggest concern though is the battery is holding less and less of a charge. When we first purchased it our son would get 2 hours (give or take) on a full charge, now he is getting between 45-60 minutes of tablet time on a full charge. I would still rate this as an excellent starter tablet for a child, but I've had to reduce my ranking from 4 stars to 3 stars.

I  know it was an accident and I feel bad so I want to replace it but I am on a budget. I ordered this as a cheap replacement. I gave it to her on a Friday at 5pm when I picked her up and she said it was great. She loved the layout because it was more like her cell phone than the RCA was. By 3pm the next day she came to me and said \"Dad I didnt drop it but its broken. Its not working right.\" I had already read about this and knew the solution. I told her to hold down the power button for 15 or 20 seconds to reboot it. An hour later I asked her how it was working. She said that it was working the same as when she took it out of the box. Its nice that it is easy to use but needing a reboot after less than 24 hours concerns me about the future of this tablets performance.UPDATE: My daughter is only here 2 weekends a month. After just 3 weekends the charging plug inside the unit no longer works. We had to plug my cell phone charger into the micro-usb slot instead.

First issue they had was all related to the apps performance within the tablet. Some apps won't even play, and other apps weren't even offered in the Google app store because of the tablet compatability.  Another problem with this tablet is that it came with so much pre-loaded apps and junk that's really hard to remove.  I added a 16gb sd card and it really didn't make much difference,  the tablet is still very slow and the system won't allow you to delete or move over certain apps to sd card.Like I said before, this is a great tablet for very young kiddos not older kids.

They are so much less expensive than the iPad Mini and claim to have similar functionality. When the kids first started using them they were really slow and it was clunky to set up the Internet connection and purchase downloads.I read another review that said inserting a 16 gig memory card would speed up the device. I bought two 32 gig cards for the older kids and two 16 gig cards for the younger kids, and that totally solved the speed problem. And now that we've set up payments for downloads and the Internet is connected, that part's not an issue anymore. The kids are really happy playing Minecraft on these things and my son says he is just as happy with this as the iPad Mini he has also used.The one thing I notice that is still a problem from time to time is that they don't pick up a strong Internet signal if they are on the other side of the house form the wireless router. If they are in the same room or next room, no problem. One other thing to be careful about is that the chargers are poorly made and one broke off inside a tablet the first week.

Having played around with it for a week and then my daughter unwrapping it on Christmas I can say it is ok.....Strengths* Google Play support.  Meaning all your apps on your phone or other devices can be put on this.  Also supports Zoodles, but there are some bugs (like can not manage time allowance - it crashes zoodles)* Price - for the listed price you get a tablet (albeit a cheap one)* Amazon + Protection Plans are cheap.  I recommend getting one for a tablet (esp. with Kids).  The Nexus made it a year - with a 4.5 year old.... this one will only be used under supervision.Cons* The screen is weak (not very bright and resolution is poor compared to the nexus)* It is slow - you get what you pay for but if you are running more than one app .... be prepared to wait while the other app is swapped into memory.* Battery is not great.

Boomer \"Boomer\"", "ReviewID": "R129VRIWBCZ1YR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Initially I was very happy with this product. The problem is it didn't last because the quality was so poor. After only two weeks of operation the USB port died. The vendor refused to do anything. They said I should perform a factory reset. They didn't tell me that I should back up my personal data first but I figured that out on my own. A factory reset will cause all personal data and settings to be lost. I backed it up through Google, and performed the reset. It did not fix the USB problem. The vendor still refused to issue an RMA number. I think Amazon will support me in this, but if not my credit card company certainly will.Here is what I thought originally thought when I received the unit:This unit has everything! It has WiFi, 3G, a camera, and it does everything! I even bought a keyboard for about $12.00 US, so that I can actually use it as a real computer. The best part is that the OS is Android 4.0 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" (yum) which is sooo easy to use that anybody could use it!I paid only 74.99 for this dream machine, and I received free shipping because I signed up for Amazon Prime! The display is bright with high contrast and vivid color, so that I found the text very easy to read. I normally need reading glasses so this was a blessing. If you have a phone with the Android OS, this will be very easy for you to operate. This device can take advantage of Google Play Store that has many many apps for just about everything. I installed Angry Birds to test the video, sound, and touch screen. This little baby passed with flying colors! The sound was great, and the pictures were vivid. The touchscreen is so smooth and seamless that I found myself feeling guilty that I had stolen something. I did really, because this is such a great deal.Pros:-Very low cost-Very small footprint, and it easily will fit into any small purse or back pack-Very Fast Response-Extremely Easy to Use (Highly Intuitive)-Great Display with High Contrast, Vivid color, and sharp images (Easy to read)-Fast Response-Huge Market of FREE applications-Plays Movies-Plays games-Available Keyboards (to allow you to really type)-WiFi-3GCons:-Relatively small display compared to more expensive tablets-WiFi cannot connect to WEP, it can only connect o WEP-2 or WPA-2.-Relatively Small local storage space compared to a laptop or desktop computerThere is a strong possibility that I will buy a second unit because my wife likes it so much that she is insisting on having one too! It is so inexpensive, that I have no excuse for not buying one for her! I am very pleased with the high quality construction and feel of this little computer. Since I know how good it is, I won't take the chance of buying a similar unit that might not be as good.Great product!------------------Now however my advice is DON'T BUY! DON'T BUY! DON'T BUY! Beware! This is a POOR quality build and this unit will not last very long.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this Tablet", "Author": "Bahman Seifollahi", "ReviewID": "R12IEP6PHS6AJ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's not a tablet, it's a joke!

This thing takes for ever to load one of the games (5+ minutes) and ever since we got it, it has only held a charge for around 5-10 minutes before completely being dead and having to plug it back in. When we got it we charged it to full, tested out angry birds and 5 minutes later it was showing at about 15% battery we thought that maybe we just did not let it charge long enough and made a mistake that it was not really at full. Well after a few times of this happening we realized that even if you let the battery charge and it says totally full as soon as you take it off the charger it will die really fast. It is ok for Netflix for our son but a pain if he has to sit right next to an outlet the whole time (the cord is really short.) We bought an extension cord so at least he can relax on the couch to play his game or use Netflix but he does not like playing the games because they take so long to load.
