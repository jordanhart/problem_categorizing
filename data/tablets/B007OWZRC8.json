{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "G-Radio", "ReviewID": "R3MAAPNQNQBD9Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting to get a tablet since last year and have been holding out since they announced ICS and Quad-Core processors.  I was going to get the Prime for christmas, but it was unavailable, so I decided to wait and see what came out in the spring.  I've stayed away from the Prime due to the higher price and GPS issues, so it came down to 3 tablets while making my decision (Transformer Pad, Acer Iconia a510 and the Toshiba Excite 10).  All 3 tablets are very similar and met my criteria for a tablet (ICS, Tegra 3, 1280x800 display, HDMI-out, etc.).  I had originally ordered the Iconia a510, but it was back-ordered.  Then I saw the Excite was available and in stock early on Amazon last week, so I cancelled my order for the Acer and immediately orderd the Toshiba. What ultimately sold me on the Toshiba model was the Gorilla Glass, the Stock ICS experience and the Full SD card slot.  My wife takes a lot of pictures and will love being able to just pop the SD card out of the camera and into the tablet.I received the device yesterday and it is very fast and slim.  I used it for a good 3 hours straight last night with music playing in the background and experienced no lag at all and still had 70% battery remaining after the 3 hours.  The Excite 10 is very well built and feels sturdy in the hands.  Not too heavy, but just enough that it doesn't feel like you are going to break it.  The WiFi signal was very strong and didn't have any issues there.  The speakers sound pretty good considering how small they are.  The setup took no time at all and with the Google Restore function, I had all of my phone apps (about 100) on my tablet within 20 minutes.So far I haven't come up with too many Cons for this device.  If I had to list some they would be the following:1. There is a good amount of pre-installed junk on the device.  Not that big of a deal since apps can be disabled in ICS.2. The Charger is proprietary.  It would be nice to charge over microUSB, but with the size of tablet batteries, it would take forever to fully charge, so it is understandable why it doesn't.Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it.UPDATE 5/11/12:1. I wanted to point out that I ran AnTuTu Benchmarking tool and it listed the Excite 10 as a 1.3 GHZ Tegra 3 processor and got a better average score than every other device listed.2. Some of the pre-installed junk can be uninstalled, but some can only be disabled.3. I was able to plug the charger into my Laptop and Car USB ports and it was able to charge. It was charging slower than the wall plug, but a nice feature if the battery is running low.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the best Android Tablets around", "Author": "Nathan foresman", "ReviewID": "R3OO4RKGB2S0VQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I have tried many, many different tablets. So far, this one is definitely my favourite. Let me break it down here:1. SPEED: 9/10I've ran a few benchmarks on it and so far, only the acer a510 has got higher. Still slightly faster than the TF series from Asus (TF101, TF201, TF300) and definitely faster than the first generation tablets (Samsung Galaxy, Toshiba Thrive, Acer a series, BB Playbook). Haven't run into any problems with speed so far.2. BATTERY LIFE: 9/10Again, the Acer a510 tablet is the only one I have run into with a longer battery life. The Asus Prime comes close, but not quite there (I would recommend an app called JuiceDefender, which will greatly help your battery life).3 SCREEN QUALITY: 10/10One of the best. Most tablets that are android based and 10.1 inch screens have1280*800 resolutions, however the brightness and clarity is fantastic. A little warmer than the Prime or Galaxy tabs (works great for HD TV or movies)4. COMFORTABLITY: 7/10An often overlooked attribute is how comfortable the tablet is to hold. This tablet is one of the thinnest, lightest on the market right now, so it is understandably a little odd to hold in landscape, nut trust me, its not nearly as uncomfortable as the Prime or Iconia a200. Once again, the only other tablet that is more comfy to hold is the. Acer a510.5. BUILD QUALITY: 10/10AMAZING! Honestly, the best all around built tablet I have ever experienced hands down. Gorilla Glass, aluminum build, solid.6. OPERATING SYSTEM: 9/10Stock ICS is nice to have, and Toshiba throws in some very cool features with its organization. The only reason it loses a point is for the stock programs that can't be taken off. However this will not slow down anything on the tablet.7:  WHY NOT THE ICONIA?With all the comparisons to the Aer 510, why not it for the same price? Well, I've owned both, and this one is better in almost all regards. I have not run into a bug or hiccup yet. Quite a bit smoother experience of a tablet.OVERALL SCORE: 54/60Actually, this is the best score I have given a tablet. Nothing is perfect, but this is quite high up there. Thanks for the time,Nate.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tegra3 Android Tablet So far... unfortunately.", "Author": "Wayne \"Omegafiler\"", "ReviewID": "RUOCY7H3UHT5B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So far I've owned the ASUS Transformer Prime (TF201), Acer Iconia Tab A510, and now the Toshiba AT305. The TF201 had build quality and wireless/GPS issues and the A510 had a \"grid effect\" to the LCD and some bad heat issues (106+ degrees). And now the AT305, which has light bleed issues. The sad part is that despite this annoying \"issue,\" it's still the best Tegra 3 tablet out there.As with the Acer and Asus, I've already gone through two AT305's just to make sure these issues were consistent. But let's go into a bit more of a detailed review first on the AT305 that I've been using for a few days now.DESIGN:Out of the box, initial impressions are very good. The tablet has a great solid feel to it, it's comfortable to hold, thin, and yes, even light weight. The back has a hard, smooth, plastic feel to it - although I hear its aluminum. If so, it probably has some type of coating on it. Basically, it's one nice looking tablet.I won't go into details regarding where everything is or what feature it has, as you can easily see this from the pictures. Although the one item I must point out is the SD Card Slot, which is on the right side. There is a blank filler card that must be removed when you want to use your own SD card. While the addition of a full-size SD slot is very welcome, there is nothing to cover the slot once your card is in there.So your hand will frequently rub against the sharp inside edges of the plastic casing. I'm normally not a big fan of plastic covers, but in this instance, it would have been very nice to have. If you're planning on getting a case, this won't likely be an issue.WIRELESS:I've tested both wireless and GPS extensively and found them to both perform very well. I'm able to maintain a solid WiFi connection even at the furthest reaches of my Access Point. And GPS can actually pick up a few satellite in-doors, which is always impressive. Outside I can get accuracy down to less than 18ft, within 1-2 minutes. This of course was verified with the GPS Test application.PERFORMANCE:Overall the device is very snappy and I haven't had any issues that I didn't run into with the other Tegra3 devices on Android 4.0.3. There are still a few occasional bugs or glitches with ICS, which I hope they'll resolve soon. Otherwise, nothing specific to the AT305.Antutu scored a 10,313 and Quadrant is right at 4,000.  I've seen slightly higher Antutu scores on the A510, which was closer to 11k. Although as I recall, this is the highest Quadrant score I've seen to date. Keeping in mind that both devices I had scored nearly identical. And in either case, the scores are subjective and personally don't put a whole lot of faith in them.Until they have some new benchmarks that really take advange of the quad core CPU and Tegra3, they're just something to give you interesting numbers to look at. :) Real world tests are where it's at. Speaking of which, playing Tegra 3 games is smooth and they all run expectedly nice. Surfing the web, running apps, and other such tasks are all as expected. Quite good.After watching movies and playing games, I got temps as high as 93 degrees on the back, right side. This was determined by my infrared thermometer. It's not as cool as the 85 degree TF201 but also nowhere near the 106+ degree A510. So I consider that to be on the warm side, but not uncomfortably so. I think the material on the back Toshiba uses helps to dissipate the heat so it doesn't \"feel\" hot or uncomfortable.While surfing or running normal apps, the temps were staying in the 80's where it should be.DISPLAY:Starting positive here, the LCD does look very nice. In fact, of the TF201 and A510, it's the nicest I've seen. Even though it's not IPS (it's TFT as I recall), it looks great. The images are very crisp, colors are vibrant, and it has surprisingly good contrast ratio. The best part is that they've found a very nice color temperature balance.While the A510 was very cool and the TF201 was on the warm side, I found the AT305 to quite neutral. This makes it very pleasing to use whether you are reading, surfing, playing games, or watching a movie.But of course we can't ignore the negative part of this. There is light bleed, and it just makes me very sad. You won't notice this on any normal colorful image. But if you're watching a movie or looking at a picture that has a black background at the edges, you'll see a very uneven amount of light emitting from the sides. And the more you turn up the brightness, the worse it is.In fact, just powering on the tablet, you'll see this on the Toshiba logo as it has a black background. It was exactly the same with both AT305's I got. And it's not something I ever experienced with any other tablet I've owned or used. Normally, this is considered a defect and swapping it out would resolve the issue. But based on my experience and countless other reviews/posts on-line, this is quite common with the AT305.Whether you call it a defect, poor build quality, or a cheap display, it's not desirable.BATTERY:Just in general, when you make something smaller, you tend to make some sacrifices. In this case, it was the battery life. To test it out, I started with a fully charged battery. Then basically used it non-stop until I got down to 20% remaining, at which point we were right at 6 hours of usage. This isn't very good. Although keeping mind this is \"heavy\" usage. I was downloading a bunch of apps, playing games, watching movies, and even ran a benchmark or two during that time.So I'd say heavy usage, you're looking at 7+ hours. Personally I don't like allowing the battery get much lower than 20%, so that's normally about the time I'm looking for a power cord. And yes, the power adapter is straight out of the 90's. There's no reason it needs to be that big; but it is, and I got over it.For me, with \"normal usage,\" I'm easily lasting the entire day on a single charge. This is mostly because I don't use it non-stop and spend most of the time checking e-mail or surfing the web. And overall, it's a fair compromise for its light weight and thinness.SPEAKERS:As with the A510, the AT305 has down-firing speakers at the bottom, and there are in fact two of them (unlike the TF201). They are backed by Toshiba and SRS enhancements, which are definitely needed. If these sound enhancements are turned off, the sound is horrible. But with them on, the speakers actually sound pretty descent.I do suggest turning on the \"boost\" function if it's not loud enough. Surprisingly even with that turned on and volume maxed out, there is no distortion. The A510's speakers still sound noticeably better as there is most detail and they have a fuller sound. The TF305 has a tendency to sound a bit muffled at times, depending on how you're holding it.I still wish they'd put them forward facing. Otherwise, I find them perfectly acceptable and wouldn't mind watching a few shows or demoing the device to friends.So let's wrap this one up.Pros:+ Looks very nice+ Light weight and thin+ Tegra 3 Performance+ Full-size SD Card Slot+ USB functionality+ Descent stereo speakers+ Gorilla GlassCons:- LCD Light Bleed- Only \"OK\" battery life- No SD Card Slot Cover (when in use)- Considering specs (16GB model), could be a bit cheaperCONCLUSION:So how bad is the light bleed? It's annoying enough that this is getting returned. I've been in the IT field for nearly 2 decades and have repaired so many computers and electronics (including many LCD's), I wouldn't even want to guess as to how many. In other words, I know a defect when I see one. :)  However, my lovely wife did play with this for a while and she did \"volunteer\" to take it off my hands - even after showing her the light bleed. It didn't bother her one bit, which I'm sure will be the case for many other folks out there.So my search for a solid Android tablet continues. On the plus side, I think we're getting closer! Just give me all of the good features from Asus, Acer, and Toshiba, and we'll have one killer tablet on our hands. Come on folks, it can't be that hard to spend $400-$500 on a tablet without making compromises.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "The good, the bad and the ugly... (it's a great tablet overall)", "Author": "TyCo \"Learn to accept rejection and reject ac...", "ReviewID": "R2H76EQ7LOW5KI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this tablet (the 32GB version) on Tuesday and after a couple days to get used to it here's what I found;Overall I really like the tablet.  It's fast, very fast, very thin & light, runs most apps without any issues (some apps won't work with it but this is only because the developers haven't put it on the list of compatible devices.  i.e. Lets Golf 3 won't run on it, I'm sure it will be updated to work though.  This tablet definitely has enough power to run it).  There's no way I've found to root it yet though.  I'll keep it as I'm sure someone will come up with a way sooner than later.Some other reviewers have said the sound is too low.  This is fixable by going into the audio enhancement settings and click on SRS sound boost.  With this on the volume is just fine.  The stereo separation is very good too (two speakers located on the bottom side of the device)This tablet has a pretty big proprietary connector on the supplied USB cable. It should last a while, it better be tough for the size of it.  This brings up an interesting point.  When you plug in the tablet with this cable to your computer, nothing happens other than it will charge the tablet.  On all of our computers (5 of them) windows wouldn't recognize the tablet was attached.  When you plug in the tablet with a micro USB cable the computer will recognize it.  It's a bummer they use a huge connector on a cable that only charges the tablet and then only at 5v.  Takes a long time to charge.  On the upside you can use external battery pack chargers (you can get 10000+mAh batteries for around $60 on Amazon that will provide a lot of spare power.Toshiba tech support from my limited experience with them is awful.  I called about transferring files via the supplied cable and they were no help.I also had an issue using the USB host functionality trying to use an external hard drive and found via their tech support it will only support drives formatted to exFAT, FAT or FAT32.  DOES NOT support drives formatted to NTFS.  This is very odd...  I had to back up a 750GB Oyen Digital hard drive, reformat it and then transfer the files (mostly movies and TV shows) back to it.  Took forever.  Now that the drive is formatted to exFAT it works perfectly.  Just plug it in using a micro USB host cable (purchased separately) and viola, it shows up on the file explorer (both the stock file explorer and ES file explorer).PROS:* It's very light and thin* It's super-fast.  I scored a little over 10300 on AnTuTu benchmark, and this is with the tablet loaded up with apps (my xoom would only do 6700 or so).  Once I can root it and overclock it a bit I'm sure it'll be one of the fastest tablets around.* Full sized SD card support.  I'm using a 64GB card and it works great.  I'm sure it'll handle a 128GB card.  If I spring for one I'll update this review if it doesn't.* Some of the bloatware is un-installable (the demo app, games etc.).  You don't need to unable them, but that is an option if you want to keep them on the device.* Screen image is sharp (although there is a fair amount of light bleed - see the cons)* Gorilla Glass* Handles 1080p video well, although the native video players doesn't handle many video formats. Use \"MX Player\", free on the market and will play anything.* Screen is very responsive.  Almost too responsive, when you go to touch an icon if your finger is moving at all left or right it will start to scroll the page and you'll need to touch the icon again to open the app.* Very good wifi and GPS reception.* Stock browser works great.  Haven't had a force close yet (this would happen all the time on my Xoom, even after I upgraded it to ICS).* USB host functionality is great (many devices need to be rooted to get this to work).* Charging off of a standard USB port is nice, but it takes a long time to fully charge.* Battery life is pretty good.  I've been getting around 8 hours of actual use (mix of streaming vids, checking email, etc).* Boot time is fast.  I clocked 55 seconds from off to the lock screen showing up and then another 10-15 seconds for widgets to load.CONS:* Lots of light bleed.  Not very noticeable if you're watching something with a lot of light but during dark scenes it's a little annoying.* Proprietary charging cable that only seems to charge the tablet.* Charging takes a looong time* No way to root yet.  After some digging around it looks like it might be awhile before a rooting method is released... This is a real bummer.* Can only handle FAT formats if you use an external hard drive.* Some apps aren't compatible with it, yet.* You have to click the notification area a few times sometimes to get it to open up.That's about it.  Overall I really like this tablet and can't wait for a rooting method to be released.  If I notice anything else that needs to be addressed I'll update this review.

The right side heat of the A510 is getting annoying.  Even viewing PDF files results in very warm to hot on the right side.  The Excite barely gets warm even when playing 3D games.2. The USB location on the A510 makes having the nice feature not practical.  Having it on the bottom is pure stupid and flipping the tablet upside down still makes using it awkward.3. After having the 305 a few days I really ntocie the vertical lcd array lines on the A510.  The Excite does not have these.4. Touch response is better on the Excite5. Having a 128GB sd card formatted to exFAT works well and better than expected.I am returning the A510 and will keep the Excite.  Very ironic.EndI appreciate the Asus 300 and Prime are also good tablets, but the 300's build is flimsy and needs a special cable for data transfer.  The Prime has weak wifi due to the panel design, so IMO it is a current match between the Excite 10 and the Acer A510 (I am putting the Excite first, since this IS the product page for it):Build = Excite.  I thought the A510 was built well, but the Excite is a work of art and design and has Gorilla glass.Comfort to hold = Tie.  The Acer feels better to hold and grip, but the Excite is lighter and does not get hot on the right like the A510 can.Performance/Speed = Excite, but barely. Benchmarks are a tad higher and seems to have a little better response.Display = A510 (but subjective).  The contrast is better and no light bleed around the edges that the Excite has.  Some may prefer the slightly warmer color though.  Still, both are 1280X800 and neither in the same league the iPad 3, but no others are.Sound = A510.  Fuller sound and better stereo effect, plus output to TV sounds better for surround sound.  Both tablets have sound features that need activation for better sound.File system = A510.  My 1TB NTSF drive works great and can play 1080p MKV movies from it.  The catch is can not charge at same time, so good the battery is so huge.  I also had a Toshiba Thrive before and like the Excite, third party apps did not work well with files.  Comic apps would not delete files either, so had to use the stock file manager.  A510 works with everything thrown at it, but constrained to the file manager on the Excite.Ports = Tie.  Excite has full SD slot (nice), but the special connector is needed for charging.  No special connector needed for the A510, so easier to find other charging options IF you forget or lose the charger.  You are SOL if you misplace the Excite charger connector.Battery life = A510.  No contest here.  About three hours longer with similar medium and heavy use (Web browsing, stream Netflix, Amazon on demand, local video, gaming and comic reading).Though both are nice tablets, I give the win to the A510 due to better battery life and file management.  That said, the Excite is a nice tablet.Added:  I wish Toshiba (and other OEMs) used the file system same drivers as Acer.  Mobiletech review mentions this too, so not just me going crazy.Added 2:  Both have real good wifi and another plus for the A510 is 16gb more internal storage for the same price as the Excite.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great addition to my work and personal life!", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R189U8NTNBMK2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tablet instead if the thrive because of the Tetra 3  processor and coming into the tablet world I wanted something that can handle the daily stress. All I have to say is measuring up to other tablet that my friends have it is totally awesome. The one thing that they did great is the keyboard most of the others that I have handled have had a delay with the keystrokes this is flawless in that respect. The camera works great for Skype and picks. The auto rotating screen is seamless and the manual lock for the screen rotation is something that many don't like it is great. I have had this tablet for about a week and a half and the HDMI port is the most sought after port that I have it works great for connecting to my TV to watch Netflix, and data transfer. Toshiba has made up for the drawbacks from the first tablet I have only the 16 gig and has plenty of room for all the apps, photos, favorite music, and files that I like to have a digital copy of. One of the things that really sold me was the SD slot, I have big fingers and the fact that I don't have to have a tiny card to put into a tiny slot is the best. This also will recognise external hard drives you just have to have a micro USB to what ever you hard drive takes. The only drawback that I have seen is the screen isn't super HD but it is clear and has great color. So if you want a tablet that is NOT a iPad and is dependable has plenty of port options this might be it for you.

Then I got really excited when a refurbished Thrive was offered on Woot, so I bought it.  Within three weeks, the glass randomly cracked overnight.  I know a lot of people will think I am exaggerating, and that I must have dropped it, but honestly, I had it in a leather cover, closed the cover, put it next to the bed, flat, and went to sleep.  Woke up in the morning and the corner was cracked.  By the end of the day the crack had extended across the screen.  I called Toshiba, and they wouldn't do a thing for me.  I found a second day where Woot offered Thrives, and tried again.  This one I dropped. and part of the screen shattered.  I went back to using the first tablet, as the cracking was a minor annoyance compared to the second one, and it just steadily got worse.  I changed my mind and the Thrive was no longer the way to go.So when shopping for a new replacement, I was certainly not going to get another Thrive, and I couldn't imagine getting another Toshiba product.  And after having had a tablet for a few months, I realized that for my purposes, the only thing that was important that wasn't standard to every Android based tablet out there was to have Gorilla Glass.  I know its not unbreakable, but it is much harder to break.  So I started shopping again, and they announced the Excite.  I didn't get excited, because it was another Toshiba product.  But every other single tablet out there with Gorilla glass was either 7 inches, or priced out of my interest range.  So I checked into the Excite.It runs much more smoothly than the Thrive did, it is significantly lighter and sleeker.  I don't have a compulsive urge to own backplates in every color (luckily I talked myself out of buying any backplate for the Thrive except the silver, which I got on sale), and even though I have already dropped it once (yes, I am horribly clumsy), the glass is still intact after 3 weeks of ownership.  I am much more impressed with the durability and the speed.  The sound from the Excite exceeds the Thrive also, it sounds much more clear.  And the battery life, oh, the battery life is wonderful.  With light to moderate use, I can get two days out of the battery.  The screen is beautiful and bright and crisp, enough that I decided that it is too pretty to put an anti glare screen protector on and got a clear one instead so I can enjoy the crispness of the picture.My only cons are that it is hard to find economically priced accessories, as this is so new to the market, it takes longer than the Thrive to charge, and this only seems to happen when I leave a particular app running, but it occasionally seems to turn itself on.  This could also be related to the fact that the power and volume buttons are exceedingly easy to activate, to the point where I frequently hit the volume button by accident when holding the tablet in landscape view.All in all, I am very pleased with the Excite.  I got it for a reasonable price here at Amazon, and since I wasn't buying a refurbished model, I also opted for the square trade warranty, so even if I do manage to clumsy my way into breaking the glass, it should be covered.**edit due to experience with the tablet**The charger is less than cooperative.  For the past couple of weeks the cord has to be positioned perfectly, and even if it isn't moved (plugged in overnight, not moving it after I establish that it is being charged) the charger will disconnect itself somehow, even though it is securely plugged in.  I checked the connections at the tablet, from the usb to the wall plug, and from the wall plug into the wall each time, and all were secure, but the tablet does not charge reliably.  This is a big downside after only 4 months, and I can't find a replacement charger out there (though admittedly, I haven't looked very hard yet), they all seem to think that it charges through the usb, and I don't think this is true.However, I still love my Excite, and I have had it longer than I had either of the two Thrives and the glass has yet to crack!

Its fast, light and aesthetically it looks good. But, like many others, I'm sending mine back due to light bleed.  Lots of it!  If the new one is good (amazon is overnighting it to me) then I will definitely be keeping it and getting rid of my Galaxy Tab 7.7 (great tablet but I wanted a bigger screen and Samsung is too slow in upgrading the O/S).Couple of things worth knowing if you are buying this tablet...- you must format your external SD card as exFAT if you want full write access with 3rd party apps. Thanks to another reviewer for this tip.- battery life is OK, not great. People are claiming 6 - 8 hours depending on use, I'd say that's about right.- external speaker is good, when enhancements are turned on, but not great.

It was a good tablet, but it came with a lot of light bleeding. I exchanged it for another, which also had some. The main reason I returned the TF300 was because of its build. It seems cheaply made and didn't come with gorilla glass. The Toshiba Excite is built like a tank. It doesn't make sounds when bent and comes with gorilla glass. I love the color on the back and the screen is also very nice. The viewing angles are also good. Compared to the Asus, the Toshiba seems to be faster. This might be because the OS is very close to stock and not very modified. However, the Toshiba did come with a lot of bloatware. Overall, I think it is a great tablet for the price you pay for it. Some cons for me include a lot of light bleeding around all sides of the tablet (I may exchange it for another, but almost all of these tablet have light bleeding - some more than others), the camera is just OK compared to the Asus (5 MP vs 8 MP), and the dock connector looks ridiculously huge. Overall, I am giving it a 4/5 because of the light bleeding mine came with.Update: I went through a few and they all have a lot of lightbleed. Not happy as it stands out in dark conditions! Might have to switch tablet brands..

My first tablet and I love it.  Great screen, I have notice any issues with the bleed previously referred to.  I've had mine for a week now and its great.  I agree that without a case, this is a little uncomfortable to hold for long stretches.  I bought a Bob J Gear case (perhaps fearing the Mayan calendar would jeopardize my purchase) and it feels great.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that Toshiba has been very slow at accessorizing this product.  There aren't any docking stations for this tablet and the placement of the power cord, you'll have to find a unique stand to make it happen.  It looks as if Toshiba is consolidating its lineup to Excite 10SE and 7.7s.  This shouldn't interupt product support for the 305 models (same basic case/chips).  Just something to think about.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Light-Bleed problem is over-stated. Great tablet!", "Author": "Stan Man \"stanf15\"", "ReviewID": "R7VIWS3ZEGLQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very pleased with my 10\" Toshiba Excite 64 GB purchase. At first I was hesitant to buy it because some of the negative reviews about the light-bleed. However, after getting this tablet and using it for 2 weeks, I have to say this problem is NOT a show-stopper in the least.Yes, you can see some light-bleed on the all-black boot-up screen at the beginning, when you reboot the tablet. But other than that, it is simply not visible and the display looks crisp and fantastic. If you are a true video-phile and are OCD about having zero light bleed during your dark movie scenes, chances are you would be using the tablet's HDMI-out and streaming the movies or You Tube content through your big screen plasma or LCD TV. So your movie will look ultra-dark on the big screen. Frankly, I don't bother and watch all the video content directly on the tablet in HD. And it is smooth as silk with the light-bleed being a non-issue...UNLESS you are looking at an extremely dark scene. Even then, it just does not take away from the overall experience. This issue has been over-blown by some of the reviewers, IMO.Here are other great things about this tablet: 1) NVidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor is very fast. 2) Couple this with the MX Video player from Google Play store, and there is no video format that it can't handle. 3) You can store all your photos and videos in the full-size SD card slot. I put a 32 GB Class 10 SD card in it and it is seamless. But I think 64 or 128 GB will work just as well. 4) Just as thin and light as the latest i-Pad. Very sleek form. 5) Stable, have had zero crashes after 3 weeks of use. It came stock with ICS, but Toshiba has made Jelly Bean available and I love it. 6) Despite the thin, light form factor, it feels like a solid build, and comes with Gorilla Glass.Be careful not to confuse this tablet with the even sleeker looking but LESS powerful Excite 10 LE.

I also go with brands I trust. In this case the Toshiba Excite was a double win. It is very fast and has a beautiful display, but it also possesses a HDMI output (micro) that many other devices do not have.With all the coming technology in TVs and Monitors, you would think that most gadgets would have some way to connect to any display. Other than buying same brand devices that support blue-tooth syncing, you would be out of luck. However, with a $5 hdmi cable, I have a mobile media device I can plug into my big screen and watch all my favorite shows shared on my home media network.To share media I simply have my Windows Media Player up to date, and through the Toshiba Media player I can select most files (not MKV) from the network device option. The Excite is fast enough that there is little buffering required.The battery life on this tablet is simply amazing. It lasts for days unplugged if I am using it as an e-reader or internet device. I really only charge it when I am streaming videos from it, mainly for the fact that since it will be tethered to my TV I should have it plugged in since it will already be near an outlet.The memory card port is another bonus as well. Though with 32gb on the device itself, it is nice knowing I can add more memory if I need. But as I stream everything, this is not a problem.As far as performance goes, this beast runs smoothly. Before I purchased a tablet I played with a quite a few models. I loaded up the homepages with tons of widgets and apps. I would then switch between pages. This was the only tablet that was still able to glide between the pages. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 (2) was not even able to do this. Apps, videos, music and different files all open with haste and I have yet to see any signs of slowed performance; associated with lesser devices.Now, I was tempted to purchased the next line of Excites (the smaller, lighter ones) however, though slightly bigger, this line of Excites carries more features.

I ordered a used one (like new condition) from Amazon Warehouse.It came very fast within 2 days. Look like the warehouse is in NV state and I am in CA.I got the tablet S/N:5C043564R.You have to look at the video to believe me for what was happening.This tablet has some kind of remote software installed which can monitor what you do as soon as you get on the Internet.At first i thought the tablet seems to be over responsive.I haven't it but it managed to click and move itself.While I tried to type in the password, the cursor will keep moving from the password field to the other.I finally got into Gmail App and I was shocked to see what happened to the tablet.Somebody remotely scroll+touch+zoom+up+down through my emails, trying to find some confidential information.I didn't believe my eyes.I did power off the unit and restarted again. As soon as I got into Gmail app, it happens again.I grabbed my phone to capture what happened and then turn the power button totally off.4 hrs later, I wonder if it will act the same since I move to another location.Before I connect the Wi-Fi, I went into Adroid setting and to do the factory reset, hoping to wipe off whatever is.I almost thought that it did remove those hacker remote thing. I was so afraid so I went in the App and disable GMAIL app.Then I went to download some Antivirus software on the Google Play. I installed Lookout and Zapper Task Killer, hoping that I would kill or see what is running behind. Everything seems to be normal at that moment.I installed and signup on other app like Netflix and Skype. I was having a hard time while entering the password because the cursor kept moving out of the password field by itself.I finally went into email again this time via PrintShare App.Again I can see somebody has remotely scroll up & down and looked into my emails. Try to find something.It does finally stop at the email that have my info, which my full name and address on it.I could not believe my eyes. The chill was running down my back.This is the real criminal here.I am sending this tablet back for sure.I just want to give a warning to the other user who might have bought the used tablet.PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS REMOTELY WATCHING YOUR TABLET HACKER", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "fernando jose gimenez velaides", "Author": "fernando", "ReviewID": "R2AH5TNNXC73QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "me encanta el producto muy buena eleccion lo uso para mi labores personales en herramienta muy fundamental para el dia a dia", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "tablet gets very hot, major light bleeding , and flickering screen. brightness is low", "Author": "John Ramos", "ReviewID": "RON86VQD7BJOS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i got the tablet and had it for not even 24 hrs before i was ready to send it back. when playing any graphical tegra games the unit gets very hot on the right side from the middle up to the point where it is very uncomfortable. the light bleed is major and when your doing anything that using a black background you will obsolutly see light bleeding through at every LED point along the sides of the unit. watching movies or video is where you see this the most. and the unit just is not very bright so if your outside expect diffuclty reading even in the shade. if you want a great tablet get one of the asus transformer seres with an IPS+ display as you can use the unit in almost direct sunlight without any issue. i almost always keep the brightness down tot he minnimum unless in sunlight. just being in the shade on a bright day you do not even need the ips+ on just the brightness at half level.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Company/Product", "Author": "randy", "ReviewID": "R3JAZ4B9KK3FSF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased May 2012.

Tablet comes charged so you can turn it on right out of the box. This is my first tablet to own, so maybe I'll miss some valid points or lack in comparison detail. I have checked out some of the competition regularly at big box stores, but went in blindly on this one. I liked the Toshiba Thrive before, but I'm glad I waited because this Excite tablet is thin! It's well built and the display is very bright and colors are very nice. I was worried at first because when you type on it there is a vibration and thought it was the backing coming loose from the top. Turned that option off. Connects very easily to wifi. Signal is a little weak across the room, but that could just be my router's power even though it's supposed to be high powered. Haven't tried GPS out on the road yet, but I expect it will work well because what I did play with worked well. Love the full sized SD slot. Being able to put my card in a tablet to view pictures on a bigger screen was one of the main things I was after. Do wish it had a cover for after you insert a card, but oh well. The micro usb and micro HDMI ports are very nice add ons as well.I'm not sure if other people's reviews are talking about the Excite 10LE, but a lot of the things they say are not true. The charger is quite small, the screen is very bright and vivid, and this thing is very quick at loading and ripping through apps etc. A few negative things, the volume rocker is a little too easy to press when holding in landscape mode. There are some stutters in certain applications. Finally, the reason I'm returning it is because there is a speck of something under the glass on the left side of the screen. I'm going to swap it for a different one and hope the display is clean. What a bummer because I was really liking this tablet. Hopefully I will get a perfect one because for $449 it's not exactly cheap cheap.Overall, this is a very solid tablet. Love ICS, and quad core is very fast. Used it for about 4 hours just downloading and experimenting watching videos and battery only went down to about 75%. I think that is pretty good for having the screen pumped up to full brightness. Also, love the native multi-language support. Was able to switch to a Japanese IME with no problem and even swype works with it. Kind of cool. Can't wait to get my replacement!I'll keep the review at 3 stars because it is a nice piece of hardware, but I've decided to return my 2nd shot at this tablet. The light bleed around the edge of the display became annoying. At first I thought maybe I could live with it if it was only apparent on black out screens or scene transitions in movies/tv. Then I realized it even washes out sections of medium depth colors. When/If Toshiba fixes their display quality problems on this tablet I may pick one up again. Until then, I'm still on the search for a good tablet.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "I just got mine.. Wow..

I am going to write a review of the Toshiba Excite 350.I do like this tab, though I am still getting used to it (I am a first-time tab owner) and there are a few technical issues that I believe can be fixed with workarounds.One of those issues was a problem I had with my Google calendar. Events were not syncing into the tab. This issue was not isolated to the Excite. The same thing was happening on the Acer A510 that I exchanged. There seems to be an issue with my original Google calendar and ICS.What I did to resolve the problem was to create a new Google account and sync all my events to the new calendar, then sync the new calendar into my tab calendar. I now have my own little super highway going on because I still use my original calendar, which syncs to my HTC Rezound and Microsoft Outlook. The wonderful and smart people at the HTC Rezound Android Central group gave me enough tips to get this one figured out. Here is just a short summary of how I resolved the problem: [..]My other issue right now is that the Twitter app is not working. It will not retain my account settings. So, I have written to Twitter and hopefully there will be an answer. What I think might be happening is that Twitter is not showing up in the sync accounts area. They are sitting there in my phone, but nowhere to be found on the tab. I would like to have Twitter working. Anyway, my issues are basically software related, which is a good thing because with Android there is always a workaround if you look hard enough.I was asked about light bleed and I have not seen any of that with this tab. I think the display is really nice. The colors are good and everything looks really pretty. The browsing is not at the speed of light, but it suffices. The browser default is a news and information page. I don't mind that and there is a Google search bar on the page.I do find that the screen rotation is sometimes sluggish. It eventually gets there and it is not all the time, but there are times when it seemingly gets stuck. Movies look great and the sound is good too.I love using Latitude so that I can stalk my favorite people and I was very happy that I was able to use some of the labs without forcing the app to crash. The GPS works great. It always finds me wherever I am and the wifi works great and connects seamlessly.And the one little thing that I really, really like is these little app folders on the home screens. I have yet to figure out what they are called so that I can create more of them or customize what I have, but they are very cool. You can add a group of apps to them and they are right at your fingertips.I have not yet tried out the camera or video. I will update after I get to those features. I am also waiting for my keyboard and folding case to arrive. I ordered both the case and keyboard from Amazon because they were much better priced than at Toshiba. The folding case is temporarily out of stock. I am anxious for that to get to me.I did order an extra power cord from Toshiba ... could not find it anywhere else. The cord is pretty bulky, but it still fits into my nice carry case. The unit feels really nice in the hands. It is light and there are no sharp edges.I will give the unit four stars for now.Hope this helps. I will add on as I get more familiar with the unit.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good features, but washed out screen", "Author": "Jon Braude", "ReviewID": "R3U7YPL0QQHKRE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I chose the Excite over other tablets mainly because of the full-size SD card and a good sale price ($299).

The screen brightness adjustment didn't help and I downloaded various apps to try and resolve the problem, but they didn't help. I returned my first one and exchanged it for another, but the second one was no better. I called Toshiba tech support and they didn't know what \"washed out\" meant.

That said, I decided that I would purchase the Toshiba Excite 10 AT305 32. Right out of the box I had browser issues. The browser page would go blank after a few minutes and this happend on both the browser that came loaded with the tablet and Google Chrome, which I loaded through Android Market. I noticed that there was a Toshiba service update and hoped that the update would address the issues.Once I installed the service update my troubles really began. I received a message in the middle of the reboot that read \"com.google.process.gapps could not load.\" Once the tablet fully rebooted some of my Google apps would not sync and when I tried to launch the other Google apps  I received an error mess that the app was not installed. Also, I could not reinstall apps or download apps from Android Market. I called Toshiba customer support and they had me do a factory reset. After the factory reset I get a error message that my \"key board has stopped\" and now I can't set-up my tablet, even after a 2nd reset. My Toshiba Excite 10 is anything but Exciting and is a useless piece of garbage.Upon speaking to Toshiba tech support again their only response was, \"ship it back for service.\" I want them to send me a new product or refund my money and then I'll ship their trash back to them.Why is it too much to ask that a product you purchase work? And when it doesn't work the company should make you whole for it. Now I have to spend time and money shipping the piece of garbage back to Toshiba only to get the same piece of garbage shipped back to me weeks if not months later after they \"service it\".

There was no bleeding of colors with black screen.  2. Response was laging, not as fast as the Samsung 10.2. 3. $450 is way too much by at least a c-note. 4. Went to Tegrazone.com and tried to d/l the game glowball. It wouldn't load.

I bought a Thrive in March 2012 with the understanding that it would be easily upgraded. I felt assured that this tablet would be all I'd need for at least a couple of years. WRONG!! Toshiba upgrades are more than buggy, you will find yourself with a useless device. Even more important than that, there is NO SUPPORT from Toshiba. I raved about my Toshiba tablet and recommended it to many others and feel like a fool for doing so. I hope no one listened to me. Did I make myself clear? In case I did not, Toshiba does not support their tablet customers.
