{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely perfect!", "Author": "K. Sperling \"loving mommyhood!\"", "ReviewID": "R2FWTEC89IKHLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd d2 pad.  I really liked the 1st, but this one I LOVE!About the 1st...The 1st one (model # DII_pad) I purchased from Big Lots for the same price ($80).  It is the older model. I saw it and thought it was worth the try for the price.  The WiFi signal was stronger than my samsung smartphone.  It was surprisingly fast and stable.  It has a nice sturdy, quality feel to it, unlike the polariod tablet I also purchased from Big Lots (that was also VERY slow). The D2 screen looks beautiful, video looks great. I installed the flashplayer via the d2 website instructions. The battery life is not very long (about 3 hours of heavy game playing, more for reading ebooks), but it charges in just about an hour.  My only complaint was that the amazon kindle app didn't work and temple run couldn't be played because the tilt feature didn't work in the game. Tilt worked just fine on other apps like labyrinth. My daughter loves my d2 pad, so she asked for one of her own over a kindle (which her dad has).This newer one (model # D2-711) from Amazon is AWESOME! It's even faster.  My daughter is very happy. I downloaded and installed about 12 apps in just over a half hour.  The WiFi is super strong.  Kindle App works great. I already put a couple of books on the pad for my daughter. Temple run works great, as do the other apps.  For anyone wondering what kind of case to get for it, it fits pretty well in my husbands Kindle fire case from amazon (Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware). Snaps in and sits pretty snug and you have access to all the buttons and ports which are now on the bottom after the redesign.About the company.  D2 pad in on facebook.  The staff there actually reads and responds to posts and questions about their product, sometimes the same day, but usually withing a day or two.  Their website has lots of info on the FAQ page, but good luck contacting anyone through the website. Word of warning...the software update for the older version (my 1st purchase) actually contains a trojan, so be advised to check any download before installing.  That is my ONLY concern about this product. I haven't needed to download anything for this new d2 pad.I would totally recommend this tablet for anyone looking for good performance and great value.  We've tried a couple of other Big Lots tablets and have not been impressed the way we are with the D2.  I recommend buying this product through Amazon because they have the newer version.  If you find yourself looking at a d2 pad in a retail store sometime, my best advice is to look a the model number or the serial number on the bottom of the box. Serial # beginning D201208... is the older model with a few small issues.  If the serial number begins D201209...this is the newer model, the fantastic one!", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet for a Kid", "Author": "S. Mom", "ReviewID": "R34HXZDQVHN7B1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a tablet for my daughter for months and I have always kept my eye on the D2 tablets because of their high ratings for tablets under $100. I waited too late to get the pink one (other sellers over charge for the tablet). I was given a Kindle Fire HD for Valentine's Day and the kid when crazy over it. To keep my Kindle from ending up like my laptop (poor hinge), I decided it was now or never to buy her a tablet.I only gave it four stars because we have only had it for almost a week (never know what may happen). Let me start with cons. :)CONS:Many have said the internet is slow and compared to my computers and Kindle, it is. It reminds me of my cell phone when I use data from my carrier and not Wi-Fi, meaning it takes about five more seconds to load. So if you an adult who needs super fast, instant internet, move along!The movies did not work...but I knew they were NOT the type of movies my 3 year old would want. Kido'z TV was not installed on mine so installed it myself. That is a great app for children to watch shows without the extras on Youtube.The camera is on the top right corner (holding it as pictured). I'm used to laptop cams being in the middle BUT as of now, she will not be using Skype or anything else. Quality of the camera is not the best (0.3 megapixels) but it's better than nothing!It's not HD...so if that what you are looking for, move along! Quality is great in my opinion.AS USUAL there are some apps you cannot delete BUT they do allow you to disable them in the settings menu.PROS:I LOVE the Mee Genius app and the free books that came with it. The narrations for those books are ten times better than me downloading kids books on my Kindle and having the system narrator read. One book about a Jungle Orchestra even had neat music and songs to go with it.The instructions that come with it makes it very easy to understand and how to operate. Be sure to follow the directions of charging before operating (mine turned on after inserting the charger) and draining the battery twice. I am just now letting it die the second time because I restrict her usage.It fits a case for the Kindle Fire (not HD) purchased at Walmart. Only issue is openings block the headphone jack (no big deal).Comes with a charger, a USB cord, and some other cable I am assuming  is for TV, computer...something!Battery life is fine.Right now I am using a 2GB micro SD card to store some apps and the micro SD card works fine. (Note: I had to turn off debugging when I used the USB to transfer songs to the SD card while inside the tablet. Too lazy to get the converter card to put it directly in the computer.)Rubberized backing...because I never liked the smooth backing on ANYTHING!OVERALL: I think it is not a bad tablet to have for a child or a beginner tablet user.I keep my eye on it at all times like my Kindle (neither have had falling accidents) so be sure to get a cover case with a stand, screen protector, AND a shock proof travel case on Amazon or from Big Lots (take it in the store to make sure it fits). Way cheaper than Walmart, Kmart, Target...wherever!", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great For Price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "jnee27", "ReviewID": "R3P2S2L1RH473S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tablet for 79.99 @ big lots and its awesome for the price,u can play decent games web browser pretty good wifi picks up great body is soild,great speaker and packed with 1gb ram most for this price only gives 256mb ,this beats alot of tablets like cobys etc even though its not preloaded with google play ,i have it on mine now so its possible ,but the mobile one not a bad store for free apps ,come on amazon sell this tablet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet especially considering the price.", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R1BWLARNHMQQYY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I use an original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 and and Galaxy S3 Phone.  So my kids were dying for a device of their own.I picked up a couple of these for them to use.  In my testing so far this tablet works well for such a inexpensive tablet.  Battery life isn't great but sufficient.  It comes with a proprietary wall plug for charging, but it may charge over USB as well.  Played some Videos on it, worked well.So far the biggest complaint is the lack of Google Play Store. Tried to install it myself but it keeps crashing (any ideas on that?).Update 04/10/2013:Downgraded my review (4 to 3 star).  The battery life on standby is horrible. 6-8 hours on standby and the battery is gone.  Found that they left unneeded cellphone (no cellular hardware on the device) software running and it kills the battery trying to find a cell signal.  I contacted support weeks ago, they acknowledged the issue (barely) but no fixes so far.Since no Play store you have 2 basic options: - Amazon Store  It is an OK replacement, more geared towards Kindle devices. Not as many apps available as the Play store. - 1Mobile Market  This is the default on the device. Again not as many apps as the Play Store, and those it does have are often out of date.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, Great Value!!", "Author": "Leo Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2DCTDGT64799S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these D2 7\" tablets during the holiday season for $79.99 each. I purchased a blue one for myself and a pink one for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I must say that I'm very impressed with our overall experience with these products.My daughter absolutely loves her pink tablet and uses it all the time. She is constantly watching videos on youtube and playing on Disney websites but even more so she loves all the games, books and apps that are geared toward kids that come pre-loaded on these tablets. The fact that D2 pre-loads 20 eBooks for kids, lots of kids learning apps from Kevin Bradford, and other fun games and apps makes these tablets an even bigger hit in our household.From a parent standpoint this tablet also works very well and comes equiped with pre-loaded utilities such as Dropbox, Pulse News and Kingsoft Office. However since these tablets seem to be marketed as a household tablet that can work for the enitre family I was also impressed that D2 had thought to pre-load a Kids Place parental control app launcher to protect personal data and restrict kids to only approved apps.From my experience we have had no issues with our D2 tablets and the internet seems to work just fine on my home wifi network. I would definately recommend this tablet and believe it is a great value at $79.99.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I finally bought the right tablet", "Author": "Staci M", "ReviewID": "R11M09EMW4QKO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the third tablet I've purchased during the Holiday season. the first was a MID Tablet for my husband and the Wifi is awful. He insists on keeping it though.The second was a supposed to be a Wolvol tablet. but it was not as advertised, so I sent it back.This one is the one I'm keepingAfter checking the reviews I purchased the D2pad tablet in pink, simply because I'm a firm believer that if you girl up your stuff, it wont be likely to be stolen.I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pink version has a rubberized back(the blue is rubberized too) instead of the plastic back that comes with the black and white versions.As for the tablet itself. I'm finding it very easy to figure out.At first I was a bit alarmed to find that it doesn't work with Google play, but as it turns out the Amazon App store and the 1Mobile app store pre installed have everything Google Play has and more, so its really wasn't an issue at all.It picks up a WiFi signal with no problem, sometimes I have to turn off the wifi and turn it back on for a better connection but that's always been the case with my laptop too, so that's nothing new.This tablet comes packed with children's games and books which is great if your giving this to a child. personally I didn't need any, so I finally figured out how to get rid of them. I went to 1Mobile and downloaded an app called \"Root App Delete\" to get rid of them, so now my tablet has only what I want.I also downloaded Pandora, so I could listen to music and was amazed that the speakers on this tablet work better than a creative zen MP3 player.This tablet works well viewing youtube videos. I've noticed that it wont view my videos from Dropbox, but I think that's because they are not in an AVI format.Some people complain about the battery life but I've been able to play on this thing for about 3 hours without having to charge it.I think that's pretty good as I don't usually stay online for more than a couple hours at a time.Overall I have to say I'm impressed with my new toy.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "**UPDATE** Works fine.

My sister has dropped her cheaper tablet and it still runs.It has gotten slower and slower to the point where its not even worth the bother to use.Tried using NETFLIX yesterday...wouldnt load it, and when it did it got stuck buffering.Save your money and move on.

He is extremely pleased with the speed, the variations and all the possibilities of it's use. The price was awesome, and it is perfect for getting on his social web-sites. The only draw back is the pre-downloaded Amazon Aps Store application. DO NOT download any of the applications on this site, these applications have dangerous malware attached to them when they are downloaded. I purchased additional virus protection for his tablet, and every time we attempted to download any of those applications the virus protection would warn us that there was malicious malware attached to the application. I just do not understand why Amazon continues to offer these free applications that immediately causes owners of new android devices to download malicious applications that will ruin your device before you can really use it.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not half bad", "Author": "Joseph Kent", "ReviewID": "RVDR63UAZ8UBC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.  However, that was stolen from me on the bus, so I needed a quick replacement.I've taken to calling this a \"half tablet.\"  It was (less than) half the cost of the GT2, has half the processor cores, half the RAM, and half the flash memory.  But all in all, it's not half bad.I took the time to figure out how to put the Google Play store on this device, which is a necessity, since one of the apps I wanted a tablet for was Google Play Magazines.  I'd venture to say that most users just diving in to the Android platform would be fine with just the 1Mobile Market that comes stock on this tablet.  But when you've been an Android user for as long as I have, Google Play Store is a must.  Still, it was simple enough to find help online with installing the Play store, so it's not a huge deal.The 4GB storage was a bit scary to me.  I was close to filling the 8GB storage on the GT2 a few times, so 4GB didn't seem like a good idea.  However, unlike most ICS devices, this tablet allows you the option to move apps to the SD card, which lets you add more apps than I originally anticipated.All in all, if you're just looking for functionality, this tablet is pretty decent.

I have a Droid X with the earlier Gingerbread Android and I haven't had this much problem as I did with this tablet in terms of scrolling and input. I don't really believe it is the operating system at this point, but rather the hardware D2 puts into their equipment that is causing the software to delay and not work properly.

This D2 is stable, has never crashed and although it is not very fast it works well. I installed a ROOT CHECKER and found it is rooted out of the box. The BUMMER is that this device is not a certified Google device so it cannot get APPS from Google Play or use Google maps. You can still get APPS from Amazon or 1Mobile but I suggest you check out the APPS first at Google Play. Their reviews and permissions information is invaluable. I was shocked to learn one of the most popular APPS can control you phone (or tablet). It can send, read or delete SMS messages, make phone calls, take pictures and It can read data about your contacts all without your confirmation. So folks, be careful. There are alot of free APPS but the, there is no free lunch. They want your information. Call me paranoid but I have been subject to identity theft and it was a bummer. For this reason I do not intend to keep the tablet. I just feel safer with my 10\" netbook. But for a basic tablet for the kids or to take on the road I would have to recommend it.**********************************I should have waited to write this review. I said it did not work with Google Play (Store). Well, the next day I got it to work with the Google Play. Finding the necessary files took a little time but since the tablet was already \"rooted\" installing the files was simple. I have now used the D2 for 100 hours and have tried to beat it up. No freezes, no problems. I am not sure if the newer models come rooted but this one did and since I git Google Play to work I am raising my rating from 4 star to five.

It was amazing, while shopping for a low budget tablet and case, how many fake reviews we encountered.  I saw a you tube review on the D2 which is why I decided to give it a try.This tablet is definitely worth considering for the kids but whoever said it was better or even comparable to a Galaxy Tab obviously doesn't own a Galaxy Tab (or is a fake reviewer.  I do and I can assure you, there is no comparison.  But really, there shouldn't be based on the amount of money I spent on my GT compared to the D2.  The D2 runs most apps well, but slower.  The screen rotation can be very pokey, like minutes before it finally decides to rotate.  The wi-fi seems to work really well, unlike a Coby Kyros we had purchased and returned.  Playing games like Subway Surfers can be hit and miss.  Some days it's great and somedays it's a little glitchy.  We also needed this for a reader and though our reader, Mantano, is slower, it still works really well.  The camera is a bit of a joke and since there is no case for this specific brand, is covered up by the case we ended up with anyways.  It wasn't really necessary anyways as my kids have their own cameras anyways and the cameras on the lower priced tablets aren't usually comparable to what they have anyways.  The kids aren't complaining, it plays Fruit Ninja and Talking Tom great!  We don't play movies on our tabs but they preloaded preview of Jack played nicely.  They are just so thrilled to have their own tablet.  I, on the other hand, couldn't deal with the issues after being used to my GT.

Not this time.  I fully charged the D2 tablet and tried it out as soon as it was charged.  Everything seemed fine for about 1 hour and then I noticed it made a strange noise for an instant.  It continued to work fine so I thought nothing of it.  It got down to about 70% power so I turned it off for the night.  When I turned it on today it seemed fine and I installed a few apps.  Suddenly it started making a strange static/squealing sound.  The volume of this sound would not increase or decrease, even when the volume control was all the way down.  I tried listening to music and a movie using the headphone jack and that worked fine.  When the headphone was plugged in the sound from the speaker stopped.

When first opening the box my daughter and I took inventory of every thing that came with it, one thing we noticed very much was the build quality. The build quality was very impressive, even more impressive than my ASUS Transformer TF-101. So we where very pleased with it but as soon as we got to playing around on it is when problems started to show, for an adult this would be a horrible tablet. My daughter has a lot of problems downloading and playing games. Over half the games she has downloaded was not compatible and unfortunately unlike the Google Play Store the android app store on this does not check compatibility. Even just browsing the internet is a bit of a challenge when your suppose to be running a 1 GHz CPU with 512 MB of RAM and unfortunately that's not what you are getting, you actually a 800 MHz CPU and 256 MB of RAM. So with a actual lack of specs for very light game play it's nice but if you wanna do more than that I would suggest looking else where because your child will be complaining to you every 5 minutes on how it keeps freezing. Maybe if there was a android 4.1 update it might be more worth it to get but until then my daughter will keep playing the games she has on here till we get her a Google Nexus 7 or 10.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the price!", "Author": "S.

She always wanted my Iphone to watch music videos on youtube. We researched alot of different tabs before we bought this one, we wanted something quality but inexpensive. The 7 inches is the perfect size for her, it has with stood her \"abuse\" so far. The games for kids that comes loaded on it is almost worth the $80 alone. They have toddler/preschool games that teach shapes, colors, numbers, and more! And it will read the preloaded books out loud! Which I also think is pretty cool! We downloaded youtube through moble1. Like other reviewers have said--it is a bit slow-- Mainly the internet, which she doesnt use. The battery life has been great for us! I truely recommend this for a child! It is without a doubt worth the $80 to me.EDIT: After owning this right at a month, I sat it on the arm of the couch, it fell off and cracked the internal screen. I called to see about adding insurance. They were willing to add it for me even though it had been a couple days past the 30 days--but it only covers up to the price of the tab. So for an $80 tab, we decided against it. A few days later, my husband broke the screen further--this time you can feel it when you run your hand over it. Pretty sad my 2 year old wasnt the one that broke it either time. Also, I have found that you can download the barnyard games for free--so you can get that with any tab you buy! The power button became lose, still works--you just have to hit it a time or two before it turns it on/off. I still think this is a great tab for a young child, but maybe not as great as I thought when I initally wrote the review. If I knew my daughter was going to use it as much as she has, I would have bought a more expensive, quality tab to begin with.

This I was willing to live with, however the tablet cannot perform up to basic standards.  It frequently freezes, runs extremely slow and unexpectedly closes apps.
