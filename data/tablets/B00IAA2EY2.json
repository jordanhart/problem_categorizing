It does everything that I want it to do and more. It came with a \"manual\" that is about 3 x 3 inches and covers four pages(...). But that's all you need. You just turn it on and use it. It's that simple.The tablet is lightning fast and scrolls through thousands of pictures without hesitation. The battery charge lasts all day long, no matter what you do or look at.I still have a laptop at home. Once that one had it, this tablet will replace it. I doubt that you'll find a better tablet at any price!", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "First tablet a possible Dud :-(", "Author": "S. Ivie", "ReviewID": "R15UR2KUODAKW0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased on May 9, 2014, it arrived on May 12, 2014, today is Sunday, May 18, 2014.  So I've had the tablet in my possession for a whopping 6 days.  I followed the instructions an charged it for a full 8 hours when I got it.... and happily set about finding games and apps.  Last night I plugged it in to charge at about midnight and at 7:30 this morning it had only charged half way.  I waited a couple more hours and it finally said it was fully charged.  Went to power it on and WTF?  it said to plug in the charger and that the battery only had 10%.  GRRR.Apparently charging issues are common with all tablets.  Some have had success by resetting to factory settings (which I will try) Others have sent theirs in on warranty only to find they have to wait 30-90days.  I'm going to try the reset, if that doesn't work... back this goes.Prior to this issue I was pretty happy.  It's pretty responsive and the screen is ok and it did most what I wanted it to do. (Hey Amazon...why in the HELL would you limit your Prime customers to your Kindle devices for streaming video?... idiots!)*** EDIT ***Ok.  So...  I think I fixed the problem at least temporarily.  here is what I did.**At this point I want to let you know that I feel your pain.1.  Go to settings>> Backup and reset>>Back up your apps/photos/software to an SD CARD. (not  required but recommended so you don't loose your stuff.2. Charge with usb cable to your Computer.  If you see progress like it going from 10% to 18% after an hour or so... YAY!!  Leave it go until you are over 20-35%3. With it still plugged in.  Go to Settings>>Backup and Reset>>press factory data reset.  It will warn you that every bit of YOUR data will be deleted... proceed.4. Now.. at this point I turned off ASUS' UI. (leave it plugged into your pc) Go to settings>>Asus Customized Settings>>UNCHECK Use Asus Quick Setting. Restart the tablet.At this point the 35% miraculously became 49% for me.:-| what the?5.  I plugged it into the USB/AC \"wall wart\" charger and Android told me it was charging.  I came back about 30-45 mins later and it was up to 70%  It finished charging pretty quickly.So what does this tell us?  Asus has a glitch in their software/user interface overlay that they need to fix.. or put out a software fix.****EDIT after fix day 2****Ok so last night I drew the battery down to about 15%... plugged it in and hoped for the best.  This morning I turned the tablet on... Fully charged!  wooo hoo!  This further makes me believe that there definitely is a glitch in the UI software Asus puts on them.BTW... I am not an android expert.  Have only owned android devices since April when I got a prepaid tracfone with android. I would call myself an advanced computer user with some programming experience.  This \"glitch\" is inexcusable.  I will continue to update until I feel I've informed as much as I can on these... I still like this tablet but what a bummer it had such problems right off like that.***Edit June 03, 2014***It's been a couple weeks since I did the fix and without the Asus UI overlay, the tablet works fine, charges fine and I've been having no issues what-so-ever.Note:  It is interesting that Asus' personnel is monitoring Amazon for bad reviews and offering suggestions.  The problem is that the \"fix\" instructions were completely incorrect for this tablet.  He kept telling me to go to do the following.\"To do a hardware reset, please follow the procedure.Tap Settings > Privacy > Factory data reset. Doing so will erase all your data on your Eee Pad. Ensure to backup yourimportant data before resetting your Eee Pad. If the problem persists, please try to a hardware reset by doing the following:-Hold down the power button until the system completely shutdown-Remove any SD card in the tablet if one is inserted-Press and hold down \" Volume Down\" button then press and hold down the \" Power\" button until screen below appears-Do not press any button until the screen below appears:There's a line, press \"Volume Down\" to execute or \"Volume Down\" to cancel wiping data.-Press \"Volume Up\" to wipe data, unit will automatically reboot after wipe data process completed, system should be able to boot up or enter system successfully.\"It should be noted that NO photos he referred to came through and he could not provide me with a link to the photo.  But regardless... in my Memo, there was no such \"settings>>privacy>>Factory reset\" he kept referring to... so clearly the online support on this is misinformed and or poorly trained. I also tried the \"hold down the volume down and power buttons and never saw the screens, to which he was referring.Anyway, this will be my last update.  I hope my solutions help some of you.  The tablet is NOT a bad tablet but this glitch could be problematic for those let technically inclined.  Make an informed decision.
