{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible Tablet for the price", "Author": "Jerry Wright \"Mr. Bewildered\"", "ReviewID": "R1T32LO2N8377M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to buy this tablet for an even better price than that listed here, but frankly, for a $100 (or so) tablet, this one exceeded my expectations.  Everything just works.  Every other tablet I've purchased (earlier Eken, Pandigital White) have required me to hack the OS to get a reasonable tablet experience.  This tablet surpasses them all by a mile.  Video quality is excellent and movies in both AVI and MP4 format play smoothly with no perceptable stumbles or jerks.  The only caveat is the onboard Mono speaker which is rather quiet, and is exceeded by the Pandigital.  But external speakers or earbuds fix THAT problem.It is chargeable through either the 5 volt power port, or through the mini-usb port which is just bog-standard.  I purchased a usb keyboard and cover for about $12 from eBay, and it just works.  I'm extremely pleased with this tablet.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007ZLX1Y4"}}
