{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Thoughts (Typed Using The Kindle Fire HD 8.9)", "Author": "Rick Mallory Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2VX6G023G4D9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying that I am new to the tablet world and have had no experience using any tablets prior to this purchase. That being said, I spent a great deal of time fishing around through reviews and specs of what seemed like countless tablets for months. The obvious cliche conclusion led to all fingers pointing at some variation of an iPad, yet for me, I do not see much sense in purchasing a tablet (regardless of brand) for around the same price as a cheap yet descent laptop that will have more potential.Enter the Kindle Fire HD.I will spare you the story on my process of how I ended up choosing a Fire HD and get right to what you all want to know: my thoughts and experience thus far with the product.Picture: (10/10)I will start with this since obviously that was the first thing i noticed. In a word, incredible. Now its not \"eye popping\" or anything out of this world, but i can honestly say it exceeded my expectations and i was (and continue to be) impressed by this piece of hardware's capabilities. I tested out just a few minutes of  TV shows, trailers, videos, and films from Prime Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Flixster, and Youtube (through the web browser since an app is currently unavailable) and everything looks as it should (and beautiful to boot)! Books come out crisp as well (both in text and picture) and the same goes for basic website visuals, apps, and games. Overall I am very impressed.Sound: (10/10)This is probably where i was most impressed. I have seen some of the reviews on here that are 3 stars or less putting down the audio or claiming they don't hear the big deal. Not to be a jerk or anything but i recommend those people check in at an ear clinic and have their hearing tested. I was literally amazed at how I was hearing sounds from various distances and angles. From up close it felt like i was hearing a high quality home theater system and not just for one flick but everything. From website audio to music, Netflix to Audiobooks, this tablet sounds great!Book/Reading Features: (10/10)At first this was not my primary reason for purchasing a Fire HD, but after toying around with a few things, I am truly impressed at how well Amazon has integrated the ability to find, purchase, read, and even listen to literature. The lending library for Prime users is a nice added touch allowing you to borrow from a rather extensive list of books. Not to mention many timeless classics are available for free (such as Dracula, Gulliver's Travels, Little Women, The Iliad, The Jungle Book and many more) and of those titles, many come with free audio! If you do not feel like spending the money on audio (or if your book has none available) the text-to-speech feature is surprisingly well done with minimal error. With all this being said, I can honestly say that I am excited to start reading again.Web Browsing: (8/10)The only reason I do not give this a 10 is because web browsing (with what is given out of the box) lacks Flash support which limits the capabilities. However, with a bit of research I was able to find forum discussions on how Fire HD users were able to work around this by downloading an app called ES File Explorer and then a separate browser called Dolphin that gives you Flash capabilities, so this is an easy fix that even a monkey could figure out how to do as long as they are patient. Though don't get me wrong, Silk is fast and beautiful and i use it for the majority of my web surfing, but occasionally Flash is needed. As I am sure you have read by now in other reviews, the fact that the Fire HD does not automatically come with Flash support is not Amazon's fault yet rather Adobe for pulling he plug on their involvement with tablets. Again, as long as your network is put together well, browsing the web is very fast and up to par with dare I say some computers.App Availability: (8/10)To me, this is the only area where the Fire HD lacks. I would rate lower here but I am trusting that over time and after updates, the lineup will have grown. Once more, with a bit of research you can find discussions on how to \"sideload\" apps from your computer and other devices, but that could be a bit too advanced for the average user. Though for what it is worth, the selection it does currently come with is top notch. Just to name a few, some important missing apps include: YouTube, Dropbox, and SiriusXM. Still, as far as I am concerned, this certainly is not a deal breaker and I am sure that as things progress access to these will become available.Look/Feel: (10/10)The 8.9\" model that I own and am currently reviewing was a lot lighter than I expected and it is true what they say ( it is just right to fit in one hand). Out of the box/pre-case the Fire HD looks great and is very thin, sleek, and dare I say...sexy? The only minor gripe I would have (that I noticed other reviewers mentioned) is the volume and power buttons are sometimes hard to find and do not always register, but after a while you get use to it. Aside from that, I love how it appears and functions.Overall: (56/60)There are a few things that by now you may know, such as how out of the box the Fire HD does not come with a wall charger. I know that is a bummer but if you don't already have one roaming around your house from a smartphone or if you cannot tolerate simply charging from your computer, Amazon sells them at a fairly reasonable price.Bottom line? I have purchased over 500 items on Amazon and I rarely feel the need to review a product, but I genuinely felt my voice needed to be heard ( or read rather) with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I strongly recommend purchasing this product and if you have any questions, feel free to comment and hopefully either me or someone else can assist you!P.S. This took me forever to type on the Fire HD but it was good practice and hopefully worth it!I would highly recommend a screen protector and a case", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value and Great Gadget", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R1664MHMUTYIOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally published in November 2012, Updated January 19, 2013 after using this Fire for several months...As there appears to be mixed reviews of the 8.9' Fires - ones with 4G access and those without - to clarify, this review is for the 8.9\" tablet with the 4G connectivity option.To get the iPad comparison out of the way, I put this tablet side-by-side to my iPad 2 I use for work.  Downloads were slightly faster and the video screen resolution and the colors were more vibrant on the Fire vs. the iPad 2.Screen Display / Video Playback:With the larger HD screen, if playing video is important to you this is the version of the Fire to get as the screen display is fairly impressive with sharp and crisp colors. The display on this HD Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model and even this year's smaller HD model.Amazon also added a cool feature on this one with the HDMI micro connection port. I have an HDMI micro plug and was able to hook this up to the big screen to watch an episode of the science fiction series Defying Gravity.  It played back great smoothly with no problems.Wi-Fi connectivity:My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this 8.9\" version of the Fire sitting next to the \"smaller\" HD version of the Fire, my Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the new 7\" Fire all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity..My website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices and were still slow but faster than the other devices (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was slightly faster but for a casual surfer it is not noticeable nor does it hang.Email Setup:Email setup was very easy with the included email app for my main Google account - it took about a minute to input my email address and password information and I was good to go: sending and receiving emails was a snap, and when I sent a test message with pictures they displayed crisply.  I will tell you I primarily us an existing app called Enhanced Email that I received here on the Amazon app store for free vs. what came as standard with the Fire for daily use, and it was easy to use - actually better due to the larger screen size - with this version of the Fire. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!Game Play:I do play a lot of games, but they aren't the heavy action / interactive games many of the kids play today.  For my test, I tried out several rounds of Words with Friends and a Majong derivative.  The display was crisp and the tablet was very responsive as it interacted over the WiFi network of my home to the game server.Sound / Music PlaybackDifferent than last year's model and the $159 this year's model, the two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I wanted to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. However, the sound is not very crisp (the $159 Fire sounds better to me) as the sound is going away from you with the speakers being in the back.  With a cover on the Fire to protect it, that can be a problem.  It's going to take a little bit of getting used to having the volume controls at the top of the device.Reading Books:Reading a book was enjoyable and easy on the eyes with the larger screen: I appreciate being able to changing the default font to something else in addition to increasing the font size so I don't have to wear my glasses.  Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.Bluetooth:Bluetooth setup was very easy. I tested this with audio in my car as well as an external keyboard.  From a music standpoint, there were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about 30 seconds; I hooked up a Motorola Bluetooth keyboard and started banging away with several emails.  Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Cellular Connectivity (This Section Updated 1/19/2013):The 4G connection is a lot like how I have heard one of my friends describe his relationship with a girlfriend: when things are good, they are real good and when they are bad, they absolutely suck.The same can be true for the 4G connection - it can be real fast when it wants to be fast, and you can be dead in the water in the strangest places.  For example, I can be out in the middle of the country and see a cell tower on the highway / frontage road, and the cell service is screaming fast and very convenient.  On the other hand, I can be in downtown Houston, the display says I have full cellular strength, and it just won't work - no Internet, no email, no anything.In other words, I have a love-hate relationship with it.Concerning the introductory data plan - the one where you pay a one-time fee of $50 for 250 megabytes of data per month for 12 months, I have mixed emotions about it, also.  I am not a heavy user of email or web surfing, I dislike video chat, and I don't download big files all of the time, so I initially thought the 250 meg per month limit would more than suit my needs.I was wrong.Why was I wrong?  It's all of the apps loaded on your Fire that auto-magically turn themselves on that constantly check the Internet for updates, apps like Accuweather and The Weather Channel, a few news apps, and Words With Friends.  The Weather Channel app had to be the worst: despite manually shutting it down, it would miraculously come back on and download maps, constantly check for updates and refresh said maps so frequently it chewed right through the month's allotment in a day and a half.No kidding.  And it's not a very good app, either, in comparison to Acccuweather so I deleted it.Bottom line is you need to watch the data throughput carefully, or you will go over.  I upgraded to the 3 gig per month plan, which is the same plan I have with my work iPad and seems to be enough.  That's $30 per month, so I wasted the $49.99 on the 250 meg per month plan (AT&T; wouldn't give me a refund even though I upgraded).Affordability vs. an iPadDollarwise, this version of the Fire whips the iPad when you stack up the annual cost of connectivity, 64Gb of memory, and the cellular (or not) models of the iPad.  The iPad's screen is slightly larger, but when I put it up against each other for the same things (web page, game app) I really couldn't tell that much of a difference.Overall, if you are looking for a larger tablet this one wins hands down.  With the full-features included with this model - especially the 4G connection - I believe this will be my go-to device, and I will no longer be carrying my e-Ink Kindle in addition to my iPad every day.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the Greatest Tablet, but a Good One", "Author": "D. Carlson", "ReviewID": "R3IX0K0RPO803C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wasn't really in the market for another tablet, but my girlfriend ended up getting one for me so she got me on this one. I would like to say that this tablet reminds me of the first Motorola Droid smartphone that came out several years back. The phone jam packed a ton of bells & whistles into its hardware and software to give a lot of bang for your buck. This is what it feels like amazon has done with the Kindle Fire 8.9. They have put a lot of advanced hardware and innovative software, so for the average user, specially someone who absorbs a lot of media, you get a lot for the price. But just because you get a lot for the price, doesn't mean it is without its flaws. This is an updated version of my likes and dislikes, (my original analysis was a bit rushed, this is more detailed):LIKESBuild QualityI like the build of this product, it has good material design and durability. It feels nice in your hands and comfortable to hold with easy access to buttons. Since this is only 8.9\" and not 10 or 11 inches, it is easier to grasp and hold in one hand with an overall good aesthetic look and feel to it.SpeakersI have to say, the more I listen to it, the more I like the sound. The speakers are definitely a step up from the norm and probably one of its best features. They produce a full, rich, and very vibrant sound you can experience music and movies the way they were meant to be experienced. It is not a home theatre experience, but as close as one can get with a small device like this.ScreenThe display is very nice. I'm not sure if it compares with the clarity of Super Amoled or Retina screens, but it comes close. High screen resolution is not special to the Kindle, lots of tablets now have high resolution screens, some higher. What this screen has that other tablets don't is the anti-glare, which works well under sunlight and highly lit places, it's not something that seems advantageous until you work with a screen that doesn't have this.InternetKindle's Wi-fi and Silk Browser make internet browsing fast. I did a comparison with a Samsung and Apple tablet, and noticed that the surfing was faster, it wasn't a huge difference but it was noticeable. Streaming audio and video had a bigger and more noticeable difference, with the Kindle being very smooth, with fewer lags and dropped connections. This is key for me, I hate streaming content with pauses and breaks in loading, there is less of that in the Fire.Reading ExperienceIn my opinion, this is Fire HD's best feature, delivering a better reading experience than any tablet right now. This is no surprise as books are Amazon's claim to fame and where they excel and have always excelled. I don't know if you remember, but before Amazon was Amazon, they were the first online retailer for books. Before there was an iPad, there was the kindle. They have always been at the forefront of the book buying and reading experience, now especially digital books. I think I remember reading that the Kindle was the main reason Borders Bookstore went out of business, Borders said they just couldn't keep up with or match Amazon's delivery system.Now with this Fire HD, they offer even more advancements. With its X-ray for books, its 'reading view' that takes away messy images on a site leaving only text, `immersive' reading that lets you play an audio book while reading, whispersync technology, and better optimization of text, other devices can't match. Granted it doesn't compare to digital ink like on the original Kindle for me did the best to mimic actual reading, but as far as tablets goes its better than what is out there. If you are getting a tablet primarily for reading, this is gonna be a good choice.Amazon UniverseI have a love hate relationship with Amazon's Universe of services. I don't like how even though the Kindle HD uses Android, it is somewhat restricted. Also, they don't have as many apps as google or apple. But taking everything else into account, movies, books, music, prime lending library, prime movies, amazon is better. The big drawback is you have to own a kindle to fully enjoy their universe, which means if you own a kindle, you are limited from using other company's universe.Apps and other featuresAll the apps work fine, they start and stop as they should, nothing to criticize or brag about. The touch screen is smooth and responds good, though nothing like iPad...hate to say it but iPad thumps everyone on that, their touch and scrolling is very fluid and just feels right. I don't have kids so I can't really comment on the parental controls but from other reviews seems like something to have if you have kids. Can access email and everything fine.DISLIKESWhen it comes to bringing together the right mix of original and developing technology in a tablet, like the first Droid phone, Amazon did an admirable job. It merged a mix that most of us will enjoy and find useful. Although Amazon has put original elements that make this tablet worthy to compete in the tablet world, at the same time, they've done some things that make you question what they're doing.AdsThis is the most disliked innovation to hit electronics since the Windows phone (and I don't mean the Windows 7 phone, I mean its predecessor, which was so disastrous nobody heard about its release and was pulled from shelves within two weeks). Microsoft was smart enough to pull its mistake, Amazon seems to continue to run with theirs.No ChargerAs you have read in other reviews, this product does not come with a standard charger. I don't like that other reviewers excuse this by claiming it makes the product cheaper. Chargers are not expensive to produce so I don't think it makes the product cheaper, it gives Amazon more opportunity to recover the Kindle cost by charging $20+ dollars for an accessory that probably only costs a few dollars to make. Not sure how accurate this is, it's my own decision I've reached as it doesn't make sense not to include a standard charger adapter because for most people including myself, this is not a pc companion, rather a pc replacement. Without a real charger, it becomes a companion. Yes, you can buy one, but why make us do that.CameraThe Kindle Fire 8.9 only has a front facing camera. It is useful for video chatting, but not for taking pictures. If I want to take a picture of something outside myself, I have to point the screen in that direction, which means I can't see what I am taking a picture of or have easy access to the camera buttons, doesn't make sense.This is some of the qualms I have, nothing revolting.All in all, do I like this Kindle HD? Yes. Will I keep it? Probably. Do I think it is the greatest tablet in the world? In some respects, yes, in others no. Should you buy it? The answer is this is not an all-in-one, do everything machine that the likes of iPad claim to be. With this it seems like amazon focused on some key things, like watching movies, listening to music, surfing the internet, and reading books. The things they concentrated on, they made sure to go full force to give users the best experience they could. They are things that most of us average users are going to use a tablet for...email, streaming, social media, video, music, for what amazon focused on with this product like I said they did admirably.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Value Given All the Features & Options", "Author": "Dean Pritchett", "ReviewID": "R3AX3V9UT4B1ZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife purchased the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for me and have to say it is definitely one of the more nifty devices, with lots of cool features and options. Before I talk about them, I'd like to say that I enjoy tech gadgets and I usually get my hands on the latest and greatest ones. Although, I don't buy everything that comes out, I do play around and keep myself up-to-date with what is out there. Also, I don't hook myself into a particular manufacturer. If a product is good, I will purchase, use, and tell people about it. If something better comes out, then I move on. This review will cover the Kindle HD as well as my experiences with other devices.DisplayThis tablet has a very nice and fresh looking display. The images are super sharp and everything looks crystal clear. It is easy to view on off angles, which is useful when me and my friends are viewing the screen at the same time or for using the device in presentations and meetings. The anti-glare feature is a nice touch, I can view it in direct sunlight without a huge loss in clarity. Granted, it's not as great as in dim light or shade, but it does the job.AudioThe audio was a huge selling point for me. Most speakers on laptop, netbook, and other portable devices like tablets and smartphones produce poor quality sound. You always have to plug in external headphones to really enjoy music and movies. That issue doesn't exist with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" These speakers get loud, and with Dolby technology, produce an enjoyable experience. Again, this can come handy when you are listening/viewing the device with multiple people.Wifi/4GI really like the Kindle Fire HD's dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. It not only does a better job of streaming HD content, but it allows you to connect to more types of signals. WiFi routers vary, some are old and outdated, while others are newer and function better working on different bandwidths and frequencies. Kindle can connect to all the different varieties. This is very handy if you travel a lot like me and need the ability to connect to whichever random connections you can find in the moment.BluetoothNice, handy feature, I don't know why more devices don't have them. I can connect to my Bluetooth wireless headphones and walk around the house without being tied to the device. Also, I can have the Kindle connected to my other Bluetooth devices without having to be next to them. Not a deal breaker, but a nice feature.Silk BrowserSilk is a neat innovation in internet surfing. It predicts what links on a site you will navigate to, and downloads those pages b/f you click on the link. This increases the load speed of webpages. The concept is interesting, and it proves useful when you've lost internet connection, because if the pages were downloaded prior to you losing the connection, you can still navigate to them.AdsThis is the part of the Kindle HD I dislike; the whole ad concept is unwise. Not only does it come off unprofessional, it adds an unnecessary decision/step in the purchase process.  The price difference is not much, so Amazon should either price the device higher or just chalk up the cost. As a buyer, if ads are an issue, since your spending $300 - $500 on a device anyway, spend a little more so you don't have to deal with it...unless of course you like to be kept up-to-date with ads.Outside of the ads, this is a fantastic media machine. With the display, speakers, dual core processor, and graphics card, it is the good for gaming, music, movies, and video. Add to it the Silk browser and the dual band, dual antenna Wi-Fi, it also becomes good for internet browsing, allowing for better streaming of those games, music, movies, and video.Vs iPad 3The main advantages iPad has over Kindle HD 8.9\" are that iPad's Retina display gives its screen a higher resolution, but not by much. iPad 3 has both a front and rear camera, while the Kindle HD has only the front facing camera. Amazon says the front facing camera is HD, but I'm not sure what that means. The iPad has GPS which the Kindle HD lacks. The clear advantage for Apple is the number of apps. Apple phones and tablets have the most apps of any competitor.On the other hand, the Kindle HD 8.9 is a bit thinner, lighter, and smaller than the Apple counter part. iPad has only a single mono speaker, while as mentioned, Kindle has the Dolby stereo speakers. Kindle's screen is a 16x9 aspect ratio (like Movie and HDTV screens), while the iPad is 4x3. What this means is that movies will display larger on the Kindle, using the entire screen whereas iPad will display smaller, leaving bars along the top and bottom.For most people, the key distinction between iPad 3 and Kindle HD 8.9\" is the price. The Kindle HD is considerably cheaper, with the WiFi model costing $200 less than iPad 3's comparable model, and the 4G LTE costing as much as $230 less than iPad 3's 4G LTE (even the iPad 2 and iPad mini are more expensive than the new Kindle). Take into consideration the data plan, and you are saving another $150 in the first year with Kindle HD.Another disadvantage of the iPad is that you get the deliciously awkward pleasure of joining a cult that brainwashes you into thinking buying Apple makes you different, better, while offering an advanced product; when in reality they are like the million other Apple users, spending twice as much for a device that is rarely up to speed with current technology.Falling behind in technology is one of the main reasons I've strayed from Apple over the few years. The original iPod and iPhone were true innovations. You might even say the iPad was an innovation, even though it was simply an oversized iPhone, even using the same operating system. To make their products work smooth, Apple's uses highly specialized components in their products. This makes it difficult for their products to evolve as quickly. The initial iPhone was one of the last phones to make the switch to 3G. And even though 4G has existed for nearly 2 years, iPhone made the jump only a few months ago. Apple's prized Siri is just an enhanced version of Google's voice activated search, which came out 2 years prior to Siri. Now Apple is playing catch up with the iPad mini and Amazons already on its second generation 7\" tablet.Vs Google Nexus 10Before starting this comparison, I would like to point out a couple things. One, evaluating the Kindle Fire against the Nexus is more an apple's to apples comparison as they are both use the Android operating system. The Nexus is a 10\" tablet (hence the name), while this review is for the 8.9\" Kindle HD. Both companies have a 7\" counterpart with the Kindle HD 7\" and Nexus 7, though the comparison here is strictly between Kindle HD 8.9\" and Nexus 10.It is also important to note that Google is the main reason anyone is able to compete with Apple phones and tablets right now. They are the creators of the Android operating system that are used in majority of non-apple devices. Tablets like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Samsung's Galaxy Tab really owe it to Google's open source Android operating system for their ability to participate in the tablet market.Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's begin the comparison. Both Kindle HD 8.9\" and Nexus 10 run version 4 of Android. However, Nexus runs the updated 4.2 Jellybean, while Kindle Fire HD runs the 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (the names are silly, but they are memorable). It is important to note, the version in Amazon's tablet is heavily customized. The customization has its advantage and disadvantages. The advantage is Amazon can offer things such as parental controls that can limit what your kids can do and for how long. The disadvantage is there are restrictions on certain features like Google's Play store.As mentioned, Kindle HD is 8.9\", the Nexus is bigger coming in at 10.\" Both have a front-facing camera but only the Nexus 10 has a rear one, which is 5 megapixels. Both have HD displays with Gorilla Glass and micro USB & HDMI connectors for HD video output. Google's display is higher resolution (even higher than iPad's retina), while Amazon's display has the polarizing filter and anti-glare technology. Both Fire and Nexus offer stereo speakers, but only Amazon offers Dolby sound.As far as hardware, both boast a dual core processor, though Nexus is a little faster at 1.7Ghz against Fire HD's 1.5 Ghz. On the other hand, Fire HD has more storage capacity starting at 32GB and going up to 64GB, whereas the Nexus starts at 16GB and goes up to only 32 GB. Kindle HD 8.9 comes in both a Wi-Fi and 4G LTE version, Nexus 10 comes in only a Wi-Fi version. Kindle has the dual antenna and dual frequency Wi-Fi, I believe the Nexus comes in only dual frequency, not dual antenna.The Nexus 10 excels in that it has the NFC chip for device-to-device communication, GPS, and it is fully integrated out of the box with Google services like Maps, Drive, and Gmail. As mentioned, Amazon's modified Android places restrictions on some of these services. Also, since Google makes Android, it is highly likely that updates to the Android operating system will likely be released to Nexus devices before Kindle Fire devices.As it relates to price, like with iPad 3, Kindle Fire HD has the clear advantage. The Nexus starts at $399 while the Amazon 8.9\" starts at $299. The next model up for Nexus is the 32 GB version which costs $499. At that price, you can get the Kindle not only at 32GB, but with 4G LTE. As far as price, Kindle has everyone beat.ConclusionThese are the major players in the world of tablets today. There are other manufactures like Samsung and Acer, however, they don't offer an extensive ecosystem of apps, media, and services like Google, Apple, and Amazon. Also, as stated earlier, most tablets use Android's operating system, so aside from hardware size and features, they are going to offer an experience similar to the Nexus.The question that beckons is which one to buy? If you really like one company's ecosystem of services, the answer becomes less difficult - get that company's device. That is, if you like Amazon's Whispersync technology, Silk browser, Xray for books and are a Prime junkie, then go with Kindle Fire HD. If you are a fan of Google Play and their services, consider the Nexus. If you are diehard Apple, well, I don't have to say what your going to go with...though if you go with Apple, do it and be quiet. Don't be like the masses of Apple customers who feel the need to run around advertising to the world about how they own Apple. Ranting and raving doesn't make you cool, it just shows how childish and insecure your need for validation is. Although, you might think you are cool, we all laugh and talk behind your back.On the flipside, if you are not overly committed to any company's services and are looking for a good overall tablet for a good price, then the clear winner is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". Given the hardware specs, its focus on media, internet, and reading, and the price point, it is hands down the best value. In my opinion it is the most advanced, feature rich device for the price.I love technology and enjoy following its progression, I've really enjoyed sharing my thoughts about this so I hope you've found it helpful.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "We like it better than our iPad (please don't hate me)", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "RO3LEA2I4EWCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We originally bought this for our daughter to use so my wife can get her iPad back.Let's start with the comparison...Size (and weight) matter - This larger version of the Kindle Fire is smaller, thinner, and a quarter pound lighter than the iPad 3.  Of course that means the screen is a bit smaller too, less than 1\".  However, the Kindle screen is breathtakingly clear and the weight difference, while it sounds small when you type it into a review or read it as you are now, is really noticeable after just a few minutes of holding the device with one hand while using it.Price - Another tiny difference is that the Fire is a couple hundred dollars less than a similarly configured iPad.About the Ads supported version - We never notice them.  They are only on the lock screen.Display - We like the Kindle display better than the iPad.  There, I've said it and hope I won't have to go into hiding.  It is clear and bright without making everything look like a comic book and shows up well in sunlight without having to turn the display way up (which means the battery won't drain quickly).Usability - I'm liking the Kindle interface more and more, compared to the iPad or \"Native\" android tablets.  The Kindle prominently displays apps used most recently and the ones I just installed in a side scrolling \"Carousel\".  Other apps are just a few taps away.  That's great for me and greater still for my young daughter (see FreeTime, below) since there's no hunting for the things I'm likely to want the most. The iPhone and other Androids I've seen do it the other way around.First use - First use was very straightforward.  I liked that it knew my name without me having to tell it.  First thing it did, after greeting me (by name) was ask for my WiFi password.  After that it took a few minutes to download updates.  When I clicked on the \"Apps\" menu it already had listed every Android app I bought from Amazon.  Same goes for videos, music, and books.  I realize iPad does something similar.  However, having used both, I feel the Kindle is easier.On the business side I can access my email accounts, including those in an Exchange server, with no problems.  Attachments, including .PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets can all be read with no problems.Back to the fun stuff, YouTube, Netflix, and SmugMug videos stream flawlessly.  Pandora provides music without a hitch.  It connects to Bluetooth devices quickly and easily.The Camera - The front facing camera, designed for video conferencing, provides a clear image while the screen provides a vivid image of the person at the other end.  We ran some side-by-side tests with our iPad 3 and the Fire always performed better.  There is no rear-facing camera for taking snapshots and I figure that's what my iPhone is for.FreeTime - We love it!!! This allows us to limit the app's and sites accessible to our daughter.  For us it's as much to keep her from getting into confusing places that interrupt her activities and keeping her from things we don't want her to see.  This is so much nicer than handing her my iPad or Samsung tablet and dealing with the frequent frustrations from her stumbling into an application she doesn't understand.  OK, these are not so much child friendly as parent friendly but everybody wins in the end.The Missing Charger - One difference that could be important to some is that the Kindle doesn't come with a charger.  It does include a cable that you can use with any USB charger or computer you may have on hand.  However, if you don't have one of those then you will want to order a charger along with this.Remember at the start of this I said we originally bought the Fire so my wife can get her iPad back?  After using the Fire my wife prefers it and leaves the iPad to our daughter.  The only problem is I need to buy a second Kindle Fire because now I want one too.FIRST THING TO BUY after you get your Kindle: Best 100 Kindle Fire HD Apps (Updated With Top Apps for the Kindle Fire HD!).  It's a bargain at $0.99 (Free to borrow if you're a Prime member).  You can zip through, read descriptions for the mostly free app's, click on the ones that interest you, and have them installed right away.A NICE CASE:  A little while ago I got an Innovic Multi Functional Handmade Leather Zip Bag for iPad 2 and 3 16gb, 32gb, 64gb edition.  Turns out even though it's made for an iPad it fits the 8.9\" Fire HD pretty well.  (I've added a video showing how well it works with this Kindle along with my review for that case)  It may not be a perfect solution but given the limited options for cases right now, especially for the price (originally $11, it has as of this writing almost doubled since I originally added this to my review and is still a good value), it isn't a bad temporary choice.  (I had a chance to try the Marware Revolve Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Black and will be sticking with this one.)", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Fire HD 8.9 essentials - the Ys, the FAQ and some comments", "Author": "A.

I am not a pro videographer and couldn't find a way to better focus on the screen and cancel out the screen reflections.Second, this is NOT a video review. It only illustrates the answer to one and only one important question: how do you get around the seemingly impossible to turn off 1-Click? This is how you do it:1 - Whether you are a parent or not, you must have parental controls turned on.2 - From the top settings menu select 'More...'3 - Select 'Parental Controls'4 - Change 'Password Protect Purchases' from the default 'OFF' to 'ON'The video illustrates the above, then shows how attempting to buy a book prompts for a password rather than immediately beginning to download it, which is what happens if you didn't do 1-2-3-4.____________________________________________________________BACKGROUNDWe own the original 7\" Fire and the 7\" Fire HD which is our daughter's favorite tablet now. In addition - we are a relatively large, gadget-using family - we own a Nexus 7, a XOOM, a Galaxy Tab and a couple of lesser known Android tablets. We used to own a first generation iPad and I have access and have used the latest 10\" iPad but only spent a few minutes with the 'mini'.These being said, I will break my review into 2 main sections, followed by some conclusions. I'll have a section on the Y's (as in why the Fire HD 8.9 and not...) which may be slightly subjective and a FAQ which should focus on the Fire HD 8.9 and I will try to make it as unbiased as possible and then I will insert my own personal comments and views concerning the product. I will not going to list all the features: pixel density, expected battery life or CPU speed, etc. because the exact specs are all listed and can be found at the product's page.____________________________________________________________THE FAQ - I am trying to be objective here but the last 2 answers reflect my own viewsQ: In what ways is the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 different from the Kindle Fire HD 7?A: Larger screen, slightly better speakers, heavier, costs more, can be purchased with a 4G option.Q: Does it come with a charger?A: No. A charger must be purchased separately. There is an Amazon branded charger but many generic chargers will do.Q: Besides the charger, what other essential accessories should I consider?A: You may want to shop for a case/sleeve/portfolio, a stylus, possibly a glare-reducing screen overlay and a screen cleaning kit.Q: What should be the first things I may want to do as far as setup is concerned.A: You may want to disable/password protect in-app purchases, set you favorite search engine if you'd like something other than Bing, set parental controls if you have children, password-protecting any content purchase and deciding which type of content they are allowed to access.Q: What can I set through FreeTime, as opposed to the 'regular' parental controls?A: You can set profiles for more than one child, set limits on the amount of time they can use the Kindle each day, specific time limits for specific activities (reading, gaming, watching videos) and you can add specific books, Videos, Apps that the child can access.Q: Is all the content I purchased through my Kindle Fire 7 or my Kindle reader, including Paperwhite accessible from the Fire HD 8.9?A: Yes and No. Any purchases from Amazon's Appstore, including books, movies, games can be accessed from any Kindle tablet and on any non-Amazon Android tablet that run the Amazon apps (Appstore, Kindle, etc.) if they are compatible with your device. Incompatible apps that were purchased, let's say, for the original KF 7 or the KF HD 7 will become available for the KFHD 8.9 if and when the publisher upgrades them to run on it.Q: How much storage is available on the 16GB model?A: 12.8GBQ: Can you make a compelling case for purchasing the 32GB model?A: Yes, IF you have a lot of non-Amazon-purchased content (music, photos, videos) that you do not wish to store on Amazon's cloud.Q: Is storage on Amazon's cloud unlimited and free?A: Yes for Amazon-purchased only. No for everything else.Q: Can I install 'third party' apps, not purchased from Amazon's Appstore?A: Yes. Under 'Device' set 'Allow Installation of Applications from unknown sources' to 'On'Q: Can I change my browser's search engine to anything other than Bing?A: Yes, you can do it from within browser's settings.Q: Is there a way to prevent 1-Click from ordering items as soon as I touch them?A: Yes. See the (poorly made) video and the note at the top.Q: Name the most compelling reasons for buying a Kindle HD.A: Easy access to all Amazon-purchased content, unique and very effective parental controls, great sound quality off built-in speakers, good value for the price.Q: Name the most annoying features that may drive you away from buying a Kindle HD.A: Sold without a charger, hard to get to buttons, fenced in inside Amazon's own 'ecosystem'.____________________________________________________________THE YsWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over a Fire HD 7 (+) or why should I prefer the Fire HD 7 over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Larger screen+ Slightly faster processor- Lower price- Lighter, more portableWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over an iPad (+) or why should I prefer the iPad over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Significantly lower price+ Excellent parental controls+ Easy access to all Amazon's content+ Amazon's cloud with free storage for all Amazon purchases+ Not fenced inside Apple's ecosystem- Larger screen- Access to Apple's store- Rear-facing camera- Siri- Not fenced inside Amazon's ecosystem- iPads come either black or whiteWhy should I pick a Fire HD 8.9 over a Nexus 10 (+) or why should I prefer the Nexus 10 over the Fire HD 8.9 (-)?+ Excellent parental controls+ Ability to play Amazon Prime movies (don't believe can get it on the Nexus)+ Amazon's cloud with free storage for all Amazon purchases- Comes with a charger- Runs Chrome, Gmail natively and all other Google Apps- Google Play, does not block access to Amazon's Appstore or Amazon apps such as Kindle- Google Now- Pure Android, sure to be upgraded as Android evolves- GPS, Near Field Communication (NFC)____________________________________________________________CONCLUSIONS, RATINGWe have our Fire HD 8.9 now and it's a good quality tablet, right at the top when it comes to quality, design, user interface (very top there) and to a good extent, features. If I was about to buy a new Kindle Fire right now I would probably go for a Fire HD 7. The HD 8.9's larger screen size is the only clearly distinguishing difference between the two so, if screen size matters, get the HD 8.9 but be aware that others make equally sharp-looking tablets with larger 10\" screens.The Y's section below seems to suggest my preference for the Google Nexus tablets or 'pure Android' in general and, yes, I do prefer them over Amazon's. But I am a minority of one in my family because everybody else prefers the Kindles. I actually prefer to see my younger kid use the Kindle Fire because of the exceptionally well done parental controls.In the end, iPads, Fires, Nexuses are all going to sell millions of units each. I can only hope that my review helped at least some of you who invested time reading it decide what's best for them.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE the Kindle Fire 8.9\": A Detailed Review", "Author": "J. Friedman \"JF\"", "ReviewID": "RM0EJRMDXSQ9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I did with my review of the 7\" version of this device, I had the chance to check out my friend's advanced copy of the 8.9\" version as well. My conclusion? Simple: I LOVE this device. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!I am a former Apple fanboy; I had the iPhone, I still have the second generation iPad; but now I am finding myself expanding to other, less expensive options. I now have the Galaxy S II, and am seriously considering switching to this product. You'll find most of my comments similar to the review of the 7\", with a few exceptions.DESIGN - I really like how the shortcut bar switches to the right side of the screen when you turn it to landscape mode, so you won't have to look for them. Landscape mode already uses up more vertical space so putting these buttons on the bottom in landscape mode would be silly. It's a bit weird that the home button is now on the right instead of left, but hey, that's fine with me as long as you're not using my landscape space.Attachments download pretty easily. Once you get the hang of things, you'll be using it in no time.FEEL - The fire HD 8.9 was designed very well this time around. So much easier to hold one-handed than a 10 incher or the even bigger 11.6\" guys that weighs down your hand. It has a fairly large bezel which does not look so great aesthetically (I would rather have an edge to edge screen with only a tiny bezel for holding, but I'll live!) It has a soft touch back which looks very pleasant. wider bezel as I noted before, and is extremely light. It is somewhat thick - definitely thicker than the ipad, but the 8.9 version feels just right. It weighs 20 oz. so it's the heaviest product in the Amazon kindle repertoire, but it offers the most so that is expected.It is bigger than the original fire and has nice curved edges which makes it much easier to hold than the original fire. It looks very sharp!!! It has volume buttons, a MAJOR improvement on the original fire as well. It is bigger than an iPad mini and feels bigger too - while still keeping a similar price point as the regular iPad but with far more options.SOUND - the sound is clear and fantastic and comes out very crisp. The fire uses dolby digital audio which comes out very clearly. Dolby knows what they are doing. The music plays very nicely and can be stored in the cloud which is great. Amazon allows you to import up to 250 songs which is not very much, but what can you do?SOFTWARE - the device has new programs such as x-ray which is great to learn more about books and movies, and FreeTime which is fantastic for kids.The platform is Android 4.0, but this is Amazon's customized version of the platform. It is based solely to sell products so don't think of this device primarily as a iPad replacement - folks, think of it more as a faster way to line amazon's pockets with other purchases that you will almost certainly make through the device. The home screen is not customizable with widgets, live wallpapers, weather apps, etc., the way an android screen is.Immersive reading is a new feature that allows you to play an audiobook while reading the screen - you can read and listen at the same time, or if you're bored with reading, just listen. I love having the option. They do well with the sound here using the new Dolby digital feature - that is just super neat and not expected in a tablet!While x-rays for movies is super cool, I got bored of it quickly. I enjoy learning about interesting features of the movie, but after the first time, I just want to enjoy the movie.The idea of FreeTime is great for my kids. My daughter can play with her games, and I know she is not doing other things because of the bright, vibrant blue background color of the screen which I can easily ascertain with a quick glance. I can lock them down on time so they can share with each other. Most importantly, the new fire HD is built tougher.The browser runs very nicely. It seems to run faster than the original fire did. I can turn full screen on or their new \"reading view\" which eliminates all the background junk that wastes space. I was able to download and load PDF files and some of my word documents without any issues, and I'm told by my friend that he had no issues loading his exchange server for work on the 8.9 fire HD.Movie and book titles show up the same way the original fire did, in a library look which seems to work well for Amazon's needs. It displays your titles easily and clearly and allows you to find what you are looking for quickly. The whispersync feature was a great idea - it lets you access your content on any device, so I was able to download a book on the fire HD and see it on my original kindle fire and my iPad's kindle app. Now they have whispersync for movies, games and audiobooks as well!!!!You can use skype which works fine on wifi - it's integrated but is not as full featured as their desktop app. You can also check email - they allow access to aol, gmail, etc. Facebook is set up with the device, and you can easily view photos as well. In short, it's a pretty full featured tablet just as all the others on the market, but at a fantastic price point.HARDWARE - The 8.9\" version costs $299 and $369 respectively (add $15 if you can live with special offers), as well as 32gb and 64gb ($500/$600) with LTE, plus you can get a fantastic 250mb data plan for only $50 a year on the LTE version. As my previous review noted, the 7\" kindle HD comes in 16gb (only $200!!!) and 32gb for $50 more. So you are getting a pretty fantastic deal. In comparision, the 64gb version of the iPad is $659 not including the data plan, so you're saving some money on this guy. Additionally you get 5 gb of amazon cloud storage free, plus you can pay more for more cloud storage (for files: 10/20gb, $25/50gb, $50/100gb, $100/200gb, $250/500gb, and $500/1k gb, plus for music: free/250 songs, and $25/250,000 songs).The data plan, if you get the LTE version of the 8.9\" fire HD, blows away the competition. Consider any smartphone you own - for instance a Galaxy S 2 - you have to pay at least $10 a month premium for the data plan alone, and this is only $50 a year! Not to mention the data plan includes 20gb cloud storage and a $10 Amazon app store credit!It has dual band wi-fi with 802.11 a/b/g/n that makes it much faster than the competition. It also has an amazing screen and dolby digital sound! It can handle WPA2, WEP and WPA security. The processor is a speedy 1.5 Ghz dual core processor with 16 gb integrated flash memory, which is almost as fast as my desktop PC... time to upgrade... :)It is a capacitive touch screen with fantastic resolution. The video playback is 720p. The device also has Bluetooth (A2DP) and HDMI port, as well as text to speech which is great for my blind friend. It comes pre-registered to my account which is a good and a bad thing. I have to be sure not to give it to anyone else without undoing that! It also has a USB 2.0 and 3.5mm stereo jack. It has an accelerometer and gyroscope and front facing HD camera with built in microphone for Skype! It also has an ambient light sensor as well which is a fantastic feature.As noted in my other review, I was able to check out the cover for the 7\" (haven't seen it for the 8.9\" yet) which has a nice leather grain. The interior is made of nylon which has a bit of a plasticky feel. I love the iPad 3 magnetic locking feature and they seem to have utilized that here which turns the device off (sleep) when you close it, and turns it on when you open it. Simple. Uncomplicated. I assume the cover is the same for the 8.9\" version.SCREEN - They have reduced the screen glare on the device using IPS technology, a polarizing filter and anti-glare, which is pretty nice. IPS is a big deal as you don't want to be looking at it from a sharp angle and not be able to see the screen. I don't have as much trouble seeing it in direct sunlight. Also, the screen is much sharper and crisper than the original fire. I can lay the screen down flat on the table and still see what's being played pretty well. The color is vibrant and the magazines show up fantastic similar to the iPad's retina screen. It has vibrant blacks and a display resolution of 1920 x 1200 which is about 255 ppi so that does lag a bit behind the iPad with retina display.PERFORMANCE -  The HD 8.9\" seems to run a bit more efficiently than the 7\" version that I tested earlier, and it certainly runs much faster than my current kindle fire. It has a hardware called MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) which is increased antennas that work together to transfer data and improve data performance without taking up more unnecessary power or even adding any bandwidth to the spectrum! It uses all antennas provided to improve the connection quality as well. Not only that, the processor needed can be the same one without requiring an updated one.Downloads are pretty fast. I have Prime so I am able to run movies and shows for free and they ran fantastic on the device. On Wifi they just scream OWWWWWWW FAST. Much better than the iPad 3 as I've cross tested them. Netflix and YouTube ran seamlessly with no stuttering as sometimes happens on wireless devices like the iPad. I was able to get about 8 to 9 hours of battery life with VERY heavy usage, a bit less than the 7\" version since I had the LTE running, I think they say over 11 hours but that did not happen for me. It charges pretty fast - it took only a few hours using their \"powerfast\" charger.ADVERTISING - The device DOES have advertising, which is displayed on the lock screen only. I found this did not bother me too much, but now Amazon allows you to pay $15 to turn this feature off. If you care so much, then you probably should not be wearing that shirt with the polo logo on it. I'm sure most of you don't and would rather spend that $15 on a new app for the device.OPENING THE BOX - It has a USB 2.0 cable and the quick start guide, as well as the tablet itself. I wish it came with the power adapter up front. I would have to go out and buy one - the iPad comes with one so why not this device? I would rather pay the extra price up front, although I guess it's better to have the option than the choice made for me. The micro-USB cable is nice for plugging it into the computer. No headphones, although I just plugged mine in from my iPad and was fine.WARRANTY - this comes with Amazon's 1 year limited warranty but you can buy a 2 year warranty as well.ACCESSORIES - You get a $3 mp3 credit with any kindle accessory you buy, so that's a bonus. You can and probably should buy two products with the device. Most importantly, pick up a powerfast charger which allows for superfast charging in only 4 hours and costs $20 which is not unreasonable. Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging (for all Kindle Fire models, not included with device). I did not get a chance to see the cover for the 8.9\" but I DID see it for the 7\", so I assume they are very similar. You can get it here for about $55 Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Fuchsia (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\") which is a bit pricey but attaches magnetically, will wake and put your iPad to sleep, and serves as a built in stand.CONS - Very minimal issues - no charger included. No microSD port. No rear camera (most have dual cams now). But let's consider these things - you save money with the absence of a charger - remember, Amazon is already selling these at cost. If you have any USB charger (most people have a smartphone so you can reuse that charger if it's USB), you'll be fine. No rear camera is fine - you aren't holding a larger device like this at all times and if you really need to take a photo, you'll have your smartphone or camera for that. The only real negative I found was the lack of a microSD port, but given that Amazon is generous with the significant memory capacity of the 8.9\", this isn't a desktop replacement so you probably wont need to use up all of that storage.Conclusion - Price is great in comparison to the competition (i.e., the iPad) but you may still want to get a charger and almost certainly a case to protect your baby. Definitely a worthwhile buy if you are looking for a functional tablet and you want to be at the forefront of the technology line. I LOVED IT and recommend it!!!I hope you enjoyed this review. Please feel free to post any comments and I'll be happy to answer!***UPDATE 11-19-12 - Still loving it. I play with it every day. Noticed that the browser does predictive linking. Cool! Screen is super clear and immersive - those pixels are put to great usage and the IPS with a variety of angles is simply fantastic (although it's included with many devices, it's still a great feature for those not used to the future of tech!).  Gotta love that x-ray tech - it's so nice to download something on my kindle then switch to my phone when I dont feel like holding it, without having to redo everything. Makes life SO much easier! Amazon, you're a blessing!******UPDATE 11/23/12-have been playing with it for a few more days and i am still very happy with it. When I'm on wifi, movies load super fast and snappy, even better than the 7\" version. It seems like the wifi is just much better on this model. Also, when watching movies, the sound is fantastic and crisp, due to the speakers on each side, almost like surround sound! One thing you should know is that the device does have a tendency to get a bit warm, nothing extremely unusual, pretty typical in fact but you should just be aware of that fact. Minor issue. Still love it and reccommend it!!!******UPDATE 12/17/12 - Sorry this is a bit behind the 8-ball but better late than never!!! Just so you are aware, Amazon has posted an update for the Kindle. Doesn't work on the lower end models. This is the text of the update taken from the forums: \"We have a new, free software update available for Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire Second Generation. The software update will be delivered automatically via wireless to your Kindle in the coming weeks. These software updates will include: *Kindle FreeTime, a tablet experience just for kids allowing parents to set daily screen time limits, and give access to appropriate content for each child. *A setting so customers can control whether or not personalized recommendations appear below the carousel on the device homepage. *Ability for customers to set the default device language to one of six languages, including English (US), English (UK), German, French, Italian, and Spanish.

If you have any questions related to this release, please visit the Kindle Help Forum - http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=kindle_help_forum_gd.\"", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad experience", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R1WN5L92AX76A6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since I am getting so many rude comments, I decided to delete the issues and problems I had with this unit.  A little background on myself; WAN Tech, Project Manager for 3 major Internet providers and a telecom specialist for 15 years.  I had purchased the Original Kindle fire and love it.  You may search my reviews to see that I am credible.I am currently on my 3rd replacement of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with 64GB.  The current unit is working, but the previous two had major issues regarding WiFi/4G connectivity and memory problems to the point where the units were useless and had to be replaced.I would not recommend this unit for the following reasons....1) Many android apps on the Amazon store do not work, or harm the unit. For example the app called \"Locate my Kindle\" (now removed by Amazon) has harmed over 130 kindle fire units.2) It appears that memory management software may be, or has been defective.  Hopefully the last update has cured this.For a synopsis of the memory problems I had with unit number 2, you may visit the kindle forum at the Amazon link below ....http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=kindle_help_forum__rvt_np?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1GLDPZMNR1X53&cdPage;=2&cdThread;=TxBRLZ21QQBP22#CustomerDiscussionsNew==================================Now that my third Kindle Fire HD 8.9 64GB is working, I feel I can write a full review of what I like and don't like.1) Email Support.  The embedded email app works well.  I use the MSN Outlook platform, and it even supports multiple sub email boxes.  This is better than the Kindle Fire Original app. 4 of 5 stars.2) Music.  The music app is fine.  However it does not let you add a new song to one that is playing like the Original Kindle Fire.  However, the work-around for that is simply to play a song, then while listening to it, build a new play list.  You can sort by Albums, Artists, and Songs. 3 of 5 stars3) Sound.  The sound of the internal speakers is ok.  The Amazon marketing department use words such as \"Booming\".  No, they don't boom.  They are loud enough for two people to watch a movie without headphones.  They do have good stereo separation thanks to Dolby.  However, if you really want a good experience with sound, get yourself a very good set of ear buds and enjoy, then, and only then, does the Kindle Fire HD actually BOOM.  2 of 5 stars4) Movies.  I have to say that this was the whole reason I got the 8.9 64gb unit.  And, I have had nothing but problems in this area.  But (cross my fingers) I hope third time is a charm.  So, lets say it like this .... When the unit is working well, the screen has excellent resolution when playing movies.  You can download them from the Amazon store with different resolutions depending on the quality of playback you want as well as how much memory storage you have left.  3 of 5 stars5) HDMI Output.  This is a new feature and I do like it.  However, be very careful when looking at cables for this.  The first one I purchased was HDMI rated, but the video quality sucks with it, even though I downloaded the movie in the highest definition.  I would buy one that said HDMI with HIGH SPEED.  That should be the best one.  4 of 5 stars.6) Video Quality.  The screen on the HD unit is good.  When displaying icons for music and menu functions, it is totally clear and easy to read.  When watching an action movie, the screen keeps up with the fast moving scenes quite well.  Further, there is an auto-dimming function that works really good with my 3rd unit, that didn't work well at all with my first two units. 5 of 5 stars.7) Amazon App Store.  Apps are limited and have a much lower selection than those available for other Android tablets.  Further, apps that work on other android devices simply do not work on certain models of the Kindle Fire (such as the HD).  However, if you read the reviews, most of the time you'll be fine.  But, don't expect that just because an app is in the Amazon store that it wont harm your Kindle Fire.  There is some history of damaging apps that are on or have been on the Amazon Store.  I suggest reading the reviews carefully before downloading ANY applications for the Kindle Fire HD.  0 of 5 stars8) Amazon Tech Support.  I work during the day, so I have found that when I call in for technical support I usually get someone that is from another country and has a difficult time understanding what I am saying, or I get someone else in the USA that doesn't have any technical knowledge at all.  So I would have to say they simply don't have any technical support that is any good at all.  Further, if you are a tech head like myself, and find a problem with the unit, the really only viable option is simply sending it back and purchasing another one.  To get an exchange is next to impossible without using colorful metaphors. 0 of 5 stars.9) WiFi Wireless.  Simply awesome!  They really did their homework on this function and they deserve to use all the really dramatic marketing buzz words they wish.  It simply is really good, it works from a long distance, and is quick to sync up with a network. 5 of 5 stars.10) AT&T; 4G.  Not as good as I had hoped.  First of all, if you leave your 4G on, you wont have much battery life left is just a few hours.  So, some of the really cool texting apps are out of the question when using the 4G.  Further, when you turn it on, it can take 2-3 minutes to sync up, sometimes even longer.  It seems to bounce around from the regular AT&T; network and the 4G as if it didn't know that it only should work on the 4G network.  Although I do like the promotional plan they give for $50 for one year because it seems to be great for me if I am just checking email, facebook or my stocks.  2 of 5 stars11) Silk Web Browser.  When this came out for the Original Kindle Fire, there was a lot of hype about the Silk browser. Personally, I think it was, and still is just that, hype.  The browser is slow to launch and will display that its ready, but then you start to type something and it isn't.  Only a few seconds later you realize that you typed your UserID and Password to your bank and the Silk browser wasn't actually in secure mode - which is a little alarming.  Sometimes the Keyboard doesn't show up when you want it to, and sometimes its just slow to show up.  Also, if you are new to Tablet browsing, realize that Flash is no longer supported.  Although there are work-arounds for that (side-loading a different browser), be prepared to start getting a little more tech savvy in regards to that.  3 of 5 stars.12) Battery Life.  Its not so good.  I have really learned to use the Airplane mode which shuts off the WiFi and the 4G antennas from searching for a network, when I know there isn't one.  Also, if I leave on the WiFi and 4G, the other choice is simply to power down the unit.  The only problem with that is that it takes a bit to power back on.  If you are looking for a battery application, I would advise against the Free Battery HD app.  I had a lot of problems with it and do not recommend it.  2 of 513) Amazon Shopping.  I have not had the best experience in the last several months with Amazon shopping.  This hasn't always been the case.  However, in the last 4-6 months, I have returned about 30% of the items due to issues with the items.  You are welcome to view my reviews for more details on those.  Suffice to say, I avoid Amazon shopping unless there are absolute glowing reviews AND the item is a good value.  Otherwise I shop elsewhere.  Further, the merchants have been quite rude.  Several have tried to bribe me to change my review with cash. I suppose if they didn't have ethics when they shipped me a defective item, there would be no reason for me to think they would have ethics later.  Suffice to say I did not accept their bribe - the negative reviews stand.  0 of 514) Camera.  It comes with only one camera that faces you when you look at the screen.  This is good for Skype.  You can still take photos with it (get an app), it just takes a little more mental coordination when shooting scenes. But I have shot photos that way and it works pretty well. It would have been nice to have two cameras though.  3 of 5 stars.15) Sync/power and HDMI receptacles.  The placement of the these probably has to do with a future accessory stand.  However, depending on the design of the optional case you purchase, you may not be able to keep the unit charging while viewing it, especially in landscape mode while watching a movie.  4 of 5.16) Power and Volume Buttons.  The power button on the Original Kindle Fire actually lit up and depending on the color, you could tell if the unit was fully charged, or was charging.  This does not have that function on the button itself.  Further, the button protrudes from the unit, which makes it easy to accidentally turn off.  However, some of the optional cases actually help with this problem.  The volume button is a new addition to the Kindle Fire.  With the Original Kindle Fire, you had to used the on-screen volume in order to change the volume.  This wasn't always compatible with some apps.  So, this is a good addition. 4 of 5 stars.17) Included Accessories.  You get a nice cardboard box and a sync cable.  You can buy the Amazon Charger with the unit for a discount.  The retail is around $20, but when you buy it with the unit its about half price.  The charger is mandatory.  My personal opinion is that it should be included especially for the price that we are paying for this 64GB unit.  The optional charger (which really isn't an option) does not come with a sync cord, you use the sync cord that came with the unit.  Since I mentioned the box, I would make sure and keep it if you have to return the Kindle Fire. 0 of 5 stars.18) Blue Tooth.  I have re-written this section of my review. The blue tooth function is poor.  It seems to drop blue tooth functionality quite often, no matter what the Blue Tooth device is.  This is especially a problem when running the skype application with a blue tooth headset.  I have tried this with the Kinovo and the Rocketfish headset, but both drop about 20 minutes into a call and can not be reestablished unless I completely do a hard reboot of the Kindle Fire.  Obviously there is some sort of a software problem with the Blue Tooth.  Hopefully this will be resolved in the future.  0 of 5 stars.19) Value.  When my #2 unit failed due to memory issues, I did take a hard look at the options out there for other brands.  This unit is unique because it has some nice options that others don't especially if you love movies like I do.  As an independent telecom project manager, I have a history of flying around the country working with my clients on their WAN projects.  This unit does especially well (when the Kindle Fire itself is working) with Email (great for work and home email accounts), playing HD movies (Entertainment; because of the larger screen and extra memory storage), music, and access to documents on the cloud.  That boils down to a large HD Screen, cloud storage, and the large internal storage (64GB).  Further, when I can't access the WiFi network, I can switch to the AT&T; 4G network to get email.  Those features on the IPAD Mini still cost more than the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G 64GB.  Further, the next popular choice would have been the Nexus 7, but the internal storage is half of the Kindle Fire.  And although its about half the price, that simple doesn't suit my needs.  So, I'd have to say, as long as all the features of the Kindle Fire actually work as advertised, its value is 4 of 5 stars.All the ratings I have given are my honest opinion with the 3rd unit that is working (but still having issues with Blue Tooth).  My overall rating is still 1 star since I purchased the unit over two months ago and I have finally got a unit that is working. And for those that don't like negative reviews, I am sorry.  I write my own personal review the way Amazon intended so that people can read my experience and determine if it will work for them.  Simply writing glowing reviews without any attention to detail never helped any future customer.  And although I have been accused of not actually purchasing a Kindle Fire HD, please note that this is indeed a verified purchase.  And for those still intent on shooting down the author of a negative review by insulting my credibility,  please realize that I am in my late 40's, I am a telecom and network specialist and have worked as a project manager for no less than 5 major telecom companies.  Suffice to say I've been around computers for a very long time.Absolute Essentials to buy with the Kindle Fire1) Home Charger.  Find it at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GWO5WK/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00You cant fully charge the HD without it. 5 of 5 stars2) USB Charging Cord.  The cord that comes with the unit from Amazon is ok, but if you want to keep charging the unit while in landscape mode with the rooCase (see below) you need a USB cable that has a right angle to the left.  I've tried a few cords like this, and this is the best one that is durable and is rated for the higher voltage charging. The right angle to the left is important so as to not get in the way of the HDMI port.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJCC2TQ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  .  5 of 5 stars3) rooCASE Origami Dual-View. Find it at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097FLMVK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00The case is needed to protect the unit, plus offer multiple viewing angles. 5 of 5 stars4) ReVIVE Series DualFLUX DC to USB Rapid Car Charger. Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OTESFK/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00The car charger provides the higher power needed to charge your Kindle HD while on the road. 5 of 5 stars5) Silver Executive Stylus Pen 2-in-1 Combo for Business Professionals.

Quite good! 5 of 5 stars", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon Kindle HD 8.9\" Makes Boredom Extinct", "Author": "Gregory S. MacBeth \"\"Be polite, be profes...", "ReviewID": "R7QCK5G4MM6BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned two Kindle devices one of which was the original Kindle.  Both of which I have been very happy with.  If you are planning on buying a tablet for e-reading and want some of the benefits of a tablet (Web, email, music, or videos), then the Kindle is the best way to go.  If you are buying a tablet for business purposes primarily, then you would be better served with a Nexus 10 from Google.For personal use, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", is the best device on the market this Christmas 2012.  It provides the perfect balance between hardware to power use, which allows the user to have a device that runs for a long time, 10 hours, for reading, music, videos, and games.  When you add in the power of Amazon Integration, users are blessed with vast sources of books, music, videos, and games/apps that will make becoming bored nearly impossible.Reading Books:The typeface is amazing on the new Kindle Fire HD.  There is no eye strain and the controls easily allow you to change the font type, size, margin, and background colors.  Outside, the screen displays the page easily in full light of day with no glare.  Amazon didn't include any frills such as page turning animations like you see with the Google Books or Nook, but never the less, turning pages is easily done with a swipe.  Highlighting is easily done and seen by the viewer.  Buying books is simple and can be completed by any educated person.  The size of 8.9\", in my humble opinion, is the perfect size.  It allows you to see a real page of text from a book, which is great because it gives you the actual feeling of reading from a book.  Whereas a 7' screen never really shows you an actual page of text .  A 10.1\" screen will show you a screen of text on a page but it is slightly harder to hold in your hands.The only real downside is that Amazon continues to use their places rather than actual page numbers in many books.Music:The devices comes with two great speakers which allow you to play your favorite tunes loud enough to hear in almost any venue.  The Amazon Music store offers great deals with $3, $5 and discounted music on any genre of you desire.  You can make playlists to organize your tunes easily.Video:With a 1080p HD screen supporting a resolution of 1920 x 1200 you will enjoy movies all your movies and if you are an Amazon Prime customer, many will be free.  The Amazon store offers a wide range of movies for all interests.  If you can't find it in the Amazon store you can always use Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO or Youtube.Web/Email:You easily browse the web using Amazon proprietary browser Silk or you can download Firefox or Dolphin.  With these choices you can access almost any site with the exception of parts of sites that use Adobe Flash which is no longer supported on Android after version 4.  There are also apps for accessing your email which provide access to almost any provider.  Please understand that if you are a power email user, you will have to use the browser to access full GMail functionality, which is easy to do.Apps:One of the first things you will want to do is disable the feature that allows only Amazon store apps.  This way you can put apps like Nook or Zinio on your Kindle Fire HD.  Now you have a fully functional tablet...  But seriously folks, the app store is not as full as Google's store but for most major apps if they exist in Google's store, they will be published in Amazon's store too.Hardware:In general, the device feels solid in your hands.  It weighs in at 20 oz which is a little heavy.  The speakers are nice quality and sound clearly when used with clean country music or distorted head banger styles.  The 1.5 GHz Dual core processor is more than enough to power this device for personal use as an e-reader or personal web browser and email.  It powers the music and video with great quality giving the user High Definition on a 8.9\" screen.Screen:The screen is amazing in that it is brilliantly colorful, has a great resolution, and is easy on your eyes during reading.  With a resolution of 1920 x 1200 you will easily be able to watch videos in full HD brilliance and to be honest anything beyond this resolution in this size of a screen is overkill that is just using more power.  The glass is strong, but I would recommend a case and a screen saver to prevent scratching.Battery:Battery life is great in the device and you could easily fly from New York to Los Angeles on one charge.  The device recharges quickly when you use the additional cost charger which is a must buy unless of course you have existing Samsung or Motorola mobility devices that use micro USB in which case you can share the cable and chargers with your new Kindle.Wi-Fi connectivity:The new Dual Band capability is a big benefit as most routers contain G and N functionality allowing for greater range of connectivity from the wireless base station.Memory:With options for 16GB or 32GB you will have plenty of room.  People fail to realize just how big a GB is.  For the average person 16GB will more than do.  If you are a music nut or video freak there is the 32GB option, but to make your life easy Amazon includes free Amazon Cloud storage for media purchased from their store.  This is great because you can access your movies from XBOX, Roku or Google TV devices.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value, beautiful device for media.", "Author": "Tracey Fox", "ReviewID": "R3TQ7KTJ2K5GLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, and love it.  When I decided to get something larger to use for out of town travel, I considered just about everything out there, but ended up purchasing the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.  I couldn't be happier! I put my hands on as many tablets as possible in the stores to make sure I was making an informed decision.  I even considered plunking down $600+ on the new ipad with retina display; also seriously considered the top of the line Toshiba tablet (has a great screen, among other things, but not as sharp as the Fire).  In the end, it was price and SOUND that made my decision.  I use my Kindle Fires mostly for music, web and video (aside from reading, of course).  The screen on the 8.9 is absolutely gorgeous!  Yes, the retina dispay on ipad is also fantastic, but the difference was not worth nearly twice the price, IMHO.  But where Kindle blew everyone away was the sound.  The stereo speakers on both sizes cannot be beat.  I literally had to put the speaker of the Toshiba up to my ear to hear it on the loudest setting in the quite noisy store I was in.  A few short steps away, in the same noisy crowd, the Kindle speakers were loud and crystal-clear, and not even all the way up.  I can really crank it up and rarely get any distortion.  Don't worry about the youtube app,etc.  There are plenty of instructions to be found on the net for loading apps like that onto your Kindle Fire.  Took me only a couple of minutes, and the app works just fine.  The silk web browser is fast, and I have no complaints about it.  A word about the ads vs ad-free argument: Unless you reeeeaaallly want to look at a picture of your kids or whatever for the few seconds your lock screen will be seen, I wouldn't bother cancelling the ads.  Even the \"suggestions\" at the bottom of the carousel are unobtrusive, and don't even show in landscape mode.  It's only $15 to opt out if it really bothers you, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I used that $15 to buy a magazine subscription to enjoy on my awesome new toy!  I picked up the case made by Amazon, which to me is a must, and will be adding an anti-glare screen protector.  The Fire already has less glare than anything else I looked at, but I still like the protectors. Some things to take into consideration about my review: I do have alot of Amazon content.  Now, I know full well I could still have taken full advantage of my Amazon content from another tablet, but it may make a difference to some of you reading this.  I am not a gamer, and I don't have 500 time-wasting apps on my phone or Kindle, nor do I want them.  And last, I am not and have never been a die-hard Apple fan.  They make great products, but so do other companies.  If you are someone who will not be happy with anything but an ipad, please do yourself a favor and buy one.  Please don't buy this great Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and then return it and post a negative review because it's not an ipad.  I hope my review helps someone!  Thanks for reading.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet with some Tweaks/get Dolphin Web Browser", "Author": "Trent", "ReviewID": "R3LDEQ74UDEZYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Kindle Fire 1st gen, and decided to go with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" since it solved some of the issues I had with the first one.  There are plenty of reviews about what the tablet functionality includes, so I'll only cover some basic things about how it compares to the first gen Kindle Fire and some notable items about how to improve the HD with better apps. Toward the bottom of this review I provide instructions to installing the Dolphin Web Browser, which is the single best thing you can do to improve the Kindle Fire HD.A few notable improvements from the Kindle Fire 1st Generation:* Volume buttons: this is huge! Big improvement. Although I think the buttons should be separated a little to tell them apart, or be physical different somehow to tell which one is increase or decrease.* Freetime: huge improvement. I don't worry about giving it to my kids any more, and my kids love it!* Generally it's more responsive, the screen is better quality, and I like the size much more. As far as the screen goes my 7\" Kindle Fire was good for reading books, but not so much for browsing the internet. If I needed/wanted to browse for something I'd usually fire up my laptop for a full browser.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" larger screen and resolution makes a huge difference. I'm no longer using my laptop as much and able to more quickly look up things I need on the Kindle. It's a full tablet! Of course, this is also a slight negative--I could fit my old Kindle in some pant and coat pockets so it was easier to take around with me. I can't do that, and I'm taking it with me more. I'm a little more afraid of losing it.Now a few things about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" specifically:* Overall I like much of it. The UI is great for novice and intermediate users. I'm an advanced user, and I still think it works pretty well for my purposes with a few simple enhancements I'll mention below.  If you like Amazon's platform and have Prime, it's a no-brainer. Free books via the Lending Library or just free titles is great!* Video is a real standout with this: I'm going to cancel my subscription to Netflix now! Netflix's catalog is going downhill quick, and is still terribly difficult to search for good content. On the flipside, Amazon's Instant Video on the Fire is now much better! I love how the free Instant Video is the 1st option when opening the video tab, and how they have shortcuts immediately to Editors Pick and Just for kids. Makes it simple to find good video, and it looks great output to my TV in HD.  I've also installed the HBO To Go app and found it's awesome as well. HBO directly on it! I've also found myself just watching video on the Fire instead of plugging it up to my TV or turning on my TiVo for the same content--just easier.* Integration with Audible is awesome! I used Audible several years ago and found when I logged in dozens of old Audio books I can download in a moment, with great quality.  It almost makes me want to go back to Audible. I use Overdrive now and borrow from my local public library to my iPod, so probably will still do that.* Books:  it's a great ebook reader. I hate to say it but I prefer most books to be on my Kindle now. Don't forget you can get them from your public library as well (search for Overdrive!). One negative is that I can't put books into folders and I have a lot of books. Oh well...* Integration with Amazon's cloud drive for music and files works great as well. Not much to say but it works flawlessly.The device is great but does have some flaws:* Most notably, Silk is a terrible web browser. Mine crashes continually and is very slow. Even after turning off \"acceleration\" it's slow.  See a fix below for this.* The battery life is so-so. I'm getting around 6-7 hours of use before the battery is dead.* It really should have a forward looking camera.* It would be very nice if Amazon allowed more advanced control over the settings of the device.  There are tons of things I'd like to customize, but since this is a more controlled environment than other Android tablets, I just can't. One example:  I get lots of email for work and personal use, and as a result I don't like audible email notifications. However, when I turn those off I lose all notifications. There isn't an ability to still show the new mail icon unless you have audio notifications!Overall, I love my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". I have had some frustrations so I'll share how I've fixed those below:* Web browser: GET THE DOLPHIN WEB BROWSER. Most people don't know this, but you can get a different web browser. You can also get plenty of other apps than what is available in the app store. Here's how: o Set your Kindle to allow installing unknown applications: Settings > Device > Allow Installation of Applications = On. o Install the One Mobile Market (independent market place). Amazon won't let me give a URL for this, so just Google \"1 Mobile Market\" or go to 1Market d o t com. This gives you the ability to install pretty much ANY Android application (with some functional limitations). o Once installing One Mobile Market launch it and search for the Dolphin Browser. This browser works great and is much faster than Silk. It has more options to control privacy and other features. The only negative is that you can't change the Kindle's default \"Web\" menu item to open Dolphin--you'll just need to add it to your Favorite's menu.* One you install the One Mobile Market and Dolphin also install: o Youtube. Must have. o OneNote (great notetaking product from Microsoft that allows you to sync notes to the cloud) o Anything else you want--just remember that anything that relies on Google's framework functionality won't work without rooting your device. Generally, if an app is already in Amazon's store, get it there so you ensure it works with the Kindle. o AirDroid: This is an amazing tool that allows you to access your Kindle from any web browser to copy files between your computer and Kindle--pictures, etc, and do other advanced tasks. o Flash: While in Dolphin, find a Flash APK file to download. I had a link here but Amazon removed it. Instead, just BING for \"flash_player_ics.apk\". Currently the top link at Bing is the file you need directly from Macromedia's servers.* In the Amazon App Store make sure you download these key must-haves: o Slacker Radio--Spotify and Pandora have better PR, but Slacker is better IMO. Radio + choose your own music, and if you pay $10 a month you can listen to anything you want, any time. o NetFlix o GSam Battery Monitor o MapQuest--It's surprisingly good. You can also download Google Maps from 1 Mobile Market, but it doesn't work great due to bugs running on the Kindle.UPDATE 12/3/12:Two additional items I realized I should mention:* I didn't mind the Fire didn't come with a charger. I bought this instead: PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger for Apple iPad 2, New iPad 3, Amazon Kindle, Kindle DX, Kindle Fire / Noble Nook Color / HTC Flyer / Samsung Galaxy Tab Series (USB Cable not included) - White. This has 2 USB ports and works at a high-enough amperage to charge the Fire quickly.* I bought the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Ink Blue (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"). I gave that 4 stars in my review there. It's really great as well but just a little overpriced.UPDATE 1/7/13:I still love my Fire, but wanted to write a quick update about Kindle FreeTime. The Kindle FreeTime function is great -- it helps kids have their own area on the device that is locked down to the items you let them have, so they don't accidentally start buying stuff on Amazon or send emails on your behalf.The key thing though is Kindle FreeTime \"Unlimited\". This is the monthly subscription service that gives your kids immediate access to hundreds of books, apps, and videos. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId;=1000863021). I used this for the 30 day trial for my two kids, and it is a huge benefit. My kids love my Kindle now because there is so much to do on it--and it's not just Angry Birds. They watch movies--even educational videos like Reading Rainbow, read books, and play apps that are educational. Last night I watched my 8 year old son help my 5 year old daughter play a learning game for 45 minutes--what is this animal, what sound does it make, etc. For $6.99 per month it's a huge value--worth every penny!", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "If You Really Want to Know the Truth", "Author": "Book Fanatic", "ReviewID": "R3PGT8A3O26AWC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, people who give a product a 1 or 2 star review because of one issue don't get the point of reviews.  They should reflect the overall experience so people can get a fair idea of what they might be buying. Secondly many people are dinging this product because of a lack of flash.  Get over it people!  It's not Amazon's fault.  Adobe doesn't support flash on ANY new Android device.The Good:The display is outstanding.  I cannot see any pixelation in text and even the tiniest fonts are clear and sharp.  The HD video is outstanding.The reading experience on books is far superior to the original Fire with a much more pleasing to the eye experience.The size is perfect.  10 inch tablets are too big and 7 inch (including the original Fire) are too small.  I love this 8.9 inch device.I am not experiencing the slowness in browsing some are reporting.  I have an excellent connection on wifi and maybe that is why.  I would note however that I bought the original Kindle Fire and after a few updates to the firmware Amazon fixed many of the problems with browsing.  The speed on this device is far superior to the original fire and it does have a better wifi signal sitting side by side in my home.The bluetooth is a huge plus over the original Kindle.  I'm typing this with a bluetooth keyboard and I love it!  I have a quality logitech keyboard.  Don't cheap out on your keyboard.  I haven't tried a mouse.  I also have connected to external bluetooth speakers and it works great.  Love that sound!Everyone and their Grandmother is complaining about the fact you can't install non-Amazon apps.  OK, that is NOT true.  You can and I side-loaded multiple apps that work beautifully on this device and some that looked awful.  There are massive amounts of Android apps not available on the Amazon app store that work perfect if side-loaded.  Side-loading does NOT invalidate your warranty.  Just don't root it unless you know what you are doing.  Side-loading means changing your default setting to allow unknown apps to install (See Amazon allows this!).  Then get the apk file on your device and tap it.  The Kindle will install it.  You can do this in many ways, to me the easiest is to simply download them from dropbox or something like that.The Not So Good:If it wasn't for the hype the speakers on this device would be in the good.  I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality after Amazon's \"Booming Dolby\" hype.  As I've listened to it subsequently I like it better.  For a tablet it is actually quite good, but frankly listening to music or a movie on this thing can't even begin to compare to what you get even with fairly cheap external speakers.  The good thing is I can pipe it to speakers via bluetooth.  Don't get me wrong, the speakers are tablet good but do not live up to the advertisement.I have never liked Amazon's user interface.  I much prefer a native Android interface.  On my original Kindle Fire I installed GO Launcher but I've read it doesn't work on this device.  Apparently there are some that do and I assume more will as time passes.  Come on Amazon you can do better than this and STILL push people towards your content.  There is very little difference in the interface over the original fire.  Yes there are some improvements but they are incremental and the UI remains much the same.The build quality seems to be good overall but the power and volume buttons are very hard to feel and figure out which is up or down.  That's a mistake.  You get used to it but that is going to bother a lot of people.There is no charging light and that irked me because I like to walk by and see the green light on my original Fire and know it is charged.  With this one you have to hit the power button and unlock the screen.  A light would have cost more but it probably would be worth it.The app market on Amazon is limited even compared to the original Fire.  I assume that is because the apps aren't ready and that is not Amazon's fault.  For example I side-loaded an app I have on my original Fire that I got from the store that is not available on this one.  It looked horrible.  We have to wait for the developers to update apps.  This is to be expected and I don't blame Amazon, but you need to be aware of this.Summary:This is a darn good device.  The reason it is inexpensive compared to similar devices is because Amazon sells at cost and they left a few features out.  You get what you pay for but with this device you are getting more than you pay for because Amazon hopes to make money off of your content purchases, but you don't have to buy a thing.  People need to quit complaining about stupid stuff like chargers.  OMG, I have numerous charges that work with this device.  Pay 10 bucks if you want a fast one.It would be an even better buy if it had a rear-facing camera.  Well gee it would cost more too so I'm glad it doesn't.  Yes I would use it some but I can click a photo with my cell phone too.For the money this is great hardware and a good experience.  If you want a pure Android experience DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE AND THEN COMPLAIN.  Do a little research first.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Why I bought a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" and how I made it useful", "Author": "Granddaddy", "ReviewID": "R3A1F4FY18DQ1S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Posted on 1/7/2013, this is an update to my comments about the Kindle's weight that I posted on 12/12/2012. I've now had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" WiFi 32GB with Special Offers tablet for one month. My experiences might help others assess their \"need\" for this tablet.Many of the 1-star reviews of the KFHD8.9 remind me of the time some decades ago when a famous consumer reporting magazine gave a poor rating to America's favorite sports car because \"it still only seats two.\"When buying a product, I want to know what that product claims to be, what it really is, and whether any of it is of any use to me at all.In December I thought I might \"need\" a tablet device. This despite the fact that I've never used a smart phone and I hate laptop computers. I figured that poking a screen with a finger is crude at best when compared to the precision, flexibility, and speed of a touch typist using a keyboard/mouse combination. Giving up a multi-tasking windowed environment seemed like stepping backwards a few decades.I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 32 GB WiFi with Special Offers based on Amazon's description and on user comments and reviews that persuaded me it could do the several media viewing tasks that I had in mind.My biggest surprise was that Amazon seems not to realize that a 32 GB tablet is far more than a media display device. It is in fact an information and entertainment system. As such it requires tools to manage large quantities of information stored in thousands of files. Not acting on this fact is the same mistake made by so many when hard disks first appeared and transformed desktop computers from simple data manipulation devices to systems that required management.Developing and refining management tools for the desktop has taken 30 years and is continuing. Hopefully Amazon will learn more quickly what it is selling. For now, the KFHD8.9 lacks the most basic organizational tools. Fortunately, independent software developers are working on apps that enable us to make the Kindle useful.Here are the 6 things I wanted to do with a tablet, along with a brief summary of how I made the KFHD8.9 useful for each task.SIX TASKS FOR MY KINDLE1.) Play home videos for my elderly mother so she can see her great granddaughters on her big screen TV.  This finally succeeded just yesterday when another Kindle owner recommended the free app BSPlayer Lite. I had produced some mp4 videos of dance and piano recitals from my AVCHD files. These mp4's played flawlessly on my desktop PC using several mp4 players. I then copied the files to my Kindle using the USB cable. I then connected the Kindle to my mother's TV using an HDMI cable.  The Kindle Personal Videos app and two other video player apps stumbled where the videos included crossfades between scenes or where there were scrolling credits over a still image. The sound continued but the progress of the video display halted for a few seconds and then jumped ahead. ES File Explorer crashed completely when I tried to use it's built-in player to open an mp4 file. I assume there is a bug in these apps or in the codecs included with the Kindle that will eventually be fixed. Meanwhile, BSPlayer Lite is the only app I've found that plays my mp4 files smoothly.2.) Streaming HiDef Netflix video to a big screen TV  This works well with no additional software. I previously used a Wii game machine (which is not HiDef) to stream Netflix. I connected my Kindle to the TV with a 15' HDMI cable that allows me to sit in my recliner with the Kindle and watch streaming video on my HiDef TV. This saved me the cost of buying some other network HiDef video streaming device.3.) Replace old iPod Nano 2nd generation for listening to podcasts.  I listen to podcasts several hours each week with my iPod always connected to one of my stereo systems. Using the Kindle for podcast listening almost didn't work in any useful way. The iPod is well integrated with iTunes self-organizing playlist system based on attributes of each mp3 file. In contrast, the Kindle has only rudimentary tools for organizing podcasts and music.  Fortunately, Amazon had a 99 cent offer that called my attention to iSyncr and the free Rocket Music Player. These can be synced to my iTunes playlists on my PC. I am now well on the way to making the Kindle into a useful podcast organizing and listening device. This saves me the cost of buying a new iPod or other mp3 player.  The rave reviews about the Kindle speakers imply to me that most small devices have really terrible speakers or that no one knows any more what high fidelity sound is meant to be. These tiny speakers have minimal usefulness, though they do beat listening through iPod earbuds.4.) Browsing the web when away from desktop  This works pretty well. The Silk browser has never crashed since I started using it. I have no more trouble with it than I do with Internet Explorer on my desktop PC. Silk is fine for casual surfing and quick lookups. It is utterly inadequate for serious research and writing. Especially it lacks a robust method of managing a lot of bookmarks or of keeping multiple tabs open for instantaneous switching among pages. (On my desktop PC I have some 2,500 bookmarks organized into 140 folders.) Clicking links with a finger can be trying on some web pages. A stylus was less helpful than I had expected. A severe fault is that you have no control over where Silk puts downloaded files. They all go to the Downloads folder and you need another app to find them and move them where you want them.5.) Reading books and technical papers in many formats, especially PDF  I have never liked reading books on my computer and I doubted I would like it on the Kindle. My opinion is slowly changing now that I have loaded dozens of PDF files and Mobi files (all free) from various web sites and from my public library. The free Adobe reader has basic markup capabilities, though it's far less capable than what I am accustomed to with FoxIt Reader on my PC. With the Kindle I can read longer documents in a comfortable chair instead of at my desktop.  A major deficiency is that bookseller Amazon provides almost no means for organizing books and documents. Fortunately, on my first day with the Kindle I found the free ES File Explorer that enables me to work with documents much as I do using Windows Explorer on my desktop PC.  Some publishers do not allow network transfer of library electronic books directly to the Kindle. The file must first be downloaded to your PC and then copied to the Kindle over a USB connection. Connecting a networked device through a USB cable seems slightly ridiculous. WiFi File Explorer Pro costs only 99 cents. It lets you copy files to and from the Kindle over WiFi.6.) Playing games  I am not a computer gamer, but I thought my granddaughters would enjoy playing games when they visit a few times each week. Having had to step up to their challenges, I am now addicted to several puzzle games, including Flow Free: Bridges, that can be played by 5-year-olds and by their granddaddy. I've also found that Bubbles is not so mindless as I first thought. It does require some strategy. With Go Free I'm recovering my old love of Go from several decades ago.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSGetting started  Had it running in a few minutes, partly because I had read a lot in advance. The Quick Start card packaged with the Kindle was not much use as it was glued into its slot in the top of the box.On/Off button  A truly terrible button. Some report the Kindle can be accidentally turned off when you brush the on/off button. In contrast, I find it very difficult to turn it on or off when I deliberately press the on/off button. Using a cover with the auto-on feature eliminates most of this annoyance.Weight  Some reviewers think the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is too heavy. With my kitchen/garden scale I determined that the KFHD8.9 with the Marware Revolve case weighs less than most hardbound books I own. Without the case it weighs less than many of my paperbound trade books, and it weighs less than my daughter's iPad. Weight is just not an issue.Weight details added 3/2/2013:Kindle Fire HD 8.9\": 19 oz. (Amazon says 20 on their specs, perhaps my scale is underweighing by 1 oz, doesn't matter)Marware Revolve Case: 13 oz.Combined weight of Kindle + Case: 32 oz.Hardbound books:Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: 40 oz.Bennet's The Book of Virtues: 42 oz.Michener's Hawaii: 39 oz.Paperbound trade books:Mutual Funds for Dummies: 29 oz.Gleick's Chaos: 20 oz.Crockett's Victory Garden: 34 oz.Apple iPad (my daughter weighed hers on her electronic kitchen scale): 23 oz.iPad with cover + integral keyboard: 43 oz.Conclusion: Kindle with Revolve case weighs less than many hardbound books. Kindle alone weighs less than many trade paperbacks. Kindle alone weighs less than iPad. Kindle with case weighs much less than iPad with keyboard case.I'm finding the trick is learning how to hold the Kindle since it is denser and has a different leverage than a printed book. It all depends on what you want to do.Router  My old Netgear WNR2000 N300 router is perfectly adequate for streaming video. I did not have to upgrade to a dual-band router as some have claimed is necessary. CNet describes my router as a no-frills, budget, wireless-N router. I used the free Wifi Analyzer to measure signal strength and channel interference from neighbors houses. I was surprised how strong the signals were from some of my neighbors 50' to 150' away. I have been streaming HiDef video to a room 50' from the router without problems.Battery life  The Kindle runs all day for my purposes of reading, light web browsing, and video watching, along with games with my grandchildren.Charger  I paid attention to the advertising and decided to order the $10 charger. I don't have many portable devices so I don't have spare chargers lying around.Recharging Time (added 3/2/2013)Recharging time for the KFHD8.9 using the Kindle Power Fast charger depends on how low the charge is when you begin charging. Here's some recharging times I observed for overnight charging with WiFi turned off. I read the numbers from the excellent chart made by Battery HD:Starting from 9% charged:to 80% took 2-1/2 hoursto 90% took 3 hoursto 100% took 4 hoursStarting from 28% charged:to 80% took 2 hoursto 90% took 3 hoursto 100% took 3-1/2 hoursFrom 33% charged:to 80% took 1-3/4 hoursto 90% to 2 hours 10 minutesto 100 took 3 hoursFrom a low starting point to about 90% charge is almost a straight line charge. After that the charging rate slows as it approaches 100% charge.Protective cover  A case is an absolutely necessity for me. My one day out with the Kindle in the car (I only used it when I was parked) and at friends' homes was a bit terrifying.Carousel  This is almost useless with its huge icons and incredibly clunky appearance. It's not even a carousel as it does not wrap around. It is simply a linear icon array with no management capabilities except using a long tap to delete a particular item.File Transfer  Transferring files to a networked device over a USB connection is tedious. Amazon provides the Send to Kindle for PC software, but it has bizarre behavior, and I used it only once. The two PDF files I sent using Send to Kindle were first sent to Amazon after which they were sent by Amazon to my Kindle. Perversely, Amazon added nearly 3 dozen random alphabetic characters to the beginning of the filenames. Fortunately, WiFi File Explorer Pro is available for only 99 cents and it does a good job of moving files between your desktop PC and the Kindle without using a USB cable.Lack of significant free apps  The Kindle world has some good free games, but other free apps can be more annoying than useful to the point that they discourage me from upgrading to the supposedly more powerful paid versions. Compared to the Windows world, the Kindle world has a shortage of powerful and useful free apps. Perhaps this will change as the tablet market expands. I have mentioned in this review a few good free to low-priced apps that were vital in making the Kindle a useful device for me.Kindle is boring say some  Not for me. I've been thoroughly engrossed in the details of my Kindle for almost a month. I've had similar learning experiences with unfamiliar technologies over the 30 years I worked with mainframe, DOS, Windows, and Mac computers. It's never boring. (Then I just might be a geek, though a late adopter.)Locked into Amazon say some  Hardly. I've loaded my Kindle with home videos, home photos, and podcasts, and I've been browsing all over the web. I've downloaded books in various formats from a variety of web sites including my public library and Project Gutenberg. I do appreciate that it is very easy to access Amazon when I want to buy something (though I prefer using my desktop PC). You can easily ignore the Amazon tools, though I recommend checking the free app of the day every day. The free trial of Amazon Prime was a revelation to me. I've never paid Amazon shipping charges, having always used the free shipping option that causes slower delivery. With Prime I no longer have to accumulate $25 worth of orders to get free shipping. Even the least expensive items are now just two days away with free shipping. (Yeah, there's an annual membership charge. I'm betting I'll come out ahead.)Special Offers and Other Ads  These ads that appear on the opening splash screen are hardly noticeable, though some have displayed images that are mildly offensive. If some company wants to share sponsorship of my Kindle with other advertisers, good for them. People who walk around with advertising on their sweat shirts, shoes, and pants should hardly be complaining. I have not seen ads popping up randomly, though there are tiny ads in some of the ad-supported free games. Some free games do display full-screen ads. Turning off the WiFi has served to remove them during game play. With Special Offers on the opening splash page I've been surprised at the lack of variety. After the 20th display of the same car at startup I knew that advertisers don't realize that I only buy a car every 15 years or so. Perhaps the lack of variety means few advertisers are buying space on the Kindle.Flash doesn't work  An endless stream of Kindle detractors keep reporting this obvious fact. Adobe discontinued mobile Flash some months before the KFHD8.9 was released. Many imply that the iPad comes with Flash support, which it never did. Steve Jobs published his reasons for not allowing Flash on the iPad nearly 3 years ago. Some credit him for killing Flash, though Flash's many problems, not the least being security and the cookies you may not realize it puts on your device, would have killed it eventually. Not having Flash is less of a problem every day as HTML5 is replacing it (now with support from Adobe). Others have documented the workarounds for those who must have it.GOOD CHOICE AFTER USING ONE MONTH  So far I think the Kindle is proving to be the right choice for a portable device for my specific purposes. If I am still using it after 6 months I'll know I made the right choice.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 64GB 4G - Very Mixed Experience", "Author": "B. Kerr", "ReviewID": "R160RO2SI5VF4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wow, I don't quite know where to start! This is probably the most \"mixed\" review I'm going to write.First off, I had no preconceptions if I was going to like this or not. This is my first tablet, so I have no pre-conceived notions on that front. In fact, I was quite determined to like the Kindle Fire HD, but after 2 weeks of one problem after another, my resolve is wearing down.Please note that this review will also largely revolve around several Kindle Fire HD specific customer service/tech support experiences. I realize that they are not the actual device, but they have a HUGE influence on your experience with the device when something comes up, so I feel that needs to be taken into account too.So, let's start at the beginning. My kindle arrived, and earlier than expected. It was great out of the box, until I tried to register it and it just wouldn't.It seemed straightforward enough, and I'm reasonably tech-savy, but it wouldn't work. Off to tech support. Longish story short, they couldn't register it either, and an hour and two supervisor tech guys later, they managed to register my kindle to my account. In order to do it, they had to create another kindle listing, but oh well. They got it done - great!Next, once I got into the kindle, now that I could use it, I noticed that it was showing the \"offers\" even though I had ordered and paid for without offers. Back to CS to have them turn it off. Should have been quick enough, but oh no.Because there were now 2 Kindle Fire HDs showing, there was confusion. Then because for some reason my order status hadn't updated and my Kindle was still showing as not even having shipped, she kept on telling me that this kindle can't be it, because it hadn't shipped. Again, long story short, I eventually convinced her that I did indeed have the Amazon Kindle in my hand and that it was indeed that order - she set it to no offers and we were good.I then spent a fair bit of time moving my files and stuff to the kindle, uploading and downloading from the cloud, inputting passwords, setting up apps, etc.All that went well and I have to say, I'm loving the screen and the sound on this Kindle. The speed is great too and once I figured out some of the inner workings, I got it nicely customized!That evening, in the middle of a movie, the kindle did a spontanous factory reset and erased everything back to square one! I have NO idea why - it just did.So, I put everything back on. I lost a couple of hours, but at least it was at the very beginning of things - nothing I couldn't put right back in. Ok.A couple more minor malfunctions came up in the following days, one of which led to yet another factory reset as \"the only solution.\"Since this is also a 4G device, I signed up for the AT&T; offer. All went well, I got the confirmations etc.By all rights, the thing should have just been working now, but I kept on getting an error message, saying the SIM card could not be located and to remove it and reinsert it.Since there was no easy way to do this, I called AT&T; customer service in the hopes that they would know what to do. They didn't. In fact, had very little documentation about the Kindle Fire HD 4G yet, and she couldn't even tell me how to remove the SIM card (it's not immediately obvious like it is on a phone btw)Anyway, at their recommendation back to Kindle tech support to find out where the SIM card was for sure and how to open the slot.I spent 20 minutes with somebody that kept on telling me that my device didn't have a SIM card! I kept on telling her that yes indeed it did, I even gave her the SIM card number that the kindle was displaying, and told her that all I needed to know where the card was located, so I could remove it and replace it as instructed, but all I got was repetitive copy and pastes from some manual she must have been consulting.After she finally got that I did have a SIM card, she kept on copying and pasting instructions on how I can purchase the data plan, which I had previously already given all the information of, as well as the information that I bought it, etc.It went on for a while, which led me to believe that she had NO idea what she was talking about, as everything was copy and paste and quite basic manual stuff and only vaguely related to my actual problem. And totally ignoring what I told her I had already tried.Then we did the reset dance again.Reset. Didn't help. Hard reset. Didn't help. And then she got to factory reset. Again.This time I had enough. She kept on saying it was the only way and I'm sorry but my trust in that wasn't that great. This is the person who insisted my Kindle didn't even have a SIM card and now she was insisting that I trust her in believing yet another reset was the only way.Again, long story short, I declined further help on yet another factory reset, as I just wanted to have some time for another solution.Anyway, hopefully this may help somebody else!Turns out that when the Kindle is connected to WIFI, it will say that the SIM card can't be found or may not be present. It gives the standard blurb about removing it, etc. That is a tad misleading. Basically, when it's connected to WIFI it feels no need to be \"seeing\" the SIM card. Once you get out of the WIFI range it sees the card and connects.That I didn't know that is maybe not surprising due to my inexperience, that the error message wording is misleading is unfortunate, but that Kindle Fire Tech Support didn't know that is just tragic. This could have been a one sentence tech support consult! There wasn't even a problem!I am so glad I didn't actually factory reset the kindle - again!So I'm sailing along quite nicely for a few days and I'm loving it! This tablet is really awesome by itself and when it works correctly, all I had hoped for and then some!I have now downloaded what I need for the most part, I have my work documents on it and ordered as I need them. I totally love Kindle Free Time!! There's no fighting about time limits, it says it's all done for today, the kids accept it and happily skip off to do other things! I don't have to worry about my son buying stuff because he can't get out of his area, nobody fights over who's turn it is - it's great!Until last night, when all of a sudden a grey square appeared in the carousel.It's a random grey square that is there instead of the icon for any given app or book. But it's not always the same app. It's truly random. So it's anybody's guess what it might be hiding.I went through the usual reset, hard reset and all that. I deleted the kindle library book that I had gotten last, thinking that maybe it messed things up. Did the resetting game again. The grey square remains. Since I haven't installed anything that wasn't from the kindle store and approved for my device, I'm not sure why it would do it.So back to Tech support I went.And yes,  you guessed it. After repeating all I had done already, the only answer they said they had was: Factory reset! It seems indeed a favorite of the support people. But it's all in the cloud he says, you can download everything again.Yeah, in a few hours! And that's not even counting having to input everything again (passwords etc)I can't keep on doing this!So, for now I'm living with an annoying grey square and having to find my books/apps by guessing, but I've had it with the factory reset and wasting hours putting everything back! It seems something always goes wrong with this device.Never enough to really render the device useless but enough for stuff not to run smoothly. And yes, it is entirely possible/likely that this came from some book or app and has nothing to do with the device, but since the Kindle is so tied in with Amazon and their apps and books, as well as their customer support, this is relevant to the whole package!What's worse, I have no real trust in Amazon tech support right now and don't know if they just say factory reset because it's a catch all and they don't have to deal with anything else, or if it really does require a factory reset! I have no way of telling if it's a big or a small issue!I would hope that on these more sophisticated devices with a large storage capacity, a factory reset is more of a last resort than the first solution to jump to!So in summary:- This tablet, when it works, is awesome!- Seems to have a fair amount of little issues that keep on popping up.- Amazon Customer/Tech support really needs to have a LOT more training on this to be effective with these new devices!- My experience surrounding my ownership of the new Kindle Fire HD 4G has been very mixed due to all the above!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's what I expected", "Author": "missa lou", "ReviewID": "RFKB62ZQSG739", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" WiFi only yesterday and I am loving it.Pro's:-battery life is about 10 hours as is stated.-charging with the power adapter is fast and easy, the USB is great to power it off a computer if I need to.-The speaker system is so much better than it was on the first Kindle Fire, I don't need to use headphones or strain to hear at times.-HD quality is nice and the images are clear and sharp.-X Ray feature is great watching a movie and wanting to learn more.-It has a camera that works with some free apps-Free time will be great when my nieces and nephews come for a visit.-Ad's are built in to the opening screen, so they disappear when I swipe the Kindle Fire open.

I have an iPad and love it. However when I travel the iPad is a little larger then I want to carry on the plane. The kd fire hd 7 was just prefect. Then I thought about the hdmi out. I totally hate that apple makes you buy numerous hdmi adapters for iPod classic, and iPad and I just refuse to buy another one. The kd fire hd 7 again was beautiful. The hdmi out was outstanding, or at least I thought. It puts out a 720p. The kindle fire hd 8.9 puts out 1080p. I have a 60inch tv and it makes for a big difference. That fact sold me into buying the 8.9. I'm so glad I went to the 8.9, yes sold my 7 on amazon and took a $49 loss.  Just love the picture resolution. Books, magazines, tv/movies just look better. Don't think you can go wrong with this unless you're looking for a notebook. Great job amazon. Too, like most people I was surprised and extremely happy to get the kindle 8.9 prior to the Thanksgiving vacation trip.  One last note, the kindle deluxe is also a wonderful ereader for those looking for a larger screen, however, pretty costly but worth it. Update- about to get the otterbox. Not happy with the price but otterbox usually have the best covers period!  update- 1-17-13 I have had the opportunity to download videos and the standard video's look horrible on here while they look like High Def on the iPad.  this made me take away two stars. when I say iPad,I mean the 1st edition not the retina version.

Had thought about writing the entire review with this device, but the more I get into it, don't think that I can do it justice this way, so I'll just make my notes here as I go, then save them to the Amazon Cloud.Of the four different Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" models available at the time of this review, I picked the one that would best fit my personal needs. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB was chosen based on prior experience with the first generation Kindle Fire, as I had found no problems whatsoever with Wi-Fi in my area, either in the home or within the establishments that I visit. Picked the model that includes special offers, as personally they don't bother me a bit.Breaking this down into sections, I'll offer a subjective overview of what's good and not so good, followed by more details.Likes:+ Excellent display; very easy on the eyes, good access to Amazon and to the `Net+ High resolution; 1920x1200 HD display, rich color from all viewing angles+ Strong Wi-Fi connectivity; dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi, fast downloads & video streaming+ Exceptional sound quality; offers true Dolby Surround Sound+ Long battery life; over 10 hours average, measured and confirmed+ No setup needed; ready to go and runs right out of the box+ Built-in micro HDMI port; allows for 1080P to be streamed to the TV+ Prime Instant Videos; unlimited, and so many from which to pick+ Excellent product feel; very solid and comfortable to the hand+ 16GB storage; about 12.7GB available to the user, more on the Cloud+ Good clean styling; minimalist, yet highly functionalDislikes:- No charging indicator light/LED as on 1st generation Kindle Fire- No charger; it could have been factored into the base priceFirst Impressions:Amazon isn't kidding when they offer fast delivery on the new Kindle Fire models. Mine was received within 36 hours from time of ordering, and the minimalist packaging is quite good, with the USB cable stowed in the box lid. Ordered it with the charger, though I already had one from earlier, and immediately charged it even though it comes partially charged. Setup is minimal, making it all so easy. Once it was fully charged, took it online and immediately installed the Battery HD Pro app and ran the full calibration routine as suggested, just as I had done last summer with the original Kindle Fire; this one is highly recommended.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" came preloaded with content already purchased before. The Home screen offers a search bar at the top, with additional groupings below: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, etc. Additional groupings will show up when it's held in landscape mode. Below these there's a carousel of recently viewed material, be it a book, app, web page, movie, etc.Exploring the new Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, it was apparent that this unit is no simple upgrade over the original. The larger 1920x1200 HD display is clearly sharper, compared to 1024 x 600 on my original 7-inch Kindle Fire, and the reduced screen glare is immediately apparent, probably due to its built-in polarizing filter. The colors were deeper and more intense, with darker blacks and even at varied viewing angles. The 1920\u00d71200 HD also helps make text crisp and sharp, and reading books and magazines is a pleasure.The real test came when I tried uploading some ultra-sharp high resolution JPG photos, and was quite pleased at how well they were rendered on the screen. The display on this Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is rated at a very dense 254 pixels per inch (ppi), making it excellent with the 300 & 600 ppi photos that I had uploaded. Tried a few HD videos as well, and the more vivid colors and deeper blacks were apparent, again even at different viewing angles, a step up from my original Kindle Fire.Hardware:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" has a good look and feel. It's actually quite a minimalist device, and is easy to hold even without a case. Measuring slightly less than 9\u00bd x 6\u00bd inches and only 0.35 inch thick, it has beveled edges, which make it feel even thinner. Weighing in at 20 ounces, it has a solid feel, and the screen surface feels quite robust. Some sources have noted that the screen is made from Gorilla Glass, which may account for the solid feel, but that remains to be verified. The power button is a simple pushbutton, which is nearly flush with the device; no snags here.Wi-Fi Connectivity:As noted earlier, I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that is equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity because of earlier experiences with the original Kindle Fire. What I found with this new one was surprising. The product description claims that it offers \"over 40% faster speeds\" due to the dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. Where I live there's plenty of connectivity, but it can dip or stutter now and then. This newer Kindle Fire HD is said to be able to switch automatically between the more congested 2.4 GHz and less congested 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequencies, and I've experienced a longer range and faster overall speed, so it works.Processor & Storage:I never had issues with the performance of the original, but this Kindle Fire HD really does perform faster.  It's probably the combination between its newer dual-core 1.5 GHz TI OMAP4 4470 processor and the improved Imagination SGX544 3D graphics core, but there's a noticeable difference, both in speed and graphics rendering. Videos are smoother and far snappier. As far as storage goes, I picked the 16 GB version as I do not accumulate as much as others. Most of the items stored here are books, magazines, photos, some videos and MP3 music files. The Amazon Cloud is where much of my content is kept, and after a book is read, it goes back there for storage so that it can be pulled when need. Keeps things simple and accessible over multiple devices.Web Browsing:The newest version of Amazon Silk works well on this device and offers faster page loads than previous versions. But one of the first things that I did was to switch the default search to Google. It's a personal thing, easy to do, and it allows me to search just as I would on my Windows PCs and on my MacBook Pro. It's fast, easy, familiar and far less hassle that way. Luckily this Kindle Fire HD makes it easy to do in the settings, and it just takes a few seconds of exploring to do it.There is Facebook integration as well, and you can import your photos from Facebook to your Amazon Cloud Drive and view them there, along with any other photos you may already have placed in your Cloud Drive. But a word of caution here: if importing your images directly from Facebook, you're cannot specify which photos you want to import; you'll end up importing them all. Just be aware of this before you start.Email & Address Book:Email setup was a breeze. I use Gmail as my primary, and it was set up and configured within seconds. Once that was setup, the Gmail address book was simple and smooth, and no problems encountered. The larger screen on this device makes it a breeze to access Gmail, read messages and to reply to them.Accessing Apps:There are a number of apps that I use from Amazon's Appstore for Android, and was most curious to see how these would function on the new device. There's a \"Compatibility with your devices\" checkbox in the upper right of each app, and if it's designed to function on the Kindle Fire HD, there's a green checkbox. Most of the apps that I use have to do with news, travel, photo imaging, word processing, music and utilities. There are a few that won't work on the new device, yet with all of the choices in the Appstore, have yet to find a number of apps to fit my needs. Many of them offer a test drive so that you can decide if it works for you.I'm the wrong one to comment on game performance, as there are very few that I've even tried. The few that I've installed to see what the experience was like seemed to perform well, but not being a gamer, my opinions would be almost worthless.In the Clouds:I've found the Amazon Cloud Drive to be invaluable for storage, and quite easy to use as my freebie backup for books, magazines and apps. But it can also be used to back up documents, photos, videos and other digital files. This review was initially stored on the Amazon Cloud when it was being written, and from there downloaded to my PC for final edits. There's a free desktop app that one can download for access and connection to the Amazon Cloud that makes life easy, and it works well.But my main cloud storage for general use on my PCs and MacBook Pro is the Google Drive, and I looked for an app to install it, but it didn't exist in the Amazon Appstore. There are workarounds, but I hate wasting time hacking apps and interfaces, so I dug deeper... and it was there, in my Gmail settings, along with my address book and the Google+ access. Simple, no hassles, and it works.Sound Quality:Didn't know how well the tiny stereo speakers would work on this version of the Kindle Fire HD would work, but it's said to offer Dolby Digital Plus, and that they were tuned to better reproduce low, bass notes, and without distortion. So I tested it using a particular track that I've used before: Strauss: Introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, also known as the Theme from 2001, A Space Odyssey. This particular pure digital (DDD) track has the full dynamics that can bring your speakers to their knees. Without getting too deep here, the opening ultra low notes could be heard, and the kittle drums were surprisingly clear.This also held up quite well with a couple more music tracks, some films and videos that I watched. Distortion is truly minimal, and there is a slightly different though quite good sound when headphones or external speakers are plugged in. Over it's quite better with stereo sound than anticipated.Bluetooth:Setting up Bluetooth was very easy. I paired it with the Plantronics Voyager Legend headset as an audio alternative and tested it with Skype for future use. No problems encountered, and the audio quality was quite good.Reading Books & Magazines:There's no doubt that the 1920x1200 HD display adds to the enjoyment of reading books and magazines, and the sharper text is very easy on the eyes, especially late at night when one is tired. With the X-Ray for Books feature, you can easily get more info about characters, locations, terms, and historical figures mentioned in a Kindle book, and it also highlights exactly where in the book those details are mentioned, allowing you the ability to jump right to the appropriate page. It also allows you to get biographies and more from Wikipedia and Shelfari.Gripes/Complaints:There's no such thing as a perfect product, and in that this Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" isn't alone. My older 1st generation Kindle Fire has a charging indicator LED built into the power button, and I was surprised to see the lack of the same on this newer product. Let's just call it an irritant. The other gripe is that there was no charger included as there was with the original Kindle Fire, and a decent charger is essential for this device. As of this writing you can get the Amazon Kindle PowerFast charger for about half price, but only if it's ordered at the same time as the Kindle Fire HD, so if you're considering one of these, be sure to order it at the same time.Accessories & Cases:Though the device offers a 10-point multi-touch interface, which is quite good and far superior to the earlier interface from the original Kindle Fire, I've reverted to old habits and use a amPen New Hybrid Stylus for most applications. This one is quite responsive on the screen, and for some of us it's a faster way of working.Also picked up the Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" based on past experience with a smaller one for the original Kindle Fire. This is a solid 4-star product, but the more costly Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", which is made from genuine leather lined with soft microfiber interior, may be a better and more functional choice for many. These are just two among the many to be found here; the choices are yours.Summary:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a solid product, easily worthy of a +4.5 star rating, considering the minor complaints that I've noted above. It has proven to be subjectively the perfect choice for my needs, though yours may vary, and the 4G versions may better suit your needs. The Wi-Fi performance has showed itself to be better than expected, the navigation is quicker than earlier versions, and the higher-resolution screen does a better job displaying menu options. To date I've had no crashed or lockups. It's currently largest tablet Amazon makes at the moment, and it gives you access to all of your Amazon content in high definition. As a multimedia device it has proven to be quite good, and considering how vast Amazon's content offerings are, especially if you're a Prime member, this is probably one of the best media consumption tablets on the market today, and certainly one of the most affordable in its class.12/23/2012", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Big Improvement Over the First Generation Fire", "Author": "R. Angeloni \"slicktiger28\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZ1BGWMISB7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the owner of a first generation Kindle Fire, I was looking forward to a new version of the Fire and preordered the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  I have been using the device for close to a week and so far have been very pleased. This version of the Fire is a big step up over the first generation 7\" Fire, and with key improvements in screen resolution, Bluetooth, sound and even user interface.Screen ResolutionThe HD display is super sharp and vibrant, and this version of the Fire has a polarizing filter and anti-glare technology, to help improve readability at any angle and in direct light situations. E-ink technology (the technology used in the Kindle and other e-readers) will remain the ultimate when it comes to reading outdoors, but the screen resolution of the HD 8.9\" for reading is leaps and bounds better than the first generation Fire, and HD movies and television shows are super clear and vibrant.BluetoothBluetooth is important to me, as I have a number of Bluetooth speakers and like good sound for my movies and music. Setup takes a few seconds. The HD 8.9\" also has Dolby audio and dual stereo speakers if you do not have Bluetooth speakers. While not exactly booming, the sound these speakers produce is much deeper, clearer, and louder than the two speakers included in the first gen Fire.User InterfaceLike the first generation Fire, the HD 8.9\" has a customized Android operating system. For the new Fire, Amazon used Ice Cream Sandwich, Android 4.0. Set-up is extremely easy. The Fire arrives personalized and pre-registered, so as soon as you turn on the device, it immediately walks you through set-up, finds your router/WiFi, and downloads your books and apps.  The most time-consuming part of set-up was downloading the latest software. The user interface also includes a recommendation engine on the home screen, to find similar material. You can also turn this feature off. My device has offers on it, and I don't really find it obtrusive, as they only appear on the lock screen.  The user interface is very intuitive.  Web browsing is fast, and I like the \"Reading View\" feature, which removes unnecessary images or information on a Web site and lets you read or see what you want to see. I also like the \"Trending Now\" feature, which alerts you to Web sites that have a high amount of traffic. X-Ray technology also allows you to do a \"deeper dive\" and to find out more about actors, a scene in a movie or book, etc.SizeContrary to what they say, size is important, especially for tablets. The HD 8.9\" is light and thin, so I am able to hold it and use it with one hand. Swiping makes it easy to move from one page or Web site to another.Other Things to ConsiderIf you like or are connected to the Amazon ecosystem, and have Amazon Prime membership, then the HD 8.9\" is a perfectly designed media consumption device. With access to literally thousands of free movies, television shows, and even books, the Kindle works hard at keeping you easily connected to all of Amazon's content. Of course, if you want to buy something, the Kindle also works hard at making it easy for you to make purchases. The Amazon app store offers thousands of apps, but not as many as the Google Play store or iTunes.Also, text inputting is fine for e-mail or other simple Web applications, but until Amazon or some third party developers come out with a free-standing keyboard, I wouldn't attempt to write a doctoral dissertation or the Great American Novel on this device. E-mail set up for numerous accounts is easy, and this version of the Fire also integrates with Microsoft Outlook Exchange.Overall, I am very pleased with the Kindle HD 8.9\". If you don't mind the fact that the Kindle is totally tied to the Amazon ecosystem, it is a fun and easy-to-use personal entertainment device that is priced considerably less than the competition.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet option...", "Author": "Xurumela", "ReviewID": "R3QU51NE3O98P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire HD with the expectation it would be just a barebones tablet that I could carry anywhere and also eventually replace my notebook at home for day to day web surfing.  Heck, for 299 and a 8.9\" screen it was a no brainer to me.  I initially looked at the very same 7\" model and Nexus tablet, but the screen was just too small and it did not feel \"right\" on the hands.  Being the past owner of an iPad 2 that got destroyed by my kids I went back shopping for a replacement.  The iPad 3 was just too heavy and wayyy too expensive for the kind of use it will have.  Plus, add the kids to the picture, I was not planning on spending over 500 bucks on something that would end up rolling around the house and taking the risk of being destroyed...again...So I took the gamble and went with the 8.9\" HD.  And after only a few days, how surprised I am...Now, I was always a big fan of Amazon, customer service is something I'd pay for and when you get the best price and great customer service all I can tell you is you got my business forever.  With PRIME, this device is a full entertainment powerhouse, I have movies and games for the kids, music on the cloud, books for the wife, a great browser and an unexpected amazing screen.  Watching movies on it is just great, listening to music another big surprise: the speakers are just fantastic...I did not get into the 'dolby' thing, as I thought it would just not make a difference on a small device, but the sound in LOUD and clear.  As for the camera, I understand other reviews mentioning the lack of rear facing camera as a problem...but honestly, I had an iPad for 2 years and NEVER used the rear facing camera.  You simply will not...I do Skype and that is the only need for a camera in a tablet in my opinion (again, different users might disagree).  As for the charger (or lack of), I have at least 5 in my house (cell phones, iPad, iPod, etc, etc).  I just plug my cell phone one on it and done, not a big deal.  And if you are a PRIME subscriber, this device is a NO BRAINER.  Get one !  If not, it is still a great take-along carry-around-the-house gadget, very well built, slim and light.  Screen is very responsive, haven't seen any lag in the Amazon ecosystem Android wrap and the browser is faster than I remember my iPad being.  Maybe I am just overjoyed with the fact I spent so little with no great expectations and got this pleasant surprise.  I do have one complaint (so far): the power and volume buttons are hard to find and to a certain point frustrating...I saw that in the 7\" and was hoping it would be better in the larger form factor but it is still something that needs improvement (Amazon, are you listening ?).  About the ads...really ? I just skip them, so no problem for me.  They are not intrusive as you my think, not at all.

First is the web browser.  It crashed so much, I downloaded an other one (opera - and you'll have to allow non-amazon store apps in the Kindle settings to get any other browser - had to do that for dropbox and some other apps amazon doesn't like...).Email is a disaster.  After setting up about 10 accounts, they worked only for one day (sends but does not receive...).  This has been a known issue for several months but amazon has done nothing to address it.  Your only option is to get another app (K9 - free - is what I got).  There's no problem with \"canned\" email settings - but all mine were \"other providers\" (godaddy and other POP accounts including my business email!).Another issue is the battery life. You  must have to turn it off to conserve power as standby  still eats up the battery life (and this is with no automatic email downloads...).On the plus side, the integration with amazon cloud services (storage and music) is very good and was one of the reasons I gave up my iPad for a Kindle.  Just a note on opening docs - best to have a document app installed as the native doc viewer is really slow for some types.All in all, after spending way too long setting things up, I'm okay with it.

I liked the Kindle from the onset and they just keep getting better and better.There is no reason to go over the features because several others here have done an excellent job of that.  I will simply tell you that there is not much to criticize with this product.  Amazon has really done a great job and at a great price.  I am in a position to help others who are confused with computers or tablets.  I've spent time with many of  the other brands but, I will state loud and clear that I love this Kindle compared to many others.I did read the negative reviews here and some if not all made me chuckle.  No, there is no instruction booklet to read, it is all on the Kindle itself and it is not difficult to find.  The negative reviews made me wonder if any research or product reading was done before they ordered their Kindles.  The objections and dislikes I saw are all a matter of using the Kindle or going online and looking for the answers.  The Kindle forum here on Amazon is a wonderful place to visit and get help or good advice.Five stars plus is my vote.  If I had a wish for just one thing it would be to have a little mark on the screen where the on/off button is.  I agree it's not easy to find even though it is dead middle of the case but very imbedded.  I never turn my other Kindles off by mistake but I did manage to do it twice with this one.  Perhaps when my case/cover arrives that will be put to rest.  Heck, maybe that's what Amazon had in mind?  Most of the new covers turn the Kindle on and off automatically.

Excellent screen, Dolby stereo sound that is second to none. Perfect size for reading. And the price!  You get so much more for your money than an Ipad!  Once you install google market on this, the apps are endless.  A lot of people complain of the limitations of this tablet, like the limited app store.  But there are workarounds that will open up the potential for this tablet.  For example, after installing google play market on this, I've got all my google apps (gmail, maps, google+, youtube), and numerous other apps running on this bad boy.  In researching for a tablet, I was looking at many different tablets including all the android tablets (7inch and 10 inch).  I ultimately decided on the 8.9 because of its perfect size for reading, in particular books, textbooks, and medical journal articles.  Highly recommend this tablet if you like to read and use Amazon services.Update: I just wanted to address some of the common complaints I see in other reviews.1. Lack of Flash Player: News flash! ALL ICS android devices do not support Flash.  It has essentially been discontinued by Adobe. Ipad never had flash. If you want Flash, install Dolphin Browser and the Flash apk.2. Lack of Android Apps:  You have two options here.  1. Sideload the Apps: Just install whatever app you want from apk file (don't have to root)  or  2. Google Play market: If you want access to all the Android apps, then you need to install the Google Play Market. It may be possible without rooting it but I haven't tried it myself (I rooted mines).3. Ads - they just appear on your lockscreen and no where else. It's not a big deal.4. No AC charger - You can use any of your micro-USB AC chargers from your other devices (ie tablets, phones).  It's a standard universal micro-usb charging port. If you don't have any, they are cheap and only a few bucks to buy.Final words:  If you want an ipad, just buy an Ipad! This is first and foremost an E-reader tablet, that is meant to be used in Amazon's ecosystem.  This is a great deal at $299 ($200 less than the cheapest Ipad 4) and with some workarounds, you can turn this into a full-blown tablet that can rival any Ipad experience.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very slow, and bad Amazon service", "Author": "Shawn W", "ReviewID": "R2B3XS5XQ72SYZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased one at $249 during Amazon's promotion. I got it two days ago and I'm not extremely disappointed with the product and Amazon's customer service.Pros:+ Really nice screen, and it feels nice to touch. Nook HD+ has better viewing experience but Fire HD+ has much better touch experience.+ Can watch Amazon prime.+ Loud speakers+ Content viewing is supposed to be good, but my unit is super slow.Cons:+ Very slow, laggy - I will talk about this in detail later+ Speakers are rear facing so you can't watch a video in bed properly.+ Hard edges hurt my palms+ Locked Android so you need to root it and run Google apps and have full Android experience.+ Can only support one account.+ Silk browser is slow and all you are viewing will be recorded by Amazon for Ads targeting.+ Input is poor. I wish I could install other input methods in android.So let's talk about its slowness. It's slow in almost all aspects. Book reading, web browsing, Video watching, app running (e.g. flipboard). When I read a book, page flipping has 1-2 s delay. It even feels slower than my paperwhite! Web browsing is slow but I guess it's because Silk redirected your URL to Amazon server first. The most important thing is bad video experience because Amazon prime is the only reason I bought this tablet on top of my other Android tablets. I tried 3 TVs/movies, all of them froze at about 5 min into the play. It's only the graphic that is frozen. Sound is still going on.I'd imagine this is a defective device as how can a new Android device with 1.5G duo core CPU be this poor? Even Nexus 7 can do better. So I contacted Amazon for a replacement. The first one ask me to restart the device, and I told her that I had already done that. Then she asked me to factory reset, and wait for 48 hours to see!!! I'm an IT expert and I know this is bulls***. It was late at night so I didn't spend much time carrying on the chat. The second day, I called again. Amazon customer service is just pushing me around, from this department to another. They put me on hold for more than 20 minutes to transfer to amazon instant video team, can you believe that?! I got a defective device, you should just fix it for me. I have no time to help your team debugging devices.Anyway, I thought the above is my unit's problem so I'd have given it a higher rating, but according to Amazon's response, they don't think it's a defective device. Wow, if Fire HD+ is like this, it doesn't even worth $100 to me. What's use of it if you can't watch HD TV and read a book smoothly? My old Galaxy Tab 10.1 is even better than it. I'm so angry with the whole experience. Even if I bought it from Best Buy, I could get a replacement easily by telling them that I'm not satisfied. I thought Amazon is good at customer service but they just tried to push me to another team and wasted my time.

Some of the negative reviews are beyond comprehension and just plain silly, but with some merit. I now own the 8.9\" Fire HD and my wife has the 7\" Fire HD. She finds the smaller unit a better fit for her purse, since I don't carry a purse, the larger unit is perfect for me. It also is a bit smaller than the 10\" tablets and perhaps the ideal size for those wanting both an e reader and a good internet tablet. We are both extremely happy with our purchases. With my HD I have easily been able to connect with the apps I use either through the Kindle store or directly through the web. Email connection with my Comcast account took 30 seconds to activate on the Kindle. It was easy to sync with my Google calendar and IGoogle and I had no problem sending documents from my PC to the Amazon cloud. For example, I uploaded the digital manual for my new mini cooper to the Amazon Cloud and opened it up on my KIndle - easier to read and find things than on the print version. I have had absolutely no problem with wifi connection, speed has been way beyond adequate, and of course the screen is beautiful. As an e reader, pages are clear, crisp, and page changing is fast. I'm very pleased with our purchases,snd also, I appreciate the reasonable pricing on these machines.As for the criticisms posted on this review site, yes I would have liked an included charger; the lack of flash has not interfered with any of my tasks; having an external charging light would have been nice, but I will survive; my fingers very easily find the power and volume buttons; why would I want to use a 9\" tablet to take photos; maybe Amazon could have included a bit more written documentation, but all you could ever want is in the Kindle itself or on the web support pages. I got rid of the \"other buyers have recommended scroll\" through the updated software; the other ad thing on the lock screen is on my soon to be deleted list for 15 bucks, but isn't as annoying as some people claim (except for Mickey Mouse appearing several times); delivery of both Kindles was before the expected delivery date.If you want more bells and whistles, need to have access to every app in the universe, need every device you own to be capable of taking pictures, can't live without a blinking charge light, and prefer written documentation, the Kindle Fire HD may not be for you.

I have used this tablet everyday since I bought it 2.6 years ago. It continues to serve me very well. It is a simple, elegant, and well created device. From the very beginning, the first app I acquired was the Kindle app. I have read many books on this Kindle app. About a year and half ago, Apple and Amazon changed the terms of use and acquisition within the Kindle app. You could no longer purchase a book from the app. You had to go to Amazon.com to buy a book and it would then synch to the app. I did not have a problem with this change but it did throw an extra step into my book purchasing process. It was not enough of a bother to abandon my iPad and get the Kindle hardware.When Amazon announced this product back in September 2012. I was curious about it. It looked pretty sleek and it had the media buzz about as equal to the release of a new Apple product. I started reading about it all over the internet and @ Amazon.com. So I formulated my rationalization plan on acquiring this new device:1.  The screen had to be as good as my iPad screen.2.  It had to enable me to acquire Amazon product easily-->very interested in Amazon Prime.3.  It would be a back up device for my other tablet with cellular access when wifi not available.I ordered the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) 8.9 4G/32gig tablet on October 26, 2012 and it was delivered on 11/29/2012, one day earlier than Amazon advised. The KFHD arrived by US POST! But it started somewhere in the USA handled by FedEx. The packaging was superb. Too bad you had to rip the package to get into the device, as it makes a beautiful box otherwise.The KFHD had enough power to launch BUT during the set up process, it does advise you to plug it in. **When I ordered this device, I was warned that it did not come with a charger. I don't know how people miss that advise. In Amazon's way, it tells you that people who purchase this item also bought a charger, screen protector, and a cover/case. I'm glad that a charger was not included. I have three chargers for my iPad and I can use these chargers to plug in the KFHD's cable. Good idea Amazon-->one less device to throw away or store somewhere.The set up process was really easy. The KFHD already recognized me!! And it stepped me through the process of connecting to my home WiFi. Right after that process completed, the KFHD stepped me through the process of signing up for the 250MG/12 month introductory 4GLTE AT&T; cellular data.  ***A lot of negative comments about this cellular data is unwarranted, IMHO. AT&T; is a reputable company, the set up process to access their network was very simple. Why people had problems filling out what is in essence an application form that consisted of Name, Address/City/State/Zipcode, email address and credit card is beyond me.I am speculating that since AT&T; has been the cellular provider in past iterations of the Kindle, adding other cellular data providers would probably require hardware changes as well. For example, AT&T; and Verizon do not use the same cellular technology. Giving a poor review to the KFHD because you cannot choose your cellular data provider is like going to a bread store and demanding to buy meat. For you iPad owners, we now have a choice of buying a branded AT&T; or Verizon or Sprint iPads. Amazon would need to do the same if they were inclined to spend time to negotiate similar deals with other providers.Now, onto the device itself. The screen resolution is really good. It almost compares to the Retina screen on the iPad (3/4th generation). I can see a difference between the KFHD screen and the iPad but if I didn't have the ability to compare it would be very difficult. The KFHD's home page is easy to navigate and to scroll through every thing I have accessed on it. I have to double tap on my iPad to do the same thing. I like having my iPad apps in folders, but I can grow to like the simplicity of the KFHD's presentation.I am a little bit puzzled about aquiring apps outside of Amazon. Apparently you have to go into settings to enable this function. And then you have to go to Google+ Play to get other apps not in the Amazon app store.Amazon's browser is different. You can access other websites but the speed of acquiring those websites seems a lot slower. But faster on the KFHD than an iPad. If you want to go backwards on the screen you are reading, the back button is on the side and not embedded in the window.There is a star icon that if you press it, gives you a list of favorite apps that you can launch without going to the home screen.The sound is certainly a lot richer than the monotone iPad. I watched a 15 minute segment of a movie on the KFHD, picture and sound was very realistic. I can get the same sense on my iPad but I have to plug in earphones to the iPad.The KFHD form factor, its size and weight, is easier to hold over a longer period of time than doing the same function on my iPad.In summary, the KFHD is a very good device to acquire and use Amazon Kindle products. It is certainly a lot more reasonably priced than comparable iPad products. The 4G cellular data is a bargain compared to the the US$14.95 250 mg per month AT&T; subscription on the iPad. I hope this 'introductory offer' will continue for as long as I own this device. The screen and stereo sound are attractive. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a tablet to read books, watch TV/Movies, and browse websites. This has met all my requirements. I cannot rate it a five star device because there is no technology available that would merit such praise.

Here's an update that I have to post:IF YOU USE FACEBOOK A LOT, DON'T GET A KINDLE FIRE HD. There is a major issue which at this time seems unresolved.  The Kindle Fire HD will only allow a few recent news feeds to be displayed (like maybe 15 to 20).  The last few will be displayed shaded in blue and you can't load any more of them.  So if you want to scroll down to something that you saw an hour or so ago, forget it.  The only work around that I found was to change the user agent to \"desktop\" instead of \"android\" in settings, but that makes some posts with pictures too big to view. One suggestion from an Amazon moderator on the Kindle Fire User's Forum was for us users to contact Facebook and make them aware of the problem.  It seems to me that Amazon ought to be the one to take such an initiative, since it is Amazon's modification of the Android platform that has probably caused the problem.UPDATE OF UPDATE (2/2012): The Facebook issue is resolved in the both the Facebook App and the Facebook site within Dolphin Browser on my Kindle HD.

Silk tends to crash at least hourly (frequently more often). It's constantly saying whatever page I'm on has stopped responding and would I like the page restored. How could the developers have missed that? Why is there no word about an intent to remedy this constant failure of a basic web browser. Since I bought this for entertainment, I'm feeling less entertained and more annoyed.The typing feature is glitchy.  It frequently misses the first letter typed while compensating you for this problem by giving you double of the next letter you type.

So, for me to recommend this is a definite leap of faith. :)There are plenty of excellent in-depth reviews so I will not rehash them.  Suffice it to say that Amazon did a great job with this device and I am more than pleased with it.The screen is beautiful, the sound is very nice and loud, it performs very well, and the interface is much improved over the previous generation Fire, which we also owned and liked.  This is truly much closer to the iPad in terms of functionality and performance in my opinion.  And once you factor in pricing?  I have no idea what, after reading up on the iPad, what it could possibly do to warrant the price premium, I honestly don't.  And please don't think that I'm just simply bashing Apple, because we own various iPod variants and an iPhone 5.  Android devices do outnumber Apple devices in our house, but Apple is still represented and I have to say, the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a definite winner.  If we had the resources there'd be one under the xmas tree of all of our relatives this year. :)To quickly address reading (what Kindle was originally all about!!) I still prefer an e-ink version to read on, and currently I'm using the Kindle Paperwhite and I absolutely love the screen, it is simply amazing.  The light is there when you need/want it and it is a joy to read on, no eye fatigue (at least no more than reading a paper book).  Reading on the Kindle Fire is nice though, the dictionary is exceptionally quick and the responsiveness of the Fire will always be quicker than that of its e-ink siblings, but that's just the nature of the involved technology, not a knock to e-ink, just a kudos to the Fire for being a fast device.  It is definitely nice to read on and I have, all I'm saying is that for lengthy periods of reading I prefer the e-ink, but there's nothing wrong with the experience on a Fire.And just to quickly address the griping about a charger not being included with the device: Amazon is leading the way with this.  How many devices do you own that use a micro-USB charger?  Quite a few I'd imagine.  Why on earth should Amazon add to the per-unit cost by including something that isn't 'truly' necessary nowadays?  I'm very happy to pay a little bit less for something than to have yet another charger laying around.  Yes, it does charge faster with a somewhat non-traditional charging rate of 1.8A, but still, I am all for overall reduced costs and a 'greener' product.  And I think that they make it quite clear that the charger is not included, so for those that complain about it, well, they probably complain about a lot of stuff in life if they pay that little attention to things - everything is everyone else's fault, not theirs, lol.Good luck and please, if you're thinking about it, take the plunge, you'll love your device.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed- Don't buy if you have large PDF format books", "Author": "Nick S \"Nick S\"", "ReviewID": "R25FOOG1B0RT90", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Cons:I'm a medical doctor, and I bought the Kindle Fire because I was planning on using it to download my PDF format medical books. Although I am able to view the books, I'm unable to search or highlight the books. It's pointless to have a 500-1000 page reference that you can't search. The only way to get these options is to email the file to an Amazon email that they create for you. It will convert the file to the Kindle format for an outrageous fee per Megabit (~$.99) if it is under 50MB. If its more than 50MB you're shit out of luck.I have literally spent the whole day and night, researching this and talking to customer service by email and on the phone just to end up feeling frustrated and disappointed. I had to explain the same thing 3-5 times over to the customer service rep, there was some kind of language barrier with this foreign based help I received.I've wasted my time and money on this device for the purpose I bought it for. The whole thing is set up to keep pumping money into Amazon by forcing you to pay money for every little thing.They want you to buy a yearly subscription to Amazon Prime and then they say you get to watch free movies, get to share books, and get free two day shipping...how is it free if you're paying a yearly subscription???Also, I initially had problems with the Netflix and Pandora apps. It said they were downloaded but they didn't show up in my Apps folder. So I tried re-downloading them and it wouldn't let me because it said they were already downloaded. I emailed customer service multiple times giving them the specifics of my problem and they kept sending me the same generic email that didn't help at all.This device would be nice if you were only planning and buying everything you downloaded through Amazon.

I am so disappointed I could cry.-) The battery will not hold a charge - one hour Max. I need to sit where there is an electrical outlet so I can plug in. It was plugged in overnight and did not fully charge.-) With the 7\" I could scroll through dozens and dozens of posts on Facebook. With the 8.9\" it will load what you first see on the screen, if you try to scroll you get the little circular icon that just continues to search. I have waited for 15 minutes and it never goes further even though I have 5 bars on the internet strength. By then the battery is drained from constant search. I give up and get out the 7\" Fire.-) Touch screen is unresponsive. I have to keep an eye on what I type - I have 2 problems there. First, when I type many times the letters do not appear as typed and I may have to hit the key several times before the letter will appear. Second, The space bar when typing does not put in spaces. I will look up at screen and see just a mass of letters. I will have to scan the typed mass and attempt to put the curser at the appropriate place and hit the space bar until a space is added.I had read the reviews and felt the 8.9\" had all the features and size I wanted. I come to the conculsion that I just got a lemon and will be returning it and looking at another brand of tablet. With this sad piece of electronics Amazon has lost one customer. How could they have gone from such a nice tablet as the 7\" is to a piece of junk that I received in this 8.9\" model? HD is fine if you just want to read your e-mail or view photos but that is not what I wanted this tablet for. I was hoping to get what it appears that most of reviews received. That is not what I received. I am taking my 7\" Fire off the eBay listing and using it until I can get a better tablet at my local electronic store.I would not recommend this tablet to anybody.

There are just no breaks or pauses.Another thing I've noticed is that this FHD model doesn't 'hang' like the older Fire did between tasks or websites. The new processor must have fixed these bugs.The interface is only slightly different from the original Fire and probably won't take me more than a couple hours to get used to. The scrolling images seem to have a bit more flare on the larger screen, but I've always prefered them over other interfaces like my daughters Nook.  I've noticed a star for accessing favorites in the lower right hand corner of the screen which I find very handy.  And the device tools are now a pull down....ok, that works.  Please Note!  If you buy this with 'Special Offers', you are forced to endure advertisements when you first turn it on, but it's $15 lower in price over a similar unit without 'Special Offers'.  Wow did I get tired of those ads real quick.  Not to worry....I was able to turn them off.....by paying the extra $15 difference in price! (you can do this after registration).I have played around a little with the built in camera, but from what I've seen, the resolution is low.  Skype is a nice feature but I haven't had an opportunity to try it out.So in short, they seem to have fixed all the shortcomings I found in the first standard Fire, improved the useability alot, and added some interesting features. I find this pad much more pleasurable to use and a worthy upgrade. I've handed my Fire over to someone non-techy but very near and dear and she is very happy...I'm mean, she got it for free so why wouldn't she be?

Hill", "ReviewID": "R1WFNA5GMLG5O6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This larger Fire is exactly what I was looking for.  It fulfills ALL the needs I had for a tablet device - by which I am saying, make sure you KNOW what you need!I purchased the Gen1 Fire last year about a day after it was released.  I have used that one for a multitude of tasks - reading, watching video content, staying connected to email (and replying, but not generating new emails), and most of all as a \"replacement\" for paper documents I generated for use in teaching and preaching.  This was the MAIN use of my Gen1 Fire...but the screen was just too small.Thus - when the 8.9\" was released, I ordered within 5 minutes of it posting on Amazon!  Wasn't going to wait this time - went with one day shipping too!  Then the wait...and the early receipt - that rocked!  I received my new Fire (hence named Dad's Bonfire to differentiate from the Gen1) about a week earlier than I anticipated, and immediately put it to work!  It was exactly as I expected - no disappointments.- Large, clear screen - allows me to create documents on desktop in 12point type, on a modified page (9.5\" x 5.5\" custom page size) that fits the width of the screen perfectly.  I save these documents in PDF format to \"fix\" the pages and limit reformatting.  At 12point, with this size screen, my lessons and sermons are perfectly sized to see from a lecturn or pulpit as I teach.- Apps - as I am not into a lot of games (ok...Angry Birds...who isn't) - the apps I already had for the Gen1 also worked on my Bonfire.  The \"paid\" apps (those I didn't grab for free in the past year) all transported as well - Calengoo, Evernote, Whiteboard, EasyPrint, Pulse, K-9 Mail, OfficesuitePro, Sketchbook Mobile, Proclaim Remote, Logos - all worked with no modifications on the new Bonfire.  Because the 8.9\" uses a modified Android 4.1, most open even more functionality.- Carousel - still not a fan...I actually liked the \"Favorites Bookshelf\" from the Gen 1 better.  However, the carousel is smoother now, and more reactive than on the Gen1.  I have not had the problem of earlier reviewers of the carousel \"populating\" with everything.  I am not really a fan of how Favorites are now handled on the 8.9\" - it is as if they are pushing you to use the carousel...it is a neat idea, but not really for me.- Sound - have to say...wow!  Compared to other \"fruit\" models - the dual speaker setup on the Fire is much superior.- HDMI out - I have streamed Amazon content from the Fire to my big screen tv...very nice.- Web - one area that still needs work.  I am not a fan of the Silk browser...am looking at moving to a side-loaded app...no matter what they say, it is slower than others, and seems to push you towards what THEY want...limited ability to customize the \"starter\" page - you get your most visited, then two rows - trending now, and selected sites - both selected, apparently, by Amazon...not for me.- Books - there are some really cool options now - like 2 column reading, x-ray, so on.  The pages are not as \"bright\" white as the Gen1 - which at first I didn't like, but now realize it is actually easier to read on!  There is even a \"shadow\" where the crease of the book pages would be - it looks like a \"real\" book!- Auto-Brightness - is outstanding.  I no longer find myself adjusting for reading in bed vs. reading at office vs. using outdoors.  Used for first time yesterday outside (not in direct sunlight, of courst) - and found I had no problem seeing the document I was speaking from.  Outstanding...- Dual-channel - very nice, as I am now using the 5G side of my router, slowing the demand on the 2.4 side for all the other devices at home!- Colors, Resolution, Screen - absolutely beautiful!  What more to say!Folks - for this price - there is nothing out there that does what I WANT to do.  I looked at the fruit - too expensive, especially when you consider the apps I would need.  Nexus - didn't handle documents with the ease that Amazon/Send to Kindle/Fire does!  I have installed the free app from Amazon on all my desktops, which gives you the \"Send to Kindle\" option...sure makes it easy to get a document to my Bonfire!  Two clicks on the document, and zap - there it is on the carousel!  I do not \"create\" much on my Fire - that is what desktops and laptops are for...this is my \"consumption\" device...teaching, preaching, reading, studying, checking email, so on - which is what I would use any tablet for...and the larger format of this Fire is OUTSTANDING for this.  For the money saved vs. other tablets - I have purchased a 7\" Fire for my daughter for Christmas...tell me another place you can get the large size and the mini size for these prices!!!Back to beginning - make sure you know what YOU WANT to do with a tablet - and let that drive your decision.

I finally went with the Fire based mainly on what appeared to be some impressive features for the price as well as the ability to utilize my Amazon Prime membership with the device (The Galaxy Tabs are not supported for some odd reason, yet the Ipads are?).Since there are thousands of reviews, I'm just going to give my TOP 5 pros and cons.The pros so far:1) Setup couldn't have been easier! I love how they had much of the tablet configured with my Prime movies and all my purchased music available, etc. Really well done!2) The tablet feels good in my hand and I love the \"in between\" size of 8.9\" vs. the 10\" I was used to and the 7\" which I tried and was way too small for me.3) The screen is very nice and it has a surprisingly good resolution for watching movies. I will say it's great to finally have a tablet where I can utilize my prime membership.4) The app store has a good selection and downloading is even easier than the Google Play store. Also, it's nice to be able to make a subtle adjustment to the settings on the device so I can still download apps not available on the Amazon store. Amazon does need to beef up their selection of apps though.5) I think the speakers are pretty darn impressive! You can hear the difference between other tablets, it's that striking!The cons so far:1) I know others have said this ad nauseum, but paying extra for a charger that EVERY OTHER manufacturer includes just left a very bad taste in my mouth. I would have preferred they increased the price of the tablet by $10 or $15 bucks if they really couldn't afford to include it for the price they charge.2) Although I'm starting to get used to it (out of necessity), I'm not a fan of the carousel at all. I guess I understand why Amazon decided on a modified Android OS, but it would be nice if there was an option to revert back to the traditional Android look as it is far more user friendly than what Amazon has created. Frankly, it's making me question whether I made the right decision to purchase the Fire.2) Maybe it's just me, but the Amazon web browser is terrible! I don't know if I've seen pages load so slowly since I had an old 486 computer in the 90's! And I have a terrific internet connection at home with a blazing fast router, so I'm pretty sure it's not me. But the Amazon browser showed choppy displays, etc. On some pages, I couldn't even scroll down for 30 seconds to a minute until it loaded. Navigation wasn't good and it's not nearly as customizable as other browsers. Thank goodness I was able to add a third party browser which is working very well (fast and clear, etc.). I know I won't ever use the Amazon browser again unless they have a significant update which corrects all the performance issues.3) As has been stated by most, the power and volume buttons on the side are so flush to the device that they're extremely hard to access. Raising them just a hair would have made a big difference.4) The lack of a micro SD slot is a big miss and again makes me wonder if I made the right decision. I guess I was more than a little surprised at how much space Amazon's OS took up out of the 16GB. I would have gone for the 32GB but for some reason it was not eligible for the student discount, which didn't make much sense to me. On the plus side, I do like that all my Amazon media is stored on the cloud and easily accessible and I have a dropbox account for the rest, but there are times you want to store more on the actual device. And the way the Fire is setup, 16GB doesn't provide much flexibility at all.5) I was very surprised at how poorly downloaded magazines looked on this device. I have a PC World subscription and since they went all digital this past month, the only way for me to read the magazine is by downloading. I would have expected the Fire to be extremely adept at this, but it was quite the contrary. My old Galaxy Tab 2.0 had more clarity and smoother action from page to page. The Fire was extremely choppy and did not display the sharpest picture. In fact, when turning pages the images would distort for at least 5 to 10 seconds on the Fire where that never happened on my other tablets.In conclusion, I really WANT to like the Fire more than I do. Without an Android based option to view Amazon Prime content and all the options which should make this a \"best in class\" device, the execution of several key tablet essentials is inconsistent at best. Maybe there are explanations to the issues I've discovered that Amazon could answer but as of now, I'm not sure as to whether I'll keep this after the 30 day return option period.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "sending Samsung note 10.1 back..will never give up my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD- THE BEST TABLET OUT THERE", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"BBB\"", "ReviewID": "R2QOHTDEXTOIWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Plus Amazon has THE BEST customer service out there...and that can be equally as important as the quality of the device.

I pre-ordered this Kindle the day it was announced in September. I was pleased to receive my new Kindle at least two weeks earlier than advertised.The Kindle arrived in the same black packaging as the Kindle Fire. Easy to open with the side zip. Once out of it's box, the Kindle is sleek, thinner than the i-Pad. It is the same height. Simple directions are found in a side pocket of the inner packaging.The buttons are placed along the upper right side, horizontally. They are flush to the tablet, and for some these buttons seem to be more difficult to find.  Turn the Fire on, swipe the lock key, the tablet asks for your Wi-Fi password, you select your time zone and confirm your account. Very easy compared to many other tablets. Now, the real experience begins. Your apps have been automatically configured from other kindles. There is an amazing array of other apps to choose from. The Kindle brings you through the entire process. You click on next to go from one page to the next in the setup process.One of the best improvements, among many is email. Very easy to set up, the email is crisp and clear.  The Fire HD 8.9 is the version to get. Its larger, higher-resolution screen better facilitates Amazon's still-new Kindle Fire interface, and its faster processor makes for a much smoother and zippier experience.. The tablet's availability in a Wi-Fi-only version ($299 for 16GB, $369 for 32GB) and a 4G LTE Wireless version $499 for 32GB, $599 for 64GB, is superb. Speakers are mounted on either side and the sound is so much better.Streaming films from Netflix or Amazon Prime is the way to go. Crisp, clear vision and the HD sound!

I have the original Kindle Fire and have been happy with it, but the new version addresses most of my gripes with the previous version.

I have download a couple audio books, a music playlist with about 50 songs, all of my magazines, a few books and most of my apps and have about 23 Gb left.  Doesn't sound like a lot, but I was constantly managing the space on my original Kindle Fire and would have never downloaded music or audiobooks, it just took too much space.  The gmail integration is much improved.  I can move e-mails to my gmail folders with the native app and it also syncs to my contacts and gmail calendar.  Ahh, so much nicer.  There is more customization available such as the ability to set the brightness to auto, turn off the last web page showing on the carousel, turn on notifications for applications, and turn off Amazon Home recommendations.  Amazon has learned there lesson well.  Give us an interface that is easy to use, but give us some customization to make it pretty.  The HD screen is very nice.  I plugged the device into my flat screen and the picture and sound were good.  Bluetooth was easy to use and worked with my bluetooth headphones, including forwarding through songs.In fact, I would have rated this five stars if not for the Silk browser.  Don't get me wrong, it gets the job done, but it crashes on the more intesive websites (esp. Adobe).  Also, if Amazon is driving us to the cloud, why can I not store my bookmarks there?

I've had it for about 2 months now and the only way to describe my feeling toward it at this point is buyer's remorse.  I had bought this as a replacement for my original iPad which is no longer supported and it has gotten quite sluggish at pretty much everything.  Initial impressions were good--but it is no iPad--it was also half the cost.  There were annoyances like it just freezing up completely for 30 seconds at a time before resuming what it was doing like nothing happened, but I figured I could live with it for at least a year despite those and it wouldn't have cost me any more than my iPad cost me since I got less than three years worth of useful life out of it.  BUT, two months in I am now getting about 10 minutes worth of use out of a complete charge!  Let me say that again in case you weren't paying attention...10 MINUTES USE FROM A COMPLETE CHARGE!!!  With a full charge I play about 10-20 minutes of Simpsons Tapped out on it (which doesn't take the battery meter down very much) and then leave it until the next day when I get home from work and it ALWAYS says that the battery is dead.  I don't have any notifications turned on so I don't know what it is doing all day that drains the battery--but at this point it is nothing more than a $400 paperweight--yes, I bought the ridiculously expensive cover too.I will unequivocally state that I'd pay twice as much for an iPad.EDIT:So after letting this sit for a day I realized that it wasn't much more than venting and didn't really provide much useful information.  So, here is something a little more useful to add.The display is excellent, though the touch sensor is not the greatest--does not seem to be very accurate or sensitive and suffers from the general lag of the system.  The system is a bit slow to respond to input, but seems to run most things pretty quickly.  I'm not sure what might cause this other than the overhead of Android.Many complain about the lack of the Google Play store, but I don't really see this as that big an issue.  You can side load anything that you download from Google Play on another Android device--it is just not nearly as convenient.The placement of the power button is annoying--I'm constantly accidentally turning it on or turning it off.  (Or at least I did when I was using it more.)Web browsing is one of the major things I had planned on using it for.  Web browsing is not a joy.  I don't remember specifics but after about a week I gave up on it for that purpose and went back to my iPad.One thing that I found extremely annoying is when I had the notifications turned on it would take me to the Amazon App Store when I told it to clear the notifications.  I'd think that would only happen if I tapped on a specific notification that was an advertisement.I also purchased the HDMI cable for it and was disappointed in the output of it.  It wasn't horrible, but not something I would use without a specific need to.The micro-USB charging port is HORRIBLE!  If you don't get the cable plugged in just right it will not charge at all--and it makes the device extremely hot to boot.  Always check to make sure you have a charging indicator when you plug in the cable.The extremely expensive case also disappointed me.  It does not fit tight enough and I've accidentally pulled it off several times when I've picked it up by the corner.  It also exacerbates the issue with the placement of the power button.I don't use my tablets to watch movies but when I tried that it seemed to work without problems.  I also don't use them to listen to music and I'm pretty sure I didn't even try that so while the sound is pretty good on the things I've used it for I can't really say how it might be for things that are more sound demanding.  Another thing I don't use it for is reading books--I have an e-Ink Kindle for that.  And I've never used the camera on it.One thing that I find annoying about Android in general is the lack of quality apps available.  Sure, the big name apps from the big companies all work well and I don't have complaints about them, but for some things it is really hard finding a decent app.  Luckily the Kindle Fire versions of apps are usually well done so given the choice I select those.Still, the negatives outweigh the positives and I would still be willing to pay twice as much for an iPad.  Were this a $100 device I'd give it a qualified recommendation, but Amazon markets it as an iPad killer, and that it ain't.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "changed rating...and sad about that!!", "Author": "AmazonFan", "ReviewID": "R1UVGKHYDENIBA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my fouth Kindle...yes, you read that right.  I had gotten the original Fire but found it bulky, heavy and the screen gave off too much glare.  I keep it charged, but seldom use and found myself going back to the prior generation for my reading (which is voracious).  This one \"fits\" me great.  Love the larger screen, but the device is very slender and easy to hold & store.  The display is simply spectacular and the streaming videos are spoiling me!  The speakers are really incredible for such a small gadget.  Easy to set up and I find the keyboard just fine and no inconvenience to check for battery.  To keep the cost lower I am happy to trade off a few things and for me, Amazon put the money where the bang is - speakers, display.  One thing is that I am not able to read my books as comfortably as one of the older Kindles with the non-glare surface.  In fairness, though, I have had cataract surgery so my eyes are rather sensistive doing close up things.  Love the case and the fact I can just close it and I'm done!Well done, Amazon.

Initially, I was reluctant to get an iPad because they are more expensive, can't use Flash, and I'm aready familiar with the MS and Android operating systems.  Of course, now Adobe that won't support flash for any tablets, that's a moot point.Visually, this Kindle is fantastic.  Good resolution, readable in different light and from different angles.  I give it high marks for that.  The battery life seems pretty good, but I've been spoiled by my Droid Razr Maxx and now have high standards.The one application I was really looking forward to, to be able to read the New Yorker on my Kindle, is completely buggy.  I spoke with a nice man at Amazon App customer service, and he told me that it's a known problem and the developer (Conde Nast) will need to fix it.  Bummer on that, but I'm hoping for a fix shortly.My biggest complaint is the location of the USB connection - bottom center if you're holding this in \"landscape\" mode.  I bought the leather cover, which works as a stand, so that we can watch movies, but with the Kindle plugged in, you can't use the stand!  That's CRAZY!  Who among us wouldn't want to keep it plugged in (unless you're in a plane) while watching a movie?  Otherwise, you've drained it completely.  The Kindle Fires from last year have the USB access on the short side - wayyyy more practical.The leather cover has its own issues, and I'll review those on the appropriate page.Interim verdict:  3 out of 5.

Anderson \"ann0314\"", "ReviewID": "RIZENF7XY436D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried out a LOT of different services now , we have iPods (4) and a father with the upper end iPad, we have a cellphone and had a tablet that was Google/Android based, we own a Surface and now we own Kindles (3). Yes I know we jump around a lot LOL. That is because we are trying to find that good balance between features, affordability, longevity, customer service, and ease that meets our needs with the stress on affordability because we are a family of 4 and this technology moves so fast that by the time you buy xyz 3, the new 6 is coming out LOL and keeping up can get VERY pricey on a family budget. My review is about contrasting the differences from my perspective:Customer Service (10/10):In this category for me, Amazon and the Kindle win, hands down. EXCELLENT customer service and I don't mean or take that word lightly at all. I've had to call all 4 companies for things and by FAR Amazon has been the best to deal with. I truly commend them for that in a time where it seems that area lacks more and more.Stability and Speed (7/10):Here I think the iPad/iPods/iPhones win it. Having used all the varying systems by far I think the iPads are the most stable and quick. That said, since the other companies are playing catchup, I would expect that to be so. The Kindle to me falls not terribly behind though. It does freeze here and there and I have had to do a shutdown/restart on occasion, more then with the iPods/iPad, but it isn't to the frequency that I have had to with other products so for me it isn't far off pace.Ease of Use/Base System Features (6.5/10):If you are coming from an iWhatever, you are probably going to come up a bit irritated and possibly baffled and very well may not initially like the Kindle. I know initially when we got ours I was \"underwhelmed\" especially with how things are setup. In this aspect I think iPads and Android systems have a leg up especially if you are like me and are a bit of an organizational freak. There are NO folders here, no way to move around or order things \"your way\". To me this was probably the BIGGEST issue I had with the Kindle. If you are someone new to tablets and this is your first, I think the Kindle is pretty straight forward and easy enough to figure out quickly. I know my 11 year old was off and running with it almost instantly.\"Fun\" Applications (9/10):In this area the Kindle is right in line with the rest. For a kid actually BETTER then the other three in terms of Parental Controls and services geared to keep your kids happy without the worry of your child using your credit card accidentally purchase to purchase something (though I will say I have less experience with this feature in the iPads so am speaking more about the Google and Microsoft systems for handling this which are both not so hot especially if you are a family with kids and adults using the same account or wishing to. On the application front, the worst of the bunch is the Surface which has a lot of NOTHING at the moment :( It is new so somewhat expected but I wasn't prepared for quite how anemic their selection really is. Probably one of the largest areas where the Surface falls very flat.Productivity (7/10):If you are looking for a tablet to Browse the net, I think iPad wins it. The Kindles and Android based tablets do well though for the casual user but for a power user you may find the Kindle a bit laggy. If you are looking for something to check e-mail the iPad, Androids, and Kindle all do well. The Surface though has a HUGE issue there. You have to use internet apps to check your e-mail if you have pop3 accounts...REALLY? O.o LOL If you are wanting to use MS Office products the the Surface wins. The rest do have apps that \"work\" but they do fall short in some areas so you wanna research if you choose this or one of the others to be sure there is something that does what you need. I will say if looking for something more for \"school\" for a child, the Surface, iPad, or Android tablets that run higher may be better. This system is good for general things listed above but not necessarily strong if you are looking for it to be a laptop replacement for heavy typing and taking notes etc. Great though for browsing forums, getting e-mail, internet, and light work.Reading (10/10):This is handled pretty well across the board with the availability of the Kindle app on most everything these days, though being able to borrow books if you are a Prime Member once a month or being able to restrict what your kids are reading is handled best by using the Physical Kindle.Movies, Music, and Sound (10/10):Strangely enough, the Kindle won on this level for me for a couple reasons (the Surface takes a good second because of the ability to add SD and flash cards to expand its size as do some of the Android systems) Amazon, unknown to me, has \"tablet\" editions of their movies...I LOVE THIS. If I buy a movie, Amazon gives you a full res version and a mobile version. If you DL the mobile version and put it on the tablet it takes up about 1/2 the space as the same movie on the other systems which means you can put double the movies on it. You do lose some resolution but if it's to keep kids busy on a long car ride its WONDERFUL. If you are more into the quality and want the HD etc though that is there still as an option as well. I also liked the Amazon Prime aspect in this area as well, giving access to lots of movies with your membership. Granted on this Kindle remember you have to have wifi to use Prime. On the music and sound side, I found the speakers on my Kindle to be by FAR the best of the group. The sound is actually REALLY nice. I have to admit I was impressed.Affordability (10/10):Definitely between the Kindles and the Google/Android units I think. For what you are getting for the price I think both these systems are doing a nice job. The iPad is great but not necessarily affordable for the average person especially when you consider what you have now will be outdated in a year or so (if you are lucky) if money is an issue, I would definitely consider these two systems though I won't say the Surface or iPads are unreasonable for what they do, just with their added features etc also have added cost. What that is worth to you really is a personal thing though :)To close (thank heavens right) after getting past the initial shock of how different this system was to the other 3 (especially the Apple system which OS wise I personally like most), I have really enjoyed it and would most definitely recommend it though whether it is best for you really does depend (as you can see above) what it is you are looking for. Fun, Affordability, For a Child, Productivity, Work etc. But for a general use Tablet for a child, reading, browsing the net without a laptop in your lap, I think this tablet definitely does it's job and very very nicely :) My whole family was happy with this purchase and I have recommended it to quite a few friends etc now especially those with kids or looking for an inexpensive solution to the Tablet quest.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle", "Author": "Krystal", "ReviewID": "R2K1C0Z1NXW7HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll be truthful, I love my Kindle.

There are plenty of reviews about the overall conformation and performance of the Kindle tablets, but very little about the audio book and Whispersync experience.  Amazon has a selection of free classic books for Kindle, each of which has a companion narration, also free, available from Audible. These are an excellent selection of performances by well know narrators, three of which I had previously purchased myself. I highly recommend new Kindle owners \"buy\" these free titles and their companion audios.  Whispersync works in multiple ways across multiple devises. I can read or listen to a book on my Kindle, then pick up where I left off, reading or listening using the Kindle app on my Android phone. I especially like the immersive reading function, where the text on the screen is subtly highlighted and \"turns the page\" following the simultaneous narration.  The immersive reading does not work with books borrowed from The Amazon Prime lending library or with Audible narrations and Kindle books borrowed from the public library, but is very effective when using purchased Kindle books. Audible titles are often deeply discounted when the Kindle book is purchased FIRST. Unfortunately if I want Kindle books to mate to my hundreds of previously purchased audio books, they must be bought at full price. Not a big deal for me as I mostly listen on the go, but no early-adopter wants to feel that they have missed out due to their patronage.  My sole disappointment in the devise has been with the speaker volume, particularly with regard to audio books. I find the maximum volume to be adequate for steaming video from Netflix or Amazon Prime video, but for some reason the audio books are much lower in volume, too quiet for my middle aged ears, even when the Kindle is set on full volume. The speaker capacity is clearly there, and the audiobook volume is fine when I use earphones with my MP3 player, phone or the Kindle, but I can barely hear audio books on the external speakers when holding my Kindle while alone in a quiet room.  My mother has macular degeneration, and audio books are important to her. I had hoped that she could use my Kindle, and the clear controls on its bright screen to access the library of Audible titles I have acquired. She simply could not hear the narrations. Of course she could use headphones, and I am considering Bluetooth speakers, but these extraneous devises are needlessly complex for an elderly person.  I wonder if a software update might allow higher volume audio book playback?  I would also like to see an Overdrive app for the Kindle so that I can use audio books from my state library system. I listen to about 100 audio books a year, most of them free from the library. That does not keep me from being a good Amazon/Audible customer. I have subscribed to Audible's one or two book credits per month program for nearly four years, and have bought more books at the reduced member rate. As long as I'm unable to use my Kindle to download library audio books, I need to use a parallel set of devises for most of my listening. I look forward to software which would allow me to integrate all of my reading and listening.  Since Amazon has purchased Audible and has made great strides to integrate the Kindle reading and listening experience, it is clear that they have identified this as part of the future of reading. Please Amazon programmers do something so that I can set my Kindle down in a room and listen to an audio book as I go about my business.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Major bugs never get resolved, quickly loses product software support (no updates).", "Author": "Digitalmaster", "ReviewID": "RA5LVB4CAKG3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can't recommend this product because of the issues that I have had with it the past 4 months that I have owned it.First, when it comes to hardware, I would rate it 3/5.

Rosario", "ReviewID": "RMRYVTG5TLXR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between a Nexus 10 and the Kindle Fire HD.  Both devices have their advantages and disadvantages.The Nexus has the Google Play Store along with all of its apps, but you cannot access things such as Amazon Prime without using the browser.  Also, getting a Nexus 10 requires you to work with Google Play Store support which is not always the greatest as I have had to deal with and still am on an issue regarding a music purchase.The Kindle does not have access to the Google Play Store, but it does have the Amazon Appstore as well as Amazon Prime access.  The Amazon Appstore has most of the apps the Google Play Store has including Netflix and many of the games.  The biggest gripe I have with the Kindle is that for some reason Amazon does not offer any of the official Google apps such as Gmail, GTalk, Google Maps and Google Music.  There is a work around to get these apps on the device as I have installed them myself.  You have to authorize installation of 3rd party apps on the device and download the .apk file from a trusted website.  There are numerous websites out there that have official Google apps all you have to do is search for the .apk for the specific app.  Unfortunately, there is no support for the apps this way so you do not get updates and many times the icon looks blurry and not HD on the Kindle carousel.  Other than that, the Kindle is a great device especially when combined with Amazon Prime.  I am using a stylus with it now and find it works better with it.  The WIFI antennas are very good for the device and can connect to very weak signals with ease, would not recommend connecting to just any network as there are hackers out there looking to phish for anything.Amazon Prime is great as it not only grants you access to the numerous TV shows and movies Amazon has under contract, but it allows to borrow books for free from Amazon.As far as the price with the offers goes, I opted to include the offers as it knocked $15 off the price and the offers are only on the device when it is locked.  Upon waking the device (pressing the power button) an offer is displayed.  You swipe to unlock the device and the offer is gone, not to be seen again until you press the power button again once the device is off.  It is not bothersome at all.  I have not had any problems with the offers thing and at times I have been interested by the offers.I opted for the Kindle, purchased December of 2012, as it was cheaper and it allowed me to access Amazon Prime shows with no problem.  I also liked the Kindle reading aspect of it.  The device does have a setting under reading font, Sepia, which makes it so much easier to read than a regular white screen.  This is actually on any device that you download the Kindle app for including cell phones.I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a tablet that allows for a lot of media consumption as it has access to Amazon Prime with ease as well as Netflix.  In addition, it would be a better device for families as it allows parents to lock parts of the device to prevent children from purchasing or accessing things they are not supposed to.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is by far the best tablet out there for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Kevin Hearn\"", "ReviewID": "RVHQD8DS6KB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just start off by saying that I am not an apple fanboy, so I have never truly been impressed with iPads or any other Apple product after 2000. I don't feel like the value is there, and as someone who doesn't have a ton of cash to drop on something like a tablet, I just can't justify spending minimum $500-800 on one.I have had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet (32 GB) since they first came out in November and all I can say is: WOW! These tablets are amazing! I can tell you that it has literally changed my life (in a good way). :) I am going to list my comments individually in sections so y'all can see the parts that are most applicable to you.Build quality:I like the very solid, ergonomic feel of this Kindle. It is light enough to hold in one hand comfortably, yet I never feel like I'm going to drop it due to its weight (unlike my Galaxy S2 Smartphone). I do not, however, like the buttons on the top that control volume and the on/off. These buttons are almost completely flush to the device and it can be very difficult to press them. I also continually press the wrong button on the volume rocker to change the volume on the device because it feels backwards to me. I also wish the device could know when I changed it from landscape to portrait and adjust the volume knob to be a little more intuitive that way. That may sound like nitpicking, but it can be an annoyance.Screen:On that note, the screen on this thing is just gorgeous. I have used it outside, inside, full light, no light, everywhere you can imagine and I have never had a problem seeing anything on the device anywhere. I live in South Texas and it can be quite bright here in the daytime (especially around noon-2pm) and I have spent many Saturdays outside reading my Kindle without any problems. It does require more brightness out of the screen which reduces battery life, but I never read outside for more than two or three hours so I have never had an issue with running out of power. I cannot say enough positive things about this screen!User Interface:I love the Amazon Silk browser, it is great and works seamless with almost everything. I did the infamous flash workaround with the dolphin browser (google it) and that works great as well. The only complaint I have about the apps is...sometimes I don't want apps to come onto the carousel after I use them. I am major OCD and I like to have my carousel totally empty besides the book that I am reading. I like the apps and I use them often, but I have to remove them from the carousel periodically. I wish there was an option that said \"do not put apps on carousel\", or even a list of apps you could put on the device that would do the same. Again, nitpicky....but a tad bit annoying.Reading:What can I say about the reading on this device? It is superb. From magazines, to books, to newspapers...everything is great. I have never had a problem with any of this and it works great. I love getting my Men's Fitness and my fiance loves getting Cosmo as well. They are always crisp and clear (gotta love that HD screen) and are never glitchy or freezing. This is really where this Kindle has changed my life. I am a teacher and it is very difficult for me to fit certain books into my backpack for school...but it is easy to fit my Kindle in there. I have read more books in the past five months of owning this thing than I had in a year.Ordering:Part of the reason I have had so much success with my reading is that it is very easy to order books from the device. I have bought books and had family members buy me books for my birthday and never had a problem. It is almost TOO easy to buy things for this device...because I spend a lot of money on books to read every month. Again, no complaints. It is far easier to make a buy on my device (which I keep with me perpetually) instead of having to remember to hit up a bookstore on the way home. And, let me add, cheaper to buy on the Kindle.Videos:I bought extra storage space to put my DVR shows on my Kindle for watching at various points when I am not home. Besides the fact that the only content it plays is .MP4 (a tad annoying) but the videos are always crisp and clear and never have to buffer or queue. I have absolutely zero complaints about video or playback on the device.Overall I would say that I have absolutely zero regrets with my Kindle. I have nitpicky concerns, but they are far outweighed by the benefits of this device. If you are like me and looking for something to make reading books and magazines easier-or even watching videos or movies, this is definitely the Kindle for you. I hope this review helps any of you that are on the fence about buying a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".

There may be a way to fix this but I am not sure how.  They say the new Kindle Fire HD has a sharper picture than the original Kindle Fire but for my eyesight I can not tell the difference.  What I do like is the size is awsome and makes playing games like angry birds or fruit ninja even better.  The backlight for reading makes reading with the lights off a breeze (does not hurt my eyes at all).  I love that amzon imported my music onto my kindle / cloud and the sound is very crisp when I use my earphones its like listiening to my MP3.  I also thought it was easy to bring over my photos from facebook to my kindle so I can share them with friends.

I paid extra for the rapid charger and did not notice much of a difference in charging time from my normal phone charger that has the same size charger.  All in all I love the kindel the ease it provides in shopping amazon, the ability to play my music, the importing of photos and most of all the ability to read with the lights off.

Why did I settle on this one over all the rest?  Because during my research I kept coming back to one fundamental question...what will I use the tablet for?  I'm already an Amazon Prime member and ultimately I decided I wasn\u2019t looking for a work horse tablet to run productivity software; I wanted a right sized media device that also lets me surf the web, check e-mail, run apps and watch YouTube videos.  And I didn\u2019t want to pay a fortune for it.  The HD 8.9 fits that bill nicely.  I travel a lot so I sprung for the 32 Gb version which I highly recommend.A lot has been commented on about the location of the power plug port and design of the power and volume buttons but I found once I got used to the buttons it was pretty easy to find them.  Even though the volume buttons don\u2019t show which increases or lowers the sound it\u2019s actually easy to figure out; up is for louder and down is for lower. But I think the power port would have been better placed at the opposite end of the on/off switch because as it is now you can\u2019t use the case as a stand unless you do what I did and turn the kindle upside down in the case.  That way the power can be plugged into the top allowing use of the case as a stand.As for web browsing I am very satisfied in how the browser works for me.  It\u2019s not the smoothest and fastest browser but it works well enough.  Overall I really like the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because it fits what I want to use it for.

I use Amazon alot for shopping as well as my media needs. So when looking into a tablet (and I did compare alot of them) I found that I just wanted to stick with Amazon.My take on the fire HD....The ADS. for me not a problem its only on screen saver(at this time no plans to remove them)Recommendations that appear. Not a problem I happen to like them there. I use on Amazon when looking for new items anyway so them being on home screen to me seems a plus.Silk. It has no adobe flash plug-in. Not a problem with as yet was able to watch youtube mobile and visit all my normal web sites.Reading. I have to say I find reading on it as easy as first Fire even better, It has text-to-speech, and some books can be read by a real person if you also have the audible book. Which is actual kinda of cool. Gave it a try with Acheron by Kenyon which I happen to own in both formats (kindle and audible). It adds a new depth to the story. The x-ray for books is nice as well, was able to get info on the characters on the page and thier role in book.Video. Nice picture and sound has happy with it.Apps. Now apps are a problem seems alot of apps that work on Fire 1st gen do not work on HD. Don't know if its Amazon or developer issue (hope fix is just an update away). That being said there are apps I wanted on Fire 1st gen that do work for the HD which is a plus.Over all Im happy to have updated to the new HD model of the fire (which I owned for a year and was very happy with).Difference I like the bigger screen, more memory, and speakers and the bluetooth is nice. Paired with my Jabbra Steet 2 I was able to leave fire in room and go next door. FYI the control buttons on the Jabbra do work to control music on fire was able to skip song and replay remotly. For me this will allow me to use the music player on Fire more easly while walking vs the 1st gen where I had to do all from screen in bright sun light (not fun). In closing I love my Fire it was great buy if you use Amazon alot for media even if you dont at price and with Amazon's nice customer service give it try, I think you will be happy.

But first, I wanted to talk about why I bought it.  Whipping out a heavy, hot laptop with that classic anemic battery power, under-powered graphics and sound for a thousand dollars, give or take four hundred bucks, was an unattractive proposition.  When I want to watch a video in bed, on the plane or in a waiting room, a tablet is perfect.  We're living in a tablet world now, so unlike when the iPad was the only game in town, now there's this thing, the Nexus 7 and even the Nexus 10.  Here's why I chose the Kindle Fire...  First, I already own a Kindle (e-ink Keyboard) and it ROCKS; light weight, long battery life, beautiful display, easy to use, wonderfully simple to buy content and enjoy it in mere seconds; a beautiful product.  A coworker showed me their Kindle Fire and it was also gorgeous, and this is a gorgeous product.  Easily competes with the iPad in the looks department.  As the advertising says, its display is visually indistinguishable from that of the Retina display on my wife's iPad.  I've been shopping for content from Amazon for years and I've been a Prime member for a while now, so getting to watch all my favorite TV shows and movies without dealing with a DVD player or the DVD drive in a crappy laptop is really nice.  It's so nice to be able to jump around--between social media, to movies, to my e-mail, to Skype with my wife when I'm out of town, over to my MP3s in the Amazon cloud.  The IDEA behind this product is awesome.So here's what it gets right...  Looks cool.  Awesome graphics.  Great sound in the headphones.  Based on Android so you can use some Android apps out of the Google Play store or Android MarketPlace in addition to the Amazon App store.  Reasonably priced.  Even though I use my other Kindle for reading, reading on this thing is pretty nice.  Screen is bright, color is deep and rich, very little glare, so, magazines are fun to thumb through on this device.  Some gripes I encountered on YouTube while trying to decide to purchase this thing included hard-to-locate power button.  I don't ever have problems finding and using the power button.  It is lame you have to purchase the power brick, but it does work and it's worth getting.  It's not too big to carry and if you get the cool leather case, you can stand it up for hands-free use.  I don't recommend the screen protector--it's crap (you get this oily looking rainbow coloring that doesn't go away no matter what you look at on the screen).  I don't care about the Special Offers--who is looking at their lock screen long enough to be annoyed by these ads?  Not me.  It doesn't have a rear camera but I already have a camera, AND a camera in my phone.  It's easy enough to transfer either of these things to this device via USB.  The camera it has is good enough for what it was meant for--Skype and video blogging.  The keyboard isn't the best, BUT, I hate all touchscreen keyboards; they're all hard to use.Here are the problems and I really hate saying this, but, there are a lot.  #1, the interface is the least intuitive of any thing I have ever used.  I wish I had at least one physical button that lets me just \"go home\" no matter where I am, which I think is ironic.  You get *physical* volume up/down buttons, but not a home button.  Instead, if apps hide your home/back/favorites icon bar, you have to remember to tickle the border to see if you can make it show up so you can get out of what you're doing.  Same deal with \"settings.\"  You have to remember to drag down the top border to get to REALLY useful things.  Something like that should be on the home screen, which takes me to my next gripe.  There is no home screen.  I'd like a nice clean \"page\" that lets me go to my apps, or, content, or whatever, but basically has nothing but the time and maybe a couple of status icons (i.e., On Wi-Fi, notifications from running apps, etc).  Instead, you get the carousel and I'm sorry, but, I don't like this thing, at all.  It's goofy to use and has a mind of its own...  Things go on it whether you want them to or not.  The most recent thing shows up first all the time, which is convenient, since when you swipe to the end of the carousel, there's no way to go back to the beginning unless you use the home icon.  I really hate that it insists on telling you what other people bought as Large icons under the highlighted app in the carousel.  I wish I could uninstall FreeTime; I will never give this to someone who needs an app to tell you when to stop using it.Reviewers complained about laggy performance and it's true.  If this thing gets busy with anything (moving around files, running certain apps), screen rotation, carousel swiping, etc. hangs/freezes for a moment.  I haven't heard much about the parental controls but I have a need to keep certain videos, photos and files password protected without locking the entire unit.  And the bad news is, parental controls are either ON or OFF.  When it's on, you can't just enter a password and access that feature.  All those features are just outright blocked.  So you have to REMEMBER to turn it back on every time you're done with a feature you don't want someone getting into by accident.  Even worse?  You can't do it by app.  You can either block all apps, or enable all apps.  REALLY bad.Storage management is a bit of a mess.  If you move a file from one folder to the other, it makes a Copy first.  So if you're nearly out of space on this device, the operation will fail.  No other computer disk system I've ever used works that way.  I know, no tablet gives you the ability to plugin and eject your own SD cards; which would have been a huge competitive advantage for this device.  Because the internal storage IS and SD card!!  How cool would it be that when you fill up the relatively microscopic 16 or 32 GB internal storage on this thing (because you don't want to have to use your WiFi every time you want to watch a movie), you could just plugin your own whopping 128 GB SD card and keep going?  No instead you have to play three-card-monty with the files on this thing, and the USB on this guy is the slowest of any Flash USB-based storage system I've ever used.  Or, literally double how much you are spending for the 4G version, the only model that offers up to 64 GB internal storage.  I wish the photo viewer organized pictures into folders--especially if that's the way I copied them there from a computer.  No matter what, ALL sort-by-date, ALL sort-by-name or ALL-sort-by-size is almost never how I want to browse my pictures or play them back in a slideshow.  Lastly, USB copy operations seems to use a TON of battery, and that it refuses to charge while plugged into USB (not even at all, not just slowly) is big-time design fail status.The \"booming bass with no distortion\" is a myth and was a primary reason for me to purchase the device.  The sound is stereo at least, and it is nice and clear.  And, perhaps if I played something with Dolby Digital encoding to activate the codec that might help.  But playing back my own MP3s or YouTube music videos is better off done through nice ear buds (good ones, not the cheap white things Apple gives you with an iPod).  You can't play back the vast majority of major video file formats out there, but, if you download and install MoboPlayer (after enabling application installation from \"unknown sources\" in settings), you will be in business.  No converting hundreds of files on a computer and then spending hours transferring them over slow USB.  Just transfer them once and play and DOES respect folders.  All hail the power of the Android operating system.I'm hoping that stuff gets better as new versions of the OS come out and I download and upgrade my device to use them although I get the feeling the more annoying things are here to stay...  Carousel is probably their money feature, so if you hate it, that's too bad.  I would say however that if you don't care about all of the stuff I found annoying, then for the money, you're going to get a good product out of this device.  It serves my needs and I didn't have to spend iPad money to get a tablet that lets me watch my videos and look at photos without having to lug around a laptop or be chained to my desk or home TV.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the bomb!!!", "Author": "KenDiesel", "ReviewID": "R3MC2SFRARKFBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me write this with all you people out there that have never had a tablet before. I myself would have never purchased one but for that my train magazines were going digital. I did my research. I talked to my brother who had an I-Pad3 and my sisters-in-laws that had kindles and samsung 7inch.  I looked at info and reviews online.  Now by the time I had done all this I was totally confused. All these people bad mouthing the different units vs. the people saying they were absolutely great. I started to note that a lot of the people bad mouthing were nit picking the units to death or were not following the proper procedures of setting up or using the proper cables or items required by the vendor.I finally decided, do I need a tablet is more business and entertainment for a higher price(ipad or samsung) or a unit that is made mostly for entertainment as a less price(Kindle). I pulled the trigger on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.When I received it the unit felt just right size wise in my hands. (The Ipad that I tried was a little larger and the Samsung 7 inch felt and looked small, the 10\" to large). I hooked up to my wifi within 2 minutes. I started looking around and figured out how to download a free book(I signed up for Amazon prime-great deal for $79 a year) on the Kindle and started looking up all the things I could do. Within a week I was almost a pro. The movies that I have downloaded are just spectacular. Graphics of 1920 x 1200 are detailed. Amazon has a lot of apps, games, magazines, tunes and about anything else you could want. It so bad, I have limited myself to 1 hour a day using this tablet.Now, you may be saying this person doesn't know much about the specifics of all the things that are needed to be done and the Kindle can't do it.

When I researched and reviewed all the specs and reviews on all of the Kindles, I finally decided on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 16 GB Wi-Fi.  Like so many others in the reviews, I was undecided as to whether or not I should get the 32GB and the 4G version or the Wi-Fi 16 GB.  So I read the reviews and then I really looked specifically at what I would be using it for, where I would be using it, what size would work best for my needs, and at the price, all of which really helped me make my decision.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a little bigger and that works better for my eyes, especially for reading.  I am an avid book reader and loved my first Kindle but the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is truly a huge improvement and a beautiful little tablet.  The quality and size are great for the price.  The HD is better than most TV's, the sound is great, the graphics are fabulous, and it's easy to use and go back and forth between functions.  I use it mostly at home or places where I can use safe Wi-Fi .  I really didn't want to add another bill for a data plan, so this Kindle works great for me.  I have mostly books on it, some music, several apps, and a couple of videos, so the 16 GB is good enough for my needs.  I also like that I can read email and send documents to it to use for my work, if I need to in a pinch.  I also purchased the Kindle Leather Cover in Royal Purple which is beautiful and the Kindle Powerfast Accelerated Charger, which I also got both at a discount when I purchased my Kindle.  I am very happy that I got the charger because it does charge it much faster.  This is probably the con that I would say that I have with the  Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"  Wi-Fi 16GB.  I think it should have come with the wall charger like it did with my other Kindle, but it doesn't keep me from giving this Kindle 5 stars.

This is my first tablet; I still don\u2019t own a SmartPhone (I still carry an original Razr).  I was considering this against the iPad mini after doing some personal research online and with friends primarily.  My first Kindle (the only other one in the house actually) is the keyboard version (before the PaperWhite model) and I\u2019ve used laptops for\u2026who knows how many years.  Also this review is written for the tablet novice in mind; those who are experts on the subject have had quite a bit to say about the Fire HD.  I please ask you to keep these facts in mind as you read the review.Personally, I love this thing.  There are a few detractions which I\u2019ll get into later, but they mostly hinge on the lack of charger and lack of a backward facing camera.The first item I\u2019ll get into is the ads.  I purchased the 16GB version with ads and let me say this:  they are unobtrusive and non-intrusive.  They appear on the lock screen, so you see it once the Fire awakens, and when you look at items on your carousel (books, apps and games) there is a small banner that shows what others who have that app/book have purchased.  For those who complain about these ads, I recognize that we all have an opinion and I\u2019m not going to invalidate them.  However if you have watched TV (like CBS, ESPN or CNN) or read a magazine (Like Time, Automobile and others) or been to any website outside of your own private network then you\u2019re already used to commercials & ads\u2026especially in a magazine.  This is far less intrusive than what you find in a magazine and far less prevalent than commercials.  For $15 off the price I think it\u2019s a great deal.  I would say that people should not be concerned with ads on your Kindle Fire HD; you\u2019re on this website & you\u2019re looking at ads already.Next, getting into how I\u2019ve used this thing every day.E-Reader:  It\u2019s great, however just like any other tablet, you have a backlight.  Personally I find the e-ink on a normal Kindle easier on the eyes and if *all* you\u2019re going to do is read e-books, I\u2019d suggest going the route of a PapwerWhite or standard Kindle.  On here you can choose a traditional black on white print, sepia (to simulate a slightly yellowed book) or white on black for reading material.  This setting translates across anything you read on your Fire HD (I have a magazine subscription and a double-tap of articles breaks out the article into the black/white I\u2019ve selected).  Your books synchronize across your devices, just like any other kindle/kindle reading app.However chances are if you\u2019re reading this you were going to do more than just read e-books.  Let\u2019s get into it, but only reviewing what the Fire HD comes with & what you can get on the Amazon Android App store.  I have not \u2018sideloaded\u2019 anything to my Fire; everything I have on my Fire is from the Amazon App store.Video:  My goodness this thing rocks.  You can use the instant watch (tons of things are free for Prime members) and you can use a USB to put your personal videos on your Fire.  Additionally you can grab several free apps such as Netflix or Xfiniti to allow you to stream video to your Fire.  The display is crisp and awesome.  You may consider getting an app or two for some video formats.  I know I can watch MP4 video on my Kindle; AVI is not natively supported.  As mentioned there are several apps that can remedy that situation.Related \u2013 Sound:  I\u2019m a bit of a sound snob.  Short of headphones, this is the best sound I\u2019ve heard from a mobile device by a wide margin, including my HP laptop with BeatsAudio.  It\u2019s not just crisp, it\u2019s true stereo, and dynamic at that.  Now it doesn\u2019t give you surround sound the way a nice set of headphones will give you, but if there\u2019s *equal* sound on any tablet out there I\u2019d like to know.  Example, I watched a video on YouTube that I\u2019d watched before and for the first time I could tell that some voices from the crowd were from the right, with others in the left & middle.  Speaking of which this leads me to\u2026Web Surfing.  This comes with Silk, the browser from Amazon.  Fact: there is no flash support.  Fact: I can watch YouTube vids just fine.  I suspect it may have to do with if the video has HD available.  The browser is fast and stable, most of the time.  There have been a few pages that have hung up on me, forcing a close.  I\u2019ve found this is more of a site-specific item rather than Silk in general.  FaceBook had a couple issues when I went to the Washington DC Auto Show and used the free WiFi in the convention center.  I downloaded the FB app later that day and FB worked fine from the house; when I returned to the Auto Show the next day & had good WiFi the app and surfing worked just fine.Apps.  The Amazon Android App store has a ton of content, and it\u2019s really easy to get to.  Plus you can just click another included app to shop the regular Amazon store; easy as pie.  It\u2019s not like you only have five apps to choose from.  However out of the box while you can view documents (word, PDF, excel) you cannot edit them.  There are apps that can be purchased that will allow you to do this, but it\u2019s still something I would have preferred.  That said there are enough things to get you up & running.Documents \u2013 taking a second here to write a quick note about documents on the Fire HD.  Yes, you can read them (.docx, .xlsx, etc.) but you cannot edit them with the supplied software.  Personally I find that when I want to edit items I use a laptop, but if you\u2019re expecting to be able to edit a spreadsheet you\u2019ll need an app from the store.Battery Life.  Nice and solid; they claim 10 hours of constant use and I believe them.  I used mine all day at the show, then continued to use it at home.  Plug it in at night and you\u2019re good to go the next day.  If you want to make that charge last longer, turn the Fire off rather than use the sleep function.The great surprise was what has become my favorite feature.  E-mail.Sounds like a simple thing, but the e-mail client that comes with the Fire HD 8.9 allows you to view all your e-mail in a single app.  If you have a few different e-mail addresses this thing is a life saver!  I have two g-mail, two yahoo and a home account on this device; you can even set it up for an exchange (work) e-mail client.  This has made it incredibly easy to keep up on all my addresses, including information from friends!  Each one has a dedicated folder, but you can also view them all in one folder should you choose.  Had you told me two weeks before writing this that I\u2019d rave about the e-mail more than anything else I would have laughed in your face.If you\u2019ve never owned a tablet before, this one is GREAT.  It has the Amazon store loaded right up onto it, you can get great apps for android tablets, video & sound are better than anything I\u2019ve been exposed to and the price is much better than the i-pad.  That\u2019s not to say this thing isn\u2019t perfect however.  Here are a couple things to consider.First, it does *not* come with a wall charger, and that\u2019s a shame.  You can plug it into the USB port in your computer but that is one slow charge.  They offer a wall charger for twenty bucks extra.  If you have one of the USB wall plug in chargers \u2013 specifically if it reads 9 or 10 amps, you\u2019re good to go.Next, they only have a single camera\u2026pointed right at you.  While that\u2019s great for Skype (comes on the Fire) it\u2019s not great for taking pictures of anything other than yourself.  Yes, you can make the camera work with some agility (you just can\u2019t get a good look at what you\u2019re taking a picture of) but that\u2019s a big minus in my book.  As a result of this layout, any app for taking pictures or video is in my opinion\u2026rather worthless.The last part of my review is to explain why I (personally) felt this was better than getting an i-pad mini.For thirty bucks less I get a larger display, a *better* display (larger is not always better!) and I can share my books/music with my other devices.  On top of that there\u2019s the sound that\u2019s awesome in comparison.  Apple makes a nice product.  I personally feel this is a better oneI thought about getting the Fire 7 inch but opted for the larger display to view video & photos on a nicer display, but I have to admit I considered saving the extra $100 and spending it on apps or (more likely) gas.Pick up a case and a screen protector.  If you\u2019re a first time tablet owner, you\u2019ll be using this thing quite a lot.And you\u2019ll be happy you did.That\u2019s my review in 1,600 words.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Goodbye iPad", "Author": "Gandalfe", "ReviewID": "R3FPRH9Y02COE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Luv'd my iPad, but love the Kindle much more.

Best for Price", "Author": "WaJA Ink In Hand", "ReviewID": "R152GYJ9CVVTS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to my purchasing the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 16G Wi-fi, like most of you, I did a lot of online comparing.  I had always been an iPad user.  Yet, because my iPad was a 1st Generation model, it had already begun to lag behind it's newer relatives in terms of newer features and updates.  So, since they are really very expensive IMO, I went into the hunt for a future tablet willing to purchase something else. After all, there are a lot of really good tablets out there right now.  So after doing a lot of reading and looking at tablets in stores, My thinking kind of went like this.I liked the Nexus 10 over the iPad, and by a little bit over the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", even though it was close. What got me was the Nexus 10 has a resolution of 2560 x 1600  at 300 ppi.  Now having said that about the hardware, my eyes really liked the Nexus 10 and the Kindle Fire HD for two different reasons (from what i could see on the internet).  When I looked at the Nexus 10, I said, \"Wow, that is just overall great looking!  Great uniformity. No lag.  Awesome looking movies, etc.  And when I looked at the KFHD, I again said, \"Wow!\"  The flesh tones are awesome.  And whoa! The colors pop on this device. So, I read some more online reviews.  And people were saying the same thing about the KFHD.  And yes, The iPad looked great, just like always. But, I concluded, I really didn't want an iPad anymore. I really wanted something else. I love Apple's computers, but.. their tablets? Hmm? I've seen what other people have and there is some pretty nice stuff out there.  So, I liked  the Nexus 10, because of what I knew about the High Resolution numbers, and not so much by what I could see! And I liked the colors and the overall picture of the KFHD.Then, I started to evaluate the tablets in terms of what they could do. And I determined that the Nexus 10 is a BEAST.  It does most everything really well. And it has apps galore from the Google Play Store.  It flat out gets the job done.  It has a front and rear camera.  Movies look fantastic on it.  When scrolling from App Screen to App Screen, it doesn't stick or lag.  It is solid! BUT... BUT... It is also $100 more than the KFHD.. OUCH! And that is not really so good!On the other hand, the Kindle Fire is one HOT TABLET! Why? Because of what it does so WELL! it is designed to buy, rent, borrow,  and use products from Amazon online.  And whoa! What it does it does really really well. Movies, Pictures, games, comics, books, you name it, The KFHD is designed to QUICKLY and easily bring all that Amazon experience to you efficiently and cleanly! The KFHD's visual experience is FANTASTIC in its display of the product in action.  And it sounds excellent in terms of it's audio presentation.  It will absorb you, as it interacts with you.  At least, it did for me!  And as I was absorbed people yelled at me. It seems time flew by with out me.  It's a great experience. Well.. err.. yeahNow, I am going to admit something to all of you.  At first, I almost sent my Kindle back.  After coming away from an iPad experience, it was really hard at first for me to get used to the difference.  I just couldn't get the KFHD to do what I wanted.  For example, I was looking for the \"same\" Apps in the Amazon store, as I had on  the iPad that I had just sold.  For the most part, I couldn't find them.  Well, after I changed my kindle settings to allow for downloading from outside sources, this began to change.  Eventually I found most of what I had on my iPad on the web, and I downloaded those Apps to my Kindle.  Then I found substitutes from the Amazon Store for the things I could not on the net.  As I started to use the tablet after that, I really started to love my device.  And the more I used it, the more I liked it!  Now, I'm so glad that I purchased this.  It does everything that I want it too, and more than I imagined it could.I have to say, the Home Screens categories are spot on for what they offer.  Comics, Books, Apps, movies, games, etc., it's all here, and easily accessible.  I don't have to click on this, and then click on that.. oh yeah, and then click on this, just to get what i really want. It's all right there in each of those categories at the top of the Home Screen. And to top it off, Amazon Prime is such a great idea! My goodness, free two day shipping for prime members from Amazon? Are you kidding me? That's great!One more thing here really quickly.  I understand where a lot of people are coming from with their not liking the Ads showing up on their Kindle HD's.  Here is kind of the way I look at it.  When I browse the intent, nearly every webpage has ads on it. When I used apps on my Apple iPad, a good many of them had ads on them. The same is true of my phones apps.  IMO we live in a culture that likes to sell things. And one of the easiest ways do do that, is through Ads.  Now, I can't remove every single ad from my browser.  I can't remove every single ad from all of my apps on each of my devices.  BUT, I can remove the ads on my Kindle Fire HD.  I will have to pay $15.00 to do so.  BUT at least it is AN OPTION.  Now, I'm not so sure that I will do that.  The Ads on the lock screen look fantastic on the KFHD. And there just might be something there that I might buy. Anyway I don't know, if I'll remove them or not.Now, I'd like to make one recommendation to the people at AMAZON.  Would it be possible to provide some options to customers like me, that get bored looking at the same screen every time I use my device. For example, you could allow users to CUSTOMIZE the home screen.  The Home Screen lists at the top of the screen: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, Audiobooks, Web, Photos, Docs & Offers. Why not let us decide which one of titles and their contents is going to be our Home Screen.  And I think it would be great if  Carousel was an option too.  And, what about a little color, huh? Could you also allow for some back ground color on the Home Screen?  I love my KFHD.  BUT, I must admit, having to look at the black background constantly gets a little OLD.  A little customization might help to make the kindle feel a little more like it's the owners and not just some interface that AMAZON is using.Anyway... To sum up... In terms of Quality for the Price, I think the KFHD is an absolute winner.  I really like the Nexus 10 too, BUT, it is $100 more than I can afford right now. Is the Nexus worth what people are paying for it? Well, maybe not right now.. because I see some of them selling for over $100  the advertised price, since they are sold out on the Google site, and people want them so badly for Christmas. I think it's getting a little out of hand.  But, for $100 more, which is what it usually sells for? Then it is a toss up! KFHD or Nexus 10?  Bother are great tablets. But in my case: for a $299 starting price, nothing beats my KFHD.  It is ONE HOT TABLET! Best for Price!", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Clifton L.

Downloads are super lightening fast! I can't seem to put it down. The display is amazing! Colors pop. Videos and magazines are gorgeous. The device is well-constructed and sturdy. The sound from the speakers is nice and loud with a rich tonal quality. The user interface and software seem mature and polished. I would say that it is highly intuitive to use. Ridiculously easy to use, actually. I had purchased a Nook HD+ a month ago but I returned it. It was such an underwhelming device. Additionally, the software was buggy and the screen often was non-responsive.  I still currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, a Motorola Xoom 10 inch tablet, a Nook Color and Kindle DX. They are all going up for sale soon(except the Kindle DX, that is). The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 makes me not want to pick them up again. Amazon's app and media store is tremendous. If you are looking for the Google experience, then this is not the product for you; as most of the Google apps are not available. Even when side-loaded the Google apps that require account sign-in will not function. Nevertheless, I can manage just fine without the Google experience.

I have yet to indoctrinate the bookstore/usage, or the movies, but that will happen.Is it an iPad? Of course not.  That's not it's sole purpose.

Without that discount, the cost before tax would have been $384 (for the \"Without Special Offers\" version).  Today I noticed that Amazon slashed the prices for Kindle Fire HD 8.9, so that the version I purchased would be $314! (as of March 13, 2013)  For that price, I would HIGHLY recommend this product.A little background on how I initially made the decision to purchase a Kindle Fire HD.  I have friends and family that own tablets, although the majority of them own the iPad.  Anyone who's played around with an iPad the last few years was probably at least somewhat impressed.  I've had several versions of iPods over the years, as well as a Blackberry for work.  So if I were to get a tablet, my initial preference would be for an iPad.  However, given that the cheapest iPads were still quite expensive (and I didn't want one without the retina display), I'd been on the fence about getting a tablet.  When the Kindle Fire HD went on sale, I figured, \"what the hell!\" and went ahead and purchased it (helped that I also had some giftcards, credit to use).At first, I was a little underwhelmed, as I was hoping for a similar experience to using at iPad, but I eventually learned to accept the limitations of the Kindle Fire HD and recognize what it excelled at.LIMITATIONS of KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9:My biggest complaint - lack of apps.  Anyone who's used an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad knows how many apps there are in the Apple catalogue.  Similarly for most Android phones, tablets, etc.  However, although the Kindle OS is build from Andoid, it's not really an Android environment.  They emphasize all of the popular apps that are available for the Kindle Fire, but there are many more which are not.  The frustrating thing is that Amazon sells apps for other Android devices in their appstore, but many of these are not compatible with Kindles.  An example of an app that I would like to install is Yelp or even something as simple as a Monopoly game (there is a version of it for Kindle, but not the one I wanted).  Not a big deal overall, but something to consider.  There's also something called \"side loading\", which I will get to in a bit.Silk browser - alot of the apps that aren't available have websites.  So one of the ways I worked around it is by just bookmarking their websites in the Kindle's browser, Silk.  However, that leads to my next issue.  The browser kind of sucks.  When it works, it's fine, but I has a tendency to crash quite a bit, which can be frustrating.  There are other browsers that you can install, but it's not so simple.Interface/ Smoothness of OS - most of the time this isn't an issue, but I have had occasions where navigating the Kindle Fire HD has gotten a little laggy or \"hiccup-y\".  It got so bad in the first few weeks of having it, that I had to reinstall the software, which has fixed this issue for the most part over the past two plus months of ownership.Video Formats - if you're like me and you want to use the Kindle Fire HD as a media tablet (video, music, magazines, books, etc.), you probably have quite a few videos on your home computer that you'd like to view on the tablet.  Well, if they're AVI's or anything other than these (MP4, 3GP, VP8), you're out of luck.  Anything copy-protected other than videos from Amazon is not going to work.  Now there are ways to convert files from another format to an .mp4 video that the Kindle Fire can handle (Handbrake), but it's kind of a pain.  They obviously want to direct you to their extensive video library, but if it's something that you already own on another format, it's somewhat frustrating.  Also, once you have the video file of your choice on the Kindle Fire, using the \"Personal Videos\" app on the device, you can't necessarily tell which video is which at first glance as it represents each video as a static screenshot (which could be a black screen!).THINGS I LIKE about KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9:Obviously the price is a big seller.  But you sometimes get what you pay for - what you don't get is an iPad experience, but it's still pretty damn good.Screen/ Hardware - I don't think it's quite the same as the retina display, but to my untrained eyes, the screen is pretty nice.  I have an iPod touch, and I've used it to watch videos, but one of the main reasons I wanted a tablet was for a bigger screen, and I am very happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Some have complained it's too big or heavy to hold with one hand, and yeah, I get that, but it works for me.  I also liked the rubbery backing, and when it's working smoothly, the touchscreen is great.Sound - yes, it does have great speakers for a tablet.  Makes it very nice to watch videos, listen to music, play games, etc.  They face backwards, behind the tablet, which is sort of weird, but it's not a major issue for me.  It does come with a headphone jack as well, of course, and the headphone sound depends on your headphones, but it's fine.Reading/ e-reader - Given that this is a tablet from Amazon, it's natural that it should be an excellent e-reader.  My fiance has a dedicated (e-ink) e-reader, the Nook, and you can't beat the battery life and the screen quality (for reading) of e-ink, but given everything else you can do with a Kindle Fire HD, that's a minor quibble.  As Amazon no doubt counts on, I have purchased several Kindle books once I purchased my Kindle Fire HD, and I've really enjoyed reading them on the device.  I even purchased the Audiobook versions a few times, and I really liked reading along to the professional narration provided by WhisperSynch for Voice.  Oh, I should also mention that you can purchase graphic novels that are optimized for the Kindle Fire, which is pretty cool.  Locke and Key: Vol. 1 Welcome to Lovecraft Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2--ShardsWhisperSynch/ Cloud - the fact that I can be anywhere, and purchase an app from Amazon or a Kindle book and then have it show up on my Kindle Fire HD automatically is a plus.  Also, the cloud storage for any mp3s/ videos that you purchase from Amazon and the ability to then download them to your Kindle Fire or play them from the cloud (with wifi connection) is great.  I am seriously considering paying the $25 or so to be able to upload all of my mp3's/ music from my computer to their cloud player.  The new Autorip feature also is pretty cool in that it automatically adds .mp3 versions of any CD you purchased from Amazon to your Cloud Player library.Amazon Prime - yes, you get one month of Amazon Prime free.  I also opted to pay the $79 for a full year.  Not only do you get free 2-day shipping of physical products, but for the Kindle Fire owner, you get access to their Netflix-like archive of movies and tv shows.  While it's not as good as Netflix, it's still pretty great.  There's enough shows and movies that I'm interested in to make it a good investment.  I don't know if I would purchase Prime only for the shipping, but add in the Prime Videos, and it's worth it.  You also get access to the Kindle Lending Library, but aside from a few well-known series (Hunger Games, Harry Potter), the majority of books available are either public domain or self-published.  I have no doubt that some of these books are great, but most of them are uninteresting to me, a rather avid reader.ISSUE on WHICH I AM \"AGNOSTIC\" - I think 16 GB is a little too small for most people, so I opted for the 32GB version.  I think this gives me enough flexibility to upload my personal media to the device, but it's still somewhat limiting.  If you use your Kindle Fire HD for mostly streaming media or Kindle books, then it probably won't be an issue.  But if you plan on adding tons of video and/or audio files, it's somewhat limiting for times when you don't have wifi.A few notes on apps and \"Side Loading\"So there are some decent apps that you can purchase from Amazon.  Many of these are free, and I'll highlight a few that I like.Twitter - much easier to use than the Facebook app.  Not much else to add.  I use it and it's free.  TwitterES File Explorer - this is a great app that you can use to look at all of the files on the device.  It also has a built in video player, and I've found it easier to use than the Kindle's native \"Personal Videos\" player.  Yes, as I've noted previously, you can upload your own videos to the Kindle Fire HD, but they must be in a .m4v or .mp4 format.  You can find many video converters that you can use to convert non-protected video formats from one to another (Handbrake is what I use). Free.ES File ExplorerComicCat - This is a paid app, but only $2.99.  If you like to read comics, especially e-versions, then it's a good investment.  You can find all sorts of comics online for purchase or otherwise.  I believe it only reads .cbr or .cbz files, but again, it's easy to covert zip files to these formats.  ComiCatAngry Birds Star Wars - similar game to the original.  Looks great on the Kindle Fire HD.  Angry Birds Star Wars Premium HD (Kindle Tablet Edition)Plants vs. Zombies - one of the other really well-known games available for the Kindle Fire.  Graphics appeared to scaled up versus actual HD, but this game is one of my favorites.  Plants vs. Zombies (Kindle Tablet Edition)Side-loading apps - As I mentioned before, Amazon sells more apps on their Android appstore than it allows to be installed on the Kindle Fire tablet series.  So you can buy some of these apps, but you can't actually run them from your tablet.  You can also download and then upload apps from other stores and sources and install them on your Kindle Fire, but you first have to change the device settings to allow you to install apps from \"unknown sources.\"  So side-loading is basically putting these apps for Android (from Amazon or elsewhere) on your device manually.  Sometimes they will open and work, other times they will never open or crash your device.  It's a mixed bag.  Do your research on where to find safe software to purchase, and be aware that it may or may not work before you spend money on non-Amazon approved apps.  I initally side-loaded a few apps, including the Maxthon browser Maxthon Mobile on my Kindle.  Sometimes they worked, but I think that's what also led me to reinstall the OS after a few weeks.  I hope Amazon speeds up the process for approving Kindle Fire apps in the future to avoid this issue!A few notes on accessories:Power cord - the Kindle Fire HD only comes with a USB cable with which you can charge it.  It is VERY SLOW to recharge connected to a computer.  I got around it by using the cord with wall adapter for another device, but even then it takes 10-12 hours to fully recharge from empty.  They sell their own charger for an additional $20, which kinda sucks, but I finally did it and bought one the other day (with a $20 credit). Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit (for accelerated charging in over 200 countries)Case - you don't NEED a case, but I think it's worth investing in one.  I found one for a decent price with decent reviews.  There are several options out there.  Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", BlueMicro-HDMI out cord - you can also use any larger display with HDMI to view what's on your Kindle.  I purchased one for a few bucks.  I've found that I never use it.  Up to you.So overall, these are my detailed thoughts about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 GB.  While it's not the BEST tablet out there, I think its benefits far outweigh its deficits, so I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a tablet for a really reasonable price (especially for Amazon fans, who probably already have one already!).", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent choice for me", "Author": "Cheryl Hannah \"AspenGal\"", "ReviewID": "R2W9E6QKINW2BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have an iBrain - won an iP*d at a conference, tried using it for 3 months and sold it to a co-worker due to my frustration-factor.  I definitely prefer Android to Apple ios, I've discovered.  After much internet-searching, I decided to buy myself a 9\" Kindle FIRE HD for Christmas with some Amazon gift cards.  A very good choice on my part!  I'm already a member of the Amazon-universe (have owned 2 Kindles [2nd-gen and Touch], have the Kindle reader on my desktop PC and netbook, am a Prime member, shop Amazon quite a bit) so the FIRE has fit right in to 'my' electronic universe.I did not need or want a replacement for my desktop PC - the FIRE provides a nice alternative for access to most of the functions I want to use while traveling or at work (where many websites like YouTube and personal email sites are blocked on those computers).  I did not purchase the 3G version, since Wi-fi works for my purposes. Wi-fi is pretty widespread around the U.S.  I've had no problem accessing wi-fi while traveling internationally either, in Turkey, Ireland, Australia, since most hotels now offer free wi-fi. While traveling I like to keep track of local weather where I'm staying, home emails, US news, pay ebills while away, check out local entertainment venues, etc.  I have a small netbook which I've taken with me in the past for this purpose...now my FIRE will handle everything I did with my netbook, while being smaller and more lightweight to carry.  My 9\" FIRE fits in most of my handbags except the smaller cross-body bags.I'm not a big gamer, nor do I want to store a lot of videos or movies on my FIRE, so the 16G version works for me.  I still have 87% of my available memory left, so I CAN download a few movies for the long flight to Venice this fall.  I have watched some TV shows via the Xfinity app (our local cable company) - all but one worked very well with my home wireless router, with no stopping-and-starting or freezing of the video.  I'm a photographer, and will NOT be using the FIRE for photos since I have a nice digital camera.  It seems very awkward to me to attempt to use any tablet as a 'camera'.  That function was not important to me in my decision.The HD screen is very sharp and colorful (even my die-hard Apple friends admit '...it looks GOOD!').  The touch-screen is sensitive (although it helps to frequently clean the oily fingerprints from it - I clean it daily just before I start the overnight re-charge).  Adding my gmail email account to it was very easy, I've added the VMWare app for access to my work computer, and several other apps which I've used on my desktop PC and find work well on the FIRE also (I've reviewed many of them on the Amazon website).  I still prefer reading books on my Kindle Touch (easier to hold in my hands for a long time), but I do read on my FIRE when I'm also using it for other things (emails, YouTube, checking emails, etc).  Amazon's 'syncing' of last-page-read works very well for both devices (as long as I remember to turn on the wireless on my Kindle Touch while I'm reading).I bought the Amazon cover for my FIRE (though I choked at the $40 pricetag); it works pretty well for propping it in a horizontal alignment (although it does 'slide' flat occasionally on slick surfaces), not very good for vertical since there's no viewing angle adjustment (I seldom use it in that way, though a couple of apps display ONLY in the vertical mode).  I like how slim this cover is - doesn't add much bulk to my FIRE, and seems to protect it well.  For use at home and my job it works fine.  I'll probably buy another cover, though, once more are available for this new 9\" HD-version of the FIRE; a cover which will allow multiple angles in both the horizontal and vertical positions (I have one of those for my older 7\" Galaxy tablet, and it works very well).I ALWAYS buy at least 2 extra power cables for every electronic device I own; per other reviewer's advice, I bought the non-Amazon AC 'rapid-charger' which was half the price and works much better than trying to charge via USB.  I took the USB-only 'charging cable' which came with the FIRE to work, so I can plug my FIRE into my desktop computer while using it there.  Other reviewers are correct in stating re-charging via the USB function is VERY slow.  In fact, my FIRE tells me when I turn it on that it won't \"re-charge\" the battery while I'm using it; however, it does MAINTAIN my battery charge while in use, so at least I'm not draining it.LOVE my 9\" Kindle FIRE HD...I'm much happier with it than I was with the iP**.

What a delight to swap easily between the text and the footnotes, with just a touch!The PDF reader which comes with this works well, but has the typical issue of most PDF viewers that if you want your page size larger, you have to re-zoom each page.  I installed RepliGo PDF reader (from the Amazon store) which retains your page size as you scroll.  It also has a feature to use the volume keys (at the top, next to on/off switch) to page forward or back, which is a nice alternative to the finger-touch method.The size of this device is wonderful.  I have an ipad-sized tablet already, and it is just a bit too big for comfort, or to carry around in a handbag. Also have a 10\" netbook for reading at home, which I still cherish, but of course the size and weight cannot compare.Prediction: The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 will be a big winner longterm, and its size may well become standard for tablets.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Like a high quality paper book. As always, i find the Kindle touch screen technology to be less than perfect (that's where the 5th star went, and it made me feel guilty). But the overall performance is spectacular. And I have owned at least one of every Kindle branded eReader, and have read hundreds of books. This is a great reader.Now to other things: As a movie player, and music player, and photo display, it again is terrific. Whether it beats the latest iPad, I don't know. But it has to be close, and it is better than earlier models. (Disclaimer-I own one of the latest generation iPads with the Retina display)SO HERE IS MY ADVICE: BUY THE 32 GB VERSION, SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO EXCHANGE FOR IT LATER, LIKE I DID. The thing is good enough you will use it for all sorts of things. Let me be clear: Other than screen performance, this is NOT to say it is an iPad. That's not its purpose in life, though it obviously will do lots of things as its support system grows.It is the best eReader around, with movies, music, and photos thrown in. Just save the effort and get the 32 first time around.PS:And icing on the cake is the Kindle leather \"Standing Leather Case\". Wonderful quality, and the feel and smell of the leather is like an expensive car. I wish something that trim, and high quality was available for my iPad. So I would buy this case (Mine is in the \"tan\" color!), if for no other reason than the fact that the eReader is so thin, and slick finished that it is hard to hold.

I was contacted by Amazon via email in April about my review and they seemed to want to help but I didn't bother to get back to them.  Then this week  my music stopped playing; my videos wouldn't play and so I decided to call them even though by this time almost five months had gone by and I felt I was too late to get any help.  Not so, Amazon's customer service walked me through some easy trouble shooting and when that still didn't work they sent me a brand new one the next day with overnight shipping. So the reason I was not crazy about my Kindle was due to the fact that I had a defective model and now my new one works superbly and I am extremely happy and I can't say enough how much customer service from Amazon made the experience much more worth it.

I even made a few trips to Best Buy so I could handle and use each size to compare the two, as well as other brands.  I figured that the larger 8.9\" size was best for me because I need reading glasses now and I was a little hesitant about the smaller screen model.  I also joined Amazon Prime when I bought my Kindle and the instant videos are fantastic.  I've had my Kindle about 3 months now and I've ordered more books than I ever would have thought because there are some great low prices (for me - $3.99 and under) on many wonderful books on Amazon.  I am wary of which games I download because of permissions but am totally hooked on the few I have which were either free or cost $1.99 or less.I bought my Kindle because I was going to be starting dialysis and I didn't want to use my laptop on a shared network and of course because the Kindle Fire is so much smaller and lighter weight.  It has proved to be no problem to hold for long periods of time and is very comfortable to use.  Movies are clear and beautiful and many of the ones I watch are subtitled and those are very easy to read.  Typing on the keyboard is easy and never annoys me unlike trying to use the tiny one on my Dell Mini 9\".  I have not needed to purchase a stylus and doubt that I will.  Wiping the screen with a microfiber cloth keeps it clean and print-free, though I am very careful and protective of my Kindle.  I bought a strapless neoprene carrying case that fits perfectly into another neoprene carrying case with handles as my intention was for the Kindle to bounce when tucked inside it's protection if it ever falls and I think it just may do that.I ordered the charger with my Kindle because I didn't have any other that I could use and it is great, too and was only $10.00.  The only function that really seems to eat up battery power is playing games but in one 6 hour dialysis session, I can easily watch a movie, read a book, and play games all on one charge.The only drawback is mine, nothing to do with the Kindle.  I live very rurally and my internet connection is beyond slow, so I have to load movies when I visit friends who have high speed connections, but I just load 10 or 12 (at perhaps 2 minutes per movie) and they remain on the Kindle more than long enough for me to watch one per dialysis session (every other day).  Books load with no problem, despite my ISP.  An operator at Amazon said that he'd worked there for 9 years and never seen anyone with as slow a download speed as mine!I am enormously pleased with my Kindle Fire HD and still cannot believe I own it.

My Kindle Fire HD 8.9 arrived earlier today. I was very anxious to open the package and get my hands on this baby to see how it felt. First thing I noticed is the quality of the build. Excellent all around. I fired it up, using the optional quick charger I bought with it. Had it registered and software updated within 10 minutes or so. The images on the screen are crystal clear with vivid and true color. I played an Eric Clapton YouTube video right out of the box to see how the picture and sound quality were. Very impressive, to say the least. The speed between my WiFi and the Kindle is great. No flutter, no hiccups, just a fast and consistent connection. I surfed the web a little bit and this new Kindle HD moved effortlessly through the pages I browsed.I have many more things I want to try on this new tablet, and I'll get around to it when time allows. That said, my early impressions are WINNER WINNER Chicken Dinner. This thing is top notch. We have a first generation Kindle Fire and use the heck out of it. The new generation is everything I expected and so much more. I also bought several of the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets for family members. I fully expect they will enjoy them a bunch. I have an Apple I-Phone 4S and think it's a very good phone. I tried the I-Pad out, and while it impressed, for me, it was severely over priced given what you get. I'm not bashing the I-Pad at all, so please don't you Apple FanBoys come out and attack me en masse. LOL I know how sensitive Apple users can be. Look, they make very cool stuff, no question. My problem is this. Simply put, it's way over priced. All you have to do is look at their profit margins. For me, the new generation Kindle HD is right in my wheelhouse. It's priced very well for what it delivers. I am a BIG time Amazon junkie too. I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and have never once had a bad customer service experience. Buying the Kindle HD was a natural fit for me. I am looking forward to using it a ton.I'd like to take a second to thank Jeff Bezos and his great team for bringing us an affordable tablet with top notch quality and features too numerous to mention. I love Amazon. I'm a customer for life.More to come, stay tuned.Added this >>>>>>>>Battery life on this 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD is simply outstanding. I seriously can't believe how long the juice lasts. Outstanding!!!As I add apps to my Kindle, I am even more impressed with the flexibility of this tablet. And whoever said the app store is lacking is seriously mislead. there's a huge variety of superbly done apps.I use my Kindle a TON. I can't tell you how impressive this tablet is. And when I consider what I paid for it, I can only once again say a huge Thank you to Amazon's Team kindle. This tablet is everything and a lot more than I expected. The scary part is, I'm just getting to know it. Thank you Jeff and team.

Van Voorhees", "ReviewID": "R3B8UNCJR8TFQ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was really excited to get the new Kindle Fire HD. I use an iPhone and have iPads in the house. I also have a Kindle with keypad that I love. This new device is well made and has a beautiful display. The web browser is awesome. I was surprised at how many apps were available for the Kindle Fire. I set it up with my multiple email accounts, calendars, and contacts. This lead to my first real disappointment. It's not possible to sync my Outlook contacts or calendar from work. While I don't need this device for work, it starts getting annoying when I have to put it down and reach for my phone to see all of my calendars and contacts in one place. The next issue I had was the power button. It's hidden so well in the frame of the device that I really have to search and almost need to actually look at it to find it. What's the big deal? Well, I like the iPhone and iPad's obvious wake button because I can get to it right away without searching for it. And, since I thought this new Kindle with its backlit display would be nice for after dark reading in bed without waking my husband, I would appreciate less awkward fumbling in the dark to turn the thing on.That leads to my next complaint- this thing is too big for reading in bed. I can't lie on my side and hold it propped up with one hand comfortably. And, it's a spotlight shining at my husband's side of the bed when I do.Finally, though it has a lot of apps, most aren't free. So, to have apps I use on my iPhone or iPad on the Kindle, I have to pay. That's jarring since I've used many if them for free on the other platforms. And, the app I use most often is Facebook. The Facebook app on iPhone is annoying. But, on the Kindle Fire, it's nearly useless. And, if you think that autocorrect is frustrating on iPhone/iPad - you will be as frustrated by Kindle's auto correct spell checking feature. And, possibly frustrated with what seemed to me a slower keyboard.If I didn't have a familiarity and daily reliance on my synced email, calendars and contacts, or constant need to check FB, I'd be completely satisfied with this Kindle. Alas, I don't like putting a fancy expensive device down to use another to get information I need/want.

There are many others out there since this model has been out for quite some time.  But I will add that this device does exactly what it advertises.  If you are looking for a \"media consumption device\" then the Kindle Fire HD is for you.  It is NOT a productivity device!!  I repeat...do not buy this if you are expecting to get caught up on your spreadsheet building, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents or photo editing.  It is not designed for that nor is it marketed for that purpose.  The Kindle Fire HD is a media device and that is all.  It excels at playing high quality HD videos/movies, music, games and works wonderfully for browsing the net.  Can other devices do the same stuff and maybe even more...yes.  Can they do it at this price point...no.I have not signed up for the 4G LTE service so I can't speak to that.  I only use mine on Wi-Fi and it works great.  I got the 4G LTE model because it was so discounted as a refurb and I wanted the option of signing up for the 4G LTE service in the future.Also, if you are like me and already very involved with the Amazon ecosystem, there is no better tablet.  I believe it would still hold it's own even if your not heavily involved in the Amazon ecosystem but it probably won't be the shining star when separated from the ecosystem.  Overall, a solid 5 stars and I would recommend this to anyone ans especially people involved in the Amazon ecosystem.Oh and the refurb Kindle Fire HD that I got was new.

We haven't owned any of the previous Kindles so I have nothing to compare my experience with, but I love reading a book with the Kindle HD.  It took me forever to struggle with my feelings about e-readers because of my fear of publishing companies losing jobs, etc., compared to my wish to save some trees.  Quite a problem for my deeply held convictions, but I talked myself into it.  I LOVE IT for reading books.  Yes, I will still order books (it's the only way I can justify it in my mind) but when I've finished a book in a series and I don't have the next, or the e-book only novellas or supplements, it's great.  I can read after my husband has gone to sleep without having a light on.  Lamps never seem to put out the correct light for reading or you have to sit where you're not comfortable.  No problem with the Kindle.  You can read anywhere.  My son loves the fact he can read out of print or free books.  I got one for him especially because when he goes to college next year he will have no place to store all the books he reads.  Trust me, you can hardly find his bedroom furniture under all his stacks of books (he has filled up his bookshelves to maximum limit).  So, for college students who read a lot, it's perfect.  My husband does a lot with facebook, surfing the web, and playing solitaire.  He is thrilled he can use his Kindle as opposed to sitting with his laptop on his lap.  They're perfect.  We are all thrilled.  Just make sure you get a book so you know what all the Kindle contains.  There's a lot of stuff you won't even know you have.  It's pretty loaded.

The screen protector from the Otterbox makes the tiny hole invisible. I hadn't noticed the pin prick hole in the glass until I had already downloaded all my stuff so decided to keep the kindle since the hole has not affected the performance or appearance.I clicked on the \"web\" tab and was easily able to bookmark my favorite websites. I had no problem accessing them and didn't have any freezing problems.I purchased the DVD Hunger Games through Amazon and was delighted to find it also in my Amazon cloud. It was very easy to also download onto my Kindle device. The picture was crystal clear...truly HD quality and it was a blast to watch the movie on my kindle...speakers worked great and it also worked great with the ear phones I already had.I joined Amazon prime and loved watching the free streaming tv shows...watched the first Star trek episode and several episodes from Glee so far...all free and easy to access. Also \"borrowed\" my first book and am reading it now. Only downside to the book per month that we're able to borrow is that they're not new books.As for the \"advertising\" shown on the kindle it is ONLY on the lock screen and did not distract at all from the kIndle so save your $15 and leave it on!I've been using my Kindle since Dec 23rd and absolutely ADORE it.I highly recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 version!", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Family perfection", "Author": "Huckleberry", "ReviewID": "R1TU5XFMPUX2O2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have (too many) kids, and the youngest are not quite ready for unfiltered internet access or admin-level privileges on any device, so the deciding factor in our purchase was the Free Time.  We're a pretty digital group, with many PCs, an assortment of laptops, this Kindle, iMacs, several iPod iterations, a smaller Android tablet and a Transformer, and a very wide, full assortment of smart phones (S3, G2x etc.), so a weakling is quickly routed out and abandoned.  And yes - they are all capable of playing nicely with each other on our network (no easy feat).The Kindle is simply perfect for what it is, and performs at least as well as we had hoped.  The display is rich and compelling and the ergonomics are good.  The Amazon flavored Android is glitch free, and while some settings are veiled, with some time they can be found and optimized.  For Amazon content, it is very nearly perfect; the delivery speed is excellent and the chance of a kid or uninformed adult accidentally screwing things up is minimal.  The Free Time is what sets it apart, and in a VERY good way.  Our teenagers have Android tablets also, but the younger kids would have no idea how to manipulate settings or install anything if it involved anything more than a click, so we got this purposely for a 7 (8 in days) and a 9 y/o to be able to read books, watch appropriate videos, play some learning type games and, in a perfect world, learn something while having fun.  They continually bicker over my wife's iMac and tie up the main TV on Netflix, so we wanted to get them their own devices, namely this and a Win8 laptop.  In retrospect, the jump to W8 at the same time as adopting a distinctly flavored Android variant was a little taxing, but we're working through it.  The trades between the new laptop and the Kindle are carefully negotiated affairs, and the only user complaint is the time it takes to recharge when the battery dies (and it IS used until the battery dies every single time).The one disappointment (beside the missing SD slot we knew about beforehand) is the difficulty of accessing the PlayStore on the Kindle.  It was fairly easy to get the Amazon content onto the Asus tablets, but another thing entirely going the other way.  This brings to light the main difference between the Kindle and any other tablet; while the Android units are more or less designed to be easy to change, root, mod, and restore if it goes south, the Kindle is not.  Being under warranty has prevented  any attempt to root it, and they've done an admirable job of making the garden walls high and sturdy. I'm sure that at some point a non invasive method of getting PlayStore apps to run will be figured out, but for now (given the ages of the main users), Amazon has everything we need on this device, and with Free Time, there is very little chance they'll access inappropriate content or brick the unit itself.  We also have iProducts galore, so the notion of controlled access and throttled content is not new to us, but at the same time, there ARE some things on PlayStore that have no equivalent on Amazon, and it would be nice to be able to access them on the Kindle too.The sound is MUCH better quality than any other tablet (and 99% of the laptops), but due to the sheer number of devices in use at any given time, headphones are the norm here.The bottom line is that the display is absolutely gorgeous, the download speeds are excellent, the content is great (and growing), and the technical skills needed to use it are nil.  For tech averted adults or growing kids, this is the ideal tablet.  It never hangs, crashes or misbehaves like it's speedier, more adaptable but less stable counterparts, and Free Time alone should warrant a very close look if you have younger kids (or a technophobe) in the house.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "20 3/4 stars!", "Author": "Shanks", "ReviewID": "R3KHD2A26BLJX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife...

It crashes often. i was  being asked many times to restore tabs. There were times that the whole tablet was unresponsive while using Silk, and it reboots after 2 or 3 minutes of being frozen.  Silk slows down a lot and begins to shutdown your previously opened webpages. When you return to them it reloads everything again so you lose information you've already typed in. For example: filling out forms or cc info. The Facebook app stinks. You can only see a few posts and the rest is blued out.

The 7 inch was perfect for reading but a little small for surfing the internet. A ten inch tablet would have been to big for reading comfortably in bed but great for the internet. Amazon introduced the 8.9 inch which is perfect for reading and perfect for the internet.The only issue I had was it would not open my email due to the lack of flash player. So I had to sideload flash with the dolphin broswer. This is very simple to do and YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ROOT OR JAIL BREAK THIS TO DO THIS. So you still keep the manufactures warranty. You just have to check the box under your settings to allow 3rd party applications. Then download dolphin and flash, or safari and flash or whatever android browser you like to use as the flash will not work with the silk browser. The kindle still updates with all of amazons new updates. Picture quality is amazing, touch screen is ultra responsive, browser is very fast, and sound is clear and loud. The weight of this kindle is the same as my older first generation kindle fire, that my 2 year old now inherited.I also purchased a blue tooth keyboard and a stylus for this one so I use it like a netbook. I purchased the ad version that displays an ad everytime you take it out of sleep mode. At any time if you don't want the ads you can sign into your account and pay to have the ads removed. They don't bother me so I left the ad's on. Thank You again Amazon for another amazing kindle.

Great value for the money!I bought one for myself and one for my 26 year old daughter and we're both very pleased. We decided we didn't need a full featured tablet, since we already have powerful ultra-light notebooks and top-of-the-line smartphones, so this fit nicely into our needs. Great as an eBook reader, with very good media options for listening, watching, and generic internet access (including emails).The initial set-up of the Kindle HD Fire was fast, easy, and intuitive. My daughter & I both downloaded books from Amazon's library and were impressed at the ease & speed. I downloaded a 6 novel set of Tom Clancy books (7-12) in a matter of seconds. We also \"upgraded\" the Kindle to 32GB, paid $15 more for the \"without special offers\" option, and glad we did.The only (minor) complaint I have is the PowerFast charger is extra and not included in box, Fortunately I already knew this, with some advanced research, and we made sure to buy the charger (at a discounted price) with when buying the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".

I might have given the tablet 5 stars if it were not for the ads and plugin charger. Note to Amazon: just increase the price up front and take care of these two complaints.My family has five Kindle products (Keyboard, Paperwhite, Fire, Fire HD 7\" and, of course, the Fire HD 8.9\") and we like all five especially the Fire HD's. On the 8.9\" the extra screen size really makes watching movies more enjoyable and reading is better. I was really surprised by how much more I enjoyed reading because of the screen size (not to mention the HD resolution). It is just easier on the eyes. The new screen also has less reflection than the old Fire.The camera addition is a good one. We enjoy using Skype for family contact and find the camera resolution to be very good.The dolby sound on the 8.9\" is great. You can enjoy movies, music or games without earbuds and/or sound boosters. The dynamics are super, too.As this tablet has the best processor of the Kindles it is more responsive even though I find surfing the web to be a bit sluggish at times. Still a nice improvement over lesser Kindle models as one would expect.This is a good size for a tablet for the things noted above, but I find it a bit large and heavy for reading in bed. You will agree if you doze off as I did and have it thunk you in the head. That is where the Paperwhite shines with its reduced weight and size.Overall, my impressions of the Fire HD 8.9\" are very favorable and I recommend it if you are not tied to the Apple world.

Netflix performs very well which is consistent with what other reviewers have reported.Rather than go with the $499 and ATT plan, it has made more sense to use my smart phone's Hotspot feature so I can browse the web when I don't have WIFI available.My advice to prospective buyers is to define your goals and make sure the kindle features line up with what you are trying to do.  Also, read the description of what you are getting so we don't get any more reviews complaining the charger is not thrown in and you the kindle doesn't support flash.

I could not blog for hours on nuances of android operating systems or systemic differences between Nexus 7 vs. Fire HD.  I am the average user that wants a tablet but hates to be tied to Apple and its runaway proprietary chain that comes with all of their products.  I had the original Kindle and the subsequent Fire and I liked both for what they were, simple...more so for Kindle, a little less so for the Fire.  The Fire was buggy.  I have found my Fire HD is also buggy.Problems:Web Browser: I received the notice that my web browser was not responding, this happened 7 times within a few minutes until I was forced to restart my browser.  It was a nuisance out of the gate when I am simply trying to read the news.Google:  It appears the only way I am able to voice/video chat is through Skype, which means I have to subscribe to another service and pay a fee for a number.  I know Skype is great and useable around the globe...so is Google+/video chat.  There is no Amazon App to use Google+/video chat.  Also the web browsing version is scaled down to the point where I cannot actually web chat through the browser.LTE:  My mistake but, I thought part of the increased payment for the HD W/4G LTE was the initial year of 4G service for $50.00; a great deal.  I did not know that I still had to pay the $50 after the fact.  Small sure, but all these small things begin to compound.Not problems:The screen is so much more vivid.  External controls are a major plus.  Sound is fantastic, and battery life is quite good.So if the above problems do not factor against you, I think you will be pretty happy with the Fire HD.  If you are like me and stopped using ITunes, have a Prime account, and order almost everything from Amazon, the HD is a great purchase. Unfortunately Fire HD is less functional than I need it to be.  Otherwise it is a great piece of gear and you should Fire HD!Some updates after further use:Problem:Power and Volume Buttons: Simply put they are too close, I shut off the screen a couple time while trying to adjust the volume.  Perhaps in the next iteration, these buttons are on either side of the tablet.Not Problems:Ads:  I have noticed the ads but not found them to be a major distraction to my use of the Fire HD.  I get the ad at start up and I believe I have seen the ad one other time but it was not a distraction from my overall Fire activities.Silk:  Since the initial bugginess, I have not experienced any further problems...I don't browse a lot with the Fire (thus far).  I am a creature of habit and go to the same sites or apps over and over again.Apps: yes, I do miss some of my Apple Apps, mostly I miss AutoBlog.  I am not a real car guy but that app excited me because it distills the important car info that has come out without having to trek through a dense website.  Other apps, I don't miss and most of the good ones I get: Stumble upon, Flipboard, Shazam, etc...Google integration:  I like the instantaneous integration on my Google calendar, address book, Gmail throughout my Samsung galaxy III Smartphone, Fire HD, and Apple Computer.

So let's talk pro's & con's between the Original Kindle Fire 7\" and the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9PRO'S:*Bigger Screen*Vibrant HD Display*Slimmer design & more comfortable to hold.*TV & Movie's sound amazing with the dolby audio.*The keyboard is bigger and more comfortable to use. And now it even underlines your miss spelled words in red so you can correct them!*Amazon Silk browser is faster & more compatible with different websites. On the older model some websites wouldn't cooperate and let me scroll so I would have to use Opera Mini browser to get around that.*Volume controls on the outside now!*Speakers are spaced out better*Finally a webcam & mic to Skype or take pictures and videos.*HDMI connector.CON'S:*No more Adobe Flash. Which means I can't view videos on some websites, because Adobe is no longer making it for Android or mobile devices. Which means on older websites that still use flash instead of HTML5 you cannot view videos. (Original Kindle Fire had flash installed).*Certain games that you may have purchased for the original are not compatible yet with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  (Facebook App is not loading newsfeed correctly on the 8.9, it stops loading after about 12 newsfeed updates).*Silk Browser seems to crash more often if you have 'Accelerate Pages' box checked in browser options. (Maybe an update will address this).*TV & Movies sound amazing with the dolby audio, but I found playing music through the speakers didn't have the same quality. And there's no equalizer in the newer model.*Lot's of Ad's. Supposedly you can pay $15 to disable all the ad's permanently. But, I did find in settings/applications you can turn off some of the recommendations. The only thing you can't disable is the ad's that show up on the screen when it's locked.All in all I'm quite happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9.

The color is fantastic, sound is great and have learned very quickly how to navigate on it.  The only thing I don't like is the carousel.

For all you guys used to electronics you are going to think I am sooooo dumb but I am going to be honest as maybe someone else out there has the same issues.Package arrived and I was so excited, I bought this mainly to skype with my family in Europe but also to have internet at home. Well turned it around and looked everywhere, could not find the on/off button! Nothing on this tablet is obvious if you have not experienced a tablet before.I do not have the luxury of young ones at home to help me I had to figure this out by myself. As I had paid with foreign currency, even thought the kindle was delivered to an American address, it was all set up for a British user.

Using the screen is awful, as someone said it keeps typing wrong letters and no matter how careful you are it still does it when you are hitting the correct key, words and forgetting spaces!!!! This is not user error as I spend all my day on a keyboard and know it well.....I ended up bringing it in to work and let our techie look at it to try and help me out.

Using Amazon prime to shop and watch videos is totally a pleasant experience. Using the micro hdmi cable plugged in your TV is an amazing feature to watch videos. Performance is OK, not the fastest tablet but for reading a book, watch movies and shop Amazon goods you don't really need a huge power house, and it is not expensive compared to other tablets. It has a vivid screen with excellent resolution ideal for reading books and magazines and watch photos and movies in full HD. I like the speakers a lot, they aren't very loud but sound quality is way superior to other tablets I have. So far this device has become my primary tablet, I use it every day to read the news, emails, books and browse the web instead of using my smartphone.The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because unfortunately the tablet is still plagued with bugs and crashes easily with the Silk browser. So far the bugs that I have caught are the following:+ The Silk browser delivers a very bad user experience. It crashes very often even if you just leave the tablet idle while reading a webpage, you will be asked many times to reload your tabs. In some cases, the whole tablet is unresponsive while using Silk, and it reboots after 2 or 3 minutes of being frozen. If you try to open more than two websites with the tabs, Silk slows down significantly and begins to shutdown your previously opened webpages (when you return to them it reloads everything again so you lose track of what where you doing) this is really bad if i.e. you are filling a form or making a payment (you need to enter all the information again), I would expect this behavior to happen when you open around 5 or 6 websites to prevent running out of memory perhaps, but not 3 tabs. You can side load Dolphin browser to mitigate these issues, however there is no excuse of why Silk performs so poorly.+ The keyboard input has a considerable lag, you can't write too fast since it will begin to miss key inputs, this forces you to write slowly (lag is less/more depending on the application you are using). Also something quite annoying I found is if I press the space key in the left/right edges while in landscape (just below, the 'x' and the 'b' keys respectively) it doesn't register any input even if you get the sound feedback you did press the key, to make it work you need to press around the center of the key.+ If I transfer 1080p videos from my smartphone they don't play properly. However 720p videos work fine.+ Sometimes the calendar app is shown as a gray empty rectangle in the carrousel instead of showing the correct date.+ It happened to me that while using the Shop application and the Silk browser sometimes I see black rectangles randomly in the screen (seems like a rendering issue from the graphics processor), most of the time going to the homescreen and returning to the app fixes the issue. In the case of Silk, reloading the webpage makes the trick.In summary, the tablet excels at watching movies, reading magazines, reading books, playing games and shopping amazon goods. Up to date it performs poorly as a web browser so if this is your priority task you may need to look for another tablet or wait until this is fixed by Amazon (I would rate 5 stars if the previous bugs where not present).Note: All the issues above have been reported already to Amazon, hopefully they create an update to fix them.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Nat", "ReviewID": "R2EPYHSU6PH8LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought this would be daunting, book to read, all kinds of technical stuff, nothing.....you just need to sit with it, play with it and in a couple of hours you're moving around like a pro...very simple for someone who is technically challanged like me.

In my opinion, these tablets were best value compared to others I looked at while shopping for tablets.Screen operation is smooth and seamless. For the most part, things were pretty user friendly as the initial start-up of the units took us through a simple tutorial of the basic function.My only \"con\" to this product was the USB cable that was supplied with the unit which is the primary charging cord for the tablet. Neither unit would charge off the packaged USB cable. After 3 calls to Amazon Customer service I had come to the conclusion that if this was working as intended, I was going to re-package both units and send them back to Amazon for a full refund. If I couldn't charge the tablets with the supplied USB cables, there was no point in keeping them.As was always the case with Amazon, they were willing to supply us with the adapters that plugged into the walls at no cost to us. I am no expert but I have come to the conclusion the USB power stream is not enough to push power into the Kindle Fire 8.9\" battery.  You may convince me of that if it were not for the fact that I had two brand new units, both with the same charging problems. This may be something Amazon will wish to address in the near future.As long as the outlet adaptor and cable they are sending me work in charging this device, I will gladly recommend it's purchase to anyone.

Of course, this is just my opinion, and it really depends on what you use it for, but I will point out a few of the contrasts between the two in my opinion.  First, obviously since the 8.9 has a bigger screen, I found it more difficult to use for games, because the screen is larger and to swipe or slide your finger around the screen requires you to cover more real estate, so to speak, and therefore it's a bit more tedious.  I also found it to be less responsive than the 7\" version.  I found myself having to tap or slide sometimes more than once on the 8.9, which never happens on the 7.I understand the the screen resolution is higher on the 8.9, but quite honestly, I really can't tell the difference, even when watching high def movies or videos.  If there is a difference, to me it's not really noticeable.  One other downside is it really takes a long time to charge.  of course a bigger screen requires a bigger battery which explains the extended charge time, but for me, I am always on the go, so I don't always have 8 to 12 hours to wait for it to charge.  Also, the 7 fits in my pocket and I mostly can't even tell it's there most of the time.  The 8.9 is of course bigger and more cumbersome.So, my bottom line is that if you watch a lot of videos and a larger screen is a must, then go with the 8.9.  Otherwise, I prefer the 7 for everything else, including the price.  So for me, that's what I do with them.  Watch videos on the 8.9, and use the 7 on the go and for everything else.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst product I've ever bought through amazon", "Author": "Jay O", "ReviewID": "R1HKRJJH8RXVTR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been a long time customer so I THOUGHT the HD kindle would be a good investment.

I did a lot of research before making this decision.First, I ruled out Apple because I don't like Apple so my research did not include them other than a comparison of the Kindle Fire to the iPad 7.My only previous experience with a tablet has been my HP Touchpad, which I got in the fire sale. I loaded Android ICS on it and for the most part it worked fine.  My wife had one as well but both started getting buggy and I wanted a `real' device.After doing a lot of reading on forums and tech sites about `the best Android tablet' I narrowed the choice to two: the Kindle 8.9 and the Asus TF300. Both fell into my price range and got good reviews.What the TF300 had going for it was being a 10\" tablet running Android. What it had going against it was a proprietary charging system (not mini usb) and some reports of bugginess. The charging thing ultimately killed it in my mind. I have tons of mini usb chargers in my house so I can plug in practically anywhere. And when I travel, I only need one charger for my tablet and phone.So I took a leap of faith and went with the Kindle 8.9. My impressions over the last couple of weeks:The screen is smaller than a 10\" tablet, but it plays Netflix and Hulu at the size as my Touchpad does because there is less letter-boxing top/bottom, so that isn't a problem. It did take me a week or so to get used to a smaller screen when visiting websites though.The first day I had my Kindle, Silk (Kindle's web browser) crashed every.single.time I tried to use it. I rebooted and I've only had one crash in the last two weeks. My wife also has a Kindle 8.9 and has never reported a Silk crash happening to her. Others have noted this problem so hopefully a patch will coming along at some point.Amazon did their own thing and layered over Android. The App store isn't as large as Android and many of the apps I had free on Android cost on Kindle because the vendor only offers the pay version. Not a deal breaker given the general cost of apps and you can side load apps if you really want to. \"I Love My Kindle (fire)\" is a good blog about the fun things that can be done with a Kindle Fire.It is smaller and lighter than my Touchpad. The screen is amazing and it has good sound overall. It's a very responsive device; opening apps quickly. I've had no problems with any apps.Battery life is amazing. I find myself forgetting when I charged it last, even after streaming movies.You have to buy an outlet charger separate. It's $19.99 but sometimes you can get it for $9.99. I assume not including one was a way to keep costs down but seems silly.I bought one without ads. My wife has the ads and doesn't mind them but it kind of annoyed me. Costs $15 so it may or may not be worth it to you.Since we have a Prime account, the integration with Amazon is really nice. I can easily access all my books and videos from the top menu bar. No more logging into Amazon to get to my videos and I don't have to open the kindle app to get to my books. These are all a swipe away.The Kindle has its own desktop, using a carousel and bookshelf. The thing I don't like about this is everything gets ordered by last use, making locating things a bit of a challenge because they are never in the same place. But there is a \"favorites\" where you can put stuff so this isn't a big deal.  And if you really hate it, you can side load a program that gives you the Android option of multiple screens. I initially hated the carousel and bookshelf but have gotten used to them.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for most needs", "Author": "S.

In choosing a new one I considered what I actually wound up using my old tablet for. That turned out to be primarily as reading tablet using the Kindle app, light web surfing and social networking while watching TV or traveling and as a music streaming device. Although I have my Android smart phone loaded with apps I used relatively few on my old tablet. The Kindle seemed a good fit for the price essentially splitting the difference between a reader and a tablet. I chose the WIFI version because I didn't want another charge from my wireless company and found with my old tablet that I could usually find access to a WIFI connection when I wanted to use it. To get the most use out of it one does have to commit to a content relationship with Amazon but there is no fees or contract; just pay as you go. If you already buy your content on Amazon it's really no change. It's cheaper and more flexible than being joined at the hip with Apple ITunes etc.Pros:* The HD Screen has beautiful resolution and streams video nicely.* The lightweight .5 device is a manageable size that has enough real estate to read,  view video, or view photos while still light and comfortable in the hands.* Works well as a Reader, Web surfing and Email as well as social networking and of course shopping on Amazon.Cons:* The User interface is kind of tacky and commercial reminding you constantly that you are connected to Amazon.* App availability is and will be low* Like most tablets it is awkward to view and manage documents.All in all a good fit for me and I suspect many usersUpdate 1/29/2013: I have lived with and traveled with the device and am still reasonably happy with my choice.Pros:* Performs well, no crashes so far.* Ease  in accessing content is excellent* Great for streaming videoCons* The Carousel Home screen interface is REALLY REALLY ANNOYING. Every one I know with a Kindle hates it. It quickly clutters the home screen with an icon for every book, app or website you have visited even once. It cannot be turned off and individual icons have to be removed one at a time; a very tedious process. This is a user unfriendly coercive feature that I hope Amazon will get rid of and soon. It sucks the joy out an otherwise pleasant device.The user blogs are chock full of others who feel the same way but I ahve yet to find a satisfactory remedy if there is one.* The power an volume contact switches are poorly marked, difficult to see/find, and have such a shallow detent that they can be deployed inadvertently.

I did a side-by-side comparison with my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I froze the pictures in the same spot while streaming. The Kindle HD won hands down.The build is very solid, however this Pro comes with a caveat (see below).The software, with one exception (see below) is very solid-responsive and quick.The sound quality through the on-board speakers or through headphones is quite good. The Cons:It boots up slowly.It is too heavy, in my opinion, in relationship to it's size. It has a smaller footprint than the Tab or the iPad, but weighs more (the caveat mentioned in Pros).Buttons are too small, poorly placed, and unresponsive, in my opinion.The software issue I mentioned in Pros was the email app. I use Gmail and the interface presented in the mail app is lacking in functionality and lacks the simplicity Gmail usually presents.It takes a LONG time to recharge, even plugged in to the wallNo access to the Play Store. I realize it's a closed system but it is too closed. Apps I use often that I am unable to access on the Kindle include:DropBox, Directv, Delta, an actual Gmail app, Google drive, Logitech Alert, American Express, and Scrabble. Summary:A well built, albeit heavier machine. As mentioned, the picture, sound and content purchase options are great. The buttons need work, the apps need work, the closed system needs work.

On balance its actual performance should please some, displease some and mostly be found a welcome addition for those whose digital world is centered in the Amazon eco-system.  It all rather depends on what you are looking for--- even within the Amazon system.  As an owner of the iPad's every generation, a couple of iterations of various android tablets, iPods/iPhones and the odd e-reader, including the original kindle, I believe I have a better grasp than many on the real world factors which judge success and failure in such devices generally.Without trying to reinvent the wheel in this review or go too far afield in measurements and techno-speak, I feel a select group of factors are to the point particularly with this specific item and I will confine comments to those, so that a concise and understandable comparison with not only choices of other devices, but most importantly the unique and singular needs this one fulfills best.Specific factors: size, screen quality, form factor, durability, flexibility, value (cost/what you get) and continued satisfaction in longterm.This version of the Kindle has a number of capabilities: as a limited personal computing device for web-surfing, document handling and light office duty, as an ebook reader, streaming media player, etc., but not to get into the weeds of such a shopping list I will jump to the end and simply state that what it is or should be seen as is as a media player which occasionally is used for some of these other  tasks.  A laptop, even a lightweight and inexpensive ultra-book is going to do office jobs and web-surfing better, a couple of tablets, most notably the Nexus and the iPad are more flexible and higher powered for running apps, with greater libraries of apps to draw on even.  A smartphone is lighter and more portable.  However--beginning with a screen that is absolutely comparable with the deservedly touted retina display, a nimble combination of hardware components that make for stellar responsiveness-- especially for those persons within the Amazon Prime family, this tablet leaves all others in the dust for the breadth of high quality media (movies predominantly) delivered.As a streaming media device the amount of storage is of relatively minor impact as what is left of the baseline 16 gigs should absolutely be more than enough for a few apps, pictures, a moderately robust collection of audio books, books and music (think of this device as the equivalent of your everyday carry bag or commuter backpack for your media).  Since you are streaming your movie content from Amazon and have an infinite storage space for your Amazon content: books, audio books and music; you really shouldn't be storing much on it.If you are more about a purse or a briefcase or if what you are predominantly doing is reading ebooks then you need to look to the 7\" little brother with its lower price, as the greater real estate of the 8.9 inch doesn't do for you or doesn't appreciably add, respectively.  Similarly, if your primary thrust is for your children, since it is easier in smaller hands and comes with all of the same services, the smaller/less expensive version is your sweet spot.It feels solid and sturdy, much more so than a number of similarly sized android tablets.  It has a nicely finished surface for gripping and has an edge to edge glass screen which is scratch resistant and tolerably low in reflective glare.  Though some reports have contested the claim of its speedy wifi connectivity, for streaming video it is second to none and flawless with no discernible stuttering, freezing or hiccuping for buffering.  The pricey, optional Amazon tablet cover/case preserves all the physical aspects of the tablet including its svelte lines, further extending its durability without turning it into a giant plastic brick.Finally, while including most every nicety you find on other tablets bluetooth, hdmi out, support for Exchange based corporate email, Skype and social media integration--- it adds a few of its own, Amazon specific extras like Read to me, Whispersync, integration into the Amazon shopping experience including product suggestions etc, the new X-ray function for most consumable content, a huge lending library of free books and a gigantic and heavily discounted textbook rental library-- making overall value untouchable (again for those in the Amazon system) by any of its tablet competitors.The single, largest deficit is the battery life.  While an improvement on the earlier version of the Fire, the 10 hour claim is pure marketing fantasy.  One of the real pluses, its thinness, doesn't leave enough room for a sufficiently sized battery. The real world battery usage will run between 6-71/2 hours depending on screen brightness being set anywhere from 50-100%.  While minimally acceptable, in the age of similar devices running in excess of 10 hours, this is far from ideal. On the flip side of that, with the speedy charger (which should be free, but isn't) the recharge time from near 0 to fully charged is considerably under the 5 hours they promise---taking roughly 3 1/2 hours or around 2 1/2 hours for 80%.The single biggest asset of the device is Amazon, itself.  Its track record, its overall services, but most of all its customer service--which in my considered opinion is not only light years ahead of its nearest rival, Apple, but in a consumer world of deception, built in obsolescence and recorded telephone loops...the closest thing to absolute perfection any of us will ever see from a business.  For this alone you may bank on the long term reliability and value of your purchase.Final thoughts:  I underscore that this is a media streaming device, if your primary thrust is something else, look elsewhere (though as an affordable electronic babysitter or a way of cutting textbook costs it may likewise prove the singular touchstone for those strongly of those needs).  The 4G LTE option is potentially a killer for Amazon, but not as it exists now.  Until Amazon can work out a deal with a cellular provider based upon the muscle of their client base so that an unlimited or at least a very large allotment per month (5-10 gigs) for a reasonable, flat yearly charge, it is all but useless.  For a media streaming device, what does the present allotment buy you in terms of streaming--1/2 of one movie?  Why would you pay double for the LTE version, essentially so you could do email and download that book which you JUST can't put off another 15 minutes until you reach home, office, Starbucks or the train? I don't think so!!If there were a percentage rating possible I would have given something in the mid to upper 80s, even with the very disappointing battery life, but with stars it has to be 4 until that one problem is substantially solved.

I bought it as a viable and inexpensive alternative to the iPad (which I now have but more on that later).  I found it very intuitive and easy to use.  Aesthetically it is very nice, clean and durable, although I don't like the position of the power button nor the position of the power port.  Many times I've accidentally pressed the power button while moving the device and because of where the plug in for the power is I can't set up the Kindle landscape while it's charging.  Within the first week I had a problem with it.  I would be watching something or doing something and it would shutoff.  After referring to the forum I found out the problem was the case.  I called Amazon and their customer service was superb.  They sent me a new case right away with a return shipping label for the defective case and that fixed the problem.  They requested me to ship the defective case back by a certain date or I'd be charged for it ($50).  I actually missed the date which was about a week or two from the date I received it (I know, my fault).  But they still didn't charge me.  In fact, they sent me another notice giving me an extension.  I made the second date and everything was fine.  The Kindle Fire HD was great for watching videos, checking e-mails and reading ebooks.  It wasn't until I tried to watch programs via Comcast.net that I experienced my first problem.  Apparently, Kindle is missing an essential Adobe Flash Player for watching certain things via a web browser.  I think you can download it but I never looked into it much.  It was a bummer but not that big of a deal.  Well, that also affected Youtube viewing, for which there is a terrible app.  So, speaking of apps... that was the true killer.  Kindle has a terrible app selection and some of them don't work well.  Even though Kindle is an Android device it doesn't allow access to the same App market as other Droid devices (I read that it has something to do with not paying Google that extra money).  So Amazon has a slightly different version of a lot of the popular apps and/or it may not have the app at all.  That really sucked.  It was at that point I decided that I'd get the iPad instead.  In summary, I think the Kindle is great if 1.) you're an Amazon Prime member (as I am) or you peruse Amazon.com a lot (as I do) or 2.) you're using it for videos, books and e-mails.  The Kindle is not so good if you are a heavy app user or if you watch things via your browser.****UPDATE*****This is an update per one of the comments (or only comment).  The app I can think of right away that didn't work for me was the Despicable Me Minion game.  Another app I had issues with was Monopoly.  Besides the fact I couldn't play Monopoly with others in the house because they have Apple devices, it didn't work well for me.

Overall, I am happy with the purchase because it does what it does extremely well...but it doesn't do EVERYTHING!It does everything EXCEPT:1) Replace a camera. The built-in camera is only front-facing, which means it is designed for Skyping or taking photos of your own  face. It is prohibitively annoying to try to photograph anything else, especially if the object has text on it, which will photograph backwards, like a mirror. You will not be able to transfer photos directly from your camera to the Kindle with a PC in between or an expensive eye-fi sd card.2) Because the Kindle doesn't natively support Adobe Flash you'll do a lot of jumping through hoops to view a lot of web content without finding and using external apps. It's rather difficult sometime to upload things from the Kindle to the cloud without a PC in between.3) It has a lot of great apps, but not all Android apps work. There are some workarounds if you're at least a little computer savvy and good at searching the web4) No matter what the hype says, the battery in the 8.9 can't handle the load. It runs down much quicker than the 7\" and takes FOREVER to charge, even with the much hyped special Kindle charger. Lots of crap is going on in the background that you don't realize.

I would also highly reccommend that you have an Amazon Prime account, otherwise you won't be able to fully utilize this tablet.You have have read reviews complaining about the advertising, that had me somewhat skeptical to begin with, but the complainers neglect to mention the advertisements are only on the locked screen. Whenever you turn on the kinle you see an advertisement and an unlock Icon. Once you swipe into your home screen there are no more ads to worry about. To me this isn't a big deal, and occasionally the ads are very interesting, such as a book or movie that Amazon wants to reccommend.As far as screen clarity, I can't tell a difference between this an ANY of the Ipads I have used (I haven't used the newest Ipad air yet) and the resolution is crystal clear. The volume is impressive for a device this size, and its amazingly light weight. I was suprised by how little it weighed when i first picked it up. The battery is impressive, when they say it lasts ten hours they mean it. I watched 6 hours of a TV series from the netflix app over 2 days without charging it, and still had about 20% battery life left.If you are new to the world of tablets and aren't going to be a \"power user\" this should be more than enough for you, and at a price that is much better than most of the other's out there.  Just remember to buy the \"Amazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter for Accelerated Charging\" (the adapter to allow you to charge from an outlet rather than your computer) because it doesn't come standard with it.ENJOY!!", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my kindle but battery life short!", "Author": "Laura Loyd", "ReviewID": "RJGS5MG8XBNTL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my new kindle, it is great for surfing, games checking email in a flash.

They only appear when you turn on the Kindle and once you unlock it they don't reappear.I took my time deciding which Kindle to purchase. I finally decided to buy the 8.9. I expected that it would do so much that it would replace my laptop, I was extremely disappointed within an hour of using it. It seemed that I could have gotten the same benefit with the $69 Kindle reader. Then it happened--Amazon began sending me offers for additional Apps--now I can do so much with it.There are many, many free Apps--games, printing, streaming, etc., etc. etc., so explore those first. I also got \"tokens\" for buying it that I can use to buy more apps. I'm also trying Amazon Prime for 30 days--movie and TV program streaming, but still undecided about it.I like that my Kindle has built in speakers, a great picture--I find it sharper than my HD TV. I leave the music playing in the background, while I explore other apps. Now what to do with my laptop???If you are buying this for a child, don't set up the \"one-button payment\" feature. It is easy to run up a large bill.You'll need to buy a charger, because it only comes with the USB cable.The next challenge was getting a case for it, without breaking the bank. I'm still waiting for the one I decided upon--$5.95 vs. another I saw for $54, so I can't make a recommendation right now. I also bought a stylus, because I hate to see fingerprints on my screen and because I press the wrong links when using my fingers. I sent for the Marware Stylus, based on reviews. It is expensive--$15, but sounds like the best one. I'll review it when I get it.I recommend assessing what you will do with the Kindle and using the comparison feature on Amazon, before buying.

Hanenberg \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RFVTDEVOCAD73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For normal reading I use the Kindle Paperwhite.  I like the fact that it looks like paper.  Like paper it depends on an external source of light.  I do not like reading on screens where the light shines at me from behind the screen.Which is what the Kindle Fire does.  However, the Paperwhite is not useful for books which are colorful, or which have irregular fonts or complex formatting.  I originally bought the Kindle Fire because I wanted to own a certain book on plants.  This book was full of pictures.  A friend of mine owned it, but I could not find another copy anywhere.  It was an old book and out of print, the author had long since died and there was no copy in any library in the state of California and none for sale anywhere on the internet.So I borrowed my friend's book, bought a Kindle Fire and scanned the entire book into a group of PDF files.  There is a fine app for viewing pdf files on the Kindle Fire.  The photographs were perfectly clear, and using my fingers with a reverse pinching motion, I could enlarge any part of a photograph.  You could get the same effect with a paper book using a magnifying glass, but this was easier.Later I found similar uses for the Kindle Fire.  I had always wanted to own a facsimile of the First Folio, but I never could bring myself to buy one.  However, there is a free pdf file of the First Folio on the internet.  Now I have it on my Kindle Fire.  To my surprise, I found it was more satisfying to read King Lear in the First Folio than in a modern, annotated version.  I had also wanted for a long time to own a facsimile of a medieval book called the Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry, but it would have been too expensive to buy one.  I could not find the whole thing on the internet, but a found a part of it as a pdf file, and now can look at it on the Kindle Fire.  Or: I was helping my nephew apply to college.  It turns out to be an easy thing to download an entire college handbook of several hundred pages, and read it in its original formatting.  Later I wanted a government report on the economic value of college majors.  They give this out for free as a pdf file, and with the Kindle Fire I could read the whole 200 page book in its original formatting.I read magazines on the Paperwhite.  But certain graphs, tables and pictures do not show up in the Kindle Paperwhite.  Images, even at their best, loose much of their value on the Paperwhite. Sometimes, as in the Economist's edition for the Paperwhite, the images are skipped altogether.  I keep finding something like \"See figure 1\" and there is no figure 1.  Or, you might have a tabulation, but when you zoom in on it, all you get is a blank screen.So when I find it absolutely necessary to look at a graph, table or image, I open the same magazine in the Kindle Fire, which has no trouble displaying any image, tabulation or graph.The Kindle Fire is also a tablet.  Young people will like it for this reason.  You can do many of the things you do on a laptop, such as write documents and send emails.  I read my email in the morning, and look at the weather forecast, before turning on my computer.  But I do not do complicated work on it.Movies are a joy on this machine.  Netflix (the movies which are streamed) and Amazon's Prime videos come through flawlessly.  I find the speakers of the Kindle Fire adequate for most movies.The main problem, aside from the fact that the Kindle Fire is useless in bright light and irritating when reading long texts, is that it is heavy when reading in certain positions.  I like to read lying on my back, but the Kindle Fire is too heavy to hold in front of my eyes for very long (I have the larger 8.6 inch display).So I bought a stand to support it (\"LEVO Deluxe iPad Floor Stand for all iPads Galaxy Xoom Nook and Other eBooks and Tablets\").  You can attach any eBook to this stand.  I often fix the Kindle Fire to the stand, which has a long arm which can position the device at any point in space.

Instead of a general review (of which there are already too many to read) I am posting some specific comments on the micro HDMI port.The FireHD has a micro USB not a mini USB port. I think the micro tends to be used more by tablets and smartphones and the mini tends to be used more by cameras and videocams.The micro HDMI port on the Kindle Fire HD does not deliver audio, it delivers high definition video only I don't know whether this is a limitation of the micro HDMI specification but in any case Amazon has elected to crippl the FireHD HDMI capability to video only. Like so many limitations it is probably related to \"protecting\" digital content \"property rights.\" Amazon has never claimed that the micro HDMI port delivers audio but you sure have to dig deep to find this out...Amazon markets the HDMI capability of the Fire HD 8.9\" to gamers and movie watchers and says nothing about its value for other uses.  One nice feature of Kindle Fire HD's HDMI implementation is that it does deliver the text of Kindle books to a large screen; at least it does on my setup. Before I bought my Fire HD 8.9\" I called Amazon Kindle support to specifically ask about this and after some earnest fumbling about they said it probably does not. Lo and behold, when my Fire HD 8.9\" arrived I found that it does. This was a very nice surprise as one of my main uses for My Fire HD is \"immersion reading\" and it's great to \"follow the bouncing ball\" on a large screen  When I'm doing this I rely on either bluetoth or the headphone jack (analog out) to hear the \"professional narration.\"", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Made for Amazon Prime", "Author": "Daniel M.

If you have thick fingers the stylus will be used often. Still looking for a separate bluetooth mouse. Really don't want to use a trackpad that is part of a keyboard. I have made my investment into the world of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and so far I am not disappointed. Right price, right size screen, good audio quality. And when I don't have an available Wifi connection, I use FoxFi on my Droid 4.

I waited over a week to do this review because I didn't want it to be compromised due to my overall excitement. I was tied between a kindle fire HD and an iPad mini. After doing some research and making my pro/con list, kindle won due to its affordable price, I even got the 32GB. I am a huge fan of amazon and already own a kindle keyboard. Not really a fan of apple, the only apple product I own is an iPod touch that I got over 4 years ago.The display of the kindle fire HD is AH-MAZING. I was blown away at the crisp display. It makes everything look good, even the font! I find myself watching movies/shows on it rather than my 46 inch screen TV because I am just mesmerized by the display. There are plenty of apps. Since I don't own many apple products I don't have anything else to compare the apps too, but I am satisfied with what is given. Reading on the kindle fire is amazing as well, I am an avid reader so this is a huge plus. Upgrading from the kindle keyboard to the fire's back light did take some adjusting but after a day or two of reading I was comfortable with it. It has pretty cool features too such as seeing how much of the book is left displayed on the bottom of the screen and it also states up many more minutes till the next chapter! As well as some other new kinks. The speakers are nice and clear, although I wish they were a bit louder, I understand it's not suppose to be a stereo but slighter volume would of been a plus. The web experience is very nice, but it does lack flash. I heard there is a way around that, but it doesn't bother me (yet). Since I got the kindle (about 8 days ago) the web page crashed only once and that's because I had a lot of things going on at once (7+ pages open + pandora)...They don't include a charger in the package which I think was a HUGE mistake on amazons part. The Amazon Kindle Power Fast adapter is a NECESSITY unless you want to wait 16+ hours to get your kindle charged. I used my other kindle adapter and only had it changed at 50% after 9 hours and drained to 15% after two hours of use. The very next day I went and got this charger, now it takes 6-7 hours for a full charge and the charge can last an entire day to two days depending on what you are using the kindle for.Since I got the kindle fire HD I also signed up for amazon prime to get the full experience. There are plenty of free shows and movies to watch! I just wish the kindle lending wasn't restricted to one book per month :(Overall I give this product a 4.5 rating and recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE My Kindle!", "Author": "Delisa Renideo", "ReviewID": "R1U6KNBWN5WR30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had 3 other Kindle's and loved them all, but this one is great for the way I use it.I still use my original Kindle Fire when reading in bed because it is easier to hold than this bigger Kindle.However, there are some wonderful things I love about this Kindle. I use it as my portable computer.  I take it with me into the kitchen and I can listen or watch various webinars or other programs I subscribe to. I hook it up to a speaker system in order to hear it better, although the speakers in the Kindle are much better than the ones in my Kindle Fire.I use it to check my email, and I can also easily respond to my email because I bought the Belkin Keyboard and Case, so it's much easier to type on it than with the virtual keyboard.One thing I DON'T like is that it isn't designed to be able to use Flash, and I use that a lot to access the videos in the webinars.  I was finally able to access Flash using a work-around. I had to go to YouTube to find out how!  I ended up downloading Dolphin as my browser so I could download Flash. I now have it and it works great, but it sure seems like it should have been integrated into the Kindle from the beginning.I love the portability of the Kindle, especially since I use it as a computer much of the time.I also love that this model includes the text to voice feature, so I can have my books read to me while I'm working in the kitchen or driving.It's easy to use, and easy to get around. I find it quite intuitive.  I wish there were better instructions that came with it, but I was able to download a Kindle book of instructions for a small price -- about $2.99 I think. That was helpful.As I said in the beginning, I still use my other Kindle for some of my reading just because the smaller size is easier to hold.

To me it's like buying a record player that will only play one label's records. Here's why Amazon won me over:- I can sideload apps. Barnes and Noble forced my switch from a Nook Tablet to the Kindle Fire when they updated their device to block sideloaded apps. I hate being chained against my will to a company's logo, and being told what I can do with my own tablet. If you've invested in a library for the Nook, you can read those books on your Fire via the Nook app. Most other apps I've tried that for whatever reason are not in the Amazon app store seem to run fine.- I can sideload legally purchased content I ripped/stripped myself, and it's easy. If you're up for learning how, you can find a way to get all your existing content onto the Fire, with covers that show on your shelf, etc.- Amazon is simply the best online bookstore. If you have Prime, with all the accompanying perks, you'll be very happy with Amazon's content on other fronts. And with free shipping you can save a lot of money on ordinary purchases.- The performance of the Kindle Fire hardware is excellent. Lightweight, looks great, sounds great, very responsive.The only reason I gave the device four stars instead of five is the interface.

I wanted to get her a tablet that had a great HD screen, was easy to use and wasn\u2019t too expensive. My mom is not tech savvy so I thought getting her a higher-end more competitive tablet (ipad, surface, etc.) would be a waste because she wouldn\u2019t use it to its potential.She absolutely loves it!!! I spent time setting it up and helped her understand how to use it. This does not come with a paper manual, but it has a quick tutorial when you start it up and there is a manual on the tablet if you need one to use.`The Short Answer:Yes, I would recommend this tablet to someone who is:a.New to tabletsb.Someone who is not tech savvyc.Someone who wants an excellent eReaderd.Someone who casually uses computers and would like to have a tabletDon\u2019t get this tablet if you must have the latest and greatest in apps (the app store is limited & no Google play store) or you want an android tablet that you can customize to your own preference.I would also let someone know while recommending this tablet that it does NOT come with the wall charger only the USB chord to connect to a computer to charge and the charging time can be a long time. But if you want to wait and see if you must have it or need it I have seen them for sale at the big box stores that sell kindles (I saw it for sure at office depot and at best buy), so if you don\u2019t get it, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to get it should you decide it\u2019s something you need.Also, it comes with ads that show on it and you can remove them for an extra $15 either at the point of sale or later. Since this was a gift, I left the ads on there (as I understand some people don\u2019t mind them while others are very against them) but I did include an amazon gift card so if my mom wanted to remove them she wouldn\u2019t have to spend her own money.How I decided on this tablet:I did some research online \u2013 the biggest selling point was the screen. I figured that my mom would use it more to read books and watch movies & TV shows, she may play some games from the app store but nothing too complex.The next thing I did was go and find one to try out at a major box store. I watched some movie trailers and played some games, went through the demo, read some paragraphs got on the internet and it was wonderful for what it would be used for. I wanted to get a good idea of how it would function and run so that when my Mom got hers and we fired it up I would know if it was working fine or not.I cannot stress \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d enough.  If you aren\u2019t sure or do not have any experience with tablets go to the store and try them out! If you have questions, ask \u2013 even though this isn\u2019t as expensive as some other tablets, it is still a major purchase and you want to make sure you make the correct decision.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "love hate relationship", "Author": "Michael Gray", "ReviewID": "R1GBS49WBBUQ5R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this for Christmas and wanted to wait 6 months before reviewing. Not so sure we will make it that long, so here goes.When everything works properly I love this pad. Just the right size, great sound and good color.Battery life is OK some of the time but can be inconsistent. That is the first problem. I have gone to bed without charging, as I thought there was plenty of power left, just to wake up to a dead unit. Charges pretty quick, but I like to be able to use it first thing when I get up.The second major problem is the browser. It constantly tells me tabs are not responding and offers to restart them. Most of the time there appears to be no problem with what I am viewing, but the notification pops right up in the middle of the page blocking what I am reading. Sometimes this will happen several times while attempting to read a single paragraph of text.Finally the pad will sometimes just freeze. This mostly again seems to be related to Silk when using the browser directly or when redirected by some apps. Keep in mind also that there are limited apps available and many do not seem well developed to work with the Kindle Fire or it's browser.In the last month or so all of these problems seem to be getting worse so that is why I thought it wise to review at this time. We still have some good days but the devices performance is just too inconsistent to warrant more than 2 stars.Update 7/31/13After writing my review I was contacted by Amazon customer service. They had some suggestions and talked me through them. They said they would call back in a few days. They never called back. What they had me do wiped all my data from Silk. Their suggestion to turn the device off to save battery just makes the pad less convenient to pick up and use and has done nothing to improve battery drain in use or efficiency in charging. The final problem has been that frequently when using Silk the pad will just reboot.Now the good news. Did a little online research and found that some Google apps can be side loaded. I now have Google Chrome for my browser and the Maps app. I'm not a big fan of Chrome but it does sync with Chrome on my PC and android phone. The pad no longer reboots for no reason. Still get an occasional freeze but rarely.I would consider adding a star if I had not been required to fix all this myself. Also the battery problem has not improved much. I am trying the new battery saver app for Kindle but so far I don't think it's doing much. I'm also using the new Mobile Desktop app and love it. You still have to go through the carousel to get to it but from there it's great.If this thing makes it to a year I might add a star yet.

When the kids take this thing to school, the kids with the ipads wish desperately that they had this 32gb Kindle just based on all that it can do.

Plus, there's a guy on here that reviewed this and said to just get the 32gb over the 64 and keep your cell phone separate because this is awkward to use as a phone.  SO helped my decision!  And really, the 32 is the best bang for your buck, hands down, unless, of course, you're a high gb user and need the 64.  The huge screen on this thing is awesome - it works like a dream and we've been nothing but pleased this entire time that we've been using it.

I only had 8GB available and with the things I read it didn't take long to fill but anyway...As for picture and sound I'd give them both a 10/10. I haven't had any problems with glares even when I'm outside. I do have a screen protector on mine but even with the screen protector it's still glare free. I'm a huge fan of watching Hulu and Youtube and it streams things perfectly.Books 10/10: What interested me the most in purchasing the HD was the whispersync feature. When you purchase a book it gives you the option to add voice to it for a couple extra dollars. And it turns the book into a professionally read audio book. I do recommend this option because the normal voice that you get without paying the extra couple of dollars is a very robotic GPS type sounding voice. In my opinion I don't mind if I pay a couple of extra bucks if it's a book I'm really looking forward too. The option is entirely up to you but sense I'm a big on books it's something I always consider.Web Browsing 9/10: The only reason I'm not giving this a perfect score is because I wish it had Flash. Yes, it is fast. Almost faster than my laptop but if it had Flash it would make it much better. I would like to be able to play Facebook games.App's (7/10): There were a few apps that were not available on Kindle HD that were available on my ipod. But it's not a big deal to me because I didn't buy it specifically for the apps I bought it for books.Look and appearance (8/10): The HD is a lot lighter than I expected. And I love having the bigger screen but it is a little clunky to me if you compare it to the Kindle Fire 7 inch. But it's just a minor adjustment that I've already gotten used too. In a way it reminds me about the size of a hardback book if you really think about it.Battery life (7/10): I can go several days without having to charge this device. But I gave it a 7 because I only got a USB port in the box and no wall charger. This turned out to be a big pet peeve with me and more of a pain. I tried to charge it through my computer but it didn't work. I had given my Mother my old Kindle Fire so I had to go out and purchase a separate wall charger. Why wouldn't you guys include the wall charger? Not all of us want to sync through our computers. Not to mention if we're going to invest in this much money there should be a wall charger included. So if that's the only complaint that I have about this device that is it that they don't include the wall charger.Side note: I know there isn't really a category for this suggestion but one thing I've noticed when searching for cases for my HD that there aren't very many yet. Maybe I'm just too picky but I was looking for a zip case one and I just couldn't find one I liked. I would like to see more cases for the HD other than just online. And Best Buy had a very few to choose from.Other than the charger issue I'm a happy Kindle Fire HD owner. I do think it is worth it to upgrade to the new version and I'm glad I did. I've had it almost a week now and I'm a happy camper. I like having a bigger screen, and I use the whispersync more than I thought I would.

However, I like larger screen of the 8.9 for several reasons.The 8.9 is hard to beat on the lectern for notes.  When using a blue tooth keyboard it seems to be a better fit to the screen.  Magazines work better on the 8.9. Of course the movies are a better view on the larger screen too.  The 8.9 is not that much larger to stick in brief case or pack. Finally, overall I just like to pick it up and have the larger screen. Maybe it's related to my idea of a  pickup versus a small car. I will always like larger size and take the truck.

The functionality of the Kindle Fire HD is outstanding.  I purchase a great deal from Amazon and they are my exclusive music source now through their MP3 store, so it was only a natural fit that I would get and use the Kindle Fire HD.  I was considering an iPad, but I'm so tied to Amazon with my music, shopping, videos, and books (both e-books and audible books), that I really didn't want to pay more money for a product that would not do everything as easily as my Kindle Fire.  Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problems with Apple, in fact, I have an iPhone 5 and love it as a phone.  I just really love the functionality of the Kindle Fire and how seamlessly it integrated all the services I use from Amazon.  I turned it on and all my libraries were there.  My kindle books and my audiobooks were instantly available and easy to get to.  It really lets me take full advantage of my Amazon Prime membership.  Bottom line, Kindle Fire HD is a great product and Amazon is an outstanding company.  I've enjoyed my Kindle Fire so much, I bought one for my son for Christmas.  He loves it and uses it more than his laptop computer now.  It's also great that since I added his Kindle to my account, he can use all my e-books and audible books.

I bought the Kindle over an IPad on the advise of my son. My 3 year old grandson uses it and is very good at it making it a great teaching tool.

First let me say that I am not considered a  \" tech savy \" person, so please consider this review as from an ordinary lay person who LIKES technological devices.You can be sure that the Kindle Fire HD is not a device that you'll need a lot of technical expertise to operate. It is very straight forward and the options are easy to understand. At this point I have owned at one time or another a Kindle, I have a Droid smart phone and my husband has an I Pad from work, so I also have had a chance to compare the I Pad with the Kindle Fire.  The Ipad devices do have larger displays than the Fire HD, but the crispness of the images on the Fire is every bit as good as the Ipad. If you regularly shop on Amazon , the Kindle Fire excels in being integrated with the Amazon store with the options of getting videos and audio very easily. From what I saw and experimented with on my husband's Ipad, there is no such easy integration on the Ipad.I know that the IPad is one of the most highly regarded tablets on the market,but I have to say that the price difference PLUS the easy integration with Amazon's huge library of content makes it a strong competitor and for me the price difference plus the easy integration with Amazon was the deciding factor for me and this was BEFORE I bought the device. Since I have had it in my possession, I can only say I have absolutely NO regrets!Also I find it easy to find great apps. The Android operating system allows you to install any app you want. The Amazon app store is the default app provider for the Kindle Fire, but if you want to get something else, you can manage, it takes a bit of doing to accomplish this though.I am also a prime member and this has made it a breeze to watch many videos and movies for free that you would have to rent if not a member. The Cloud feature  is also a great feature because for Amazon content, the cloud storage quota is unlimited!I would say that in the entertainment category, this device is phenomenal. You will be able to download and access many types of entertainment, such as music, books, videos, apps, the web, Docs, the newsstand etc etc. I could go on and on about this and the more I learn, the more I am so glad that I decided to get this device.I would recomment to download the Kindle Fire HD manual, especially if you are not used to an android device. This manual has been updated for the Kindle Fire HD and even if there is a bit of difference in locating the options, it will be easy to figure out. Another good reference is \" Help Me! Guide to the Kindle Fire HD: Charles Huges\" . They both have a wealth of practical information. I downloaded these two to my Kindle Touch, so I could follow the directions when they were side by side and not have to flip back all the time.As far as any cons:1.  The power button seems a bit awkward in the portrait position because if you are holding the device with both hands, it is  easy for your hand to hit the power button. It might be better to have that button closer to the left of the volume button.2.  The directions for the web searches seem somewhat cumbersome  but once you go through the instructions, it gets better.I might have to update this review later on, since I have only had the Kindle Fire HD for a little while. I am going through the two manuals page by page and learning a lot. So far I am very impressed with what this device is capable of. That said, my husband loves his Ipad, but he uses it mostly for his work and does not deal with Amazon as much as I do. I do think though that he is coveting my ability to access Amazon so easily plus the video and audio capabilities!", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Virginia Acosta \"9erfan\"", "ReviewID": "R1C73AY8WIEDAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire, 8.9\".

It served me well since I mostly used it for browsing and read books. When the iPad mini came out I decided to give it a try and I liked it for it has many apps I liked (which I never bother to try with the Kindle since I was not an \"apps user\"), on top of that, for it can do Chinese input so well, and the mini is indeed very light in the hand. With that experience, I tried to see if Kindle Fire could do what iPad could with apps. I was able to find most of these apps I liked on iPad and installed them on the old Kindle Fire. But I could not install Chinese kbd app w/o \"rooting\" it\", which I did not want take the risk.I bought the Fire HD 8.9 (on the day it was offered $50 off) with one main purpose: to stream video to TV (with HDMI) when I needed to. I had it for 3 days and initially found it was too big for my taste but I slowly more and more like it while discovering more positive aspects of it. The display is truly beautiful and great for reading PDF books (I love reading old books) with it high res display, and that is far better than the reading experience one would have using the 1st gen Fire or the iPad mini (both are at the iPad 1 screen res). Best of all, I found (by surprise) one can easily install a Chinese keyboard app to fit the need for Chinese text entry. That made me very happy. Now I think I can happily let my wife take the iPad mini since the Fire HD with it new Chinese keyboard is a better Pad for my needs overall.One strange issue bothered heavily me early was that the Kindle HD 8.9 seemed dropping Chinese character in browser or apps in the 1st day or so of use (not to a degree one could not read the page since it only dropped very few on a page), but it seems has learn to do it right now somehow.

I work in an office building and the Kindle has spend 95% of it's time in an indoor, friendly environment.  I've owned my kindle for over a year now and wished from day one I went with a different option.  I choose the Kindle as I'm a big Amazon.com fan and trusted they made a good product. Here are the issues I've been having:If you jump from different applications (i.e. Amazon Videos to Kindle books, Internet browsing), the Kindle freezes up as it doesn't know how to manage the memory properly.  Amazon.com customer service says this is a known issue and recommends holding the power button for 20 seconds to fix the problem.  This is a hard reset and may cause you to loose app data, save points, account history and other information.The touch pad often responds slow or not at all.  This has been the most common issue I have and happens almost every time I use the web browser for more than 5 minutes.  This must also due to poor memory management as Amazon's customer service fix is the same:  Hold Power button for 20 seconds to reset system.Speakers are rear facing.  Not a big factor for me as I use a Wi-fi headset.  If you do wish to use the speaker, you will have to remove it for any case you are using because they cover the speakers and muffle the sound.Charging the Kindle has now become a very serious issue.  I use the recommended Amazon.com kindle quick charger.  Within the year, the kindle connection has become very loose.  Now, I have to make sure the charge is connected just right and hope it isn't bumped.  Many times I've picked up my Kindle after charging, only to find the battery is too low to turn on.  This shouldn't have become an issue as the kindle has always sat flat on my desk or table when charging.This tablet is also not usable outside.  I've attempted to access the web and view movies while spending my lunch hour outside.

He said that the settings in the Wi-Fi router would need to be altered to accept the Kindle Device, but if you're a guest of the Wi-Fi, you don't have the capability to change the router settings.

The replacement almost never freezes up.  So why don't I like it?  Keeping in mind the fact that this is one user's experience, here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:* The e-reader can't be beat.  A great visual experience and the almost seamless ability to purchase/borrow books.*  The Kindle Fire is first-class when it comes to downloading and watching videos, especially if you're an Amazon Prime member and have lots of free videos to choose from.*  The HD experience is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!*  Plenty of useful apps for download, many of them free.*  The size is really nice.Cons:*  Amazon Silk is herky-jerky at best.  Crashes frequently, even after reboot.  Links are often unresponsive.  Doesn't support Flash.*  Hate, hate, hate the carousel.  Cluttered and ungainly and pretty much useless.  Would much rather be able to put my favorite applications on the home screen.*  Actually, this brings us to one of my biggest gripes against the Kindle Fire HD, i.e., the lack of personalization options.  Amazon has pretty much locked you into their concept of usability ... and brother, it's not mine!*  The Dolby speakers ain't all they're cracked up to be.I guess my biggest problem with the Kindle Fire HD echoes a problem I have with Apple products, namely, the user doesn't seem to come first here.  The business plan comes first.  Selling stuff comes first.Basically, I would say if you're after a terrific e-reader and a device you can use to watch videos in glorious color, this would be a good choice.

I could load webpages 4-5 times faster on my iPhone 5 and even my old iPhone 3GS. YouTube videos for the most part just wouldn't load. On every other device, iphones, ps3, ipad, etc... no problems in the same room.2. Touchscreen was having all sorts of problems. Typing was an exercise in futility at times. I'd press the same letter key dozens of times before it was recognized. And it seemed to not be an issue with one location on the screen... just generally unresponsive.3. The absolute worst is the content. Paying for a service like Prime, you'd think would be similar to Netflix since they are positioned as a competitor. It's nothing like Netflix. The available TV and Movie content (PAID content, mind you) is miserable. There is no use for getting prime unless you constantly read books. The worst thing is that they have a MASSIVE catalog of movies, but they have their own rental and purchase prices ON TOP of prime. Some of these go for as much as $20 for HD. That means there is no excuse for not improving the selection of Prime content. I really don't understand why they don't boost their prime content to make it more attractive and leave the new releases as pay per view.Conclusion:I think the best think about the whole situation is that Amazon really does have amazing return policies. That sounds like a backhanded comment, but really if you are interested in trying it out Amazon will give you 30 days to do whatever you want... even give you a trial of prime.

I had done A LOT of searching, reviewing, and comparing other tablets before purchasing this one. I finally decided that though the KF HD lacked the latest Android OS, and would be centered around the Amazon universe (no Google Play apps, etc) this would be a good beginner tablet. I wasn't wrong about the ease of use and I don't particularly mind not being able to download apps from other than Amazon, especially since everything appears in the Cloud and I can easily delete/retrieve apps at will.However, I was NOT prepared for all the problems I have had with the device since almost day one. I initially had issues with the device locking up all the time and the battery life seemed waaaay short for the time usage. I did my homework and learned to shut down the device by the hard/cold reset. Thought I was home free for a couple of days til the device would no longer charge at all even though there was nothing wrong with my charger. Spoke to customer service for the 3rd time and they sent out THEIR rapid charger because obviously mine was inferior (not her exact words, but that's the gist) I will admit that the tablet absolutely charged better and even performed better with the rapid charger. I was really starting to enjoy using the tablet and happily played games/read my books with little problems for almost 2 WHOLE weeks...until today.I was in the middle of playing a game when it suddenly froze. I had no choice but to shut it down via the hard reset. When I powered it back on, the load screen ran continuously. After an several hours of trying to resolve it on my own, I grudgingly called CS again. The guy was really nice and tried to remotely reset the device (or something to that effect) but when that failed, he offered to replace the device.I am REALLY hoping I simply had a DUD because there are several features i really liked about this tablet. 1.) the screen brightness is awesome for bright days - not so good for battery life but you can really see the screen well.2.) the auto-sleep sensor is awesome when using a case that supports it.3.) size is perfect for me due to poor vision, I felt the 7\" was too small and a 10\" was just too bulky 4.) the gorilla glass screen is really durable and sensitive to the touch. I had a screen protector but took it off when the stylus had too much drag for sketching/drawing. 5.) the carousel is nicer than I thought it would be, keeps the apps and books easily accessible with a simple flick of a finger.Time will tell if the replacement KF HD will perform better than my first one. I will be happy to change my rating! The only reason I didn't rate it lower to begin with is because I really enjoy the tablet when its working and customer service has been quite good, albeit a little stubborn at times.UPDATE July 2013: The replacement KF HD 8.9\" is performing MUCH better than my first one, therefore I will now give the device 4 stars. There are still some issues that prevent me from giving a 5 star rating.  For some weird reason, my carousel will randomly disappear and I am left with a black screen with the menus at the top. Luckily the menus are still there and I can simply  There really seems to be no rhyme or reason for this and in all fairness I haven't spoken to CS yet to see if there's a resolution. Another thing is there are often errors when I download apps from the app store and I end up having to redownload them.

I read comparisons between the Kindle, IPad and Nexus 7 for weeks and the bottom line is people i.e. reviewers like what they like and it doesn\u2019t take long when they are comparing the various devices to see if they are IPad, Nexus or Kindle fans.  You can compare processors, screen contrast, memory, etc. until you are blue in the face; I personally can\u2019t see anything in the way of speed, sound and display when using the Kindle that would cause me to switch to an IPad or Nexus.  I will say I\u2019m not a big fan of Apple; they seem to nickel and dime you to death and are rarely competitive when it comes to price.  I am an Prime Amazon consumer i.e. I buy everything under the sun from Amazon and like the idea that the Kindle is tailored for their website and products.  I like the idea that Amazon does offer the consumer books and magazines for FREE; if nothing else it is a great gesture from a retailer to a consumer.Last night I streamed a movie, surfed the web, listen to my music as well loaded roughly 5600 mp3 to the cloud last night (It took about 8 hours) so that I can have them at my finger tips with the Kindle.  The entire Kindle experience was satisfying.  Being a man that doesn\u2019t carry a purse, backpack, clutch or anything along those lines, I decided on the 8.9 inch version; the 7 inch wouldn\u2019t fit in my pants pocket, so what was the point in passing up a larger screen for roughly the same price as the 7 inch.  Women on the other hand carry a suitcase around daily so the 7 inch may be better, if you are considering portability.If you like one stop shopping the IPad and Kindle are what you are looking for.  If you want to be locked inside a room with only a front door and no key, I would say stick with Apple products and buy an IPad.  If you would like the option of a locked front door and an unlocked back door then I\u2019d say go with the Kindle and Amazon\u2019s products.  If you want a front and back door with a window and a key to lock and unlock both doors, then go with a Nexus; you will however have to find independent sites to buy your movies, music, books, magazines, etc.  Personally, I don\u2019t have the time or desire to go from site to site trying to find media and audio content for my entertainment device.Lastly, I own 3 PCs, 1 Netbook, 1 Apple Mini computer, 1 Barnes and Noble Nook,  a Kindle DX and now the Kindle Fire.  I believe in buying the right tool for the job.

I still remember when the first Kindle came out and pretty much changed the world.  It was a revolution for book readers.  And then other things happened.  The release of the iPad, for instance, which caused everyone to jump up and make a tablet.  Now there are so many to choose from that when I considered buying a tablet I wasn't sure what to go with.  In the end I went with the Kindle Fire HD.  The price was good and I've been a part of the Amazon community for years on end.  I haven't been disappointed in my purchase one bit.  There are a couple of small gripes that add up, but nothing much.I won't spend much time talking about the technical specs of the Kindle Fire HD.  I have the 16GB one that's 8.9 inches.  It comes with a USB cord, but doesn't come with one of those actual chargers.  This isn't too bad, because if you already have a smart phone that charger will suffice, but if you don't have a charger already it's kind of silly that you get the cord but not the charger itself and you immediately need to pay $20 on top of this.Setting up your kindle is pretty simple.  If you've already got an Amazon account you can connect to that easily.  If you are not an Amazon Prime member you can start a free trial.  If you have a Kindle, however, I urge you become a part of Amazon Prime.  It'll be a good decision in the long run.  It not only gives you some pretty decent shipping prices, but for people who own a Kindle Fire you'll be able to have access to a few things you wouldn't otherwise, such as television shows on the IMDB.  Or you can \"borrow\" books for free from the Amazon Library for as long as you want without having to pay a dime.  If you have a kindle, you might as well get prime on top of it.  It's not bad for a years time.The tablet itself is extremely light and feels pretty nice and sleek.  There are two speakers on the back near the bottom that give off some good sound, but you can always plug in head phones or a speaker if you want.  There is also a camera that should be at the top if you hold it for a landscape view, and on the left if you're holding it like a book.  The orientation will adjust automatically (though you can lock the orientation if you so choose to), but some applications and games will have a preset orientation you cannot change.  Likewise, I would highly suggest a case and a screen protector for your Kindle fire HD immediately.  It's light and simple.  Perfect for on the go stuff.  All the more reason to have a case.  And if you're going to constantly be having your fingers on it a screen protector will do nice so that the screen doesn't smudge.The display itself is pretty crisp.  Everything being displayed in fine HD.  You can adjust the brightness in the settings menu if you want just about any time you want with a pretty easy interface of a menu.  Even if you're in the middle of an app or a book you can access the settings by sliding your finger (or stylus, as I prefer to use) down from the top and it allows quick access to things like your settings, notifications wi-fi access, etc.  The user interface of the Kindle Fire HD is pretty easy stuff.  And no matter where you are it's easy to return to the home menu at any time.Any time you leave a program, app or book, it will be on display in your \"carousal\" which allows you to go through every item.  Recently downloaded items also appear here.  If your carousal gets too crowded you can always hold your finger (or stylus) on the item and select to remove it from the carousal.  You can also put it on your favorites for easier access.  The carousal is a good idea, but I've found that mine gets crowded a little too easy.  I use a lot of apps and read a lot of books and from time to time browse the web.  Every now and then my carousal gets too full and I have to go through removing stuff from it one by one by one.  There is no option to universally clear your carousal.There's Bluetooth and Wifi on the Kindle Fire HD.  I did not purchase the one with 4G so I can't tell you about that.  It's pretty easy to connect to the internet.  And it'll be able to store all kinds of wireless networks in its memory.  The only problem that I have is that the web browser itself is not that good.  More often than not when I'm surfing the web and read news stories or going to certain sites that no application exist for, I'll get a message that the browser has stopped working or that the tab I'm using has stopped working.  These messages are not infrequent in the slightest. I would highly recommend downloading a different browser as opposed to using the default browser.  Most other browsers are a lot better.Of course, one of the biggest tenants you're looking for is probably the apps.  And there are a lot of apps to choose from on the Kindle Fire HD.  Cheap as well as expensive.  The good news is that you can always get a sense of what you're in for because there are always reviews for each app.  They download fast (most of the time, if they're not too big).  There are 16GB of space available on my tablet (there is a 32GB one available, if you wish) and even that feels like a lot.  Apps and books are pretty small and take up nearly no space whatsoever.  In fact, most of the space on mine is occupied by the professional narration on some of the books I have.  Case in point, unless you're feeling like you'll download tons of movies or things which take up whole gigabytes of space, the 16GB hard drive is more than enough to satisfy.When you download movies they come up very crisp indeed, but I don't download a lot of movies to my tablet.  I use my Ultraviolet account a lot, but that uses the internet to stream from my collection (and a handy little application called Flixster for that).  It's the books I'm more interested in.  There are LOTS of classic literature books you can download for free.  When you download books you can add professional narration to them as well.  Sometimes it's free and sometimes it isn't.  It's more or less like putting an audiobook version to your standard book.  Most times the professional narration is unabridged.  I've yet to find an abridged one.  For some books there is still an option to tap to hear text read aloud, but since it's not the \"professional\" narration it's just a robotic voice that really drones on (and it's boring... very boring).  So if you feel the need to listen to your books, the professional narration is pretty amazing.  If you feel like reading, however, you can adjust the settings by changing the background, font size and even the font itself.  But the best feature is the ability to \"X-Ray\" the book.  You can see certain terms used a lot and how often.  You can read about certain things that other kindle users highlighted.  But you can go deeper and read about the author himself or herself.  You can look up terms and locations.  You'll instantly be taken to the web if you see something you may not know about and you're curious to learn.  It's overall pretty handy to X-Ray a book.  You can also make as many notes as you like on your book.When you're finished with a book (or when you X-Ray) it always offers suggestions of where to go from there or what to read next.  It's always offering suggestions and you can always find reviews if you like to help you out.You can use that USB cord to connect your Kindle Fire HD to your computer at any time and put documents from your computer or even a few other things if you desire.  Sometimes this is pretty nice.  I was able to transfer documents to my Kindle from my laptop pretty easily.  This includes music and movies if you want them.  And the Kindle can read quite a few formats.There are a few things that can be urksome about the Kindle Fire.  Some are little and some are bigger problems.  The first is that it isn't easy to access the files.  Unless you download an outside app for that.  You can get into the basic stuff like your music, books and movies.  But if you want to go just a little deeper you have to download an outside app for that.  Likewise, it's difficult to move things from one folder to another.  If you put a document on your Kindle Fire and it automatically puts it in the books (I'm not sure why mine did this) it's not easy to move it over without going onto your laptop to do so, or downloading a document manager app of sorts.  It just seems strange to me that management type options wouldn't be built into the Kindle itself from the get go.  Instead you need an app.  It's a free app, but why should I have to do this?Another strange problem I've run into is that my kindle, from time to time, freezes or just goes blank for no apparent reason.  Then it'll suddenly start rebooting.  I'm not sure what happens.  This doesn't happen often, but it happens often enough to be noticeable.  There were also times when it lagged so much that I wasn't sure if my clicking on certain links, apps or books was actually registering.  Come to find out that sometimes it registers just a little too late.  And other times it just so happens my Kindle has frozen on me and I have to shut it down and restart it.  Again, not too often, but often enough to be noticeable.  I have also run into times when it can't seem to seek out the wireless network in the area.  The solution is--you guessed it--I have to shut down and reboot the Kindle Fire HD (although for this little problem sometimes putting it in sleep mode and then bringing it out works just the same).  Like the other two issues, this doesn't happen often--but it happens often enough to be noticeable.Overall, though, I like my Kindle Fire HD a lot.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Not an iPad or a Nexus 7 or any other tablet.  The problems I've encountered aren't big enough and it's very possible that no one is experiencing some of the things I experience at all.  I've been enjoying my Kindle Fire because it's made a lot of my life simpler.  Particularly when I travel.  It's nice to have all my books in one place without having to have a bag full of six or seven when I'm out.  And I can also get magazine subscriptions and go to Youtube or whatever without hassle at all.  If you're looking for a nice, inexpensive tablet, then the Kindle Fire HD is a pretty good deal.  You'll end up having to splurge a few extra bucks for some much needed accessories (charger, case, screen protector and stylus are the ones I recommend most) but in the end it is definitely worth while to do so.

After comparing most of the popular tablets, I was down to the iPad and the Fire 8.9 HD 4G. The iPad was a bit more expensive, and had more features and more apps, but the Kindle allows you access to a lot more free media if you get an Amazon Prime account, which we had planned to do anyway.(Honestly, if you want productivity and real-world WORK capability, like document production, etc., buy an iPad, or really, buy a laptop. The laptop will be cheaper.)The screen is bright,clear and the video and audio quality is very good. The touch screen can be a bit balky at times, though. I'd recommend buying a stylus. It is far smoother with that than with your finger.Make sure your hands are clean and not sweaty or greasy.The loading is fast...VERY fast if you have either a good WiFi signal, or are connected to 4G. Which is another issue. 4G is not always available...if you are on trips, driving, like we do, then you will find a lot of areas where you will find yourself hooked to 3G or Edge instead, which is much slower. Grrrr.Forget streaming video if you are on Edge. It's too slow. However, you CAN download content, and then play it back at your leisure...but some HD movies are larger than your memory, unless you have the 64Gb memory, so there's another issue.Also, you cannot play ANY Flash content, like, say, a lot of YouTube videos, and some commercial websites. This is not Amazon's fault. Adobe no longer supports ANY mobile devices, including phones or iPads.Don't worry...there is a work-around. You just download the ES File Explorer from the app store(which, believe me, you are going to want anyway. It's a super useful app.) and then you download the Dolphin web browser, and then (finally!) you can go get Flash Player 11 for mobile devices, which runs with Dolphin, but not Silk. (Silk is the web browser that comes with your Kindle.) Supposedly, in the future, this will not be an issue since most websites are supposed to be switching to HTML5.Bottom line: We pretty much like it. If we had it to do over, we'd still buy two more Kindle Fire's, in spite of the above noted glitches. It still has more upside than downside. The huge availability of media content of all types makes up for the shortcomings.

I typically have to look.Location of USB/HDMI - Really bad design and I can't believe no one caught this in development very annoying.On Screen Keyboard - The return key is often missing and it makes working with some apps difficult.Lacking Device to play through wireless? - Have not found a way to mirror this over wireless (like Apple TV).I found most apps I use on the iPad to be available either at the kindle store or via adding another app store.  My issues with the power button were mostly overcome by adding a case because now it comes back on automatically when I open the case so I only need to find the power button if I need to turn the device off completely(almost never).  My brother and I both bought the kindle at the same time and I love mine overall, but he was so annoyed about the issues with the on screen keyboard and the fact that twitter doesn't allow copy and paste in their andriod app that he will probably return his.  I don't use twitter, but this was clearly not a fault of the kindle.

Plus, I knew there was no charger in the box since I had read the description before ordering! Thus, it was not a surprise!3.  Setup:  Yes, it was a bit confusing when I took it out of the box and there was no directions and no clear on/off switch.

E-mail.  I am not sure if I am missing something, but I wish there was some kind of notification of when I get new e-mail.  The iPad beeps just like my computer.  As far as I can tell on the Fire, the only way to tell if I have new mail is to go in and check it.  Am I missing something?3.  Apps.

I was going to use it mainly for keeping books and documents on my device and as a medical study tool. I am an avid Google user, so naturally I was torn between the new Nexus 7 FDH and this. Because of an amazing deal that Amazon ordered I decided to go with the kindle. I was excited. Once I received my device, the hidden disappointments began to roll in. Carousel; is pointless and rather aggravating to use. It becomes an endless list that's annoying to continually delete programs from. My other disappointment is how shallow the app base is for the kindle. Very controlling; almost like Apple but without the massive app resources. I can't use Google chrome, google docs (side note: amazon does have their own versions of cloud storage, but I prefer the seamless browsing that google provides) or any google play apps or even Itunes apps; only amazon apps (mainly consisting of paid apps). The tablet is a beautify made and the screen is crisp and responsive. The real power of the kindle comes from the massive Amazon prime account. So if you're not into that, you're pretty much missing out on the true point of this tablet; a media devouring machine. This thing has potential, but Amazon put's limits of what could be an amazing device. Despite it's beautiful screen, the adds, the limited app store, the need to get an amazon prime account to get real use out of it, the useless Carousel option, the lack of support for google made it a no for me.

After much research, we decided on the Kindle Fire 8.9.I must say the picture quality is great on the device itself, however, I also purchased an HDMI cable to stream movies from Prime on the Kindle to our TV. This is where it breaks down. While the picture quality on the Kindle itself is great, the picture quality on our TV was horrible. The colors where way off and the picture was hazy. Almost like viewing a 3D movie without the glasses. We were hoping to use this feature when we travel, but it doesn't look like it now.Then there was the connecting the Kindle to my husbands PC to download files and pictures. It never could find the device driver to install, and therefore he is unable to connect and download anything. When he went to the help screen at Amazon, he notice that this is a very common problem. He tried some of the fixes, but nothing worked. He then started a chat with the technical support and that was a joke. After an hour, the tech support came to the conclusion that my Kindle was defective, even though many other customers were having the same problem. He then tried connecting to my computer and it connected right away. He advised the tech support person, and asked where he could get the device driver to download to his computer, since that seem to be the problem. The tech support response was that they don't make one since the Kindle doesn't need it....Really!!! So, now to download files from his computer, he has to download to a flash drive, upload to my computer, then download to the Kindle. Very cumbersome, but it's all we have, since Amazon doesn't have a workaround themselves.If you are only going to use the Kindle by itself, it is a great tablet, but beware of it's shortcomings, if you intend to use it for some other purpose.

I have owned several different versions of the Kindle and also the first Kindle Fire.  When I got the new 8.9 HD, I was so excitied.  First, it's beautiful!  Second, OMG the image is clear, crisp and so sharp.  The Kindle Fire HD is very easy to use with on screen instructions and tips.  It is very easy to connect to all of your social media including, facebook, twitter and my space.  You also have access to all of your yahoo, hotmail and gmail accounts.  The app store is not as robust as Google Play however there are some decent apps out there.I am a Prime member, so I have all of my books, music and movies on Amazon.  I really worried with this one how surfing the web would be as the last fire seemed to be rather cumbersome and slow.  The Fire HD is FAST!  I have a newer Dell laptop core i5 and this new Kindle Fire loads just as quick if not quicker in some instances than my laptop.I have spent about a week now with my new Fire HD and my love and awe continue.  I love being able to do everything online that I need to do, check my bank, check my school work, office work, shop, play games and facebook.  I really barely use my laptop these days unless I have to type something.  I do hope they come out with keyboard case for the Kindle Fire.Now on to Kindle Free time - I have a 5 year old who loves my Kindle.  I started up the free time for him and set up his profile.  We downloaded all of his apps and books and he clicks on his name to see just his stuff when he wants to use the Kindle.  I am rather disappointed that the books that I have ordered for him say text to speech is enabled but it only reads the credit of the books.  I was hoping that he would be able to read along with the stories.  Hope this gets fixed soon!Ipad vs. Kindle Fire HD - I also own and IPad.. and to be honest, I hate it.  It sits here and I never use it.  It's heavy and cold.  I really hate the metal feel in my hands and the price is ungodly.  The Ipad2 is also much slower than the Fire HD.  That being said I was very happy with the price for the Fire HD.  I opted to purchace the one without special ads.  I was really bothered that the Fire HD only comes with the cable for charging and not the actual wall charger.  You have to buy this seperatly for 19.99.So why the 4 star review and not 5 if I love it?  Well for one the fact that I have to pay for a charger.  This in my opinion is BS.  Two, we need more apps... and some of the apps that are out there just don't work, even after uninstalling and reinstalling (slotomania and scramble with friends).  There are also paid versions of the apps that I have on my Samsung Galaxy SIII that I would love to put on my Kindle Fire but that is sadly not available.  Overall, I do love my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD, the size and weight are perfect.

Due to a few issues, I gave it a four because it's not possible to give a half star, otherwise I would have given it a four and a half.I've had a first generation Fire since they came out, and loved it from the start. There are some great improvements on this new one that I really love, but there are also a few things that I think could be better.  First, the good:The screen really does look as gorgeous as Amazon promised. The first thing I did when I received it was go to videos and watch the trailer for the movie \"Brave\", and I must say, I was absolutely blown away at the incredibly beautiful quality of the screen.  It's amazing!  After watching more videos, I am still just as impressed - they look fabulous and run smoothly with no lag. I'm also extremely happy with how spectacular my magazines look.The sound is great, and hugely improved over the first generation Kindle Fire, which makes enjoying video and music all the better.I love the larger size of the 8.9\".  It makes the whole Kindle Fire experience even more enjoyable without being hard to handle.  Feels just right, nice and thin, and not heavy to hold.Processing speed is great, and so is Wifi speed.  Screen operation is very smooth, with scrolling much smoother than the first Kindle Fire.Very happy to have the camera to Skype on this Fire - I'll be Skyping with my friend in France who I don't get to see all that often, so for me that's a nice plus.  I know some people are complaining about the lack of another camera, but I knew that before I purchased it, and I don't intend to take pictures with my Fire so it's not an issue for me.Ok, now for the things that need improvement:I don't know what they were thinking when they decided on the on/off and volume buttons - they're hard to feel or see, and I quickly got sick of hunting for them.  However, I just received a case I ordered from Amazon, and now with the cut-out holes for the buttons in the case, they are easier to find.  Also the case automatically wakes/sleeps the Fire, so that's less pressing of the on/off button for me as well.  By the way, you don't have to spend a small fortune for a case - mine is really nice and it only cost about $15 on Amazon.Yesterday when I typed on my new Fire I had no problems.  Today, though I still have auto capitalization and word suggestions turned on (I checked), the auto caps and word suggestions are not working.  I'm going to call Amazon about this, but I would hope that issues like these will be fixed with the next automatic update.The Silk browser crashed several times yesterday as soon as I opened more than one tab, though it's been ok today.  Again, another issue that will hopefully be fixed with an update, as I believe Amazon did for the Silk browser on the first generation Fires (initially I had problems with Silk being unstable on my first Fire, but that issue was resolved).I found Amazon's \"recommendations\" for me below my carousel annoying, so I got rid of them by going to Settings, then Applications, then Home Recommendations and turning them off.  Annoying problem solved.  As for the ads on the opening screen, they don't bother me as they're only there briefly till I swipe the screen.Based on the experience I had with my first Kindle Fire, I think once there is an update for the new Kindle Fire HD, many of the kinks that I and others are experiencing should be solved (except, of course, for the buttons). Overall, I do love my new Fire, and I hope to be just as happy with it as I have been with my first generation Fire.  Hopefully after fixes, the only thing that would keep me from giving it a five-star review would be the on/off and volume buttons.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice improvement over the original Kindle Fire", "Author": "Dave Edmiston", "ReviewID": "R3NERQJ227KFUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using my original Kindle Fire for about a year now, and I've been using Kindle eBook readers since the original version of the Kindle (K1), so I have many years worth of likes and dislikes with the Kindle devices.  I've been using this new Fire HD 8.9\" for about four days now and am very happy with it, with a few notable exceptions.  In general though, it's an amazing device and I'm pretty thrilled with it.I'm not happy about the lack of Flash, but that's inevitable based on Adobe's removal of Flash from the Android world.  My bigger complaint is over the lack of autocomplete in the Silk browser. I don't get it. They also changed the keyboard layout a little bit so that punctuation characters like the comma, the apostrophe, the question mark, etc. aren't available by just pressing and holding the period. So between the lack of autocomplete and the new location for these characters, typing text is clunkier than it was on the original Fire.Other than that, I really do love the new Fire.It's super fast. They really enhanced the browser and the CPU speed. Having a larger screen makes it easier to work with too. They also improved a lot of things on the UI to make the experience better.They stopped dumping your entire Library to the Carousel, which makes it a lot less cluttered when you initially start it up.I don't really care for the Related Items below the Carousel though (where the Favorites used to be). It's a pretty ham handed attempt to funnel you back to the Amazon store.The Facebook app stinks, but the screen is large enough and the tablet is fast enough that it's easier just to use the full Web-based version instead of the app or the mobile version.The product Offers on the home screen aren't as annoying as I had expected. I actually like them more than the screen saver images on the original Fire. At least these change up more often and give more variety.I like the new camera and the ability to use Skype.I like the attempts at location services, but it probably would have been easier just to put a cheap GPS radio in it.I thought I would really love the new location for the power button and the physical volume up/down buttons. The buttons are cheap though. I tried pushing volume down + power to take a screenshot (a feature that I was really hoping for), but the key combination never worked for me. This actually caused the power button to get stuck. With the power button stuck, there was no way to turn the device back on. I had to thump on the button with my finger a bunch of times to get it to unstick. I'll probably need to have Amazon replace this unit for me, because that's not OK.The Dolby speakers that Amazon touted so hard are actually really nice. I was surprised how good the sound quality is.For me the biggest and most awesome improvement is in the actual Book reader app. Reading Kindle books on the Fire HD 8.9\" is amazing. The larger screen is so much easier to read on. And one very cool feature is that when you turn the device to landscape view, it gives you a two-page view. This is a very comfortable way to read. (My wife says she's had the two-page view in her iPad's Kindle app for a long time.)I've heard a lot of people complain about the lack of power adapter.  You get a USB cord, and the idea is that you plug this into your PC.  If you stick with this option, you will get a very slow charge from your Kindle.  If you have an original Kindle Fire, you are much better off using that charger for the new Fire HD.  I actually like the fact that it comes with a good USB cable.  I have plenty of 2.1A USB chargers around the house, so I'll use the cable with those chargers.All in all, I'm really happy with the fire. I'm still steamed about the quirky text input experience in the Silk browser, but hopefully enough people will gripe about the browser that they'll fix it in another version.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fire OS 3.0; where art thou?", "Author": "Iago \"trinity\"", "ReviewID": "R1TLD1Q7N4F8P0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As per Amazon's PR:Amazon currently has no plans to update the software on the existing Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD tablets.It states that Fire OS 3.0 will be \"available exclusively\" on the new Kindle Fire HD and the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and 8.9-inch models.BOOOOO!

Easy to use and lightweight enough to carry like a small book.2. I like the moving home button. That's one thing that annoyed me about the iPad when I played with it in the Apple store is that the home button was a physical button. The home button is a soft button on the screen that moves around as the screen does. It is at a convenient location all the time so that helps.3. I can now read my tech books while lying down on the bed, which are usually heavy and a pain to carry around. I used my laptop before ( too big) and my iPhone ( too small) too and neither were comfortable for me to read while I was lying in bed or just lounging around at a cafe. I feel like Goldilocks when I say this but the 8.9 kindle fire is just right.4. The sound and video quality is pretty good. so are apps on the Amazon.5. Going to the store and buying the apps/games/books/music/video is pretty easy, smooth and very quick over wireless.Things I didn't like:1. Packaging. I felt like besides that small thin USB cable, it could have included something else. Like maybe an power adapter that should NOT be 10 dollars more. I don't know what the iPad comes with but I have an iPhone and iPod touch and they both came with their own adapters. I luckily , like every other tech junkie out there, already have a belk USB adapter so its not like I was totally inconvenienced or something. Just enough to crib about it on Amazon anyway. I also thought it should have come with its own earphones. It doesn't. you have to get those too. :(. I just think it sweetens the deal, that's all. Then again, I might be totally spoiled by Apple.2. Keyboard. The keyboard is easy enough to use but the response seems to have a little lag and it isn't as smooth as one might think it could be. it has suggested words on top of the keyboard which does help speed up searches. Luckily I'm not going to be using it much for typing.3. Auto correct. I do like features like these when I am texting and it is a great help. Usually, but the auto correct kept correcting my name when I used it as a proper noun in most instances like while entering it in fields like \"first or last name\" or \"username\" or other places where you would think it shouldn't matter what you typed in because it specifically asks for uniqueness. iPhone had that problem too but I fixed that by entering it in the address field. Which I felt I shouldn't have to do because guess what? The thing is registered to me and it says so on the top left hand corner too that this is \"Sonali's Kindle\". So it should stop auto correcting it to Somalia.  I spent a good 4 minutes entering my name over and over again because it kept auto correcting it. It needs to get a clue that after the first try the \"typo\" was intentional.4. GUI to the amazon store to buy physical stuff is clunky and non responsive. I wanted to buy a cover for my kindle. It just didn't respond to my touch to enter payment information or address and I kept trying. I've also notice some apps like Netflix and facebook have really slow response times and at times they just hang. Since I don't face any problem with response when I use the ebook reader or the app store and certain games, I am not sure if this one can be blamed on the kindle but on the app developers.Overall it's doing what I want it to do.

Well, this review isn't one of those.I never thought I would say this...as I really have tried so hard to avoid being one of \"those people,\" but after using the Kindle Fire, it's safe to say, yes, I am an Apple person.Right now I am using the iPhone 5, and the Kindle HD 8.9, and there is just no comparison when it comes to the quality. The following is a brief bullet pointed list of problems I have with the Kindle, that I do not have on the iPhone:- The glare. Oh god, the glare!!! Isn't this device advertised as being better than the iPad when it comes to glare? I don't see how that can be possible, because looking at this screen is like looking in the mirror. That is how reflective it is. And if you should want to watch a movie or tv show that's primarily dark, well good luck, because you're basically going to be staring at yourself for the next hour or two. IT IS TERRIBLE!- Startup. Start up is sloooooooow. I mean, this thing takes minutes to start up. And even then, once it's actually started, it's gonna take another few minutes to wait in order to pull up any of the apps, otherwise they will just freeze and/or crash. Best thing to do when you want to use it is press the start key, and then walk away and come back in another 15 minutes. Then you should finally be good to go.- App availability. It's really unfair to yourself to ever purchase and Apple product and then get a device that is going to use an android app, because let's face it - we all know there are a million more apps for Apple. That said, I thought there would still be a decent enough amount of apps to choose from on the Kindle, being that Amazon owns the other half of our world. Nope. Not even close. I looked up the apps I have on my Apple, and only was able to find about 1/8 of them. Let me repeat - about 1/8. That is unreal, and frankly, unacceptable. The entire device is built around apps, therefore one would expect there to be a decent amount.- App functionality. The few apps I have been able to find and download regularly freeze and crash, and are generally much slower than Apple apps to start up. Some of them were in fact so unreliable that I ended up just deleting them.- Customizable options. Ummm, yeah...there aren't any. At all. Being somewhat tech savvy, I enjoy the ability to greatly customize my devices. I choose different backgrounds, different start up screens, password protect my devices, etc. That I have found, you can do NONE of that on the Kindle. You're basically stuck with that glaring black background, and that stupid \"carousel\" app display.- Sound. The sound stinks as well. If you want to watch or listen to anything, just plan on having to turn the volume up all the way. And that's in a quiet, child-free household. If you have children or a loud house, just plan on not being able to hear it at all.- Buttons. If you can find the buttons, good luck pressing the right one. Half the time I press the shut down button trying to press the volume because they put all three of them right in a row. I get that they were trying to make the buttons blend in with the device for sleekness, but sometimes functionality over looks is the better way to go.Basically, I will use this thing until I can save up enough for an iPad. That's how terrible I think it is - and it is brand new. Do yourself a favor and save up a little extra cash and get the iPad.

I had read dozens of user reviews in advance and really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, probably because I was not yet familiar enough with it, relying on it caused me to miss a crucial email and a long-awaited meeting. This one was my bad, not Kindle's.Back home, I started using it more and found it difficult or impossible to access the online versions of my mail subscriptions. A magazine sample downloaded from Amazon Kindle site froze at 48% and did not let me advance. First star lost. Accessing my Gmail account was still cumbersome -- second star lost. For me, it was best for reading books: the vertical page size is about the same as a paper book's, and an off-white background selection is easy on the eyes.Now comes the function that dropped the third star: it goes dead frequently and is a hassle to revive. The first time it happened, the user guide was useless and online instructions did not work. I had to contact Kindle Help who walked me through it on two calls, one hour apart. The second time around, I followed the steps that Kindle Help had shown me. Again, it took an hour to revive it. Too labor intensive for me! I want something that comes to life when I plug it in to recharge it. Preferably something with a clear on-off button and a power indicator like my laptop and my phone.Kindle Fire may be an excellent tablet for most users, just not for me. I need something that makes it easy to read my newspaper and magazine subscriptions and access email. It also has to be available when I need it without an hour-long multi-step revival process. I guess I have been spoiled by the ease of using and recharging cellular phones and laptops. After eight months of intermittent use and comparing notes with savvy friends, I have concluded that an up-to-date smartphone and a 13-inch notebook will bridge all my needs, and I no longer even need a tablet.

Adams", "ReviewID": "R3T7RZPX47Y2JF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet for my wife at Christmas.  She had previous owned an ipad, but unfortunately, it was stolen in a home invasion and was never recovered.  Since that time, she has occasionally used my kindle fire hd 7\" but longed for her own table.  So I decided to purchase this 8.9\" kindle fire.  All the same great features with a bigger screen I thought.  How could I go wrong?Overall, I suppose this tablet is okay.  As a amazon prime member, my wife has easy access to all the videos, books, and kindle apps her heart desires.  She has started reading much more because of the convenience of searching for and obtaining books, and naturally the bigger screen just makes that a lot easier.  Unfortunately, however, her experience surfing the internet has not been as grand.Before I purchased the kindle fire 8.9\", I had read reviews that warned that this tablet had issues with stuttering while loading pages and generally unexplained slowness.  Since I'd never experienced anything like this with my kindle fire 7\" I sort of shrugged it off.  I might have disregarded those problems a little to quickly I've discovered, because my wife has had lots of issues with pages with rich image content not loading quickly, stuttering during loading or just freezing of  the whole tablet.As the tech guy at the house (and I'm using that moniker loosely because I am not that tech suave) I've had to try to find a solution to this problem.  I've read pages and pages of supposed fixes, and I've tried more than I can recall right now.  One thing that has really helped is by using apps for all my wife's favorite websites like facebook, twitter, pinterest, etc. instead of using the web browser to view them.  (I've never had to use an app for these sites on my fire 7\".  The web pages work great in browser mode.)But even though we've cut down on the problems, the slowness issues still persistent, though thankfully we've eliminated the freezing.All in all, the kindle fire 8.9\" is a great looking tablet at a really good price.  It does work - more or less, and it is really convenient for using amazon prime services.  However, if you are thinking of buying this one, you should take the warning about slowness, stuttering loading pages, and freezes very seriously.  Those things might be a problem with your particular kindle fire 8.9\".", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch", "Author": "Joey Purnell", "ReviewID": "RM6Y10XB291MC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch is a pretty good tablet. It's not great but it's still pretty good. It has a nice screen with awesome speakers and sound! But it is pretty heavy so it's not that comfortable to hold. It has a nice sleek looking design. But I think the ports would be better placed on the bottom. But probably the biggest negative is the app store. It is very small compared to Apple and Google's app stores. Their are a lot of good apps NOT available on it like Instagram,Google Chrome,Youtube, Google Maps, Google Plus, and the free version of Cut the Rope. Speaking of web browsers, Amazon's silk browser is ok, but the fact that they don't have chrome in the app store just makes you want it even more! The battery life also isn't that great. But some more positive things about the device are, that even though the app store is limited most of the apps on their are really good! The reading experience is better than any other tablet on the market right now. And if you have Amazon Prime you have a lot of great options available to you. X Ray is also a really cool feature especially when watching movies. The front facing camera is also pretty cool to have. But sadly it does not have a back facing camera.

On my laptop I will get very good download speeds at almost 50 feet from my gateway roughly 15+ megs per second.  On the Kindle it's well  below that.  When I try to watch Netflix it constantly freezes up and goes into buffering.  On web pages the load time is excessive.  When I am closer to the gateway though, the Kindle runs fast.  My second complaint is the gated community that Kindle users are forced into so we can't use Google Play and download a large number of apps.  Silk is a horrible web browser also.*********UPDATE 12/30/2013: I did research on Google and I guess it's Google that won't allow Kindle in. Also, the Silk web browser seems to be working better now for whatever reason. It's not as slow as before.

Here are my thoughts:I won't get into the pros too much because I'm pretty sure those are quite easy to see: screen, sound, size, price. I just want to get into the reasons why I sent it back.First the internet connection was really finicky when starting it up after it was locked. It would take quite a while to find the connection and sometimes required a restart to connect again.One of the main reasons I bought this was so I could video chat with my family. I couldn't get Skype to function properly. The audio was so quiet I couldn't hear anything people were saying. It would freeze the whole tablet, requiring me to force a restart. It is incredibly disappointing to have to force restarts on a brand new device. I troubleshot it for a couple of days, uninstalling/reinstalling and what not, but I couldn't get it to function. I'm sure I could have contacted amazon for some more troubleshooting, but I decided to send it back before reaching that point.I was really uncomfortable using the carousel function. It was neat to see the icons so big, but that was about it. Other than that it seemed like a huge waste of space to have only one or two massive icons available on the screen at one time.The App Store left a lot to be desired. There just weren't that many interesting options. Maybe I was just spoiled by my iPhone, but it feels really lacking to me.The straw that broke the camels back, prompting me to immediately return it, was something so simple and tiny: I wasn't able to save pictures from my email. How silly. A function that simple should be included without a doubt.In the end, it looks good, feels good, and sounds good. It was the tiny stuff that frustrated me to the pointof returning it. I didn't want to troubleshoot the device just to get it operational. I didn't want to deal with a finicky internet connection. I didn't like the lack off App Store options. Skype was a mess.

If a few unimaginable, disappointing problems hadn't reared their ugly head just recently I'd give the Kindle a 5-star rating, unfortunately for now, kindle is just mediocre. ;/Let's start it this way... until yesterday I WANTED to <3 the Kindle. I've gotten 3, the Kindle, Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and Kindle Fire HD 7.I was sharing my son's Kindle for reading books until I got my Kindle this month (I have the 7\" Kindle Fire HD) I ignored some of the \"glitches\" thinking I'd take the time to straighten things out once I had my personal Kindle...well no such luck.1) There is no way to keep content from anyone you share an account with, be it a spouse, parent or child. Meaning my horror books are visible to my son, no matter what I do, unless I want to delete my purchased content. I personally like to read and reread books, now I'm forced to waste money and get rid of a book...bummer!! Luckily my son is not a kid to open something that's not his BUT some of the title pages are scary for a young child, so I'm left with only one option. Don't buy, or buy and delete, which still makes the cover photo available while I'm reading the book.2) There is an app for monitoring your children's Kindle activity (Kindle Freetime) but it's a pay for app and the ONLY way to keep adult content, inappropriate content from a child's view. Disappointing! I should be able to block material. This could be a solution to above complaint.3) There is no way to organize your books and apps. For someone who has purchased dozens and dozens of books in 8 months, this is a real pain in the bottom. Considering it's actually available on the earlier and less expensive versions...why leave that option off the Kindle Fire HD? Again, this could be an easy solution to the above frustrating complaints.These are enough for me to be disappointed with the Kindle. I'm considering returning the 2 most recent purchases, and no longer purchasing Kindle eBooks, so that I don't risk my son being exposed to books I'd rather he not see.BTW before anyone comments back the books I'm personally discussing are true crime, mystery, suspense books, nothing crazy, no smut, no triple x, I just don't want my son seeing the cover to Black Dahlia or the likes. My son won't be looking for them but he simply can't AVOID seeing them as they are listed in the cloud ;/There should be a way to organize or remove books from view.Darn Kindle I wanted so badly to like you.

This is my third Kindle.  The only reason I bought this latest one is that my first generation Kindle Fire stopped charging (after only having it for 1 year 4 months).  Amazon customer service told me that these units are well known for this issue.When ordering this (via a customer service rep on the phone), I said I wanted a KF without the \"special offers\".  He said they didn't have any available (?), but I could simply pay $15 to have the ads removed via their website.  Interestingly enough, it arrived WITHOUT the special offers, and it didn't cost me a dime.  Way to go, Amazon!I love the larger screen... the clarity is amazing.  And I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound - I don't need to use headphones any more when watching a movie.  I sometimes even have to turn the volume DOWN, it's that good.I don't have the same problem I've seen other reviewers mention... the lagging internet speed.  Mind seems to go lickety split with no trouble.  And yes, the power off/on button at the top is sometimes difficult to find, but I don't think that's anything worth complaining about.The only negative I have (so far) is the battery.  It takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R to recharge it... whether I use the USB cable that came with the unit (and their PowerFast for Accelerated Charging plug), or another similar cable.  My previous KF used to charge in 2-3 hours... now, it often takes 10+ hours to get it charged enough to use it without being attached to a cable.  Seems a tad long, in my humble estimation.The charge also doesn't last very long... I can have the thing fully charged (100%), and it goes down to 25% VERY rapidly - even if all I'm doing is reading a book.  I HATE that.All-in-all, I am reasonably happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" unit.  Would I have been AS happy to stick with my first generation Kindle (if it hadn't stopped charging)?  You bet.  Would I have preferred to replace my non-charging first generation Kindle with a plain ol' Kindle Fire Tablet 7\" LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8GB and save $25.00??  Yup, I probably would have been just as happy with that.

The only complaint (minor) is that the hd isn't really that great of high def... its a little misleading. I remember commercials on tv before i purchased it, bragging how clear the screen was compared to an apple ipad. What I mean is that the screen resolution or definition isn't that much more noticeably better than the first gen kindle fire. An example: my 5 year old & I watch a few funny youtube videos before his bedtime, and the screen resolution is much better and more clear on my samsung galaxy s 3. I can hardly stand watching youtube or other streaming vids from the internet because the picture quality is grainy and blocky (?). And that is with using high speed wifi internet in my house! Needless to say, we stopped watching bedtime youtubes on the kindle hd and only watch them on my cell phone.  But, the size, apps, and convenience is great. General websurfing and email is pretty much the only reason i purchased this device. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. Glad I didn't spend several hundred more for an ipad. If Amazon keeps their technology advancing and competitive, I will continue to be a customer.5 stars because it delivered exactly what I expected and its a good value for what I paid.

I switched to the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD because of the way magazines and newspapers are formatted (i.e. clear index and perfect reading layout of each article), the ease of emailing in PDFs and then reading them in Kindle or the Adobe App (where they automatically show up), and the ability to easily hold the 8.9 in one hand without a case.  If you have a laptop and an iPhone as I do, the new Kindle 8.9 is a perfect in between for users who read a lot.  And if you want some tunes while you are reading, Amazon's music product is pretty good (not to mention plenty of storage options for those who want some movies or TV handy for plane rides).Since I plan on sticking with the Kindle 8.9 platform for a long time, I do look forward to a few improvements on version 2.0.  First, I think the processor is a touch slow, especially using the Silk browser - version 2.0 should make Silk feel \"quick\".  Second, I wish Amazon had MOG quality downloads available for music (or even the MOG app available).  Over time, Amazon certainly wants to be a leading seller of music/streaming and, after listening to hi-quality MOG or Apple Lossless, the Kindle 8.9 tunes sound a bit lame.  Lastly, while I love the Kindle reading products, there is less you can do with an article than on iPad - Kindle needs more tools to forward, post, copy, and highlight.  Sure some of these are available for some products (like highlighting in Kindle books, for example) but the Newsstand offers almost nothing (you can't even save articles anywhere).So it's a great reading device - great enough to make me swap out an iPad Retina - but it's my guess/hope that v 2.0 will be the ultimate (for me anyway).", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it", "Author": "Barbara J.

I took a chance and purchased a stylus so that I could wind it between my fingers much the same way I hold a pen to write and it works quite well for me. I can read, surf the web some and even play a few games. I ended up getting the 32 GB model just to be sure I had plenty of storage space for some of the apps I chose to get.The display is beautiful and streaming movies and videos on it is just icing on the cake. Reading text-books for school is a breeze compared to my original Kindle saving me plenty of room on my desk and not having to fumble around in a book trying to find the information I needed. All in all it does the job and then some. If I had to choose the best thing about it I'd have to say its size. It is smaller and lighter than most laptop computers I have used yet it is still large enough it's easy to read and carry around.

It's great to have all my streaming content from Netflix and Amazon wherever I go.  I did sideload the Dolphin browser and a version of flash that works with it, so that I can watch other video formats.The APP store is really overloaded with games for kids.  I guess people must use their devices as babysitters.  But I did find some useful free APPS.  I recommend YOUZEEK, which seems to have all the music on youtube in categories, by artist. I am a guitar player, so I can plug my Kindle Fire HD into my PA, fire up YOUZEEK and jam along with my favorite artists while I watch the video (if youtube has the video). I also recommend the PBS video APP, Flixter, Urbanspoon, IMDb, Norton Mobile Security free APPS.I purchased the powerfast charger with my Kindle and it works great.I also bought a rooCase for it which is a great value.

In my opinion it is not worth $15 to disable them.Pros:-A must have for Amazon prime members-fast and powerful processing and browsing-great screen resolution-Great speakers (this was a major complaint with the original fire I can now watch NBA league pass with the speakers turned up without earphones)-Great price-Great book/movie/app selection-X-Ray (I didn't think i would use this feature at first but it is actually pretty cool. Watching movies and being able to get information and recommendations is great)-Upgraded the silk browser (I didn't love the original silk browser but this version is pretty awesome, the suggestions and bookmark tab is very useful)Free time (love this app, easy to set up and very useful for anyone who has kids)-Upgraded book and magazine experience (scrolling and page turning animations are smoother, pages look crisp and easy on the eyes).Cons:-Customization (This is really a stretch considering the fact that i actually like the UI used for the fire, but it is not a native android experience and thus not very customization)-No memory expansion (this would have taken the 8.9 from 5 stars to 7 stars. I understand why Amazon did not do it but it would have been nice)-No front facing camera or GPS (these are really minor issues, there was only one time where I could have used the front facing camera but I also have a smart phone so no real complaint)I love my Kindle fire HD I would recommend it to anyone. Amazon really stepped up their game with this product!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R8RRO6ZF7450H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for my wife as a Christmas present.  She was always complaining that she could never get on the computer because of me!  I will not make this a long review, as others have already done so.  I will say, however, that the Kindle has exceeded all of my wife's expectations, as well as my own.  It was not difficult to set the email account up with Verizon on the Kindle.  She has enjoyed the Facebook app. and uses it daily.  She finds it very easy to surf through the Internet, and equally as easy to send and receive email.  I have had a lot of fun with Amazon Prime watching the old Western \"B\" movies...movies I have not seen in 50 years--Roy Rogers, Johnny Mack Brown, Gene Autry, etc.  There are an awful lot of movies offered through Amazon Prime that are free to download, and I find this feature to be most useful and a super value.  New owners of a Kindle get a free 30 day membership with Prime, and after that, it is $79 a year.  I expect full well to renew after the 30 days is up.  I did have one problem however;  for some reason I was unable to download videos after 10 days.  I called Amazon service on a weekend, and they told me they would turn it over to the technical department.  I called the next day to see the status of it, and was told it would take up to 3 business days to address my problem.  I received an email from Amazon late the same day, tried the video downloads, and yep, it is now working.  As far as the charger not included with the unit, I don't think that is a big deal.  I purchased a wall charger, cord, car charger and a nice protective leather (like) cover for under $15.00 over E-Bay which included shipping.  So, I was able to purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for $249.00 on a one day only sale, and I think this was a terrific value for the money.  Knowing what I know now, would I make the same decision?  Absolutely!  There may be better tablets out there, but for the price and the value received, I don't think you can beat the Kindle....", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Complete Success!", "Author": "Kris James", "ReviewID": "R3JJ8PTW4RS1R6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband is good with computers, but slow to adapt to new technology.

I've owned an iPad 1 since it launched, and while I love it, it's recently slowed down and isn't compatible with iOS 6.  So, I had been considering moving on to a more current tablet.  The newest iPad was an obvious choice, but when I considered what I primarily used the iPad for - reading books and comics, surfing the internet while on the couch, watching video - I realized that I didn't necessarily NEED to live within Apple's ecosystem.  Sure, they offer a ton more apps, but I don't use enough of them to justify another $500 purchase.So, I looked to either the Nexus 10 or Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Ultimately, I chose the Kindle Fire HD because of its integration with the Amazon store.  I'm already a Prime member, I have a vast library of Kindle books, and I use they're Cloud music player because it works with just about any device I'd want.I'm glad I went with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It's a good, not great, device.  When I first received it, and put it through its paces, I was a little disappointed.  It doesn't run as smooth as the iPad, and again, few apps are as polished.  And then there's Silk... the world's worst browser.  It's slow, clunky, and doesn't do anything better than any other browser out there.  Fortunately, the more time I spent with the Kindle Fire HD, the more I learned about it and came to enjoy it.When you get past the fact that it's not the iPad, you can appreciate the Kindle Fire HD for what it is - an amazing e-reader that also happens to be an adequate tablet.  Seriously, this is the best Kindle experience you'll find.  Books are baked seamlessly into the OS, the Kindle UI is excellent, X-Ray is cool, and the text to speech feature works amazingly well.  Not the Audible option, mind you, but the standard text to speech option available on any book.Besides book integration, the Kindle Fire excels at delivering all Amazon content, which should be obvious.  Movies are quick to load, music stored in the Cloud work perfectly, and photos are easily synced with your Facebook account.  Again, it's just a darn good personal tablet.  The fact that it's $200 less than an entry level iPad shouldn't be ignored either.Outside of seamless access to Amazon content, the best reason to own a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is its beautiful screen.  As someone who owned an iPad before it had a retina screen, I can tell you the difference is staggering.  Everything is clear and crisp.  Reading is enjoyable, and movies have excellent black levels.  For an avid comic reader like myself, the Kindle Fire HD is a godsend.  Even though the size of the screen is slightly smaller than that of an actual comic book, everything is perfectly legible because of the high resolution.In short, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It's not an iPad, but really, you shouldn't have expected it to be.  It's a great reader (books and comics) and video player, and has an adequate number of tablet apps.  Is the lack of specialty apps worth the $200 savings?  I'd say so.  Especially if you're already knee deep in the Amazon ecosystem.  If you're a Prime member, and also use the Cloud Music Match service, it's close to a must buy.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Review", "Author": "Margie Burns", "ReviewID": "R3JYDUBADVCA5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", but I had a hard time operating it at first, have gotten better but just wish that there were better instructions on line.

I have a wifi router that is located in a large building, quite a distance from my office, and on a different floor. This device gets far better wifi reception than any other device that I own, including my laptop, smart phone, and Nook. At even this distance from the router, Netflix streaming is seamless, with no buffering at all. Web surfing, downloading apps etc. are also relatively quick. When I am closer to the router, speed is lightning fast. Graphics are very nice as well. I'm very happy with this purchase. About the only thing that I don't like is that every app that I use is automatically added to an onscreen carousel. I really like to keep an uncluttered screen, and manually removing these apps from the carousel is somewhat of a pain. There may be a way in settings to disable this feature, but if so, I haven't found it yet. I do like the favorites feature which is easy to use. Having this feature is a better way of accessing what I want quickly and the carousel of recently used apps seems redundant. To me, it would be far better to only add things such as most recently read books to the carousel.

Of course, I researched this tablet when it was announced as well as read reviews after its release. This is my 4th Kindle.  I have had my new Kindle Fire for about a month now, and it is definitely a keeper.  I will touch on a few issues below that have been mentioned in other reviews.THE CHARGER (or lack thereof):  I knew from research that it would come only with a USB cord for charging.  I have other chargers (one for the original Kindle Fire) but opted to purchase the PowerFast Charger for the \u00bd off price of $9.99 which is an option for everyone who purchases this tablet through Amazon.  The location of the charging port on the device does not bother me because I can just turn it upside down while charging and watch a movie easily without it being in the way.FLASH PLAYER:  I\u2019m not going to say much about this except that there is a work-around for this by downloading an older version of Flash.  Read the comments on other reviews for details.DESIGN:  Fabulous is all I can say.  It is just the right size, not too small, not too big.  Thin and lightweight.  I purchased the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 case for $54.99.  It has a low profile and I like that.  I also have one of those AmazonBasics Netbook Bag for 7 to 10 inch tablets with a handle.  It carries my Kindle 8.9 (in the case I mentioned above), USB charger, and PowerFast Charger, whenever I am traveling.PICTURE QUALITY:  Fantastic, sharp, crystal clear movies and shows.  The high definition is really obvious when compared to my original Kindle Fire.  A++ in this area, Amazon!!WiFi:  I had no problems setting up WiFi.  After inputting my router security code, it recognized it and connected immediately.  I tested streaming a movie in the opposite side of the house where the signal is the lowest.  When streaming a movie on Netflix on my ORIGINAL Kindle Fire, it would sometimes lag and show a \u201cbuffering\u201d message, but on the NEW Kindle Fire HD 8.9, there was NO lag or slowdown of streaming the same movie.  Movies and shows stream seamlessly and I have no connection issues, even low signal areas.SOUND QUALITY:  Dolby sound is very nice as well, however, 90% of the time, I use headphones.CAMERA:  For my use, the camera is a nice add-on, but I don\u2019t intend to take pictures with this camera, anyway.  I have an iPhone for that and with this Kindle HD 8.9, it has the ability to import your photos from other mobile devices (iPhone?) and Facebook or Twitter directly to your tablet.  Love that feature!  I would primarily use this camera for Skype, probably.4G LTE WIRELESS:  This seems to be a bit issue with a lot of folks.  I\u2019ll admit that I was attracted to the $49 one-time fee for a year\u2019s worth of 250MB/month 4G LTE Wireless coverage.  But I knew that 250MB would not be enough for me.  We have 3 iPhones in our family through AT&T.;  So I went to the AT&T; store with my Kindle.  I dropped my current family plan and changed to a Mobile Share Plan which gave me 10 gigs of data per month for 3 iPhones and 1 Kindle Fire Tablet.  My hubby and son don\u2019t use much data at all, and I use maybe 3 gigs per month.  So, in my world, this is a win-win and I\u2019m spending only about $30.00 more every month for 10 gigs of data.  As you may recall, the other options given on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 during 4G setup were 3 gigs for $30 a month and 5 gigs for $50 a month.  I\u2019m getting 10 gigs for $30 a month.  Thank you AT&T;!!!PRICE DIFFERENCE:  OK, stay with me on this......I compared the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 gig for $369 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G LTE Wireless for $499.  This is a difference of $130.  So you pay $130 more for the same high end, 32 gig model just to include the 4G LTE capability.  THEN, the average person signs up for the $49.99 for the first year 4G LTE Wireless for 250MB of data per month.  So you are paying $179.99 MORE for this Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G LTE Wireless just to get this feature.Now, when you look on AT&T;\u2019s site, to get a data plan for a tablet equal to 250MG per month, it normally cost the average person $14.99 a month for this data plan.  This amount times 12 months equals $179.88.  So, really, AT&T;, is getting their money in the long run because Amazon is probably forking over most, if not all, of the profit they receive selling the 4G LTE version of the tablet to AT&T.;  Amazon probably views this as an acceptable loss because they know that they will recoup this amount plus more when people purchase media from their website.  Of course, this is only speculation on my part, but, it does sound feasible, doesn\u2019t it?So, in my opinion, this tablet exceeds my expectations.  NO disappointments, NO frustrations, and NOT a waste of money, as many would claim in the 1 star reviews.  You just have to know what YOU need in a tablet, and know WHAT you are buying.  This is a media consumption device, pure and simple.  It\u2019s not meant for heavy duty productivity, spread sheets, etc.  I LOVE IT!!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than iPad", "Author": "C.

I have a Roku and Cable, but sometimes I want to chill in bed and consume some media.  I dont care about e-mail or other apps as I plan on using this at home as a multi-media type device.The screen is awesome.  I will match it up with my iPad 4 on most things concernign video.  The sound quality is better than all but the Galaxy Note 10.1 which has 2 front facing speakers!!Reading books is awesome on this thing.  Magazines are even better.  Movie play is great in HD and I can easily have my eyes on the screen for an entire movie and not get strained.It is not the \"do everything\" tablet you might need.

The user interface is designed to continually try to sell Amazon content. It's not friendly with Google Apps, which I am heavily invested in. The Silk browser is sub-par and the apps selection in the Amazon Store too limited and in some cases overpriced. Eventually I did what many others have - erased the Amazon operating system and replaced it with a generic Android OS. It's given the tablet a new lease on life. I can now use all of Google's apps and any others in the Android marketplace. It also seems more stable and reliable.

You can even put in a password so no one else can use it.  You can hook up to libraries, music, games, and there are lots of sites for downloading free books. Amazon Prime lets you read one new book a month.  My only complaint is the way the charge port is made.  According to the Geek squad at Best Buy, the charge port isn't braced like those in a tablet or laptop so it cannot move, and the contact points are easily broken just by plugging it into the charger.  They said the charge port is the main reason people bring them kindles, and it's not something they can fix..  I would advise getting an extended warranty if you buy one.  If yours is one with an easily broken charge port, and you have an extended warranty, Amazon will replace it.  Right now I'm on my 3rd Kindle Fire, because of that charge port.  And if the charger goes out, you can't get any personal information, like credit card numbers and passwords, etc,. off the Kindle before it is sent off to somewhere to be repaired and sold again.  If the maker put something around that charge port so it couldn't wiggle and break, I would have no complaint at all but they would probably charge more for it then.  Also, the last charge cord sent with my Kindle is impossible to get in the Kindle without maybe breaking that fragile charge port inside the Kindle, so I don't use it.  I use my old one instead.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Silk issues", "Author": "R.

It's not worth it.  Wait for a sale or a refurbished unit under $150.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a decent piece of hardware that is diminished by its user interface.  People who have never used a tablet may not be bothered by the interface, but those familiar with real Android smartphones and tablets are likely to be annoyed by a design that so clearly promotes shopping and consumption of Amazon's digital content.  Yes, I know, the primary purpose of the Kindle is to encourage more purchases from Amazon, but the sales focus is excessive.When you install a free app from Amazon's app store, you receive an e-mail confirmation of your $0.00 purchase.  Overkill.The special offers on the start-up screen are no problem.  They go almost unnoticed among all the other sales pitches.Other observations: -  The 8.9\" size is easier to hold in the hand than a 10.1\" tablet, and it is lighter. -  The display is sharp, making it easy to see detail on Google maps, for example. -  The dual-band radio is great if you have a dual-band \"n\" or an \"ac\" wireless router. -  Works well with Bluetooth Android keyboard. -  No option to use an SD card, because Amazon wants you to use its cloud for storage. -  Short battery life when in active use; keep a charger handy. -  The real Android OS provides many more configuration options than does the simplified Kindle OS.Fortunately, the Kindle Fire's operating system can be replaced.  So, within 48 hours of starting to use the Kindle, I had converted mine to run as a real tablet with Android 4.2.2.  It's a nice Android tablet.  The excellent screen and decent internals make the Kindle a good value if you can get it for less than full price.  Note:  A DIY conversion to Android is technically challenging.

I purchased my first Kindle Fire HD after trying out a friend's Kindle. I checked the local stores' prices, but I got a much better price by calling the Amazon Kindle-Sales Representative. He was able to get me a better Kindle model for less than the local stores' prices. He also found the magnetic RooCase cover which I wanted; you can turn on your Kindle just by flipping the cover open! He found me a basic-priced stylus, a protective film-cover for the screen, and he told me to try out my Kindle for 2 weeks before buying the separate Damage Warrenty. He gave me the Damage Co's. phone number, and I later did have them start the Damage Warrenty after I decided to keep my new Kindle. I had a good friend come over to help me connect my new WiFi device and get my new Kindle registered. Now, I thought I had purchased the same size Kindle as she had, but it turned out that I had gotten the larger 8.9 model. I had gotten the sizes mixed-up after handling store models without covers. My friend was impressed that I got my larger Kindle 8.9 model and all its items for just $50.00 more than her 7\" Kindle HD alone had cost her at a local store. She was impressed.  I will add that having the Kindle Support phone number is great!  Any time I had a question, a quick phone call to a service rep solved the issue.  I am also glad to say that Amazon stands behind its own Manufacturer's Warrenty, too! We live in a rural area and when my Kindle 8.9 was having issues in January-February of 2013 receiving emails, one of the service supervisors reviewed my Kindle's history. She learned that I used my Kindle every day for several hours due to personal disability issues that make traveling difficult. So my Kindle was one of my main methods of entertainment and of emailing friends & family.  She saw the Kindle's email delivery problem reoccured over and over after several service reps had tried to restore that app on my Kindle. She said she felt my Kindle needed to be returnef to Amazon. However, she said not to worry at all as they were sending me a new Kindle to replace my original one as mine was still under full warranty for one more month. So, within two days, my new replacement Kindle arrived. A great service rep walked me through the steps of 'moving' all my items from my first Kindle into my second Kindle. We had put my RooCase cover onto the new Kindle at her suggestion so that I could tell the two Kindles apart as we had to have both devices sitting side by side to complete the transfers of my apps, past book & movie purchases, etc. Finally, we had the new Kindle registered and running well...my older Kindle was completely back to \"factory settings\". It had nothing of mine left on it at all, which is how she said a Kindle needs to be when it's returned. She actually thanked me for being so patient and following all her instructions! I felt She was the one who had done a wonderful job in walking an older lady through all those steps! My new Kindle works very well with no problems at all. So, I  would recommend getting your Kindle and any parts from the Amazon Store.

My first Kindle lasted several months, everything was fine. I could play games, read all sorts of books and use the web browser. Then suddenly my Kindle started locking up and freezing or just restarting itself. After resetting it to factory default (and having to start over on everything that wasn't on the Cloud, which is quite a bit) It continued to lock up and freeze. Amazon customer service was great and quickly replaced the Kindle. The next Kindle that came was dirty and had obviously signs of pre-use. The battery would only last a couple hours and all apps and books would lock the Kindle up constantly. As long as I restarted the Kindle 4 to 5 times a day and cleared the cache on all apps and web browser several times a day it was somewhat useable.  Back to customer service, restore defaults, hard reset the Kindle, turn the screen brightness down, turn the volume down and the battery still only lasted a couple hours and I still wasn't able to read books on the device. Insert Kindle number 3... Again Kindle number 3 had some sort of grease marks on the back and finger prints on the screen when it came out of the box. The power button only worked half the time and something wasn't working properly with the WIFI..... Kindle number 4 locked up upon the initial setup and got stuck in reboot mode until the battery died. Now Kindle number 4 cannot do anything with Silk without it restarting the device. Some apps work, most do not and reading books is very laggy (it could take several seconds after you turn a book page for the device to catch up).Meanwhile customer service tells me they just don't understand, that these are fantastic devices and should be able to run anything I want to do with them.

My daughter found that button and all she had to do was tap it, effectively wiping my Kindle out of all apps, books, movies, etc. I had to download everything again and basically lost all of the saved data for all of my games. When you are on level 70 of Candy Crush, this can hurt. I did indeed put parental controls on the device.

Its impossible to access the google play store without rooting it, which can eaisly brick the device, rendering it completely useless untill you send it in. There is just way too much available on google play for Amazon to just block it on a device that would be perfect for it. There are a couple other apps that do work for searching/installing new apps without using Amazons app store, which is the only reason I didnt return it. So far about 90% of the apps that Amazon charges for are legaly available for free elsewhere.... The default \"carousel\" home screen is awkward and clunky. There are some other options out there, but you can never completely get rid of the horrid home screen. You also have to pay Amazon if you want the advertisements to be taken off your lock screen.... Yes, even after you BUY it, you are still forced to view ads unless you give them even more money.In hindsight, I really wish I would have bought a different, un-crippled android tablet.

I bought one with more power after reading the reviews, so I do have a hotter charger, ($10 on Amazon) but I also found that it wasn't necessary. Just use your cell phone charger. So it takes an extra hour or two, so what? The charging icon is not automatically displayed. Go to settings and turn it on, or you can't tell its charging. (its also a very tiny icon, put on your reading glasses to verify that its charging!!)The unique part I mention is that it does not have the standard desk top format we are used to looking at. It does not display a desk top which you put icons or short cuts on in the traditional sense. It has a completely different way of showing them which for me and my wife took a while to get accustomed to. I guess someone is always trying to invent a better mouse trap, but its really not an improvement over the normal desktop scenario everyone is used to. But other than that its a great product.

It made it only $80 more than the most expensive reader. I had previously owned a Kindle reader with a navigation button. When the button quit working I was unable to use the reader anymore. I began looking for a new Kindle and was unsure which one to purchase. My 10 yr old has a Samsung tablet which I have used on occasion and I find it easy to navigate. I have a Kindle app on my laptop which I used regularly but some books I wanted to check out of the library would only download to a Kindle and not a Kindle app per the publishers guidelines. So when Amazon put the Kindle Fire on sale I decided to get the HD so I could read and also use the internet and play games. I bought the 16 GB with Wi-Fi because I didn't want to pay for a wireless plan and we have Wi-Fi at home. When it arrived I opened it and put it in the case I had purchased and immediately began to use it. It is so easy. The screen is very responsive to finger taps and swipes, maybe even more so than the Samsung. I never have any trouble with my internet connection and pages load very quickly. At 39 I am in what I guess you would call the in between generation. Computers became a household item when I was a teenager and has progressed from there. I didn't cut my teeth on technology but I find it easy to comprehend and this Kindle is very easy for me. My 5, 3, & 2 year old all love to play games on it and read books. My 10 year old wants to play on it too. If you want a Kindle for reading but also spend time online and play games then this is for you.

Flash is NOT supported on this particular device, and you cannot side-load it.  Well, you can side-load it, but it will not function.  So don't bother trying.I wanted an inexpensive, large-screen tablet that would allow me to watch anything on You Tube, a live-stream of one of my local news stations, and view the magazines to which I subscribe in digital form...all without paying any monthly fees, or even one-time fees.  I thought this tablet was for me.Well, there is no real app for You Tube, so that's out. If you go to You Tube's website, you can't watch anything because, like I wrote, Flash is not supported on this device.  (It is supported on some other Kindles, but NOT the HD 8.9\")  And, I could not watch a live-stream of my favorite local news because, again, no Flash!  (Adobe's problem, not Kindle!  Shame on them!)I found some of my magazines (for free) in their digital form, because I'm already a print subscriber, they were free.  Most of the other magazines were viewable IF I paid for a year's digital subscription. No thanks. I'm not paying twice.Since this Kindle device doesn't support all Android apps, there is a chance may apps you may have on your Droid or IOS phone will NOT be available on the Kindle...so make SURE that this will do what you want it to do before you buy it.  Seemed like there were a lot of \"silly\" apps and lots of games. If that's what you like, then you will probably like this tablet.  Or if you're into books, you may find what you're looking for.  (I'm not a big reader, so I didn't investigate books available)Lesson-learned for me...I should have checked into it all a lot more.

There was a promotion with back to school that brought the device down to $200. I decided that for that price I would try it out and see what it can all do. I have been pleasantly surprised. I was on the fence about tablets and decided I would replace my recently dead laptop with another laptop. After two hours of trying to navigate Windows 8 on my new laptop I took it back to the store and was once again at square one trying to get a mobile device. I'm so glad I gave my Kindle a try. I want to preface this by saying if you're looking for a true tablet experience with tons of apps this is not the route to go. The interface as a whole is limited compared to a normal Android tablet, but what the Kindle does do, it does very well. I am able to browse the web freely, while listening to music on Pandora, and can also check my various email accounts. There are also some apps that I have downloaded to the device that I use as well, such as Netflix. The app store is not as extensive as the regular Android store, but there are quite a few apps that work very well on the Kindle. For my basic mobile needs I love this device. Anytime I need a more powerful machine I just use my desktop. (I know, I'm one of the few that still uses one of those) I actually prefer my Kindle compared to the IPad 2 that I have for work. I find that I like the user interface better and that the screen quality is much sharper than the IPad. I also like the more compact size of the Kindle compared to the bigger tablets. As a whole I do not regret my purchase one bit. I love using my Kindle and would definitely buy one again.

The screen quality is great, comparable to the i-pad. Play-back sound is good enough for every-day expectations. Don't expect it to have the power of a boom box, or a full stereo equipment!I must say it is probably my own fault that I find this product lacking in a few ways: I should have read the specs more carefully.  Why did I not read them? I guess it is so much common place already to have these features even in mini-size smart devices that it never occurred to me that they are not on the Kindle!1) It sucks that this tablet cannot take videos. Photos, yes - but hardly: as long as you take them with the front camera, which admittedly is not easy, if the taker does not want to be in the picture.How much more can it cost to integrate a second camera lens, to allow photo taking? I mean, come on, Amazon, the little i-phone and other comparable tablets have it, so why not the Kindle tablet?2) This leads to point two: No video recording!!! Same as above... it should just have it! I wonder what Amazon is thinking... do they believe people will go and buy an i-pad or a Nexus on top of the Kindle Fire, in order to get these features?These two points are my biggest regrets for the Kindle Fire 8.5, and I find it truly regrettable and disappointing!Other things I wish it had: a software for note-taking and email dictation. Obviously, that goes with the above two points: if they can integrate a camera, they can integrate a software like I have on the iPhone, for instance, to use spoken dictation with the microphone.In conclusion of this, I'd call it a rather passive tablet. You can watch videos, you can see photos you took with another camera, you can play back music recorded by another device... You cannot do any of it WITH this tablet.You can surf the web and look at websites, and you can type (albeit painstakingly) your emails with it, no dictation.I guess the two most useful features I will use are the consolidated email feature, where you can see the email of any number of different accounts (yahoo, aol, gmail, you name it...) in one glance.And of course, reading books. That may be its best feature, since one has access to what... millions of them by now, and lots of them for free. Their number is increasing each day!As for the movie watching, it is OK, but I'd rather still use my laptop for this, since it can load and stream them faster than the Kindle, not to mention that I prefer a larger screen for that.I'd willingly give it 5 stars, if they will integrate the features mentioned above.Sometimes, I'm wondering what those tech designers are thinking when they put together a package.... or maybe they are not thinking much? Without those features, a user has to still have another tablet/smart phone, to do what the Kindle is lacking. Nobody wants to spend twice the money and schlepp two tablets around! What for???~!!!  So, Kindle designers: Please, put those features on the Kindle Fire and keep yourself in the market.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle for life", "Author": "kodocat", "ReviewID": "RP8SX69N6CFEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started with a keyboard kindle and thought this was it!

It's kind of a complete joke. The battery drains within an hour or two, even when it's plugged in as you're using it. I've had several instances of plugging it in to charge via USB while I'm at work (read: not using it) only to find that it has not only not charged at all, but drained to the point of shutting off. I've also plugged it in to charge overnight in a wall outlet and woke up to find that, again, it hasn't charged but has drained and shut off. I plugged it in to a different outlet, checked it after 30 minutes or so to make sure something was happening, and then left it plugged in for another ten hours. When I checked it before bed, it was charged to 86%. That is nothing short of ridiculous, I'm sorry.I am aware of a special \"quick charge\" device that you can purchase separately to charge in under 5 hours (Wow, you're kidding! Strap in and put your helmets on kids, this is ludicrous speed! /sarcasm #Spaceballs), but I think it's absurd that you have to buy a \"special charger\" to make the thing function normally.The picture is fine, the sound is fine, the app availability is marginal, the interface is acceptable. It's hard to care about much else when you can't even use it for any reasonable length of time.In this case you get what you pay for. It was cheap, and it functions accordingly. I wouldn't buy this again, nor recommend it to others.

Google Play on my 7\" Android tablet seems to have a more interesting selection of movies for rental.So the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD is a very good to fantastic device as an e-reader and a pretty good device for watching TV shows and movies.  But as a tablet for apps it isn't good.  Basically, Amazon has defanged the Android OS to make this device work best as an Amazon product delivery system.  Standard apps for Android, like Google Navigation, aren't available.  There are many key apps I use on my Android 7\" tablet and Apple iPhone that aren't available.  Everything seems to be oriented toward buying books, movies, TV shows, and apps through Amazon.  It's more than a bit annoying, and the OS used isn't nearly as slick as you'd find with a pure Android or Apple tablet.I'll be happy to use this as a reader for book-length manuscripts.  The quality and size of the screen hold a lot of appeal to me.  But I'll keep using my iPhone and Android 7\" tablet for apps.  This device comes up short in that department.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "What was I waiting for?", "Author": "Suz", "ReviewID": "R10WUEA9FE1LLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, actually, I was waiting for a good price cut on the Fire HD models, while continuing to use my old first generation 7\" Kindle Fire.Last week, Amazon ran a daily deal featuring seriously discounted certified refurb Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablets, so I bought one (32GB).I don't, strictly speaking, or even loosely speaking, *need* this thing. But I certainly like it. It has drawbacks, mostly the stupid carousel interface. I just splurged another fifteen bucks to get rid of the \"special offers\" so maybe the interface will be less annoying now.However, the display is fine, operations are quick, sound is good (through headphones or small external speakers), and I'm enjoying streaming Amazon Prime video on the FIre HD. I've been able to load (by USB) some instructional video files and some photos onto the tablet, which I like being able to view without needing to be online.I knew it would be an upgrade from my old Kindle Fire, but have been delighted by the improved performance.I was able to snag the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Saddle Tan during a Lightning Deal on the same day I bought my discounted refurb HD, which was a lucky buy. It's a really good case, but even at the discount not exactly cheap.Overall, I'm not sorry I waited, but am also not at all sorry I finally bought this Fire HD in the larger size.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Silk is a good reason to not buy a Kindle.", "Author": "Karyn Best", "ReviewID": "R2TM45Z134R9PA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For emails, books, games and many other reasons I like the Kindle.

When the device works, it's a great device to use.  The size is just right without being bulky.  I also like the ability to download videos & documents from the cloud and to have apps store there without clogging up the device.When problems start with the devices I've had going into sleep mode on the own right during the middle of working on it tends to cause issues when using it for work.  This also becomes frustrating if in the middle of a game and the device goes into sleep mode when you're just about  to hit the high score.  Another issue I've had as been with the Silk Browser.  After utsing it over time it tends to get slower.  There aren't any other browsers available for use unless you want to rig the device and void your warranty.It Kindle can resolve these issues and  open up to more apps that can be accessed in Google Play, you would have an awesome device.  Not sure how the company plans to make this more of a work device versus just an entertainment device.

Yes, email's great, although I've changed to another browser and also added a minimal bunch of apps that allow for comic book reading (CRZ/CBR files) as well as periodicals (Zinio is insanely good for world magazines).I didn't exprecto fall in love with the Kindle for TV shows, but it is an intimate viewing experience. Fast wifi. Get the leatherette case to make it stand; the microUSB is easy to get extra cable for ($4 anywhere). Easy to charge, Kindle has converted this old-fashioned reader into a newer media fan. Bring on the newspapers and ROLLING STONE.

They are currently on the back side which means the case can cause some interruption in the quality of the sound.  If you use it without a case you have to be careful where you set it to not block the speakers.
