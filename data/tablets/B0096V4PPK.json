{"Reviews": [{"Title": "3rd party seller scams. Your NEW Amazon iPad might be USED. Here's how to tell.", "Author": "Reader44", "ReviewID": "R1CLDLMEVLXZUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product itself is fantastic and my stars are based on the product being a great deal and a great device.But for anyone thinking of buying from Amazon, be warned. I purchased one of these for someone on her birthday and it was listed as new.  Amazon seems to only sell iPad minis from third party sellers, not from Amazon.com itself, meaning another company gets the iPads from any source they want, sends them to Amazon, and Amazon ships them. One of these sellers listed an iPad mini slightly above retail price, but cheaper than all of the other iPad minis on Amazon. In fact, when I searched for iPad mini, it was the seller and product page the site automatically directed me to. The page indicated it as new, and sold it to me via Amazon.  When my friend got her iPad mini, it looked new, was packaged and sealed like new, but when she turned it on, it was tied to someone else's icloud account. I called apple and gave them the serial number. Sure enough, the item was used, only had about 60 days left in the warranty (instead of 90) and was registered through Apple to a different customer.  If I wanted a used iPad Mini, I would have paid less. Much less.I even emailed the user who had previously owned it (since her email address via iCloud was showing up when my friend tried to access the app store. I emailed the previous user just to make sure it wasn't a stolen product. She explained that she had purchased it a few weeks back from At&T;, not from Amazon. She wanted a wifi + 3g version, not just wifi, so she returned it and somehow, the third party seller got their hands on it and sold it to me as new.In the defense of of the third party seller, once I got their phone number from Amazon and called them (most seller numbers are not on Amazon, you have to call and request a phone number), they provided a scary explanation: They explained that there are problems with Amazon's FBA system (fulfillment). Sometimes, iPads are returned with nothing but index cards in the box and Amazon thinks there is an iPad inside. Sometimes, products mingle, and so another seller's used iPads might be with a different seller's new iPads. They explained that they have a very legitimate source of iPads and have been selling iPads for years and that this is a rare occurrence, although it has happened before. I have no way of verifying any of this, so I can't blame Amazon or the seller. All I can say is that for such a large purchase, and one that is a gift, you are better off buying from a major retail store that doesn't sell used items at all (or buying from Amazon when it is shipped and sold and fulfilled by Amazon).  Right now, this product is actually on sale at Walmart.Amazon refunded me but now my friend has to return her birthday gift. I recommend buying from someone other than Amazon. For this particular product, it's probably the cheaper route to do that anyway. If you do buy from Amazon, call Apple with your Serial Number and verify it is a new, unregistered product with a full 90 day warranty. Don't get scammed.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "A phenomenally portable twist on the iPad that finally breaks the mold of 7\" tablets.", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R18KRNCDSS963I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Conceived from its sleek, glossy 10\" counterpart, the new iPad Mini boasts one gigantic new trait over the full-sized iPad: the ability to hold it in one hand. This almost revolutionary twist on the device that sparked a frenzy in the tablet world has finally brought joy to those that have held out hope of such higher portability in an iPad for so long. But does the iPad Mini live up to the hype?  Absolutely.Turns out, the iPad mini is indeed more than simply a shrunk-down iPad, though there may be an argument for it actually resembling something more along the lines of a blown-up iPod touch. In any case, the big question: is the iPad mini right for you? I'll endeavor to answer that for you here by taking you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share from my past few years of iPad ownership experience altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own.Plus, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad mini review on Amazon, I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My reviews tend to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to help you quickly locate any specific info you're after. For example, see the heading \"Downloading Apps and Games\" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's compare hardware specs between iPad mini and iPad, and what each means for you:+ Device: iPad mini vs. iPad (4th gen)+ Weight: 0.68 lbs vs. 1.44 lbs -- over twice as light as the iPad+ Thickness: 0.28\" (7.2mm) vs. 0.37\" (9.4mm) -- thin as an iPod touch+ Display: 163 vs. 264 pixels per inch -- less-crisp text, but equally long life for a smaller battery+ Resolution: 1024 x 768 vs. 2048 x 1536 -- half as many pixels as the current iPad, but still sharper than an iPad 2+ Battery: 10 hours (16.3 Wh) vs. 10 hours (45 Wh) -- smaller, lighter battery lasts just as long as the iPad+ Processor: A5 (dual core) vs. A6X (dual core with quad core graphics) -- same as the new iPod touch, but not quite as powerful as the latest iPad, yet it doesn't need to be because the iPad mini display totes a quarter as many pixels!+ Price: The iPad mini has a price tag that is indeed much more attractive than the 10\" iPad. It's actually closer to that of the iPod touch.===== First Impression =====At first sight, there's a feeling of novelty to the iPad Mini, especially if you've used a 10\" iPad or tablet. The more you use it, however, the more you realize that this is the size an iPad was meant to be: perfectly portable. The 10\" iPad is so bulky and heavy in comparison, and I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed and awkward taking it with me and using it places, especially waiting in line. Not so with the iPad mini! It's super light, more than half the weight of the 10\" iPad, and its sleek rounded edges are much more comfortable for carrying than the sharply-tapered edges of the iPad.My initial reaction to the unveiling of the iPad mini was one of slight disappointment, mainly because it was closer to 8\" than to the desired 7\" of other tablets in its class. Why would Apple bother bringing a smaller iPad to market that's still not quite as small as some of the other 7\" tablets floating around? Ah, but I was wrong.Until I held it in my own hand, I failed to realize that Apple had made better use of the iPad mini's size than most 7\" tablets do. What matters in a 7\" tablet class isn't the screen size but the actual device size. The iPad mini is 3mm shorter and 7mm wider than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, yet it touts nearly an inch more of physical screen size.===== Interaction Experience =====Naturally, the iPad mini shares the iPad's same phenomenal multi-touch interface that is undisputedly second to none. Android tablets and other devices may tout \"multi-touch\" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. Apple, on the other hand, gives a whole new meaning to the term, supporting up to ten simultaneous touches, and app developers have certainly leveraged that capacity. For example, one popular app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the Piano app.===== So What Can the iPad mini Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad mini right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos from your computer via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music, movies and media via the iTunes app. Another popular app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad mini. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat face-to-face with other Apple-device users via FaceTime.Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad mini doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with an iPad, and the same goes for the iPad mini. All iPad apps work on the iPad mini. After all, the iPad mini is still an iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a \"netbook killer\" (due to its ability to surf the web, check email, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. But along its path to success, it sparked a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines, news and now even ebooks via Apple's iBooks app. Now, it's quite clear that Apple had the goal of a much more comfortable ebook reading experience in mind when they set out to create the iPad mini. You can easily hold it in one hand, just like a real book, and it's as light as a real book, two traits many users have been hoping to see come to fruition soon.On the other hand, to use the iPad mini for more productive purposes, such as editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps including: Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets) and Keynote (slideshows). Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad mini for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad mini alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad mini into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad mini couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card (or iTunes gift card), all you need to do is launch the 'App Store' app, browse or search to find the app you want, tap the download button (usually it says the price rather than 'download', which then changes to 'install app' after you tap it), then tap again to confirm. Enter your password, and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple then charges your card (or deducts from your gift card balance) the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new purchase. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it's perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this in hopes that you'll write a rave review for the temporarily-free app. The secret to your success here is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.In hopes of making this the most helpful review on Amazon for the iPad mini, here's how to obtain these special promotional-sale and temporarily-free apps for yourself!There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad mini itself. I prefer to use an app called \"AppShopper\" which lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the \"popular\" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad mini =====Typing on the iPad mini has certainly become a bit less burdensome than with its 10\" iPad counterpart, especially in the way of thumb-typing. However, typing lengthy messages can still be a concern. Obviously, the iPad mini is no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.Alternately, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard, you can choose to split the keyboard, which makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom. Undocked keyboard can be split or merged, per your preferences.Typing Method #2: Two FingersIf thumb-typing isn't your style, try holding the iPad mini in one hand, like a book, and use your index and middle fingers to go back and forth across the virtual keyboard. Alternately, if the iPad mini is resting on a surface and is in landscape orientation, you could try using two fingers from each hand, but I don't think the iPad mini is big enough to type with your full range of fingers like the 10\" iPad is.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextWith iOS 5 and Siri, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing.You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'question mark', 'exclamation mark', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen', 'single quote', 'double quote', 'ellipsis' and more. Siri is built into the iOS software and is a free service, but one caveat of using Siri for speech transcription is that you must be connected to the Web at the time of transcription, because Siri is a primarily Web-based service (albeit a free one). At times, network congestion has been known to hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, but that happens much less frequently now and usually only occurs if your device is connected to a poor cellular signal instead of WiFi.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps like Dragon, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad mini's small stature is no less capable, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad mini is in landscape orientation, Apple's built-in Safari Web browser or Google's downloadable Chrome app will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site. Chrome lets you keep an unlimited number of browser tabs in the background, while Safari limits you to 9 tabs (at least until iOS 6 is released).The good thing about Web browsing on the iPad and iPad mini is that you can rotate the orientation. Content on the Web was born to be viewed vertically (in portrait orientation), not horizontally (landscape orientation) as most laptops and desktop computers use. In general, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad mini allows you to see more content at a still-decent size. Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by quickly double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and the browser's interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Flash content is now being used less and less, in favor of newer content technologies like HTML5's canvas and JavaScript effects, which can emulate some of Flash's most familiar capabilities, but sites using Flash do still exist. Flash is often used for advertising, video playback, browser-based online gaming, and for many other interactive site components, from graphs to product demos. However, the Flash experience on tablets that do support it is still quite poor in the interactivity department, especially considering that Adobe never intended for it to be used on touch screens. Thus, certain Flash content may expect a mouse hover and you can't emulate that with a finger on a touch screen.While I found browsing the Web with a 10\" iPad to be a literal pain in the neck, the lightweight and small stature of the iPad mini has certainly improved the experience. It's easier to handle, to hold upright with a single hand while browsing the web with the other, and it's more comfortable to hold. Since I didn't surf much with my 10\" iPad, I have no qualms about the lack of a retina display. I'd rather have this iPad mini with the same resolution as the iPad 2 and a 10-hour battery life with a much smaller batter, than to have an iPad mini with a retina display and either a 4-hour battery life, or a battery as heavy as that of the 10\" iPad!===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad mini's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad mini.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad mini. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad mini to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad mini is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad mini coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad mini. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photos and Video =====The new iPad mini brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad mini!Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, if you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad mini, you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad is making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad mini's greatest strengths, especially with it being about the size of a book. Magazine, newspaper and now book publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own iBooks and iPad apps, taking their publications to a whole new level, interactively and financially too.My experiences interacting with some of these digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becoming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single book.As far as Amazon ebooks go, you're not losing out by passing up on their Kindle line of tablets, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad mini via Amazon's Kindle app. If you read a lot outdoors and don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite (not Kindle Fire) is more your style. Kindle uses e-ink which is much easier to read in the sunlight.All in all, the iPad mini is an great e-reader on a whole new level. Had it touted a retina display, text would be slightly more crisp, albeit at the cost of long battery life. I'll take longer battery life over slightly more crisp text any day. Text on the iPad mini looks fine, unless it's really small, and that's usually only the case for an occasional website, but not ebooks.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad mini's strengths because of its single-app-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", lets you do just that. For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad mini. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents, Numbers allows you to create and edit spreadsheets, and Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). Keynote has been pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings with an iPad, but I'm not sure the iPad mini would be as comfortable using for presentations.There's also a productivity category in the App Store dedicated to additional apps geared towards helping you be more productive. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone and iPad will run on the iPad mini, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps specifically made or updated for the iPad and iPad mini. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad mini is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of iPad users with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are better for the 10\" iPad than the iPad mini. Meanwhile, games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction are much conducive for use on the iPad mini than the 10\" iPad.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad mini is really hit-or-miss. Apple's iOS 4 brought the ability to print documents from their devices, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support \"AirPrint\" or, if yours doesn't, you might have success using Printopia software, so long as you have a Mac with a shared printer. Search Google for 'AirPrint' or 'Printopia' for more info and printer compatibility. From there, printing is easy, for apps that support it. The first time you attempt to print something, the iPad mini will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options. For more information about printing with your iPad mini, I'll link to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad mini delivers surprisingly well in the area--it provides several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service). Apple even provides a free device-location service.===== Praise =====+ Clever use of space to cram an 8\" screen into a 7\" class of device that can be held with one hand!+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close.+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking.+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the dual-core A5 processor, despite the same 256MB of memory as the third generation touch.+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do HD video.+ 4G LTE - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi+ Supported on Sprint - previous iPads only supported Verizon and AT&T;+ Lower iPad entry price point===== Caveats =====+ No Retina Display - But at the added benefit of a lighter battery that holds its charge just as long.===== Disappointments =====+ No GPS (or assisted GPS with 4G model) - IP based location just doesn't cut it at times. GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use+ No NFC - Near Field Communications is what powers PayPass in credit cards, and there are certainly uses for it in devices, especially for data transfer, if not for making payments or redeeming passes with the Passbook app.+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos, or hold more of those 1080p videos you can shoot+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, for importing pics from your external camera for use with the new iPhoto app+ No numeric character row in keyboard, despite plenty of space on the iPad and iPad mini's screen.===== The Bottom Line =====There's really not much to complain about in an iPad now. Sure, retina display would be nice, but if we'd been given that, we'd be complaining about battery life, heavy weight or performance issues. Meanwhile, the 10\" iPad has its uses, but portability isn't one of its strong suits. The iPad mini now fills that gap, and it's really been a dream to use. If 10\" is comfortable for you, go with an iPad. As for me, the iPad mini has mostly lived up to my tablet desires.Do you really 'need' the retina display? The honest truth is, no. See, Apple has certainly come to spoil us with its latest and greatest hardware, including the retina display, but I really don't see the iPad mini's less phenomenal display as a real deal breaker. I also a believer that the original iPad or iPad 2 are still great devices if you like the 10\" class of tablet, and they don't have the retina display. So, really, why wait around another year for something better to come along? Then again, there's no absolute guarantee that the next iPad mini will even have that retina display.The bottom line is, don't wait around and waste these precious cycles of your life hoping and betting on something better to come around, when you can always buy the current iPad Mini now, enjoy it now, and resell it down the road. Apple products always hold most of their value for a long time, because they're in such high demand.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Slower at buffering video than my I-pad Retina (and the I-pad 2)", "Author": "D. Fichtner", "ReviewID": "R2QAXZKLNZHPDM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, I'm not going to rip this thing apart.  I feel the Mini is an absolutely wonderful form-factor, and I recommend it -- just not yet.The good:The size of the mini is just short of an inch wider than your typical competitor.  You might not think this is much, but seriously, it is.  I absolutely love this aspect of it.  In addition, the Mini is just wonderfully light and easy to hold (I have big hands, though).As much as people rip on the screen, it is comfortably bright, and the battery life seems to last quite well, even if brightened up a bit.  No complaints there.The bad:That same screen, as others have said, suffers from its low resolution.  Had this tablet come out a year ago, it would have been earth-shattering.  Now, when other offerings from Android are coming out with far better resolutions, it's just meh (the Apple Mini's contrast and color are still superior to the Nexus 7 by far, though).  If you are someone coming from an I-pad 2, you won't care about the resolution so much.  For everyone else who is used to I-phones with substantially smaller, yet sharper resolutions, you will notice the difference.Also, and this is a big one for me, I have found that the I-pad Mini is slow to buffer YouTube videos.  I'm pretty sure this has to do with it having half of the Ram of its larger pad family members.  Cutting the Ram in half was a big mistake.  It also seems to cause lags in surfing on only some sites that are more graphic intense.

Bowman", "ReviewID": "R1A9CEFMDUNOVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid reader and a writer who has tried every portable device under the sun. Smart phones (even the large ones) are too small to read comfortably or to type; laptops simply are not portable enough due to short battery lives; and other tablets were uncomfortably large for me (I've got small hands.) I've tried taking notes directly on screens with a stylus; I've tried Bluetooth keyboards; and I've tried typing directly on screens. Everything was either too large or too small. Other, similarly-sized tablets tend to lag, or the battery life is very poor.I've been an Apple holdout for a while. I had a little iBook a long time ago, and the system issues, general uselessness of the battery, the severe problems with transferring Word, Corel, and other word processing documents, and all-around, irritating, proprietary nature of Mac turned me off for several years. Don't get me started on what I thought of the pricing.After doing a lot of research, however, I took a chance on an iPad mini. It was the perfect size (decent screen, super thin, super light) the battery life is supposedly long (it is--seven hours on the brightest screen setting, several days on standby, 10-12 hours with a low or medium bright screen) extremely portable (very, very important) easy to backup (and from the backup, export to different formats if needed) and does exactly what I need it to do (word processing, graphic art, reading, and surfing.) I have never been happier with an electronic device. (I also use it as an iPod. And as a player for my Google Drive. It's fabulous.)To repeat, it's absolutely perfect for me. I can work on it for hours, it's powerful enough for professional art programs, it's great for writing (the native note app, Google Drive, the Corel app, and a couple of others) and it is by far the best screen for reading I've come across.I tried a Bluetooth keyboard, thinking the screen would be too small to type on. The Bluetooth was a dud--it only worked once--but that was a happy accident. The iPad mini is exactly the right size for me to comfortably type onscreen.I have no complaints with Safari. It's super-fast and while it isn't my favorite search engine ever, it naturally does the job. The only issue I had was figuring out how to open a link in a new tab. (This took me a week. I can be a little slow.)Now that the rave is over, there are a couple of caveats.First, while the screen is the perfect size for me to type on, I'm a small female with hands about 2/3 average size, so it may be too small for some people to comfortably type on.Second, there are (as noted by other reviewers) no USB ports. If you need a lot of memory, this is not the device for you. There is no easy way to expand it. This was actually a little disappointing for me, but Google Drive and Dropbox solved the problem for me. (I'm a lucky person who is never far away from a WiFi signal.)Also, there is no way to replace the battery. When it starts dying, it's done.It doesn't have the retina display that comes with the larger iPads. (It's still a better resolution than many other devices, but hey--no retina display is no retina display.)Finally, there isn't really any way to get around the price. It costs more than some laptops, and certainly more than the other tablets of its size.Personally, I think it's worth it. The sheer portability and quality of the item is incredible. The fact that it is literally perfect for everything I need to do makes it even better--for me.I strongly recommend the iPad mini, with one caveat: do your research. Make absolutely sure you know exactly what you need and what you want, and invest in a product that meets that. This is not the item for someone who needs a lot of onboard memory or a ton of power. Someone who wants just to surf or just an e-reader may be better served with another product, too--but then again, maybe not (like I said, this functions as the most delightful e-reader ever.)I love it, and I think most people will.

Or actually, Amazon did (I think it was fulfilled by Amazon).The Apple ID numbers were covered up by a sticker attached by the re-seller.  I had to carefully peel this back so I could call Apple and get the smut on this particular device (more on that below).  I wanted to make sure that is was not a repackaged, used device, as others have reviewed, or that it was refurbished, or purchased over 30 days ago (and thus ineligble for AppleCare- also reviewed below).  I was able to peel off the sticker without ruining the plastic wrap, which would have made my return 'opened'.A corner of the box was slightly dinged in, and the plastic wrap on the box looked pretty well scuffed up, and definitely gave the appearance that it had been bounced around quite a bit.I did not open the box, as I found out from Apple that this was not actually a brand new device.I looked for but did not find a Mini sold directly by Amazon.  It appears (and an Apple Tech confirmed this) that Amazon does not sell Apple products, instead relying on resellers to take on that onus.  Is this all cause of the Kindle?What impact does that have on us?  In most cases, you will be ineligible for AppleCare. AppleCare is a huge benefit for most purchasers, covering all types of damage up to 2 years.  If you buy an Apple product from someone other than an Apple store, you can still enroll your device in AppleCare, but it must be done within 30 days of purchase, and it must be done at an Apple store.When you purchase an Apple product through Amazon, you are getting a device that in most cases was purchased by someone like us, at a BestBuy, WalMart, Target, etc, at some point in the recent past.  They then 're-sell' the device on Amazon.  Apple uses the origianl date of purchase from the Apple vendor (the BestBuy, Walmart, Target, etc) to start the 30 day AppleCare counter.  In my case, my Mini arrived on the 30th day from original purchase.  I had 3 hours to get my device down to an Apple store, get it enrolled in AppleCare, or else I would be SOL.  Fortunately, Amazon's incredible return policy enabled me to just go online and in a few clicks print out my free return label.As an FYI, Apple stores are the absolute best way to purchase an Apple device.  Not only are they cheaper (mine was actually the same price, with tax, as it was from Amazon), but they will spend over an hour with you getting it set up, linked to your iTunes, your iPhone, iCloud, etc.  It's an amazing experience, and it's all free with your purchase.I challenge Amazon (and Apple) to combine their two excellent companies and develop a strategy for online buying experience that actually enhances each other's products/services, rather than detract from them as they do now.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another used iPad Mini sold as new", "Author": "Robert Fisher", "ReviewID": "R2Z7IM6NCKWAUK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I echo Reader44's review (above) about getting a supposedly new iPad Mini from Amazon that turned out to be used.

I then called Verizon and provided the necessary information to connect using 3G.  However, it would not connect even though I had the Verizon logo and three bars on the screen.  I called Verizon back, and another person told me there was a \"problem,\" and I needed to speak with the Fraud Prevention department, which was not open weekends.  Or I could go to a Verizon store and have someone there look at it.  I opted for the latter and drove to the Verizon store in Torrington, CT.  Someone there checked it out, entered some data from the Mini on her computer, and confirmed that the Mini had been previously sold to someone else.  The unit was \"blacklisted\" because that someone had neglected to pay his or her Verizon account.  No, Verizon won't unlock the Mini, so I have to return it to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon's web site says Freebie Electronics gets 4.9 out of 5 stars, which seems hard to believe if that company makes a habit of providing used electronics to Amazon for sale as new.

My friends said it was pointless but its not. It is physically smaller than the iPad but it has the same excellent quality. Its a lot lighter than the iPad. You may think its to small it's not, the commercials kind of make it look smaller, you get used to the size very easily. The size is very convenient  and it still feels like the full iPad experience.It is fast as well. The camera is nice and the speakers aren't bad like the iPod touches. I actually prefer the size it's not big and bulky, you can take it out in public and feel a lot less awkward than with a real iPad. If you want a tablet for strictly work use maybe the iPad is a better choice, however if you're just going to use it for a work and games, entertainment, photos etc. I definitely recommend it.Display  It has a gorgeous display. It is not retina display but I've compared devices with and with out retina and there is virtually no difference in the display. It also has an awesome battery life. It isn't less than the iPad. Apple really did go back to the very beginning and put a lot of effort into this device. It is much better than the kindle fire. This device's light weight, beautiful display, fast speed, quality speakers and camera, makes it easy to use, take on the go, present, and enjoy!Camera  It has a camera, the pictures are like cell phone pictures, but if the room which you're in is bright and you give it a second to get focused the camera is magnificent, especially outside on a sunny day!Siri  As you probably know this device includes Siri. Siri I often don't use because I'm not in the habit of it. But when I do remind my self it is helpful. Not only is it helpful but to play around without, it has a (specific) response to everything you say. Also I find it really neat that if I'm typing a document I can just press a button and it types what I say, which is wonderful for rough drafts and stuff! This also works if you're searching something etc.Space & Apps  I got the 16 gb version however the space I had available was only about 13gb, which really wasn't too bad, just take in to consideration, that 3 of the gbs  won't be available for use because of what is already installed (no, you cannot delete what is already installed). So, if you're someone who takes lots of videos, photos, plans to make movies, have apps where a lot of data will be contained (iMovie, pages, etc.) Get the 32 gb one, or you can do what I do is take videos and photos, then upload them onto my computer, then delete the data entirely from my iPad, beacause videos and pictures take up a lot of space, however one or two short videos are fine. Just manage your space, but 16 gb is really a fine amount (I'm only at 7).  The apps on apple devices are magnificent, it's not just fun games, there are some for creating documents, educational ones, apps for teachers, photo editing, the Holy Bible! Even medical apps, that give you instructions for medical emergencies or problems, and there is a really neat one on the brain, apps that help you find your iPad if it's lost!  There also is iMovie, if you are unformiliar which it, it is this really neat program that allows you to make movies, it simple, and looks extremely professional it s only $5 in the App Store, so worth the money!  V.S Other Products  Yes, there are cheaper things like the Gooogle Nexus tablet, Samsung Galaxy Note, KINDLE FIRE, and other android tablets/computer tablets, but if you have any i-device (iPod touch, iPod nano, iPhone, etc.) you know the experience is way different than android and for many people way better. It isn't much more, and I know people who have gotten rid of there other tablets (in perfectly good condition) for the iPad mini. And it also had a variety of e-reading apps. And the computer/tablet devices are neat... but $700 more. Besides flash it has all the abilities as computers (refer to \"Space & Apps\"), and for the few flash-involved I'm sure there is a computer somewhere in your house.  In conclusion, this device is wonderful. I've been exposed and experienced with multiple devices, this is still awesome!  In conclusion, this device is amazing.  I switched several people to the iPad mini. Tablets are all made by intelligent people, but this device is made my geniuses. It has, Siri, good speakers, nice camera, very convenient size, for watching movies viewing photos etc, still light, compact, portable.

It's extremely thin and fits in my purse. I had the Nook Tablet before this and find that they are very similar in size. I also have the iPad 3 and for regular use, I prefer the larger screen. I wanted the mini for travel and it will be perfect. Everything I have on my iPad 3 can be put on my mini so when I travel, I have everything I need. I bought the 32 gig and I currently have 7 full length movies and 25 tv episodes (40+ min each) in addition to 130 songs and 84 apps of which 16 are games so it holds quite a bit of entertainment. I have a little over 2 gigs available. My iPad 3 has 64g so I was worried I'd miss the space.The mini feels much more thin and delicate than my iPad 3 and my Nook Tablet. I worry about it breaking and wish LifeProof had a case out for it. In portrait view, the sides are narrow so holding it just there can be precarious. I let it lay on my palm with my thumb on the narrow edge for more support. The screen size is satisfactory and I've had no screen issues while watching movies. Many say if you are used to the retina display then this will disappoint but I don't have that problem. Movies display in wide width with the ability to increase the size to full screen by zoom. Sound is excellent. Alone it is fine on 5-6 level and with other noise, 7-8 is fine.

It had great reviews & such, so figured it would be a functional tablet. And it probably is for playing games, music and things like that. But it is really lacking as a tool to use in business.The iPad mini, & I have no reason to believe the iPad is any different, comes without an office suite, a way to easily transfer files from a PC unless you use the Cloud or the iTunes Utility, which for security reasons cannot be used in my business, & few apps are without a cost. In this world, people often have multiple platforms at work & home. Even in the app store, there is no direct link to business apps. You must search for everything. With lots of time, searching & frustration at times, the tablet is now functional. I will not go into the lack of multitasking & other small inconveniences.Trying to get a manual for this unit was another treat! You would think it would be included on the desktop as a PDF file. Every Web search to find a User Manual lead you to links to other sites wanting you to download their PDF, Anti Virus or some other tool bar software. When I finally found a manual but it was specific to the iPad even though the internet search said it was a manual for the iPad Mini. Still haven't found anything very specific to the iPad Mini that I own. I will use the iPad with iOS 6 manual and hopefully it covers everything if there are differences. With Android Tablets it is just a matter of searching for the word pdf and the tablet and up comes your manual. Apple has to tie everything into collateral sales by linking with everyone.Paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, it is easy to put in data & I would recommend adding one. I also find a stylus works better than a finger on this tablet. Thankfully I got the 64G mini or would be in trouble since it is not expandable with a Micro SD card. Bad for consumers who have to pay more for this & only good for Apple's bottom line.I could go on about the iOS vs others, etc. but it comes down to having setup & used a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in a few hours & I saw how easy it was to use, I would never recommend an iPad Mini over the Galaxy Note 10.1 for business use if your business is Windows centric rather than Apple based.

I am a huge Apple fan seeing as I also own a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so I was already very familiar with the iPad's interface and software. What's great is the fact that Apple makes it so easy to download and manage all your media between their various products. I proceeded to sync all my music, movies and games/apps onto it and then came the fun part: testing everything out. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the speakers especially for a tablet. The sound was loud and crystal clear. Movies look absolutely gorgeous even on this model which DOES NOT have the retina display. Since I stream movies through Netflix and Amazon I felt it wasn't worth spending more money on extra hard drive space that wasn't going to get used. Games that I usually play on my iPhone work awesome on the Mini mostly due to the larger display. While some might like the bigger screen on the iPad, this one is just a tad smaller (1.8 inches to be exact) which in all honesty is plenty big in my opinion. When holding the Mini, which you can do with one hand by the way, it definitely feels more like a tablet vs. holding a clipboard like it's larger sibling. I will definitely get a lot of use out of this product.

After all, do I really need a third iPad?  There was a decent sale at the time and I decided to go for it and I have not regretted the purchase for one minute.Overall, the features, speed, front and rear camera, etc. are very comparable to its larger counterparts, however it is available in this smaller, more lightweight, compact and easier to carry mini form.  I find that taking this with me on a business or personal trip makes the bag much lighter and for equivalent features.  Taking photos with this product is much less awkward looking too than when i see people posing for the full size iPads (I still can't bring myself to do this).  I would say size wise, it is about 70% of the full size iPad but this has no great impact on the ability to read emails or type any differently than the larger iPad.  The full size iPads almost seem too large now that I am accustomed to the compact mini.I don't want to get into all the features of the iPad overall as I have not noticed any differences between this and my other iPads.  I have heard the RAM is less on the mini, but I have not noticed any difference as previously indicated.  It is well integrated with other Apple products, which I love about the iPads.  I can take a picture with my iphone and instantly it appears in my photostream for viewing on my iPad, iMac or AppleTv screensaver.Overall, great buy, even with two other iPads, I don't regret this purchase one bit.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great addition to  my desktop for use during TV programs", "Author": "B.

I have a MacBookPro & an iPhone 4S, 16 GB. A priority for me is having products that do what I want understandably, reliably & w convenient, knowledgable & quick tech support if needed. I have found Apple products are that way so didn't even consider any other brands.I find that the specs for this & the iPhone 4S are somewhat similar--processor, camera, etc & I got the 16 GB version for both.I was using my MacBookPro for business & to show a presentation at the table. But, while very light for a laptop, it still was big to carry around.I find that now I don't even turn on my Mac every day. I can browse email & the web & a lot of apps just fine on it.Since I'm new to the iPad, I wasn't sure just how useful it would be. Well it is. It makes a good e-book reader. Although only have a couple so far. I got the Kindle app since one e-book I wanted needed that format.I also is a very nice size to carry around w me. I got a new purse that is not large but has a pocket on the outside into which the iPad mini in its case just fits.I also like that I can do iMessages on all 3 of my devices & while I can do things on the iPhone, the iPad mini is much easier to read & type on.I bought the Belkin case at BestBuy that looks like a pad folio w snap in holder for the iPad. So its not totally obvious that its an iPad, looks nice & both protects & provides a nice stand for it that works well on table or on my lap.I'm also using my iPad mini rather than a hard cover bible for church, using the YouVersion app. The combo is agile enough to jump around to different passages & easier to carry.As one who is a touch typist, I was concerned about whether I would need an external keyboard, but have found that I can type pretty well on it. Not quite usual fingering--more like several finger typing but have been able to use it to take notes at seminars & meetings. This using the Pages app. I also have purchased the Keynote Ap thinking I would use it, but really use the free Slide Shark to handle a co presentation.  I'm thinking of purchasing the Numbers app. Need to review how to sync the Apple apps between the mini & my Mac.As far as connectors, don't have the myriad of Apple accessories that some are concerned about. I had previously gotten the InCase car charger from the Apple store for my iPhone (after the one I got at Walmart quit working after 8 mo). This is the kind that is in 2 pieces so one plugs into the car power outlet & then any usb plug can plug into it.  So if my iPad Mini needs charging, I can use its cord to plug into the outlet & charge in the car.Also, I bought it at the Apple Store & since I had One to One through my Mac, I could use it to learn my iPhone & my iPad. Unfortunately having recently moved to Portland, OR, the Apple Store is way across town so not as convenient as I was used to. Haven't been there yet. I need to go as sometimes I tap to close a Safari window or click on a link w no response. So should get the touch screen checked (as I did w the touchpad on my previous MacBookPro where they find certain portions not responsive & fixed it, quickly.Speaking of the Apple Store, I like the fact that I have that resource--even though now its less convenient than it was.  This is 1 reason that I like Apple products. If there is an issue,  I remember w other devices (Windows computers & Windows phone) where the service was not very good. My windows phone had major issues (couldn't properly handle daylight savings time & other issues). Verizon people were nice but didn't really help so got runaround & some never did get answers.  They knew a lot of basic stuff, but now w smart phones, they can't know all of them well.Also previously w a device from 1 co & OS from another & then other apps, I have gotten the run around w each blaming the other & being caught between them. Or maybe not even blaming the other but having to make multiple contacts to get an answer.I have found Apple Stores to be on top of things & their service turn around time is very fast--several times faster than they had promised.The other thing w Apple products that I have found is that they just work. I've had hardware & software failures w other computers & phones. I got my iPad Mini I think in early March. Working fine. My iPhone 4S is 22 mo old & working fine (they had to do a reset & upgrade to iOS6 1 time, quickly taken care of at the Apple Store).So for me, having products that do what I want, reliably & w tech support that quickly takes care of any issues that may arise is very important. I had not found that level of reliability & tech support w other products. I expect the same level of continued reliability & service if needed w my iPad Mini.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent device", "Author": "A Guy in Indianapolis", "ReviewID": "R3J5LJI5PL2B7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Lightweight but solid-feeling.

I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ipad Mini", "Author": "BIANCARYAN", "ReviewID": "R2FWSG146E1Z5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd apple product in which i purchase because I am a college student.

For now, it is probably  the best device in its class on the market today,  in my opinion, but the price is still more than its competitors.

I, myself, have tried the Android phones and tablets but have come back to Apple for two main reasons: Consistency and Quality,I have always wanted an iPad but the cumbersome and awkward size was always the turn off to me. I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS! I cannot say enough good things about it; it's the quality hardware and software Apple is known for. I can always count on my iPad Mini to work and do so like it did the first time, never slowing down.So... If you are in the market for a small tablet and don't mind paying the premium I highly recommend the iPad Mini. Sure, it's a bit more expensive but if you have it know you are paying for a slick device that won't turn into a frustrating paper weight next year. :)", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Note required", "Author": "Artem", "ReviewID": "RDV7K5Y8UQBNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would be a very useful note to this product: Wi-Fi model have no gps module.Anyway it is excellent thing :)", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Moved from the Kindle Fire (1st gen) to the iPad Mini, loving the change", "Author": "Angela Streiff", "ReviewID": "R2BA9H0Y9FUOAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the original Kindle Fire when it was first released. I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small but powerful", "Author": "Leonardo Dugarte", "ReviewID": "R2MUZQGQ6271RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Talk about Apple products is to talk about excellence, innovation, design, simplicity, utility.

The full screen keyboard makes it easy for me to type and access websites with ease. Way easier and smoother than my other apple devices. Having Siri is a great plus.

So, I thought that because the item has only been used a few times and in new condition and that I had all the original packaging, that the seller would take the item back with little to no problem. The response was that the item had to be returned in it's original packaging, obviously with an unbroken seal to get a full refund. Well, in order to use the item, you have to take it out of the original packaging (duh) and was offered an amount that was a third of what I paid for it; obviously I declined to return the item and downloaded a users guide online for $0. This is the problem: when you order something online you open it and try whatever item you ordered to make sure it works or it fits you or whatever only to find out that the item isn't right and you want to return it - sometimes as in this case it's just not worth it. I'm sorry I didn't just go buy it at Staples or Wal-Mart.UPDATE: Funny enough, after the owner of Always Innovating read my review he sent the following e-mail to me:Always Innovating:I apologize that this transaction did not meet your needs. Customer satisfaction is very important to us, and our feedback % means a lot to our business. If you would like, I can send you a complimentary cover for your ipad ( please let me know what color) if you are able to remove the negative feedback.ThanksMy Reply:Thanks, but I had purchased a cover at the same time I purchased the iPad... I have no need for another cover. Unfortunately, unless you want to refund my money in full as previously requested (minus a restocking fee of course), the review stays. I'm sorry, but I'm sure you could easily resell this item for close to what you sell them at brand newAlways Innovating:If you would like, I can issue you a 10% refund and you can keep the item.ThanksMy Reply:You are totally and completely missing the point. You previously stated that \"Customer satisfaction is very important to you\"; well, I am a customer and I AM NOT satisfied with the product or the way your company conducts business with it's customers. It appears to me that all you seem to care about is a negative review which clearly states the facts. I also noticed a couple of other reviews of dissatisfied customers with similar complaints. It is an insult to offer me a bribe of 10% of the $312.00 I paid in good faith to your company for a product for which I am stuck with because your company refuses to refund my money, unlike many other companies I have dealt with on Amazon. So again, unless you decide to refund the money I paid, I will return the item, (which is in pristine condition) I refuse to help you.Needless to say, I have not gotten a response.

Unfortunately - that means 30 days from when it was directly purchased from Apple.  This was purchased from Apple by a third party vendor and distributed through Amazon more than 30 days before it was shipped to me - so the device was no longer eligible for the AppleCare program.  I have two options - return it to Amazon and purchase another device directly from Apple (this specific model has been discontinued by Apple and is no longer available from them) or I can just give it to my grandkid, along with a really good protective case - and HOPE that my two year old doesn't break it.

When I listen to itunes or Pandora, the music sounds super clear without the headphones{unlike the iPod}. Also the iPad mini is super light so I can hold it in one hand and my hand won't get tired. When I study for tests and exams, I use siri/notes and when I talk on notes what ever I say  goes on the paper. It makes it easier to study. This device has great memory and loads super fast so if you buy a game or music it takes only takes a few seconds to load. There are  small things that I don't like about my iPad mini. When I am using the internet or Google, I can barely see the print. Also, it is complicated to set up Imesseges if you don't have great reception.

I read the Verizon version will work on other carriers but the same is NOT true of the ATT - so for me its was protecting the resale value.Love the LTE speed.I got the 32 Gb version since the 16 is way to low for me for the books and magazines I read.In a pinch I can use the tethering feature on it if my cable goes out and I dont think verizon cares - as long as I dont suddenly spike on my data usage.  The same cant be said of ATT.The ipad itself is so much easier to handle.  Its sooo much lighter than the regular iPad. after using it I cant get over how heavy the 10 inch one is.I also had a regular sized 32Gb iPad 3 w/ RD. and sold it to get the asus transformer prime. I got it since it had one feature I wanted, the expandable memory. I loved the Prime at first but it was glitchy and got slower over time.  But it was never quite as smooth as polished as iOS. I guess google needs to work on improving their \"photocopier\".I started using my wife's iPad one day and just kept using it since it was so much smoother and it never froze up like the prime.I decide to get a mini since it had just come out and it was cheaper. I got the 32 Gb LTE version for a little more than the base regular wi-fi only ipad with 16 Gb.The non-retina display is not a big deal for me even though I had a iPad 3 and a iphone 4 (replaced w/ a 5). The resolution IS better than a non-retina display iPad but not as good as the ipad 4 w/ RD. Bottom line its good enough to watch movies and view pictures or magazines on.The mini with LTE is the perfect size for using as a gps in the car.  Its way bigger than almost all gps provided in any car right now. Plus it doesnt cost +$2K like it does as an option on a car.Its also the perfect size to use to control my TV as a remote for Apple TV, Comcast (although I have the wrong cable box right now), ...Cons: The only down side thats important to me was the lack of expandable memory. But I did find a fix for that.  I use a Seagate GoFlex Satellite Mobile Wireless Storage 500 GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBF500101 Black. It lets me stream wirelessly up to 500 Gb of movies, music or whatever to my ipad.  It even works if I dont have a wi-fi signal since it generates its own signal.

I was fully satisfied w/ my ipad2. Only thing that was making me consider getting the mini was its portability.  With the ipad2, you have to have it in a case, plus a bag if you don't want to accidentally drop it...plus setting it up, etc...Well, I ordered the mini last week and I haven't been able to put it down!!  I absolutely love this thing!Unexpected surprises...- the weight...it feels like you're holding a piece of cardboard...it's light.- the speakers...they're loud & it doesn't matter whether u place it on its front or back, u can hear them perfectly...and u get stereo speakers that sound soooo much better than my ipad2 and louder, clearer, etc...  I've been listening to music on this way more than on my ipad2...- the cameras...front and back...they are a very nice upgrade and the back camera is nice b/c it doesn't matter whether u take a pic, light or dark, it comes out nicely lighted and clear...  isight camera must use every available slither of light to give u a decent pic in just about any bad lighting situation, which is unexpected coming from a tablet.-typing...for some reason, it seems soooo natural to type on the mini... it's a one and a halfer by its size, but it feel effortless-screen resolution...after reading endless reviews about the mini NOT having a retina display, I almost didn't buy it...BUT I love this screen...it is tight, crisp, and I have no problems reading...in fact, the videos that I watch on here are INCREDIBLE... so, for those of you on the fence about the screen resolution, it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned...don't cheat yourself, like I almost did...I've been watching videos and finishing them in one sitting...that's how nice the screen is...I see things I didn't notice on my ipad2Sadly, I haven't had the desire to pick up my ipad2 since I got the mini... I will have this thing for a very long time...

When I was growing up, there were few gadgets around to satisfy my gadget need; however, since I have reached my \"golden years\" there are gadgets galore.

Then along came the Texas Instruments calculator...WOW, it ran on batteries and figured out things for me.  I was in heaven and so began my love of electronic gadgets.  As a professional I had a plethora of electronic gadgets at my disposal (and I still did anesthesia with a calculator.)  The gadgets did get more complex, and expensive, as I got older and I do have a \"thing\" for laptop computers and have owned several...I prefer to surf in my lounge chair, with the computer in lap, my feet up, and a tv show in front of me as opposed to sitting at a desk, etc. Then I planned a trip to Europe this year.  I wanted to be able to communicate with the folks back home without having to tote my laptop, so what to do.  Well, BINGO...you got it.  I needed an iPad!  And where do I go to purchase all my best \"Good Gadgets\"???  To my laptop and Amazon of course!!!  Didn't take long before I located my sweet, little, cool, white, handy-dandy, baby who computes from my lounge chair and any place else with wi-fi...and she weighs much less than the laptop, even fits in my purse.  With Amazon in charge and freebie electronics actually providing the product for my purchase...WOW, what a deal.  Amazon's usually lightening fast, but I had my little, cool, shiny, new, white, baby in less than 2 days - all securely packed and ready to rumble.  And so we have continued to do sending messages/pictures home from Europe, playing games (which I never did before), and reading my fav magazines...SUCH A DEAL!  Give them a try!

We take lengthy road trips roughly once a month for fun (more frequently when the weather is nice). And we like to do take these lengthy trips with our three year old, whose patience for the third drive to Canada in one year is...not super good.Enter: iPad Mini, ultimate toddler entertainment device.My son started off as a wee little pudgeball using my iPad 2, and I noticed that he and the iPad had an unnatural connection. The predicable nature of iOS and sensitive touchscreen were easy for his baby brain to puzzle out with trial and error, and the many restriction options allowed me to lock him out of most things he shouldn't get into. He was better at using the thing than I was within weeks, and when that iPad met an untimely death on a concrete floor, we decided to get our son one of his own. The iPad Mini is a much smaller, sleeker device that fits chubbular fists quite easily - a perfect size for children.Armed with a suite of educational apps and Curious George episodes, our son and the iPad have now driven thousands of miles and visited several countries. The battery life lasts us most of a day without being plugged in (and that's with constant video playback). It has quieted innumerable tantrums while on the road in the middle of the Cascades and on the most hideously boring stretch of road known as I5 in southern California. I expect it will also survive our upcoming six hour flight quite nicely.On a less child-oriented level, the screen looks great and the slender device is a pleasure to behold. The white one looks a bit cheaper than the black one, in my opinion, but that's all rather subjective. The software is fast and responsive. The touchscreen is a delight.Note for parents who might want to grab one of these for their children: iOS7 now defaults to showing ALL videos you've ever bought in the video library, including those you haven't downloaded. You can turn this option off in the settings. If you don't want a frustrated child without WiFi trying to download your copy of Dredd 3D, you should really make sure to do that. :) Also, make sure to set the \"require password\" setting from \"15 minutes\" to \"immediately\" so that you don't end up buying a few extra seasons of Curious George. And make sure to turn off in-app purchases, too.Last thoughts: I wish the restrictions were somewhat more comprehensive. You can prevent kiddos from deleting apps, but not from deleting videos, and it's hard to bring Blue's Clues back in the middle of nowhere when he accidentally deletes the whole season. I also wish this tablet were a bit cheaper - it's an awfully expensive device to risk the child throwing it out a window. My son's been surprisingly responsible with his iPad so far, though. Whether the investment is worth it for your family probably depends on the child in question.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "ipad mini", "Author": "firefly2550 \"stacy\"", "ReviewID": "R17KBRBOBH259Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "whats not to love about the ipad mini? i have several android tablets and i personally love how simple the ipad is to use and set up i am a video blogger on youtube so i use my ipad to record and upload my videos dont have many apps as i just got it ordered tons of cases and skins for it battery life with full brightness is def an issue when i pulled the lightning charger out for the first time it dropped to 97% is this normal or does my brand new ipad already have a glitch? havent tryed any games yet planning on downloading some soon thats my review for now will update as i use my ipad......", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "christmas present", "Author": "gary ferrell", "ReviewID": "R2567AQR9E51XV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "christmas present for the mrs.she has been waiting this for awhile now,and dont even know that i got her one for christmas!lol", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Vanessa Pavlik", "ReviewID": "R2KKMO13LCUBTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this product April 2013 for my husbands birthday.

The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the \"fire\". The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the \"fire\", but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.

And every other owner of an Iphone, IPod, Iwhatever... is aware that the glass/screen/digitizer can shatter pretty easily. I changed the digitizer on my 2nd Gen Ipod before and it was a breeze, so that's not a big deal or a big cost ($9 for the IPod touch) digitizer).Shortly after getting our IPad Mini the screen somehow cracked/shattered!!!! We have no idea how it happened and were of course irate. Knowing that the 'basic' warranty wouldn't cover such a repair, I look at how much the screen/digitizer costs (60-179 btw). I found one for around 60. The removal went ok...minus some added difficulty due to the shattered glass. BUT HERE's THE PROBLEM.The Home Button does not come with the digitizer and MUST be transferred to the new one if/when it has to be replaced!  The issue here is that this REQUIRES SOLDERING!!!! Search for it if you'd like: Ipad Mini Home button soldering.  Here's where it gets real bad/funny: all of the videos that I viewed never mention needing to replace the home button; they just show how to take it apart, and put it back together so I didn't think anything of it at until I reached that stage (too late!) So no I have to either find someone local who knows how to do this (no luck so far due to it being pretty new (and super difficult) or send it off and spend some $$$. Here's the best part.... the part that you have to solder the new digitizer to (a circuit) ISNT EVEN AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY!!! So if anything happens to the super delicate wiring in the removal process, YOU CANT EVEN FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!What confuses me the most is that the ease of which their glass screens break is no secret and is not difficult to have happen.... SO WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT SOOO DIFFICULT TO FIX ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS!?!?!So, if you have or get an IPad Mini and experience any issue dealing with the Home Button (not responsive, intermittent, stuck, etc.) or the digitizer/glass screen (not responsive, scratch, cracked, or shattered.... all which are fairly common... I wouldn't suggest doing this on your own and be prepared to open the wallet. Most online services offering to replace the digitizer are around $125.I hope that, maybe in the next generation, this is fixed/addressed. For something soo common, this needs to be a plug in solution...not having to find a specialist to solder it back together. My suggestion would be to 1) get a very durable/strong case (otterbox?) and 2) DONT USE THE IPAD UNTIL ITS IN THE CASE!!
