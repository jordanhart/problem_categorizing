{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Multi-function Tablet at a Great Price!", "Author": "Shoof \"trice di cinema\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3CAA9MLYV9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife has a Google Nexus 7 tablet and the latter is my only frame of reference for functionality and quality.I purchased (3) Zeepads for my grandchildren and they arrived 12/22/12 instead of the scheduled 12/21.  All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.  While I was very skeptical that a tablet would do all the things claimed, after seeing the Zeepad in action, I wish I would have grabbed one for myself!", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet! see review to get some tips on it.", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "R2T2EI4DAUN9YR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently received my tablet yesterday, it worked right out of the box it was somewhat charged. Note: You should charge it as soon as you get it because it takes 6hrs to charge the first 2 times, this is stated in the manual. Also, be careful with the wall charger, mine needed to be adjusted before it could begin charging the tablet. If you charge by USB it might take longer, i found that the wall charger is quicker. YOU SHOULD BUY MEMORY EXPANSION, it's not optional if you plan on adding a lot of items on your tablet you get 1 GB of on-board storage. Make sure you are careful not to drop it, i would not recommend that at all because it doesn't seem like it is able to take much damage. Personally i bought a tablet case with a keyboard a good 1 to use is the 7\" Tablet Stand with USB Keyboard - Black Faux Leather Carrying Case, there is a converter that comes with this tablet that you can hook up to the cases keyboard USB cable. The browsing speed is quite nice and the apps are amazing since they come from the Google play-store. You can stream any type of online content like from YouTube or the web. One thing i found odd is that when your on the main screen and you click the search magnifying glass you see a brief image of previous YouTube videos that you've watched. In my opinion i suggest you uninstall the YouTube app that comes with the tablet and re-install a newer one which fixed my problem. Tip: If you put a SD card in and you want to get it out you push the SD card in and then release it and it will come out. If you decide you want to link a YouTube account with your tablet, and each time you try to login you get an error message. You might need to do the 2-step verification for the Google account you want to link with(additional help just ask). This is an overall good product.

Its biggest advantage is that it comes rooted from the factory. With a fast SD card (Class 6 or better), it runs full screen, full motion, video without even straining and it's compatible with Kindle. Granted, the camera isn't the greatest but, hey, look at the price and move on. The WiFi connection is rock steady and this tablet can also be set up as a Wireless Hot Spot. Audio Quality is outstanding and it even has a rudimentary Graphic Equalizer, along with sound FX, included. Obviously, the video quality isn't what an iPad or one of the more expensive Android tablets would offer but, again, look at the price and move on. It's good enough that only a comparison with something a LOT better will show its shortcomings. You can set up one of three different kinds of start-up security but be warned: If you password protect this tablet you MUST use a USB keyboard to log on. Otherwise, you won't get in.There are a few small, (to me at least), problems with this tablet:1) I originally purchased this tablet from Sears and those, (I purchased two for my grands), had the Adobe Reader, Skype, Netflix, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flipit, and Solitaire preloaded but this one did not. Apparently, this is a slightly different, (read: Newer), version of this tablet and that accounts for the difference in available out-of-the-box apps. That's not a con for me personally, but for those of you who buy a tablet for any of the above, be aware that you'll have to download all those apps.2) The viewing angles are actually pretty good EXCEPT....If you tilt the top of the tablet too far back, you will get what amounts to a negative image. The other viewing angles are about what you would expect with a flat screen. If you, as I did, buy this tablet with one of the keyboard cases that have the \"kickstand\" on the back, you won't have to worry about this problem except when using the tablet in Portrait position.3) The specs say it has 4Gb of internal storage but unless there is something here that I'm not aware of, this tablet has only 2.5Gb of actual, usable, internal storage. For me, that's no big deal because I'll be using it mostly as a reader for Kindle books. For someone who wants to load a bunch of apps and games, be aware: There is not as much internal storage space as you think there is. On the upside, the tablet will accept up to a 32Gb Micro SDHC card and you can also plug in a USB Flash Drive so storage space, (except for apps which just don't play well unless installed to the primary \"hard drive\"), is not really an issue.4) I'm not sure if this is really a con but I need to mention it. The battery life seems to be a bit short. I've gone from 100% to about 20% in a couple of hours of intense surfing. That said, I've also watched a 2+ hour movie with no problem at all, so it could just be me. On a brighter note, Comodo has a free battery saver app that's worth its weight in gold. So far, I've seen a 2x increase in battery life after installing that app.5) This tablet is woefully short on documentation. The included manual is nothing more than a Quick Start guide and there is a shortage of any kind of technical information about this tablet on the Net. After a bit of searching I found the manufacturer's web page, [...], but there is very little useful info there. Again, this is not a con for me personally, I do computers for a living, but the average user needs to be aware that if you buy this tablet, you'll need to do your own problem solving because there is very little in the way of help from the manufacturer.I put this tablet through rigorous testing over a period of a month. I did everything I could to it, short of actually \"Bricking\" it, (or throwing it against a wall), to see how much it could take and how well it performed. I actually got it to freeze but a quick Google session, (Hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time until the tablet shuts off [About 5 seconds]. Press and hold the power button as instructed in the manual to turn the tablet on and you're back in business), produced a solution to that problem. I can truthfully say that this tablet is built like a Timex. The Boomers who read that last will understand exactly what I mean by that and why, as a result, I'm giving this tablet a 5 star rating.I bought two of these as birthday presents for my grands and I liked them so much that I got one for me and will buy at least two more for two more of my grands. They come with everything you need, (USB OTG adapter, USB Data Cable, Stylus, Earphones, Screen protector, and Charger), and they can be used with a USB Keyboard/Mouse. You could even attach a USB Mini-Hub if you'd like. This particular version also solved the problem of the shaky charger connection and even included better quality, noise cancelling, in canal earphones.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Great Performance to Price Ratio and you're looking to break into the world of tablets, without breaking the bank, you want this tablet.

The capacitive touch screen is much better than the cheap Archos tablet I had (which quit after a year).  I watched part of a netflix video on the zeepad and it ran well, but the dark scenes didn't show up well due to low contrast.  All other applications I've run were plenty colorful and vibrant.  The processing speed seems better than other cheap tablets.  One little quirk, but so far I haven't been able to keep the time consistently accurate.  It goes back to some factory programmed time zone (maybe China).  The battery doesn't seem to last more than 2-3 hours with constant average use.  Also, the actual screen size is a little smaller than most 7\" tablets but not so much it matters.  The unit does resemble a large GPS navigation system in looks (which doesn't matter to me).

I didn't want to get them something that would make me hurt too bad if THEY broke it.As a techie I am aware that my personal standards may be a bit high but I tried to keep my expectations in check for the purposes of  the intended use.  a 5 and 6 year old.I ordered two of these thinking that less than 80.00 a piece for a \"tech toy\" can't be horrible.  Boy was I wrong.  The quality of the propduct build was about what I expected, plastic, and cheap plastic at that.  The screen, while I didn't expect it to be up to par with something like a Nexus 7, I didn't think it would be practically unviewable in portrait mode, and low visibility from certain angles even in landscape mode.I knew it would be slow, I fully expected (thus appreciated) the lag in functions.  The battery life however was a shocker.  One was dead in about 2.5 hours and the other made it about 3 hours.  Not acceptable no matter how inexpensive it was.The other thing that I noticed is that one of the tablets (though they were identical) did NOT have Zeepad branding, it was a generic of a generic, nothing to cry about since as I said before they were identical in every other way.The packaging and contents are also of a generic caliber.  One came with earphones and a cheap sylus, the other came with a cheap stylus/pen and a screen protector.Another thing that really bothered me was the jailbroken state they are in.  Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the company. I can't say that the software was \"stolen\" because Android is largely open source however it did seem to be a bit janky and illegitimate.One tablet was in an Asian language with little hope to change it to english, fortunately I'm used to android and it's icons so I was able to make it through.Overall it just wasn't worth it for me to keep them, Got them on Friday, sent them back today.  Decided to get my babies a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 instead.  They are worth the extra hundred bucks a piece :).If you order this your mileage may vary depending on your expectations of course.

My must-have feature was the ability to do Skype calls and it worked pretty well. It comes with the real Google Play Store, so it would be easy to install your favorite applications. Here some points to ponder:- Only front camera for video calling. The resolution is pretty decent, though the camera application was very basic. Fixed installing another app from the Play Store.- No GPS.- The items on the screen \"stretch\" when tablet is held vertical. No big deal, but I think that means it would be better to use it only in horizontal orientation.- Also, when transitioning (moving the tablet) between horizontal & vertical, the screen gets a little crazy swapping from vertical to horizontal. It calms down when stabilized.- Highly recommended to install the adhesive screen protector immediately after opening. Got some scratches for normal use.- Tested Skype and Youtube and both worked fine.- I couldn't test the ports or the USB cable. Adhesive screen protector and a stylus are included.EDIT: My brother told me they are having problems leaving Skype enabled all the time. I don't know what happens but it shows as if in disconnected status. Also, it seems the volume of the speakers and the sound quality is very low when in a call, compared to a Galaxy Tab 2. I assume it would be better to use headphones.EDIT2: Now that I have it back and using it everyday, I can say that is slow. I guess this is related to the small memory (512Mb). When browsing, switching between applications, or using an app constantly, it gets slower. Sometimes I get the msg saying that an app has stopped, but I just choose \"Wait\" and soon it gets back again. I've installed a memory management app so when the memory usage falls below 25% I run a \"quick boost\" to recover control. I'm using it mostly to watch Netflix in my bed (with headphones of course, as I said the speakers are awful), and it works pretty fine. Also, on the PROS side, is pretty tough; it has fallen a few times, and stands the beats as a champ. I tried to use a microSD card to free storage space, but it couldn't recognize it, don't know if the beats have something to do. The battery life is normal and the wifi reception is good.In summary, again, is pretty decent for the price but as it needs some maintenance, I would say is not recommended for a non-tech person.

Pay attention to the delivery date.  It still came 10 days earlier than promised.  I only mention this because I didn't pay attention and wondered when it would show up.  Anyway I have an HP iPaq PDA that holds a lot of my day to day info and it is not getting younger. I don't want the data on my smartphone as I don't want it hacked.  I need to replace the PDA before it dies.  Looking at replacement costs was eye opening to say the least, 500 smackers.  Forget about it.  Then I thought, hey get a 7\" tablet, bigger screen and lots of apps.  I didn't want anything too expensive as it would be an offline one or two use device.  I saw that the Zeepad had a lot of good reviews and got one.  I've had it for several weeks and have punched a lot of data into it.  It is slow and punching data in is time consuming as sometimes the character doesn't register.  But for my purposes, I don't care as I will be inputting once and reading hundreds of times.  As I said slow, you click and then wait 3 or 4 secs but I am a very patient person and it doesn't bother me that much, though I gave 4 stars because of it.  The charger's plug to the tablet is longer than the socket on mine so it doesn't fit all the way in but it charges.  Do not force the plug into socket or you may break it.  One review says the prongs to the wall socket broke, I checked to see if mine were loose and I recommend you do the same.  Bottom line, this is an $80 tablet not a $200 tablet and you have to expect it will not work the same.  If you are looking for an all around excellent, fast 7\" tablet get the Kindle Fire, if you need it for a one or two use device I recommend the ZeePad.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!!", "Author": "Ashton Brereton", "ReviewID": "R3DP8OKRDZPNEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a fully functional tablet that would allow me, wirelessly, to access the internet, check and write emails, and access files on computers on my home network - from anywhere in or around my home - at a price below $100.

The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have a backward facing camera - so I can't can't scan documents. The front-facing camera works perfectly. So, in sum, I recommend it unreservedly - at the price.UPDATE:I have been using the Zeepad more often now and found that the built-in browser was somewhat slow - taking seconds to access main pages for sites such as CNN, NBC and BBC - and occasionally the browser froze. So, I installed Opera Mini for tablets (free) and found the increase in speed of access to web pages was dramatic. Access is now in less than a second, the formatting of the pages was changed to suit the Zeepad screen, the font size was automatically increased, scrolling is a breeze and all the stories and information are available.

The packaging screams cheap but that's to be expected with an 80.00 tablet.  what was not expected was the inability to play music, it does play... 60 seconds after you click a button in Google Music and once it's started you cannot stop it for another 60 seconds, the point is this is ridiculously slow, even after removing everything installed on it. Displaying album art is non existent as well as even the song names.  if you click out to look at another album, you better go brew a coffee and take a shower, it might be ready when you get back.  This was not a symptom of Google's app either as all the other music players I tried had the same issues.On top of that turning it on and off is a problem, after it goes into sleep you have to hold the button for 30-60 seconds for it to reboot, it will not turn back on after it shuts down the screen like all other tablets do.  I read some of the reviews and unless I got a bum tablet I cannot see how anyone can get this to work properly, there is no way anyone can function by clicking a button and waiting 30 seconds for something to happen.Try it, think \"click\" in your head and then count to 30. that's how long it takes to respond when an app is open.I cannot say how it plays games but if a simple MP3 is any indication this is not worth 8 dollars let alone 80.I would not give this item to my worst enemy... or wait, maybe I would...We should have sent Osama a few of these in 2001, we'd have found him in the same cave still trying to power it on.Update 01/20/2013: after looking at this thing siting in the box waiting for the return I decided to try one thing, I forgot that I did not erase my google credentials so I opened it and did a \"reset\".Oddly enough, now the thing is snappy enough to play the music and show albums and turn on and off properly, not sure what did it and it doesn't change my rating but it now works for my purpose  So if you get a sluggish unit, try resetting it in the settings of the device.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zeepa", "Author": "Mr. Pilachi", "ReviewID": "R3F0DP3C2KCJSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good I love it I will recommend it to all my friends and will buy more in the future if I can still find them on sale.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thought they were great at first but they started malfunctioning within a couple of weeks.", "Author": "Samantha M", "ReviewID": "R1FQGYQVDORZVW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We ordered two of these as Christmas presents for our kids.

At first she liked it.  About a week went by when she started swiping my Ipad again.  I asked her why and she said that it wouldn't cut on.  So after charging it and getting it boot up she started to use it again(for 2 days).  Then she kept bringing it back to me because she didnt like the way the movies looked and that they kept stopping.  Thats when I started to play with it more. I noticed that the batties didnt last long at all.  3 to 4 hours on avarage.(if you are not watching netflix)  The screen has to be viewed head on like an old computer monitor and freezes all the time when using Nextflix.  I have seen better screens on cheap smart phones.  And this thing is slow!!  I though that the thing was gonna be A LOT faster than this.  So when a 4 year old can pick out things she doesnt like on a tablet like an adult would that should tell you something.  Maybe the Ipad spoiled her but either way I am shopping for another tablet for her Christmas present.  I'm going with the Kindle fire or the Kurio 7 this time.

That it runs the standard Google Play Store and standard apps is wonderful.  But aside from the software, the hardware is about as minimal as possible to still run Android 4.2.  I got one of these for my parents and one for us, with the sole intent of making them both digital photo frames.  It's great for that purpose, but I wouldn't suggest it as a regular tablet.  We also have a Kindle Fire HDX that's about the same size but twice the price, and the Kindle is still the better bang for the buck tablet-wise.  This Zeepad tablet has a terrible viewing angle if you try to use it in portrait mode.  But if you want a pretty cool and inexpensive digital photo frame, this is a good option.  I run the Dayframe app and replaced the standard charger with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EJHH20/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15 and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9PO5AM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_27 and have it sitting horizontally (landscape) in an AmazonBasics stand http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZT4VA0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_29 at about eye level when sitting.

My kids have had these tablets a week one of the chargers is broken (yes already) The tablet freezes if it works at all, the volume is bad I can't even explain to you... Nothing works! So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the \"manual\" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the \"seller\" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these. I advice anybody considering a tablet for your kids to stay clear of these... iPad, kindle, Nook etc is the way to go...

You have to push hard to get anything on the screen, but it skip lines most of the time... very frustrating, as if I'm writing a secret formula of some sort or an alien writing an unknown language from outer space.What's irony, is that the seller (Goodios) want's to charge me a re-stocking fee if I return it (that was the first threat when I contacted them after a week), as if I was rough with it or I'm gonna return it with missing parts. They didn't even bother to offer and pay for the postage. I didn't want to go through that cause some companies will find anything wrong with anything to avoid paying you the full amount, and I dealt with those dishonest once before. I tried to hold on to it and made it work properly, but to no avail (it was totally a lemon and I kept telling them that... still they never offer to pay for the postage). I didn't like the tablet anymore cause of those issues, and the brand was faulty. I bought it cause it had some favorable reviews on that tablet and the stylus to use, but mine was a mistake, a total crap, and the seller was a total jerk for threatening me...

Thank goodness I always purchase the SQUARETRADE warranty because I would be out of money!! I called SQUARETRADE to see about coverage.... this product would have normally been covered under the manufacturer given the timeframe, BUT since this is made in China and it's based out of there...they were nice enough to let me return the product to them, get my amazon gift cards and be done with these ZEEPADS!!!! Now on to finding a better quality tablet for my girls!!!We purchased two tablets for our 4 & 5 y/o girls. They play on my android phone and ipods continuously. These tablets are PERFECT for the game play and NETFLIX that they enjoy on a regular basis. I am very pleased so far with the quality for the price.

No bluetooth was sad but not a deal breaker especially since it has an sd card slot.This bad boy is pretty sweet for what it is.

Lags a bit switching from portrait/landscape and the usb and app installations are slow.Don't let that stop you from buying it though.

One drop from my 4 year old niece and the device split a little on one side and both the power and volume button popped out cleanly with no clear way to put them back in besides to take the tablet apart, something I had no plans of doing, and put it back in. Thank goodness for the SquareTrade warranty!Before it broke, I found that I could not connect this tablet, or the other tablet for that matter, to my computer using the provided USB cord without it shutting off automatically. Meaning that I couldn't add any of the pictures or music to the tablet like I had planned to. Not only that, but the camera quality is absolutely TERRIBLE!!

I turned it off after using it and we went to bed.  The next afternoon, I attempted to turn it on so we could watch a movie since it was raining.  And nothing.  Would not turn on. I tried charging the tablet and nothing worked.  Needless to say, I was less than pleased.  What pushed me over the dissatisfaction edge is that when returning this item, I had to pay for return shipping; that shipping (since it is international) costs me $26.  So not only am I currently out the money I spent on the item, I am now out an extra $26 because I was sent a defective product.

I followed the directions and charged it 2 1/2 hours before using it. It is so cute in pink. The graphics are nice and the speed is good. It has some handy pre-loaded aps such as Facebook, Google and fun games I know she will like such as Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja. It is so much more than a reader. I've only had it a couple of days and it has an ap for the reader but I haven't had time to test that yet.

ANTIVIRUS AS SOON AS U GET TABLETThe tablet comes installed with games and 2 of the games came up as potentially threatening so if u just hand it to your kid and they try to play those games u are at risk I use avg pro its still$15 bucks but I have it installed on 4 devices so worth the money u can get it in the play store this tablet is awesome but an adult should go thru all the settings and run spywear b4 handing it over to kids as I said in my updates whoever rooted the device changed the settings if u run avg it will walk u thru the settings at the end of the scan to protect your deviceI bought this tablet for my 18 month old daughter because she is determined to keep up with her older brothers and loves all the learning apps available for young toddlers I must say this tablet is great for her im going to try to find a kid tuff case of course the tablet is on the cheaper side I only paid 76 bucks im not complaining all the apps work and this tab has options to delete installed apps and options to move apps to sd card I did not have those options on my galaxy so not bad at all shes gonna be so excited to play her word games when she wakes up from naptimeUpdateJust realized this tab comes rooted I know this is a high selling point for some it makes me a little nervous but so far so good I will update again if anything else pops upUpdateSo my daughter loves it the abc phonics games are a must for anyone with young toddlers the zeepad is definatly great so far of course the speakers suck and itscheap plastic its only $76 bucks I recommend going thru the settings whoever rooted it set those kind of weird still tweaking them my daughter doesnt want to let go of the thing its great for kids and budgets I cnt afford an ipad and if I could im not handing It to my child so this is a great way for u to let your youngster play without losing out on $500 or more if they drop itUpdateDay 2 with the zeepad the charger works its battery life definatly isnt great and it depletes even when your not using the tablet but I also believe those small annoyances to be the reason the zeepad is available for such a cheap price its a wonderful beginner tablet for young kids it comes already installed with kids games and is obviously intended for kids but as I said before if your on a budget an adult could find this useful also its not the fastest or the best thats why its so cheap but its still more than enough for my daughter to watch her shows and play her apps I would definatly recommend this tablet to others great purchaseUpdateThe tablet is still working despite the fact my 18 month old has been drooling and pushing on the screen a little harder than I like then again I bought her the zeepad so she wouldnt abuse my galaxy anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain reading the reviews are what helped me make my purchase and they are also how I determine what seller to purchase from that is ehy I keep updating I feel like this tablet is a good deal if u purchase from a reliable seller and supervise your kids charge it for them its not a tank they can still break it make them sit on the couch while they play it instead of running with it this tablet is cheap and has tons of features but its not durable or it would cost more if u want durable spend $100 more bucks and u will get higher quality this is a great beginner tablet its still quite fast for a single core processor and has tons of features runs netflix youtube and my comcast apps all fine on comcast I have to log out then back in somtimes for it to work but for it $76 delivered its not that big of a deal plus u can install apps that require root access my tablet doesnt do that and to buy higher end rooted tablets is at least $100 more on top of what the going price is so im assuming the negative reviews are the people who bought from the seller at the very bottom offering the dual camera on the probably fake zeepadsUpdateIts been a couple weeks now the zeepad is still charging and works great I only charge it about once a week but I also shut it off when my daughter isnt playing it I think this was a great deal my daughter loves it and it plays all her movies and games without any problemsUpdateThe zeepad is still working just got done loading a bunch of free mp3 songs for my daughter off of the free app I got off google play I really dnt understand all the bad ratings for my$76 bucks this is an amazing deal we have 3 samsung galaxy tab2 also and this tablet does just as much a little slower at times and not as good quality but for the price this is a great dealUpdateSkype works and all of the other apps we have loaded on here just got done reading elmo and dora ebooks we downloaded on the kindle app I still cnt figure out why people dnt like this tablet I'm writing my review on it rn the battery isn't that bad and why would u want your child playing 5hrs of games a day anyways either way zeepad still works and we still love it", "Date": "March

address was incorrect. I chatted with Amazon and they sent a request to Draco Tek. I also sent an email to Drack Tek and they responded within 48 hours...I was impress with the seller and Amazon for helping me correct the shipping address. I purchase this item on March 9,2013 I received this item on March 23, 2013 sooner than promised. I brought this product for my grand-daughter she is 4 years old and is very savvy with my iPad 4. I brought this product for the price and for what it can do. I was some what disappointed because when I received this product everything was their except the stylus pen, the box came with 3 different type of chargers. One was USB, AC adapter and one for using a flash drive. The USB and AC Adapter does not work I tried it and the charge stayed at 1%. So I tried a different USB and it started charging so I left it to charge overnight. I tried it the next day and it did not charge more than 2%. The product request that you charge it the first time 6 hours...so I was disappointed that I still could not use this item. So I tried another charger that I had and this charger was charging I started charging at 9:00am and it was fully charged be 2:00pm.  Finally I was able to see what this could do and so far it works okay. I know folks say this was inexpensive...however you should always receive what the seller is selling and the item should do what the product states it should do no exceptions.  I brought this base on what the product offered. Money should not be a factor...just because some items cost more does not make them a better product. I could send this product back after all if the product cannot work because you cannot charge it then it is no good to you...major flaw. I think Drakco Tec Store which is located in China should read their customers reviews. I did read the reviews and had mixed emotions. Being a buyer at Amazon and trusting Amazon I took a chance. I have purchased a lot on Amazon since March 9,2013 and I'm learning a lot about the sellers and shipping. I what have rated this product higher because it does work and it is a good buy...however not being able to charge this item is very huge for me. Please take the time to read all reviews...their was a lot to read. I read all of the reviews after ordering. So I did know there was a possibility that the charger would not work. So I did gather up all of the old chargers I had collected over the years from old cell phones which save the day...so in the end it did work out.

It's not blue tooth, but even with blue tooth you have to be ale to see what your typing, so it's not like you can be typing in the other room, so it's the same thing basicaly unless you have to have something else plugged up at the same time. It comes with the usb to plug into the usb that the zeepad comes with so u have everything to do it plus cheeper with a durrable cover. I had no problems with the seller or the shipping.(shipping threw fedex)You might want to consider buying a car charger for the tablet, I bought mine on amazon.comLINK:Car DC 5V Adapter For Zeepad 7inch Android Tablet PC Power Supply Cord ChargerYou can also purchase an adapter from Wal-mart that plugs into the car to take house held items with house held chargers to plug into the adapter to make it charge in the car. I have one of these and it works with the zeepad house charger.I'm not sure why so many people leave the \"not so positive feedback\" for this product. Most of the negetive feedback came from those who ordered durring Christmass. Okay, I never order anything durring Christmass. WHY? Things get lost, misplaced, or damaged(may be the cause for those who had minor issues- package could have been dropped or slammed into another package or left in too hot or cold of environment). 9 times out of 10 it's not the company who is at fault(the postal service who is delivering the package could be) and durring Christmass their E-Mails are flooded. They may have accidently overlooked your e-mail or simply haven't gooten to it yet. Plus if your item doesn't arrive by the estimated delivery date don't panik, it's just an estimate, it may take a few more days to arrive. I orderd mine a week or 2 after Christmass and payed the extra money for \"2-3 day shipping\" and it arrived on the 1st estiamated delivery date. I didn't run into a single problem with shipping or ordering, I am sorry for those who did and I have confidence that the seller will indeed get back to you and fix any issues you may have expeirenced. I must say this couldn.t possibly be a scam because, I am a real, happily satisfied customer and I recieved a real Zeepad tablet w/ accessories, undamged and on time threw amazon.com(shipped by FED-EX).Copy of the nice e-mail conversation I experinced with the seller:Me:  Hey, I lost my pink zeepad stylist and messed up the zeepad screen protector can you send me a new screen protector and  another pink zeepad stylist?

There is no customer support. We bought two of these (one white and one pink) for our children to use as e-readers but the i-reader (as it is on this unit) doesn't work. It freezes the unit trying to load then after a couple of minutes a pop up comes on asking you if you would like to stop or wait for it to load. I have waited for over 10 minutes for the i-reader to load with no luck.  The i-reader shows it loaded and is taking up memory it just doesn't work for what ever reason. Good thing it uses Android, I loaded the kindle (for free from Amazon) on it and now can load books through the kindle. I also use the local e-library so the kids can check out books online. The unit is not the fastest but for the kids it is good. It would be nice if there was a customer support or at least more information in the box for use of this unit, or they could load the information on a tutorial on the desktop.  But over all it seems to be an desent unit for the money. We don't let them use it for social media or e-mail so I can not comment on that. They do use it for games and internet research and it apprears to be doing fine for that, so I would assume that the e-mail and social media would be fine as well.  It streams the video's well from you tube. My kids watch the Looney Tunes video's when they finish thier reading (30 min. a day only).  The picture is clear so vidoe is good. The outter case or shell doesnt' seem to be to durable, so I am glad that they have not dropped it yet.

But it does freeze a bit. Runs a little slow, but with only 512MB of Ram, I chalk that up to the fact it's been a while since I've worked with something with such a slow processing speed.It's a decent reader - the kid prefers the weight and size compared to that massive Nook she got from another relative for Christmas. The fact that it is PINK is possibly the biggest plus. It does run most Google Play apps - so that is a plus since they are mostly free.  The front facing camera is pretty poor quality, so that feature for Skype is there, but know it's about as good as webcams from 10 years ago.

NOW I did read all of the comments, and this company has a great reputation,but this product when it works for people its fantastic, when it doesn't well I had a tearful child!! So is this the sellers fault? how do i rate this with anything but a 1 when the product failed so miserably even if the seller was fine? I mean i didn't contact the seller amazon did, so im assuming they treated amazon as they would me on that note they get 5 stars, BUT again why are they not testing these tablets out, I mean its a real crap shoot when you buyt this, as you can see some people got lucky and what they bought was awesome, I gambled and lost I bought it crossed my fingers and got a defective one:( i am not going to buy another one, I'm not sure what I'm going to do but this tablet form any of the sellers is not the answer for my family!!I got to my house on time, they DO NEED to package it better!! its in a small box with no bubble wrap or packing material of any kind, and then that box is in another box,(just rattling around) this may be why some are getting cracked screens, plus it(the tablet) was ice cold, I dont know if that would break it, but I'm sure it doesn't help. Maybe that's what happened! For the person who wanted a instructional guide..I got one, it had no adjectives in it, and it didn't help with , why did the sound go out?? so you really dont need one, as everything else is pretty easy to understand, it was funny though!!SO Im giving the tablet 1 star, I rolled a dice, and the seller will get a 5 but for the purposes here, I'm giving it 1 star. So it is definitely buyer BEWARE!! ( I didn't make 2 separate reviews 1 for product 1 for the seller, so I only made this one and included everything!)

I admit there are a few things the Galaxy has as features this tablet doesnt do, but for the most part it can do all you need (unless you are a high end user).  This tab comes with just under 1gb memory onboard.  I do recommend you buy an 8gb micro SD card (TF card) to go with when ordering as most aps want to install to the card.  Set up was easy and second nature~ no having to flash the bios, or other such nonsense that many other no-name tablets had on their reviews to get Google Play (market).

The thing is the equipment turned out to be defective tablet wont turn, the screen didn't work. So I went yesterday to the Toys R US Where I bought it the one in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, to have it exchanged by another tablet or for a refund. And not only did I wait sooo long in line I was attended by this obnoxious assistant manager , whom which after looking @ the tablet just simply told me she couldn't accept the tablet because the manufacturing company wouldn't accept it. I told her the Tablet had arrived like this yet she didn't do much or anything to help out in this situation. All I can say is that Toys R US.. should emphasize more on customer service which is very low quality, they don't seem to hire a lot of employees although the stores are very big. Sometimes you have to walk around for a while through out the whole store in order to receive some assistance by a employee. As far as this situation I feel totally robbed/Scammed for my money. Employees are supposed to assist customers diligently and efficiently on any situation. But I just sensed they don't really care even though my daughter was next to me while I was trying to exchange the item ( Which obviously made her very sad, she wouldn't stop crying on the way back home.) I simply don't understand why wouldn't Toys R US exchange my item or give me a full refund it seems there always some sort of controversy or excuse to their own benefit  when it comes to exchanges or refunds. Other stores like Game Stop, Electronics Boutique, Wal-Mart,  Amazon won't give those obstacles when it comes to exchanging a item which they also sell a whole lot CHEAPER. Iam beyond indignated because the store manager totally wiped her butt with my receipt ( The purchase had been made less than a month ago) And even though  she did admit the Tablets were in fact coming with defects  she declined to offer any assistance or a exchange, refund, store credit whatsoever. Usually I never really buy often in Toys R Us... because there isn't located where I live & because I don't find the prices of the items cheap or affordable.. compared to Wal-Mart or K-mart or Game Stop , AMAZON . But this incident totally made it for Iam never BUYING ANYTHING ON TOYS R US ... EVER AGAIN.. and will give NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS to relatives and Close ones based on my Personal EXPERIENCE.
