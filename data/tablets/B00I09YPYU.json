It downloads from the play store quickly.The screen protector is neatly installed, better than trying to put one on myself. I would recommend this tablet to anyone.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, low cost", "Author": "Stephanie Hansen", "ReviewID": "R18H6KD2CAAOIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price paid, I expected something cheaply made and mediocre for speed. I have been very pleasantly surprised. The speed is great for an android tablet and the battery life is wonderful! I use this primarily for streaming with my Google chrome. Even being used for 3 hrs each night, I still only have to charge it every 3-4 days. I would definitely purchase this again!", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "RUBEN RODRIGUEZ", "ReviewID": "R3BR50JXH9IDOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased for a trial use for my resort.

Gadbois \"Sport Pilot\"", "ReviewID": "R35Y28ECSBJV0O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was a birthday gift for our second son who is a bit mentally challenged so I ended up creating accounts. It arrived in amazingly short time, 2 days. We bought the suggested cover with a keyboard for something like $8 which is a bargain.As stated by other reviewers the off axis viewing is impossible, the usb input from the external keyboard is slow to respond at times , the WiFi reception is weak, and it seems very slow to boot up to me. I found android a hassle to set up as compared to setting up a Nexus 7 for my wife. I am probably spoiled and too tough on a tablet this low in price. My favorite portable computer is the Acer Chromebook 720 with a boot up time of 7 seconds and runs the Chrome OS.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$119.99", "Features": "Look no further for a budget tablet with more features and value for less.
