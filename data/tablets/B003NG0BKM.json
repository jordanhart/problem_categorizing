It is way more solid than any other stand I have ever seen.  The rubber pads that cradle the ipad are perfectly placed and seem well attached.  I am very pleased with this monster.The only question for you is, 'will you use it enough to justify the cost?'Update:  Dec 2012 -my wife went back to college this last year.  Having this stand right next to her laptop has been a godsend.  All her textbooks are digital so having this nice solid stand has been great.

Upon receiving the stand, I was surprised by the weight, but the weight actually provides excellent stability for those not wanting to remove the ipad from the stand while navigating.

It matches the back of the iPad in terms of color (aluminum).  however this is definitely not lightweight like aluminum it is quite heavy.  So if you are using a fixed desk surface and not moving it often, then it should serve you quite well.  if you plan on moving it often then look elsewhere for something that is a more travel friendly and lighter.  Also, the angle that it provides is unmovable.  For simply looking at something quickly it is fine, but for reading or other things again you might want to look elsewhere as the angle isn't that great for these activities.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A must for any I Pad user", "Author": "Mr. R.

You can put the iPad on the stand straight up or turn the iPad on the side and this stand will still hold it up.  The only thing that I wish was available for this stand was if it was able to adjust it's forward motion. The stand has no adjustability.

Fry", "ReviewID": "R1FRXIR5BWGQJB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not only are these quite expensive, for what they are, I've had the rubber pads become unglued and slide off on both of the units I purchased.  Despite very careful use (my iPads tend to stay put on their stands), I've had 6 of 8 rubber pads (on two separate stands) slide down out of position or fall off completely, leaving sticky glue residue where the pads should be.Customer service mailed me replacement pads(along with rather exacting instructions on how to install them), and despite following directions to a 'T' the replacements soon began sliding off as well.So I've spent $150 + shipping, on stands that have a fundamental design flaw.  I certainly would've looked elsewhere if I'd known. These 5 star reviews are coming from people who haven't used the product for a meaningful length of time.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice, too expensive.", "Author": "R.

The wireless keyboard fits nicely underneath and the iPad looks so proud sitting there.  Do you need it?  Well, I guess that depends on what it's needed for.  If you plan on using it on a desk or where you will be using a keyboard then it may be just what you want.  I just wanted something to set by my stereo so I can use the iPad as a jukebox so to speak.  This works but it has a big footprint, can't adjust the viewing angle, tight spaces you can forget about it.  It rocks alittle if you're touching the screen when upright.  Nice product though, just too expensive.I purchased the Targus Mini Stand about 1 week before this stand.  To be honest I like the Targus better for my needs.  It is small, doesn't rock, looks nice and it only cost $18 bucks.  If you wanted to take it with you it would fit into your bag with ease.  So, between the two I'd have to go with the Targus Mini Stand.  That being said the Stabile stand is still very nice.

However, if you are looking for something portable... this is not it.  This puppy is heavy!  Not that you can't easily move it around in the home... you can.
