{"Reviews": [{"Title": "IPad user changes to a Note 10.1", "Author": "Graptor", "ReviewID": "R3EVA93GLHDJQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PerspectiveYour choice in a device has a lot to do with your experiences and needs. Let me give you a little background so you know where I am coming from and see if my experiences are relevant to you. (They might not be). I have only owned IPads in the past and have upgraded every year as the new models have come out. I have also owned every IPhone until recently opting out of the Iphone 5 for a Galaxy S3. I began missing the functionality I have in my new Android phone while using my 3rd generation Ipad. Seeing what Apple was offering with the 4th Generation Ipad, I decided to purchase the Note 10.1 16GB 3G international version. Network connectivity was very important to me. I primarily use a tablet for business note taking (Evernote), connecting remotely with a Citrix receiver, mail and calendar. For home I use it to watch YouTube, read news, Facebook and surfing the web. I have had no prior experience with non-IOS tablets.SetupConfiguring the tablet with my Google accounts was fast and easy. There was no problem using an AT&T; sim to get service. An Ipad comes with a MicroSim so, you'll need to get them to give you a larger Sim or buy an adapter online if you intend on using the same card. AT&T; does classify the device as a phone, not a tablet. Which means that if you have a shared data plan you will be charged $30 to $40 a month to add the phone to your shared data plan, instead of $10. Regrettably, I have to agree with their reasoning, the note is a phone NOT just a tablet. There are benefits to having phone service on your tablet, your going to need to weigh the cost with the benefit. Also understand your dealing with a 3G device with the Note 10.1, it does not have LTE. Where I work and live that isn't an issue since, they are both in 3G H+ areas. I was getting 3MBPS with both my Ipad and Note, no difference. If your in an LTE area then that difference could be significant.ImpressionsLet me say, the note is flat out better for business use. Ice Cream Sandwich build has come along way and in my personal opinion after being an Apple fan boy for years is that its now more functional. The Spen and split screen multitasking the Note offers are fantastic. Keep in mind you can't split screen everything but, most things are there and it seems like Samsung has put a lot of thought into what people would want to use that feature for. Having a real clipboard was the biggest surprise for me. The device is packed with functionality but, there is a learning curb for IOS users. For personal use its also great to have a real YouTube app made for a tablet again. Exchange Mail, contact and Calendar sync work very well.HardwareThe device is fast and responsive. I receive strong network and WiFi connections. The device feels sturdy. The SPen works flawlessly. You can change the thickness of your lines by applying more pressure to the pen. Screen is bright and wide (I prefer the space over the IPad). Comparing the screen to an IPad 3rd Generation it is difficult for me to tell the difference with the lower resolution. The front mounted speakers are in the right spot. The rounded edges are easier to hold than the sharper Ipad. Its also feels lighter than a 3rd generation IPad. I purchased a removable 32GB MicroSIM card. The Samsung does limit the usage of the external memory, which is a downside of their devices. You can't load apps on the Sim unless of course you root the device. Also, keep in mind this will come with a European charger, you'll need a USB charger to use it. My old Iphone USB block worked fine all I had to do was insert the Samsung cord into it.(correction:an Apple USB charger will only work if your device is turned off. I found an international plug adapter at Radio Shack for $13.)ConclusionI'm extremely happy with my move to the Note 10.1. There is a leaning curb switching from IOS to the Note 10.1. There is simply a lot more that you can do with this device. I can not tell you enough how multitasking and the SPen improve the overall usage for me. All the apps that I used on my IPad are in the Play store as well. Evernote, skitch, Citrix Receiver, YouTube (HD), pulse, Spotify, etc.. You don't have to settle any more for an IPad. Thankfully, resale prices for a 3rd Generation IPad are high. My Ipad lasted 45 minutes on Ebay and netted me most of what I paid for the note.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product, but beware the supplier", "Author": "John W. Wendt", "ReviewID": "R3M2H3O0LHTVKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this in December 2012 from FGS Trading. I do not recommend this vendor. They got the product from Hong Kong, formatted in Chinese. So, I turned it on, EVERYTHING was in Chinese. I have nothing but respect for the Chinese language, but try to change the language when every last element is in Chinese, and everything you touch results in another instruction in Chinese! I tried to contact the vendor, FGS Trading, twice. They never responded.So, I downloaded the manual, and after some time managed to change the language by following the icons, which are fortunately the same for all languages. There was still considerable reformatting to do of various keyboards and options--which I was able to do after reading the manual.But enough griping about the vendor. The product is great. Snapped in a SIM card, and it immediately downloaded and installed the settings. Very simple to set up as a wireless router; my devices recognized it immediately. Stuck in a 64 gb memory device (which should only be formatted in the tab), then put it in my PC and downloaded my entire Itunes library, which was then read and organized by a popular free app, Rocket Player--completely organized my podcasts, albums, playlists. Great Google maps, which I am using with the GPS overseas. Surprisingly accurate voice recognition. Great for Skyping as well as regular phone calls. Love the streaming radio, which does just fine on the pretty pathetic bandwidth I have over here in Nairobi, Kenya. I have installed a free proxy server too, which gives me access to (ahem) certain content that I would not ordinarily have access to. Just getting into the actual writing functions. Haven't paid for an app yet, and it's lived up to all of my expectations. All told, an intuitive device that excels in all the areas that matter to me, and I haven't even begun to explore all the apps that are out there. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 feels solid and does not disappoint.As for FSG Trading, I can't say a whole lot, but if you happen to be Chinese you are sure going to appreciate the Chinese language options, which are many! FGS, still not too late to apologize. Perhaps you should let your customers know what they are in for and how to deal with it.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note 10.1 3g wifi N8000", "Author": "Big J-Daddy", "ReviewID": "R126SFP8E1VMJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic!
