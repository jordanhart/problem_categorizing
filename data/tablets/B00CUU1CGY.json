{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kindle HDX 7\" Wifi 32 GB", "Author": "Rita", "ReviewID": "R1IWS6AOYTRZS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I want to say that I was 4 star happy with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and have been just as happy or happier with past Kindles.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" will be the fifth one for me and my family.I find that the HDX is a good upgrade from the HD.  I haven't found anything yet that would make me want to return it.  There was 60% battery out of the box and for me, setup was a snap.  The HDX connected to my account, downloaded all the info, upgraded and came back up in about 5 minutes.  The hardest part was opening the box.I was very happy to see the charger when I opened the box and not just the wire.  I really hate to buy the extra charging plug.  The one that comes in the box is a smaller charger than the square one Amazon sells.  I don't know all the specs, but I assume it charges slower, but has to be faster than charging through the computer.  I haven't had to recharge completely yet so I don't know how long it will take.  But I am assuming it won't be any longer than with the HD.  I found that so far the power usage is about the same at the HD.  I was on it for several hours last night and used about 15% without running video.  That was setup, book downloading and cruising the features and some internet just to see how the screen looks and check out loading times.  The charging wire does stick out from the kindle at greater than 90 degrees, so one will have to be careful when plugging it in and removing the plug.  Also, you wouldn't want to lay the kindle on it's face when charging, the plug will get in the way.The screen resolution is fantastic. The sound is very good for such small speakers and I haven't seen any buffering with the videos.  Although the cloud did have all of my books, the cloud didn't seem to know which books were still on my HD. The only books on the HDX when it arrived were the ones I purchased since I put in my order for the HDX.  When I set up it pulled in the cloud but not the unread books on the HD.  So, I had to run through the HD and download the books I haven't read yet from the cloud to the HDX. The speed is faster than the HD, although not remarkably faster.  It is lighter than the HD which is good for me because I have arthritic hands and can't hold a book. So far the best one from that standpoint was the Touch.Many have complained about the bluish/purple light around the boarder on white pages.  I would not have noticed it if it hadn't been mentioned in the reviews.  It doesn't distract from my reading (and I read a lot), doesn't cause me any eye strain, and I forget it is even there. People complaining because Amazon is trying to put a positive spin on this are na\u00efve.  All companies are going to try and give their products the best spin.  It is up to the customer to like it or not.  Return it if you don't like it.I am happy for the mayday button, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  I don't want to contact someone just to say hi.  But I am sure I would use it in a heartbeat if I needed to.  I have never had a problem with phoning tech help, even if it is in India. The user guide was pretty easy to find and I am going through it tonight to see if there is anything I haven't figured out yet.The origami cover isn't really great and hugely overpriced.  It's a little floppy when opening it but the magnets put it tight when you  flip it to the back for handheld reading.  I do like the way it feels, and the magnets that hold everything together and creates the stand are solid.  The kindle is held in the case securely, although it looks like it might fall right out, it won't.  The cover doesn't block the speakers, but seem to enhance the sound by holding the kindle slightly away from the back cover and aiming the sound at you in landscape.  When I stand the kindle in landscape it wiggles a little when I swipe or tape to change pages and seems as if it wants to fall over.  It hasn't yet, but it doesn't seem very stable. The worst is when I stand it in portrait.  The kindle turns itself off and restarts repeatedly.  I don't know if it is the cover on button thingy hitting the table or if the new location of the on button on the kindle itself is poorly thought out.  The on button isn't in the way no matter which way I hold the kindle, it is only a problem when it stands in portrait.  Maybe another cover would work better.  I am going to wait to see what other hard cover is created by other makers.So, I am happy with my purchase and I am glad I upgraded.  I don't use my kindle for more than reading, email, facebook, twitter, and the internet, but I am looking forward to the software upgrade in November.  I am curious to see what kind of business items will appear.  I wish Amazon would notify kindle owners when a new update is available or make it possible to update software automatically when one connects to Kindle.UPDATE 11/3/13 - I am happier than ever with the HDX.  I am experiencing a weird thing with it though.  It may be the Origami cover that is causing this, but 4 times now in the last week the HDX has decided to just restart all by itself.  When it does, it doesn't save a book where I am reading.  I have to hunt for the page I was on.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "couldn't agree more", "Author": "Debra Ann Fescina", "ReviewID": "R199IHRUR3XORN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Found the following on the 1-star reviews:  \"From somebody that has owned both products, I was never happier to sell my kindle fire on Craigslist. I've had two apple computers and 4 iPhones as well as two iPad's and I couldn't be happier with them. Everything else is just an imitation. Save yourself the trouble and go straight to the apple store.\" Again, I couldn't agree more.I purchased FOUR Kindle fires last year for grandkids for Christmas.  I have two of them in my home right now that will not charge AT ALL.  The other two, I am waiting to hear from my other grandkids to see if they are having any similar issues.  I have spoken with three representatives from Amazon, and I am hearing the same thing from all of them:  They would be happy to sell me 2 replacement Kindles .. it is the best that they can do.Amazon needs to put into place a remedy for people other than what is written in black and white.  The fact that your people, one who is supposedly a supervisor, cannot stray from the rules and make an exception to a customer who purchased FOUR Kindles and now has TWO not charging at not quite 13 months later is amazing.  There SHOULD be some sort of empowerment to Amazon employees, especially supervisors, to make decisions that are fair to Amazon's customers.  I asked if I could get an exception to the 30 days past warranty; and when told \"NO\" I asked if I could get a discount from the normal $79 replacement cost since I would have to purchase TWO refurbished Kindles.  Again, I was told \"NO\".  At a minimum, Amazon should replace the battery at a REASONABLE cost.  However, that offer was not on the table.Apple, Nook, Nintendo, Bose, Dell, HP.  I have them all (I have a hand-held Nintendo that is literally more than 15 years old - it still works!).  I have never had a product quit working at 13 months ... the only thing close to this is an iPod that only works while on the charger but it is FIVE years old AND it does still work while on the charger!  I couldn't agree more, that folks should put real thought into what they are buying.  Reputation for what lasts is what is important.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "HD to HDX Upgrade - Initial Impressions Good and Bad", "Author": "R. K. Greene", "ReviewID": "R1K17Y6CLEE74V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update 12/4/13:Now that I have had a chance to use my new HDX for 30 days....here are a few morefindings against my year old HD model:1.  I now prefer using my HDX over my HD model most of the time.  The performance  is way more solid than my HD.  I still use my HD for my missing Weather app  WeatherBug...and the older version of AccuWeather.  The HD and HDX clearly  use different stores.  I got notes back from app developers....no estimate  of when these apps will be in the HDX store.  Does anyone really care?2.  A new minor app issue for my ESPN scoreboard which nobody wants to address.  The standings font for the stats is too large and overlays the city names  such that NFL Won and Loss numbers overlay the city names.  Very annoying.  Does anyone ever test these new/modified HDX apps?3.  Battery life.  As noted below....it is directly proportional to the brightness  setting.  If you want to conserve your battery life...turn the brightness bar  down to 70-80% of the bar length....to get at least 2 more hours out of your  battery.4.  No HD solid black matrix...more dark grey on the HDX.  I guess I am getting use  to this change.  Still like the black LEDs better.  I also don't notice the  blue edges as much on white screens when I am reading.  With time, we can all  get use to just about anything.5.  I did get the HDX Marware screen protectors.....a must accessory...although way  too expensive.  $14.99 + tax on prime for just 2 plastic sheets.**********************************************************************************First, let me say I really like my Kindle(s), but for those who are consideringan upgrade, I will post my quick review to help you decide if now is the timeto make an upgrade or not, and whether to keep your HD around for certain apps.I am still testing out my new HDX and will update this review as I discover moreabout it.  Normally, I wait a few months before I buy an upgrade for any pieceof hardware, but this time I pulled the trigger early on 11/4 to take advantageof the extra 1 day 15% discount which Bezos gave us for the FAA ruling on wireless devices.  I will assume most will want to purchase a standard cover and AC adapter.

Great price performance (Cheaper and Faster)2. Size and weight (Smaller and lighter footprint for jacket pockets)3. Origami case is ok with fixed magnetic angles but not adjustable4. Mayday Help (Excellent) - Fast response but some advisors are still  learning and some are not familiar with HDs and need 2nd level help.5. Apps and movies seem to be running much smoother with fewer freezes than  HD model.HDX vs HD CON:1. Most disappointing:  Screen background matrix is not a black matrix like theHD...more of a very dark grey with lighter gray spotlight in the middle of the display and shadowing of icons and other objects.  HDX screen seem less sharp than HD despite higher resolution when viewed side by side.  I tried all positions of the brightness bar and turned auto feature on and off with no improvement.  There is no contrast control either per my chat with the Mayday folks.2. Others are correct on the white screen blue edge lines on the bottom and rightside of screens.  The HD would probably be a better choice for those who readmore on their Kindles white screens. I did not notice blue line edge problems for movies and pictures. Choice of the blue LEDs for the HDX might explain this problem and the \"dark gray background\" matrix on the carousel screen.  I am surprised there was apparently not more human factors testing on this model before this release.3. The standard font size for the HDX seems 1 or 2 points smaller for more text than the HD. An issue for older reading glasses users.  Portrait viewing will help this a little.4. I don't like the non-carousel device app icons to be half-way visible at the bottom of my HDX.  There is no * (star) feature on this operating system to hide the apps you don't want visible on your carousel.5. Not all HD apps you have now are available on the HDX.  I am not sure if the Kindle \"Store\" is the same store for the HD and the HDX.  If so, they have a problem.  A good example is one of my favorite free Weather Apps, WeatherBug, which has the blue ladybug icon with rain and snow symbols on shell.  The HDX store says it's there and you try to find this icon in the store and all you get are apps the look or are spelled like it but not the real WeatherBug app.  Meantime the HD Kindle \"Store\" has the real one...and I use it on my HD all the time.  When I called the Mayday folks...they said it probably is still not available for the HDX.  If so, then why does the HDX app store search say it is there???  Another free app, AccuWeather, is there in the store, but has a totally different look andfeel, on the HDX. I still like the HD version better.6. Still no .AVI .MOV or .MVI support for movies, only .MP4.  I had to get a desktop converter software for all my Canon camera movies. (ArcSoft Media Converter 2 is a good one)7. Miss the HDMI port on the HDX.  May use the HD for playback of movies on my HDTVs.  Not sure how fast the wireless \"Mirror\" display will be on the HDX...or if I will have \"Miracast\" compatibility. Seems like the hardwire cable would be faster.8. Battery discharge seems to be faster than the HD for same apps...may be underpowered for the higher screen resolution.  Might require lower brightness setting to conserve battery reserves. Requires additional benchmarking.Final Analysis:I'm sure many of the early \"bugs\" will be worked out of the HDX before the holidays and many of the \"missing apps\" will show up at some point.  I will probably keep my HDX to keep testing and benchmarking it against my HD.  I will not get rid of my HD until I see the improvements on the Con side addressed here and I would advise the current HD users to do the same.  Even if this generation proves to be a disappointment, there is still a lot to like about this one for a new tablet owner.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle FIre HDX!", "Author": "Sara Karolina", "ReviewID": "RJELLQHFEYV6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Kindle Fire. You can read, surf the net (let me just suggest downloading the Dolphin browser, since the Silk browser it comes with isn't that great). And that blue LED light on the side that everyone is complaining about isn't actually flawed, it was a design decision based on lower LED battery using power. The blue LED lights used less power than the white, so they went with the blue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me and I don't really understand what the big deal about it is. You definitely notice it, but more so if you are reading a book but still, it doesn't even matter. The clarity of the screen is amazing. I highly recommend going with the 64 GB, that's what I got. I already have a ton of apps on there and am watching tv shows and movies and barely have any memory used up. I also got the Amazon origami magnetic case for my Kindle Fire, and it's also really good quality. I saw that most reviewers didn't like the fact that the charging spot for the Kindle Fire is at an angle. I actually like it because it doesn't get in the way of anything when it's laying down. The headphone spot is also at an angle and I don't mind that either. I think overall the design is awesome.

Size & weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2. Speed, its seems REALLY fast, book pages are in a blink of an eye  & the web loaded fast not choppy or drag, my wifi is pretty good so it helps. I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4. Did I mention there is no blue or purple gold green or rainbow light around the border !!!!!!! & if there is it is so light I cant notice it. I only used it for an hour or so last night so I will update if this changes but for now it looked clean.5. Apps,,,hmm I hear a lot of people b*tching about google this or google that,,,,WHO CARES,,there is enough content on Amazon to keep me happy & not that I am a betting man I will bet there is a bunch more in the pipe line.6. I maxed the Kindle out with 64 gb  so I assume i will have enough room for years to come.7. Very easy to use,,,,,turned it on entered my wifi password and bam my account was set up in less than 1 minute.8. Shipping it was here in 1 day for 3.99 how can you beat that ?9. Amazon eco-system good stuff period I have always been a huge fan !10. Did I mention there is no blue or purple border light :)11. So to sum up my thoughts on my new Kindle HDX is this,, OUTSTANDING & I would recommend buying it over an I PAD for PRICE (value) the I PAD mini does not offer a 64 gb model and the 16 gb 4g mini cost  $429 which is 5 bucks more than I paid for my maxed out Kindle AND the 64 gb 4g I PAD air is $ 829 !!!!!! Yea thats right $ 829 !!!!!! LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear & rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border !!!!Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device & Merry Christmas to all !!!!!! ;)ps what is the best screen covers & case to get ???On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker !!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shocked by how bad this Kindle is", "Author": "alana", "ReviewID": "R13VX6O3LRMI2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this tablet.  I love the variety and price of books available in the Kindle store, so I thought I would step out of my Apple cocoon and try a Kindle Fire for an e-reader.  I was so excited, but within 1 HOUR of owning the Kindle HDX, I quickly became really, REALLY bummed with it and decided to return it right away.  For the price, you would think you would get a decent quality tablet, but there were some major red flags right away.I will start with the GOOD news first (and the only reason why I give this item 1 star):- The MayDay feature is amazing.  GREAT job by Amazon on this one!  The tech supporters were friendly, helpful, and excellent with customer service.  I used this feature a couple times, and each time a tech person responded in about 10 seconds.  Obviously, as more Kindle HDXs are sold, and the tech department gets busier, they will be slower in their response time, but that's fine!  It's such a great feature, that it's worth waiting 20 min for.  Even though I was ultimately disappointed with the Kindle HDX, I was really impressed with the tech support available.  This is one major feature missing from Apple.Now, for the BAD news:- Froze 3 times on me in about ONE hour.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't download anything on there except for a couple books, so there's no real reason for the damn device to keep freezing on me.  That's the biggest red flag for me with this device.  One hour in, and the damn thing keeps freezing, so I can imagine how much worse it's going to get as the device gets older and I download more things.- Kept getting error messages when the device would automatically update after turning it on.  First of all, I don't want it to automatically update when I turn it on, but I guess there's no way around it.  And to top it off, brand new and it's not even updating correctly?  C'mon Amazon!- Apps wouldn't come up correctly after it froze and turned back on.  So after the device kept freezing and I turned it back on (3 times), on the main page where you can see the big books, apps, etc... that you can scroll through, the pictures of the apps wouldn't show up.  It just came up as gray boxes with the Amazon \"box\" logo on it.  Again, I shouldn't be having these type of basic loading issues one hour after opening the box.- There is NO WAY to create \"collections\" in your books library.  Say what???  I've been reading my Kindle books on my iPhone through the Kindle App, and I'm able to organize my books into collections.  But the Kindle Fire doesn't allow me to do this?  This is the most asinine thing I've ever come across!  You'd think that you'd get more features through a Kindle Fire than you would on the Kindle App for a different company's device.  Using MayDay, I talked to a tech who confirmed that yes, you can't organize your collection on the Kindle Fire, but that there were other third party apps that let you do this.  She also said that maybe, with the new software update coming in November, the Kindle Fire may include this feature, but it's a \"maybe\".  I'm sorry, but this is a huge no-no for me if a company can't get their s*** together enough to offer basic organization of your library on their own device, when it's a feature already available in an app for a different company's device.  I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm just so shocked that they can't even get this kind of basic necessity worked out...- THE WORST PART FOR LAST: the BLUE HUE around the edge of the screen.  I read a lot of reviews about how horrible this is, and I thought that I would still give it a try.  I thought that maybe the blue hue isn't visible when you change to the \"sepia\" tone for books.  Um.  Yeah... No, it is still very visible, and it is as annoying as everyone else made it out to be.  I can't concentrate on reading anything bc my eyes kept looking over at the blue hue.  My eyes unconsciously kept floating over to it like a mosquito to a bug zapper.  While I was trying to read, I caught myself thinking, \"wow, that blue hue is ridiculous, it's really visible, how horrible, I can't stop staring at it... so weird...\"  When buying an Amazon Kindle product, I expected a seamless and easy screen to read off of, and this totally FAILED.  So again, when I talked to a tech rep about it, she kept saying that the blue hue is \"completely normal.\"  Um, no.  I spent $250 for the device (without \"special\" promotions) and as the client, I will tell you what I think \"normal\" is.  Trust me when I say that the blue hue is NOT IN ANY WAY \"NORMAL\".  I know this is what she's trained to say, but I felt like Amazon was just trying to CON me. LIKE INSISTING THAT I'M EATING CHICKEN WHEN I HAVE THE SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT I'M EATING CAT.  After looking at countless of different types of computer/device screens, we are intelligent enough consumers to know what is a \"normal\" screen and what isn't.  A blue hue around the edge of a device does not feel \"normal\".  Amazon should seriously listen to all the reviewers' comments about how bad this screen is and just apologize instead of trying to tell us that it's \"NORMAL\".SO - after all these problems within one hour of using the device, I have decided to return to my Apple cocoon and buy an IPad Mini.  Yes, it's much more expensive, but in my opinion, it makes no sense to pay $250 bucks for a device that has so many problems that make it unusable when you can spend an extra $150 more and get SO MUCH MORE that works BEAUTIFULLY.  Sorry Amazon, but you completely failed on this one.  Please listen to your customers' complaints about this device.  We are especially right about the screen - it's HORRIBLE.  Stop telling us that it's \"normal.\"", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue Edges and Yellow Tone Very Distracting", "Author": "S.

This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time. Also, a lot of apps have videos, and netflix ends up being an app, so the line between apps & videos is blurred anyway.If you are a parent who thinks this will make managing time with electronics easier, think again.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazon has outdone themselves!", "Author": "wanda", "ReviewID": "RBJ4GF80COQYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third KF - I had the first and second versions of the non HD Fire.This new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is simply amazing. I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle. You won't regret your purchase!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Purchase, Fully Recommend", "Author": "I Shop Too Much", "ReviewID": "R2QJ79PRC99V0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first glance the Kindle Fire HDX is everything I had wanted, not to say that it still is not what I wanted...mostly.The Kindle Fire HDX earns a stable 4/5 stars, if it were out of ten however; it'd be a clear 7/10.*Device & Apps*The device itself is fantastic, the speed of the Linux OS mixed with the 2.2 GHz quad-processor really does make this the fastest 7\" tablet I've seen, there is no doubt about it.  In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.  Just because the one was bad, DOES NOT mean that the tablet itself isn't worth getting.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now Great For Web Browsing!

Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.  If I have any future questions about the device, I will not hesitate to use the Mayday feature.All in all, it is amazing to me that you can buy a quad core, high def, touch screen tablet like this for $229.

I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

I am convinced it caused my first Kindle Fire HDX to lose its ability to start up.  I attempted to side-load my music again to the new replacement tablet and it almost stopped responding as well.  Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!). I'm hoping the soon-to-be release helps with this.I appreciate many of the features of the new machine, but Amazon giveth and taketh away.

If the next replacement is also bad, I will give up until Amazon fixes this issue.Follow-up: I recently received an email from Amazon telling me that the blue/purple light is normal and makes the screen nicer. This is a silly answer as it disrupts the experience so badly and makes reading on the device nearly impossible. This is the same type of shenanigans Amazon pulled with the Paperwhite. An obvious defect becomes something they intended. Don't believe it. I have never seen a tablet (or almost any other device) where you can see the backlight around the edges. If Amazon wants to challenge me on this, I will gladly post pictures of my Fire HD and HDX side by side to show just how much this answer makes zero sense. This is a defect not a feature.

The Nexus 7 (2013) has a slower processor 1.5 GHz Quad Core to the Kindle Fire HDX 2.2 GHz Quad Core. This is the only reason I am rating this product with a 3 star rating.The sound is great but in a side by side comparison to the Nexus 7, the Nexus 7 has a bigger and crisper sound, but in all honesty not much of a difference. It may be a matter of preference.A lot of technology blogs are giving the Kindle Fire HDX a better rating for the screen quality but with the brightness settings set at max. The Nexus 7 (2013) has a much brighter and cooler picture than the Kindle Fire HDX. (Again a matter of preference both 1080p displays).The HDX only has one front facing camera compared to the Nexus 7 which has two. Albeit the front facing camera snaps great images, the Nexus 7 has two equally great cameras in the front and back.The battery life is a better than the Nexus 7 but both lasted around three days with average use.I also find myself fumbling to find the power and volume buttons. The buttons are placed on the back of the Kindle HDX and more often than not I have to rotate the tablet a couple of times to locate the power button.Another thing I just cannot get over is the Special Offers version 16 GB model. Everytime I turn on the device an Advertisement for some random Amazon product greets me. I find this a bit annoying. As a huge advocate of online privacy, I do not like this type of marketing scheme especially for the price of $230. The Nexus 7 (2013) costs exactly $230 without ads or added bloatware. I have actually seen deeper holiday discounts on the Nexus 7 (2013) than the Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased my Nexus 7 last week at Staples for $180. Similar discounts are available with a quick search of DealNews.com or Slickdeals.com.The Amazon App Store is lacking many products that a college student like I use on a day to day basis. For example: Skydrive, Black Board Learn, Gmail, Youtube, Falcon Pro (Twitter client), and Outlook 360. (This is not Amazon's fault its up to developers)Comparing the Accessories for both tablets. Amazon seems to have a monopoly on the cases because I was not able to find cheap cases for the Kindle Fire HDX. Ebay and Amazon have excellent hard ergonomic covers for the Nexus 7 for less than $10. Amazon is selling a case for its Fire HDX for $50. The cheapest case I could find for it was $20 from Belkin and that product did not really protect it.In closing the Kindle Fire HDX is not worth the price of $230. The one thing is has going for it is the actual Kindle side of it. I read Mockingjay on it and enjoyed holding the device in my hand. It is light enough that your hand never gets tired of holding it. I will return this item and exchange for a lower version of the Kindle family that is strictly for reading.In comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) default reading apps, i was able to read ebooks easier on the Kindle Fire but PDF's were much easier to read on the Nexus 7 which now uses QuickOffice as an out of the box reader. The QuickOffice app had more settings to adjust large PDF files and customize the text color and background. I was amazed the Kindle Fire did not have these options available. As any college student will tell you, professors are out of their minds and assign scholarly articles from JSTOR or Google Scholar that are 30 to 50 pages in length.

Once I do finally get it to pick it up, every time I turn it off or it goes to sleep, it loses the network and I have to fiddle all over again. I have a degree in computer networking, so I do know a bit about this stuff, and this just isn't the way it should work! When the network is detected, no matter how many bars are showing, download speed lags significantly behind my old Kindle Fire. I did a comparison last night. I got 32 songs (the same 32 songs from my Amazon account) downloaded on my old Kindle Fire in the time it took for one song to download on the HDX.The battery life per charge is not as advertised, and the battery itself it often quite hot to the touch. I've worked with the 'Mayday' tech (she was so nice and tried her best) but the best she could do was tell me to do a factory reset and she'll call me next week to see how it's going. I think I'm going to insist this one be replaced as well. Can't tell you how many hours I've wasted getting HDX's set up to have it all wiped out again. If I were you...I'd wait until they get a better handle on this one.

I already own an iPad 3, an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro. So it only made sense that I come full circle and buy the mini when I needed a smaller more portable tablet. However, while shopping around, the Kindle Fire HDX won me over.I normally breakdown the good, bad, and the ugly of the products I review. But there's really nothing bad nor ugly about the Kindle Fire HDX. So I've settled for good and not so good...GOOD~ It's affordable. I purchased this using my Amazon store card and received $50 off from their promotion. So for $179, it's $220 cheaper than its rival, the iPad Mini w/ Retina display.~ The images are clear and the colors are vivid. My husband even thinks the screen quality is better than the iPad.~ It's incredibly light. When I unboxed it, I immediately lost myself in a book for a good 3 hours. And there was no hand strain from holding the Kindle up to read for that long.~ I can buy books from Amazon directly from the books section. With the iPad, I had to go Safari, log in to Amazon, buy the book, log back out, then go back to the Kindle app before I can read the book I want.~ I finally get to take advantage of my (1) free book a month for being a Prime member.~ The silk browser is fast and the browsing experience is noticeably smooth.~ I can switch between reading and listening to the book's narration without exiting the books section.~ A ton of apps to choose from. Having used the iOS platform for so long, I was a tad concern that there won't be enough apps for the Kindle. But I was wrong.~ Very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. If my 3-year old can navigate through the HDX with ease, then so can you.~ Decent battery life. My kids and I put the HDX through the paces when I first unboxed it. And after watching a ton of YouTube videos, reading half a book, browsing through several web pages, and listening to an audiobook, the HDX stayed alive for a good 10 hours.~ MAYDAY BUTTON! This sealed the deal for me. A 24-hour customer support rep directly on your Kindle HDX with just a touch of a button. I mean c'mon, this feature blows Siri completely out of the water.NOT SO GOOD:~ The speakers are not as loud as I'm used to. In some cases it even sounded a bit muffled. But when using headphones, the sound is loud and clear.~ The front camera's quality is not so good. It's grainy. But since I won't be using this for video chats or taking pictures, it's not a big deal.~ The app store is not secure. While my daughter was using the HDX, I got an email thanking me for an app I purchased. Good thing she chose a free app. I have yet to figure out if I can set a password every time someone tries to purchase an app. This feature is available on the iPad, not sure if it too is available on the HDX.~ In the first 48 hours that I had the HDX, my wireless connection would automatically disconnect when the HDX is not in use. So every time I tried to use it I had to log back in to the network and establish a connection. After a few times of doing this I finally got tired and hit the Mayday Button. The Amazon rep was so patient and helpful. We finally fixed the issue, I only needed to modify my router's proxy settings.VERDICT:~ BUY IT! If you're torn between this or the iPad Mini, I highly suggest giving the Kindle Fire HDX a try. For the amount of money you'll be spending, you'll get more value for your dollars with the Kindle.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "RETURNED IT FINALLY. SAD BUT TRUE", "Author": "Marilyn Armstrong", "ReviewID": "R17WEBSQEGQOZ2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon launched the new generation of Kindles at the end of September 2013. I spent time perusing these latest greatest Kindles. They were supposed to be pretty much the same as the Fire HD, but with better graphics, battery and sound. A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7\u2033 tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said \"That's it, I'm done.\" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this. Unless you plan to use it plugged in, charge it after every use ... nope. Doesn't live up to its PR or its predecessor.Sorry, Amazon.

This HDX has a very clear, sharp screen. I haven't seen the new iPad mini with retina but I can't justify spending almost twice as much for it.So far, here are the two negatives about the tablet:1. Mine was shipped with a usb cable and power adapter. However, when I plugged it in using the supplied cable and adapter my tablet displayed a message about using a low powered power supply. It charges very slowly. Every other tablet I've owned came with a 2amp adapter for optimized charging. Why did Amazon bother to include a 1amp charger?2. Not all Prime videos are downloadable. This was the big reason I finally bought a Fire and I was disappointed to find that many titles, especially the more popular  titles, were not available for download.If you are planning to download multiple Prime videos, I suggest upgrading to a 32 GB or bigger.

But I am frustrated with a lot of issues:1. I bought this along with Amazon's Origami case which automatically wakes up when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when you close the cover. However, the device goes to sleep shortly after I open the cover and fold it back! I think the sensors are somehow detecting that the cover got closed when in reality it is not! This is really very frustrating. I don't know how Amazon could sell the cover without properly testing it with the device. I guess a firmware fix is possible and I really want Amazon to fix this.2. The accelerometer sensor is not properly calibrated. Even the slightest tilt will make the display go from portrait to landscape mode or vice versa. Again not a good user experience. I have used iPhones and iPads and I really like the way the accelerometer works on those devices. A firmware fix should be possible for this too.3. The automatic brightness control setting is useless. Again the sensor seems to be too sensitive. Even though I hold the device without any movement and under a constant light setting, the brightness continuously kept changing. You just cannot use the device when the display continuously flickers.4. I configured the email app to only manually fetch the mail. When I open the app and check for mail, it consistently fails on the first attempt. You always have to retry to fetch the mail. Need a fix for this too.5. Many other issues like Silk browser not connecting to websites sporadically, unable to connect to WiFi randomly (my iPhone at the same time connects perfectly fine).6. Amazon has been slow to get the apps in the app store updated to take advantage of the high resolution display. Many of the popular apps that I downloaded still had low resolution.7. The latest software update has deteriorated battery life. Previously the battery used to drop by only 6% during the night while in standby mode. After the update, it drops by 17% for no reason!All in all, this is just a tablet that aspires to be in the top league but fails to do so.

My expectations were for smooth web browsing, Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming, movie playback (Handbrake encoded), and reading news/books.I have not been disappointed. The Silk browser works well, no issues so far. The screen has excellent picture quality. Netflix and Prime stream perfectly and look sharp. Handbrake encodes are sharp and play with no issues, at either 720 or 1080p. Feedly app works ok, and of course reading books works perfectly. I had seen some reports that there is a blue glow around the edge of the screen that people found distracting. On my particular screen, I can faintly see the blue glow on a white background, but it is very light and hardly noticeable. Certainly nothing that will impede my use of the product.As for the kindle itself, it feels sturdy and well-built; power and volume buttons are in good places, as are the speakers. Battery life is good so far, enough for a day's worth of surfing, movies and games. About 6 hours of mixed use (games, movie playback from kindle and streaming, web-browsing and email) over a twelve-hour period left me at 50 percent. The whole Interface is quick and responsive, no lag at all moving from menu to menu or app to app. The speakers provide a good amount of sound for a tablet, and have more than enough clarity to hear dialogue in movies or tv shows.Learning curve on use of this tablet was very quick; the few questions I had were quickly answered on Google. Everything else on the tablet was easy to figure out; the menu and home page are well-designed for finding the way to what you are looking for, and there is a decent tutorial for the basic functions. There is always the Mayday button; though I don't see myself needing it, I imagine many people will find it useful. The Amazon App Store has many more apps than most reviews would lead you to believe. Every app I use was on there and functional, and I saw most of the other popular apps available as well.

However, reading books is a major reason I have a Kindle and the blue haze around the pages is a very serious problem. I was aware of it from the reviews and hoped it would not be an issue or that it would not be noticeable.  I was wrong.  I tried the sepia background and even the black background with white letters.  The sepia did not make much of a difference and I can't see myself reading books with a black background and white letters.  So I have to decide whether to live with this major flaw in an otherwise fantastic product or return it and hope Amazon resolves the problem in the future.  I think I will probably return it because the prospect of seeing blue tinged pages on every book I read in the future on this instrument is a depressing thought.

I was hoping mine did not have this haze, after opening up my new unit, it again had the blue haze around the border. Very unhappy. Although the haze was not a dark and fuzzy on the new one it still is annoying. I re-read some of the reviews again what concerns me is some people are stating their device is fine and has no blue haze. I want one! I reached out to a customer service rep and made another compliant and the rep was super nice and stated she was sorry. She is going to put in a claim for me and call me back about the issue and about getting me another replacement. I almost don't want to bother because it seems like I won't win. She did tell me this was normal and the blue haze is suppose to be there but it should be very faint and not to noticeable, that the paperwhite has the same thing. She also said it's because they used blue LED lights and not white LED lights. This is suppose to really make the picture look amazing. I agree the picture is awesome and I love it, but while reading this blue light really bugs my eyes out. Is it a defeat or really normal? I don't know what to believe.

I called and the tech told me that the battery did last almost 10 hours so what was the issue, really? No one used it all day, that battery should have been 100%. I looked more into the issue and after talking with another Rep they said that I have to turn the WiFi off every time I am not using it. This seem to be so ridiculous, I have never had to turn WIFI off  with any other tablet. My husband has an Ipad Mini and his charge was at 88% after a few hours of actually using it.

I am just sad at this inconvenience and was wishing for 1 day shipping or a credit to the app store....I mean this is why im a prime member after all (hehe :-))On a last note I got the 64GB fire and Im glad I did.  Downloading HD content takes up ALOT of space OK a 48min episode of Intervention takes up a little over 3GB.  Thankfully there's multiple downloading options that could make the great HD 3GB video into a fine 720 experience making this same file at around 1GB.My advise...  1) Wait for another promotion Christmas is around  the bend and I would be surprised if they don't offer  another 15% day.  2) Splurge on the highest storage that you will need (compared to apples storage upgrade cost 599 for a 64GB mini Ipad when after tax mine was 278 with the 15% discount ($356 difference including sales tax)  3) If you have rewards with a Credit card use them (makes me feel better when making purchases like these with \"free money\"  4) Pretty much accept the fact that for the next week or two after you receive your kindle (If its not a dud) your mind will be blown and you will have no life other than with your new fireThat's all for now....and that's my 2 cents...if your on the fence try it...with amazon prime its AMAZINGoh and I forgot #5)...If you cant stop drinking the apple juice why bother buying the hxd and then posting a 1 star review because its not an ipad...its meant to be a media device and really excels at this...seriously if you fit into this category Stop it, its annoying and that's being really kind at bestHave fun, be kind and enjoy life :-)", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, Not So Great An E-Reader", "Author": "Makeever \"mackeever\"", "ReviewID": "R15B5Y73FOZHTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In comparing this to my 2012 Kindle Fire HD: it's a much faster and better tablet, but I was disappointed in the e-reader.

I have been a happy user of just about every iteration of the Kindle family since the very 1st Kindle Keyboard. This is the first time that I have been unhappy with my purchase.I traded in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 in order to \"upgrade\" to this model only to learn that the key feature that made me love the Kindle Fire so much has been removed by Amazon. Previously, you had the option to enable text to speech within just about any Kindle Book. It was quite convenient to click on the \"play\" button while in a book and hear the device read to you as your eyes move down the page. Quite an immersive experience! To take it a step further, you had the option to purchase the professionally narrated audio book (if available for the title) and take the experience to a whole 'nother level. Now, the only option is to purchase the audiobook to enjoy the same functionality. In the interest of full disclosure, with the HDX, you have the ability to turn on text to speech from the system settings, but then the Kindle reads EVERYTHING that displays on any screen, meaning websites, menu settings, etc. That is extremely annoying!One other thing that really bothered me was the screen issue that many are reporting. The entire edge of the screen was brighter than the rest making for a distracting reading experience when in a book.I ended up returning the HDX and buying another HD 8.9.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "don't buy it", "Author": "Ian Eppard", "ReviewID": "R3HGXQS0IC3YZ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The commercial says all this stuff about how it's better than the iPad air.

Faster, smoother and better than earlier versions", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "RALWCKMXLE1DZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Each generation of the Kindle Fire 7\" tablet gets better than the previous iteration, and this one is no exception. It is not revolutionary, the way that the 1st generation Kindle Fire was when it was introduced in September 2011, but it's a great example of good product evolution.Picked up the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" during one of the December promotions after seeing the 'Try Risk Free' sidebars on the product page. Within the first day, knew that it wasn't going back, as it has exceeded my subjective expectations. Mine is the Wi-Fi version with 16GB memory, and I picked this one based on prior experience with earlier versions. Right out of the box it was easy to see that the engineers had done their homework and listened to the users of the prior models. As an owner of the first generation Kindle Fire and then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablets, it becomes quickly apparent that this one has most of the features we have been looking for since the first models.This will be a detailed review, so for those who just want the key points, will list them followed by a more in-depth look:\u25c6 Likes:+ Excellent 7\" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10\u00bd ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences\u25c6 On the Fence:\u00b1 Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to\u25c6 Dislikes:- None encountered\u25c6 Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7\" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10\u00bd ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.\u25c6 In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.\u25c6 Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.\u25c6 Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.\u25c6 Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.\u25c6 Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW \u25aa 12/31/2013", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service Experience of My Life", "Author": "Jeffrey hubbard", "ReviewID": "R3DY6GOGW9WK5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After spending the extra money on 2 day shipping and being assured by the customer service rep that the product will arrive in two days I ordered the product... flash forward to five days later the product finally arrived, but that is where my real troubles began. The kindle refused to turn on when I hit the power button so I held the power button nothing. I tapped the power button a couple times not response I held it again, so on and so forth for about 5 minutes until it sprang to life and relief flooded across my body. This relief was short lived through because only 10 minutes into having the product on after going through all of the initial set up the screen went blank. I called up kindle support and was transferred around about 3 times before I found someone remotely competent. They went through some steps and determined that my brand new out of the box Kindle was broken already! they said they were going to express ship the product. When the shipping information appeared on my account it said that it would be shipped in 4 business days, I don't know about you but 4 days is about double what should be considered express shipping. But I patiently waited, on the 4th day when it hadn't arrived I called the shipping company and they explained the estimate was wrong and it will be taking 5 business days to receive the product which just added to my excitement. When the product finally arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it turned on much more easily. Well pleasantly surprised until I tried to register my device. When I tried it would not let me register it, yet again I wade neck deep into the sea of incompetence that is Amazon customer service to find out that because they do not know how to properly ship a product and it took longer than 2 days to be received they went out and on their own reported it lost or stolen which is essence bricked my kindle. the process of reversing the problem took over an hour and was the worst hassle on the phone I have ever had.

I was bored of Apple (I have an iPhone and MacBook that I love but still...) and I didn't want just a tiny computer. I wanted something that was an entity all on its own. Something that could do it all but in a new fun way. My main requirements: camera, good price, and toddler friendly. I liked that the kindle fire hdx not only met all my requirements but far exceeded them also. It has FreeTime for kids which is well worth it alone, my daughter has unlimited instant access to hundreds of books, videos, and games with her favorite characters. You can get a subscription (4.99/month for one child 9.99 for a family) or just set up the child's own profile and fill it with the plenty of free kids apps available. I love that it's an android operating system. The apps are everything I need, yeah it's not hooked up with Google play or anything but I haven't found that to be a problem. Every app I wanted and am used to using on my iPhone is still available and all of my daughter's favorite apps are still here too. The picture and clarity of the screen is amazing and I found it to be much nicer than any of the other tablets I looked at. It has a great design, easy to hold for both adult and child, the sound is clear and great, it's super fast, I enjoy the silk browser, it is easy to use (if you are familiar with modern technology), we have been using it like crazy for a week now and there's isn't a single fault we can find. My husband can't even believe how great the graphics are. I am thrilled with my purchase and couldn't be happier. I also love that it's Amazon, a company I trust, and provides easy access to anything I want to do. There's also an app that connects to your local library early so you can \"borrow\" books directly onto your kindle. Kindle is also a major name so everything already (for the most part) has kindle compatibility. I really can't say it enough: I love our kindle. It's perfect and amazing and just what I wanted.

Besides, I have all of my bookmarks and notes that I haven't learned how to transfer to the Fire HDX. We chose the 7\" size because it's easier to carry in a purse or pocket. Keep in mind that the screen takes up the whole dimension, so it's a larger screen than the Kindle that has the keyboard at the bottom. It's really easy to read. We had our Kindle Fire in the car the other day and needed to look up a contact. That's when I discovered that it's like trying to read my phone's screen in the sunlight. Impossible. So I ordered anti-glare screen protectors. I hope that takes care of the glare. While we do love the Kindle Fire KDX Wi-Fi, I've noticed some problems that maybe aren't a problem to others. I had my Fire with me at church and wanted to jot down on my calendar something that I need to do on a date coming up in a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a Calendar icon, so I opened it to the date I wanted and discovered it wouldn't let me type my note. Why would it be necessary to have the calendar linked to the Internet if I don't care a thing about synchronizing it with my computer? I just wanted a nice little place to jot down the date of something. We don't use smart phones so I didn't think about this sync thing. I guess I just want something simple and old fashioned. At any rate, I had to wait a couple of hours until I got home and could link to the Internet simply to type my note on the calendar.Since this is high definition I was kind of excited when I saw the camera icon. I figured I'd get much nicer pictures than on my 7 year old digital camera. So I clicked on camera and saw myself. I read directions to see how I change the camera to showing what a regular view finder would see and had to chuckle when I found out it's just a one-way camera. Therefore, I took a picture of my Christmas tree by turning my back to the tree and holding the Fire over my shoulder so I could see what it saw. I got a good picture, but that's an awkward way to take a picture. So I guess I won't be using it for much more than Skyping.Things we love about the Kindle Fire HDX: the special offers (which I thought would be annoying) only show up when the device is off, so you don't have to interrupted by pop-ups. Wonderful! It's like the pictures you see on the old Kindle when it's off, only it is advertising instead of pictures of famous authors. It's quicker to manipulate between items. For instance, if you are reading the Sunday School lesson and want to go to a scripture reference, it's just a click away, then an arrow click back to where you were. It's faster to move between pages, chapters, etc. with a swipe of the fingers rather than clicking the page buttons on the old Kindle. (But we still love our old Kindles and will not be getting rid of them anytime soon). We love the bright picture and the fact that it can be read in low light (unlike the old Kindle which has no backlight). The high definition is really pleasing to the eye.We haven't tried Mayday yet, but from the commercials that feature appears to be a real boon to people who are not truly tech savvy (like we're not). I think this is a gadget everyone can find a good reason to own as it is much cheaper than an IPad and most other tablets. It looks great and works intuitively. Everything that's really important to us (and the reason we wanted it) is downloaded onto the device, making it unnecessary to be online away from home. The only thing that might have been nice and could be the reason we may someday opt for smart phones is that we can't use a barcode feature whereby you can skip printing a coupon and instead have the barcode on your device for the restaurant or store to scan.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "An electronic product for all ages", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3CZU05PRY4IVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Kindle reader 2nd generation to the HDX 7 - I truly enjoyed and used my kindle reader.

To me this is a item I will use everyday.  Also a piece of information you can run the battery to 0 with perfect play before it stops.

My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5. Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST. My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro. This Kindle Fire HDX is the first kindle I've owned personally, although I've gotten to borrow Kindles from others (originals and Paperwhite). This is, to date, the BEST tablet I've ever used. It's fast, responsive and never seems to drop the connection. I haven't gotten to use a 3G feature yet, but this tablet finds a WiFi connection where my Surface Pro, other tablets and even my powerful laptops can't get it.It's got great apps, the screen is stunning (looks better than the last iPad Air or Surface Pro 2), and its drop test rating is one of the better ones. Plus, I understand that Amazon is now offering an interest-free payment plan for the HDX.

After reading so many unsatisfied reviews, I was quite skeptical about its operation.  Well, was I ever surprised!  The Kindle arrived perfectly boxed and in great condition.  Set-up was as easy as pie; no trouble connecting to wifi; in fact, no trouble at all.  I am a 71-year old great grandmother who has absolutely NO experience with a Kindle.  So, if I can do it, so can you.  I am a voracious reader and was anxious to see the \"blue haze\" so many people talked about.  Personally, I cannot understand the complaints.  Yes, there is a very faint blue border, but not enough to bother mentioning (to me).  I am absolutely astounded at what this device is capable of.  I spent several hours experimenting and I realize there will be a learning curve, but I'm having fun with it.  I've used a Nook for the last two years and have slowly grown discontented with its performance.  When placed side-by-side, the Kindle wins in weight, brightness, speed and features.  I look forward to many happy hours with my new \"playmate.\"  Did I mention how great the colors are and how vivid the videos?

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage. Hope that was helpful! It might've been common knowledge, but I would not know, as this is my 1st tablet ever, as mentioned previously.To use miracast for your Kindle Fire HDX and television, I recommend:NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000)B00904JILO", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prime video download a joke", "Author": "Patriot1", "ReviewID": "R3MLJ9YWG0SFQP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the HDX for three reasons.

I had qualms about trading it in to purchase the new Fire HDX 7, but wanted the extended battery life offered.The HDX is beautiful, fast, and functions beyond expectations in all features, except, as an e-reader. I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support. First, the good: brilliant color, speed, much improved speakers, and the button placement is ideal for on/off and volume. \"Mr. Hyde\" appears in the reading, at least on my device, in a slowly-advancing glowing blue border! I know- the notice has gone out that this is \"normal\" and part of the advancement in true color display, but my device border is irregular, blotchy, and prevents any enjoyment of reading despite adjustments of brightness, font, etc.Amazon customer support is stellar, but I've had some difficulty conveying the fact that this display is unacceptable. Past experience with support has been very positive, so I won't let Jekyl and Hyde dissuade me.More to come....**10/30/13 Kindle support consented to sending a replacement. This second HDX does not have the unevenly lit border, but is \"shadowy\" even with the sepia background, which I find easier on the eyes. The HDX doesn't come close to the reading experience of the Fire HD that I traded in, but I'll live with this because any other e-readers I've tested have backlit displays that are far worse!I would advise you keep your Fire HDs if you enjoy reading. So, \"Happy Halloween, Mr. Hyde!\"***02/06/14 A major drawback has emerged: rebooting before connecting to wi-fi. Check the forum for this because scores of owners are waiting for a fix for this.

My first tablet was an iPad 1st gen. I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down. Since then I've owned the following: Google Nexus 7 (original), Amazon Kindle Fire (original), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\", Motorola Xoom (original), HP TouchPad (WebOS fire sale), PanDigital Novel 7, few generic Chinese eBay (all of which sucked BTW), Barnes & Nobel Nook HD+ (still have, gave it to my mom when I ordered the HDX) & now the just released Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 32GB.Honestly I didn't know what too expect with the HDX, all the specs were awesome & it's kicking serious butt against the Nexus 7 (2013) in various benchmarks, but I was still kinda nervous. I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience. I haven't figured out how the HDX pulls this off, but the sound is phenomenal.You definitely notice the quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, as this thing flies!Amazon's re-built from the ground up newly minted Fire OS 3.0, is a work of art. It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime. You can easily find anything & everything you may be looking for.Amazon's app store is rapidly catching up to Google Play & I have been able to find all the apps I use from the Google Play store.The integrated apps, such as e-mail, calendar etc. was surprisingly easy to setup with my Gmail & Google Calendar.Amazon has most definitely hit a massive homerun with the HDX line. Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX. And YES, the HDX really does have the best & highest quality HD display currently available.After seeing what the Snapdragon 800 CPU & Adreno 330 GPU are capable of, I now see why Google is using both in the upcoming Nexus 5.

I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.

She didn't understand a word of English, she made me go through her checklist of trouble shooting, even though she had a record of me speaking with tech service. She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working! She only sent me the shipping label because I got angry at her for spending so long on the phone with me and we were getting nowhere.Amazon sent me a new kindle.

I tried to sync documents to my kindle and I followed the website's directions, downloaded the android transfer app to move the documents from my computer. Nothing happened. I called tech service and the first thing the guy tells me is that the kindle doesn't use android. Why would amazon link the android download to their kindle support page if kindle doesn't support it.

It arrived a day ahead of time and there were no issues with the packaging or turning it on for initial boot up. After using it daily for 4-days I have encountered some issues with the device.

Movies, print, and pictures are very impressive.Speakers are impressive, a near surround sound experience when watching movies.Easy to consume Amazon products.Con'sApps, their are not many apps available.Apps locked up several times requiring a complete reboot of the device.Kindle Free Time has a very limited selection and does not feel justified for the price.Regarding applications failure. I loaded several language learning applications from the app store, Babbel, Duolingo, Learn French Deluxe, and Busuu. They ALL eventually locked up and required a reboot. The device appeared to completely lock up and I held the power button down for quite some time.ConclusionThe Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a great device if you plan to only consume Amazon products. It has some room to mature here, such as more intuitive searching for products on amazon.com. But I would grant this device a 4-5 stars for that experience.Regarding apps, it was only a 2 star rating. Smart devices are all about consuming any type of content on demand. With the several different apps failing the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB is not yet there.

No unnecessary features attached to the browser. Just bookmarks, HD video, and fast surfing.Videos/Audio/Apps:The Kindle Fire HDX has a Dolby Digital Plus audio engine which allows for the device to separate the background noises from the person speaking or the music. At full volume, I find this hard. But, with the speaker placement on the top of the device, sound is very clear and loud, even with a case. And with a 1920x1280 resolution at 323 pixels per inch, this is right below the Apple iPad Mini 2 at 324 ppi. But, chances are you will not even notice it. Graphics are amazing for games like Asphalt 8. Downloads for videos and movies do not take an hour, unlike my iPod Touch 4. Yes, the Amazon store may be small, but it has its share of cool apps, including Skype built in (on the Cloud; I'm getting there)Amazon Cloud:Ah yes, the Amazon Cloud. Lets say you bought a load of books on your Kindle Paperwhite. Already on your Kindle Fire. You just have to click on \"Books\", download it (which takes a small amount of time) and there: you got your book onto your Kindle Fire HDX.Same for apps and all that stuff. When you get on your Kindle, you already have Skype, Yelp, iMBD and the Oxford Dictionary. Just have to download and you have Skype on your HDX. You have free, automatic and unlimited cloud storage. iCloud can only claim free cloud storage of up to 5 GB. There is also Amazon Cloud Player, which means you get to listen to your Amazon music on your computer.Special Offers:Not disturbing but helpful. I find myself using these for app deals and videos on Prime and stuff like that. Yeah. It is not intrusive or boring mostly. But it is something I would NOT spend money to remove.Home Screen Layout:With the carousel and the drag down screen thingy, I find it helpful for display but not much else. I like the organization at the top with categories such as \"Books\", \"Apps\", and \"Games\".Customer Service:I like the immediate protection of May day but have not used it. The service on Amazon.com is very helpful in fixing my Kindle Fire. By the way, if your kindle ever gets frozen, just hold the power button for 20s and the Kindle automatically turns off. No important info is lost.Reported Problems:The blue haze \"problem\" is present, but it does not affect me at all in a bad way. When I see it, I find it hilarious and just keep playing/watching. For all the people hating it, DEAL WITH IT.Buttons are on the side, but you just have to feel around for them.Charging is slow with the USB, so Amazon recommends the PowerFast charger.Apps crash a lot: Watch out. Just a minor problem.I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING: Buy the 32 or 64 GB version (5.32 GB is used by the device already) with WiFi- adding 4G LTE is +$100 to the price and Special Offers included.

I have not been able to do so or find an easy way to do it that would always sync without having to manually input one at a time. The emails all sync without any problems (@mac, @comcast, & @gmail) but I still have to get use to the Kindle email and play with it some more before I'm really comfortable.The Amazon Prime membership is the way to go, I actually cancelled my Netflix and saved $100.00 a year.

While the Kindle HDX does take pictures and videos, you have to turn the screen away from you to do so...which makes things a little difficult.  It appears that the primary reason for the camera is for using Skype.  Also, one thing that would have been helpful is for a PDF version of a FULL instruction manual to be downloaded right on the Kindle desktop.  As it is now, you have to go online and read through a list topics to try and find answers to questions....or use the Mayday Button.  There is a PDF manual online, but it is only a Quick Start manual.  So, there are many new features that the new HDX has, that we are actually discovering by way of the TV commercials for the Kindle HDX.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Front Facing Camera", "Author": "SLC \"SLC\"", "ReviewID": "R3I1VMT9JJ6K45", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would never have thought to check if it had a front facing camera, my ancient flip phone had one.

I wanted to experience Android - and this Kindle is Android with Amazon's \"skin\" on top.  I considered a Nexus 7, but customer feedback worried me about it being possibly too fragile.  Price on the Kindle HDX was hard to beat - and the features -screen, and CPU and memory are front-line.What prompted me to write a review?  I bought the Kindle 16GB, WIFI only version- and have been using it about 4 weeks. Tonight I set my 4G iPhone up as a Personal Hotspot - and hooked up my Kindle to the Internet, using the Apple iPhone's WIFI broadcast.  Speedtest showed the Kindle at 5.79 Mbps download, and 10.57 Mbps upload -I was very surprised at the speed it achieved and that upload measured faster down download!Tonight, I also started Pandora, and synced the Kindle to a little bluetooth wireless speaker, and got some great sound.  The Kindle's internal speakers are good on their own (and 2x better than the Nexus 7 if you listen to them side-by-side).  I've found all of the apps I've wanted (Evernote, myfitnesspal, flipboard, feedly, skydrive, zillow, lastpass, and others in the Amazon store -I also sideloaded a couple of apps, a virus checker and maybe 3 or 4 other apps - can't remember which ones right now).  Tried Google Chrome on the Kindle, and I find that it really isn't any more stable (in my experience) than is Silk.  Synced all of my e-mail contacts in from Google to my Kindle Contacts app, and also synced all of my Google calendar entries (from Google/iOS) to a Kindle app called CalenGoo - which seem to be working to keep everything in sync both ways.  Photos I take with my iPhone are synced into the Kindle and can be viewed or edited, and they even show up in a subdirectory on my PC in the Amazon Cloud Drive. Music uploads into the Amazon Cloud have been difficult - only 1 music directory (artist) at a time (from iTunes) - something I haven't finished struggling with.  I agree there is a very faint, light blue border (mainly on the left and right side) on white pages.  If you look you see it, but it is barely noticeable, and to me at least, not the least bit distracting.  I just don't ever notice it to the extent that I remember it  - I just don't \"see\" it unless I go look for it. Its not a defect, just part of the screen illumination design.This review has been all over the place - but I just wanted to give people a hint of what is possible (and there is a lot more I'm sure). I've had a few small glitches  Sometimes the browser (either Silk or Chrome - seems too sensitive and wants to open any sidebar advertisement that I happen to slightly touch.  Scrolling can be either too fast, or sometimes just right.  I can't find a quick way to jump to the top of the screen as I can in iOS.

I really had a hard time choosing between Kindle and ipad. I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them. You get a PERSON in AMERICA when you hit the mayday button, and it literally takes less than 10 seconds to connect to them. It really made me think I have to get one of these for my gramma. Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to.

As a device for browsing the web, viewing movies and, most especially, reading, it is the best device I've ever tried. It is not without its failings when compared to other tablets (or even the iPhone), but overall I like it. The review that follows is more of a semi-organized narrative vs a table of pros/cons or an organized feature list with scores.Rotation (for apps that support it) is really fast and seamless. The place where rotation doesn't do what I'd expect is email; more on that below.The response time when turned on is what you'd expect. It would be nice if it was easier to stop other apps from running; even iOS 6 has a straightforward way for this (much better in iOS 7). Amazon stuck with the slow & clunky Settings/Apps/Running method that has been in Android seemingly forever. Some apps get pretty unhappy with you if you force them to stop. You can reboot for a clean start, but that makes start-up pretty slow. A pity that while keeping this Android feature they disabled some other key features (see below for Apps issue).Books and even newspapers display their text and pictures beautifully. The paging is snappy unlike my older 2nd Gen Kindle, and for speech-enabled books, the speech synthesis system is decent. I LOVE the X-Ray feature. It is not perfect, but I assume it will just keep getting better.Silk is a decent web browser, but not as smooth as its name tries to imply. It is fast, but doesn't work with some important websites; and when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. Take Google Maps for instance. The display of Google Maps just plain sucks. No doubt about it. My iPhone handles Google Maps much better (and has a Google Maps app). No, I don't plan to take my Kindle on the road as a map device, but I would like to use it instead of my iPhone when a computer isn't handy; but that is not to be. To make things worse, there is no Google Maps app in Amazon's store. And to add insult to injury, you cannot install apps from Google Play unless you root your Kindle. That just plain sucks. This takes thousands of Android apps and puts them out of your reach. Amazon already has a \"don't install from other app stores\" switch there. When I turn that off, the Kindle HDX should just work with Google Play... I do not understand why Amazon made this choice and the Kindle HDX is poorer for it.I don't have many apps installed (some that I want to install I cannot -- see note above about Google Play). Some that I did install are ill-suited to my Kindle (e.g. Audubon Birds) as they have a fixed orientation and don't understand rotation. I'll probably stick to books and movies (and newspapers), which no doubt suits Amazon just fine.On the question of e-mail: the Kindle's email support looks pretty, but is pretty non-functional for me. I have an Exchange account plus some iMAP-only accounts that I setup. The Exchange account works really well, except for the Kindle's UI (see below) and some odd configuration things. For instance, no matter how many times I changed my notification sound, the HDX insisted on playing a different one. I even tried using the MAYDAY feature to see if the support gurus could help. I got my HDX on the first day they were available, so the support gurus will still learning the device and did not offer up anything I did not know. In the end I turned off notification and rely on my iPhone to alert me.The mail UI is disappointing in that when I rotate my HDX to landscape mode to gain reading space, the HDX instead insists on showing an Outlook-like 2 pane UI. I thought there was no way to change this, until another user (thanks, Judy) pointed out that a 3-dot menu shows up when a message is selected. That menu allows you to switch to fullscreen mode while viewing the message.WORST THING OF ALL with email: The HDX would randomly mark some unviewed messages as read. This took me many, many days to figure out, and caused me to miss some time-critical messages. How do I know it's the HDX? It started after I setup my iMAP accounts on the HDX; it stopped when I deleted them (another ding vs. other devices I've used: no way to disable the account just for testing -- you must delete it or use it).It is nice that installing my Exchange mailbox brought over my contacts & calendar, though I really don't need yet another device chiming to remind me of meetings. So I use this more as a quick check when reading so I don't need to get my iPhone out.The virtual keyboard is ok, but only just ok. It isn't smart about things like automatically engaging the shift key after punctuation or on a new line (I thought I disliked that about the iPhone at times, but the HDX made me realize how handy it is -- sad that my year-old iPhone has a better typing UI than my new HDX though). The spacing makes it easier to type on than a phone, but I miss the iPhone's features (perhaps just because I've become used to them). I do like the running display of word choices that show up as I type.A general configuration gripe: why is there only 1 sound type to be configured? There are notifications for: email, apps, calendar... why just one sound? And why don't changes to that take hold? Sigh, yes it is a smaller detail but one that impacts the \"fit and finish\" of the device. It's not like Amazon hasn't shipped out a tablet-ish device before, so this disappointed me.Movies -- now this is a REALLY nice feature. The speakers on the HDX (especially with the origami cover in place -- separate review coming on that) are just ok; I'd plug a nice headset in to listen. It is very cool that you can download prime movies onto the device and go on the road with those. What I do not understand is why the HDX has no way to SEARCH for downloadable prime movies. Instead, you need to browse, movie-by-movie, to find the ones that can be downloaded. C'mon, Amazon... really?? I haven't watched a movie on my HDX yet but will on a future road trip. I just hope the battery holds up.The UI for viewing photos is marginal; there is no good way to search for, sort or group photos. You just need to scroll through them and try to spot what you want. Worse, when you copy pictures across the USB interface (yay for a USB interface -- with the display, the only other technical advantage the HDX has), the picture's creation date is tossed. The HDX sets the creation date to the date the picture was copied; I can see NO advantage to anybody except for the careless programmer who didn't have to add that feature to his or her spec. Once you find the picture you want though, the display is what you'd expect from the HDX. Again, if I really want to find a particular picture quickly, I guess I'll just go to my iPhone. I am not even sure I'll keep moving pictures to my Kindle.Music: don't use it. My iPhone syncs with iTunes and I also have an iPod. Moving all of that to Amazon's cloud or my HDX would require conversion from Apple's format. Just not worth the time. Some of my music was purchased from Amazon, and those songs are available. But it is a small subset. Top it off with marginal speakers in my configuration and, well I just don't use it.I am yet to try Skype, but I suspect it would work very well.The HDX comes connected to Amazon's store. That makes it easy to buy books or movies. If I ever remember to carry my HDX into my basement to watch movies, it could be an easy way to select a For Rent movie when I want to watch it through my XBox. Too bad the swipe-to-TV feature doesn't include using the Amazon XBox app... then I'd always take my HDX downstairs with me!That leads to another oddity: for some Kindle management features you have to leave Amazon's store app and use Silk (or your laptop or iPhone) to go onto the web. Why is that? I can buy stuff from Amazon (including expensive, physical merchandise), but if I want to add an email address to my \"approved for documents\" list I need to go sign-on via Silk and browse around their website to find that feature? Doesn't make sense to me.Now the Mayday feature -- it is a really nice idea. I am fairly technical, and when I ask for help it is usually on some detail (like why won't my changes to the Notification sound stick?) that is not easy to find in the documentation. Unhappily for me, the Mayday reps, while very eager to help, did not yet know the HDX very well and I was often put on hold while they went to research things. So I'd go back to reading something and sliding their little window around on my HDX... which got old pretty fast. It is, though, really nice to have that help available when they are able to help. I can hardly wait to try hitting Mayday on Xmas day just to see if they can handle the load ;-)So why did I give this device 4 stars? Because it replaced my older, 2nd gen Kindle and as I said above, it rocks in that role. If you want to view this as an iPad competitor, I think it fails as a general-purpose device that you'd take on the road instead of a laptop; hell my iPhone does a better job of that than this new HDX.

The Ipad has a good track record but I was looking for a small productive powerhouse tablet under $300. It is being debated weather the Apple A7 in the new Ipad mini is faster then the Snapdragon 800 + Adreno 330. The price range of the new Ipad mini was a tad to high for me.The Nexus 7 2013 is the Hdx's adversary. Most of the spec's are similar like the screen and battery life. The deal breaker for me was the Hdx had a better processor chipset and build quality. I had the 1st gen Nexus 7 before and loved the power for the price but the Nexus had a defect after a couple of weeks and had broken parts rattle inside the tablet. Later on the screen became unresponsive. I was able to return it for a full refund. I heard from many people that the build quality of Amazon's Fire tablets were good. And so I was swayed.Here is a list of pro and con's the Hdx 7\" has:Pro's:-Fastest tablet on the market (Snapdragon 800 + Adreno 330) (exception. the debated Apple A7 chip)!-High Def screen with high ppi-Acceptable battery life-Excellent build quality!-Simple user interface-Good customer support with Mayday-Aggressive and competitive price point!-I almost forgot, THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING I never heard speakers on a tablet / laptop / phone this good! Amazing, no doubt.Con's:-Amazon's app store is lacking supporters*-Bulky user interface for some, including me**-No Google support-Screen blue haze (not a very large issue)****There is a way to install android app's other then Amazon's App store. By downloading android .apk's with a usb or by downloading it from the web browser then using the file manager to install them. Most apps work, some do not.**I am not a fan of the user interface. It is simple and it works but has little room for customization. As soon as a root and rom comes out, I'm going for it! Then I'll be able to give this review 5 stars!***People report blue haze around the border of the screen, my screen has so little haze it's not noticeable unless I have a white background and the brightness high. This is not a true con since it does not affect me. If it affects you, Amazon is willing to work it out with there excellent costumer service.If your looking for a tablet this holiday session, look no more! This is a top tier Tablet and I believe the HDX line of tablets sets its place well in the top 3 tablets for 2013! If your looking for build quality, ultra fast gaming and productivity/multitasking response, all at a great price, you found an award winning device!Until a root and rom comes out, I'll give this baby a solid 4 starsYou wont regret buying this tablet.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Kindle", "Author": "Donna Isbell", "ReviewID": "R1WQR173L4SGSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a rare eye diease .

Read this before you buy!", "Author": "J. Andrew Geary", "ReviewID": "RFJ1CNSGGVYJ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, the good:The screen was amazing! I  started watching a nature documentary and was transfixed. Movies, tv shows, games, everything looked great on this device.The device was lightweight, had a fast processor and decent memory. I bought the 64GB but they should have made a 128GB since a single 1080p movie with dolby surround took up 9.5-10.3GB when downloaded from my amazon account. You only get 54 GB to start with because of the operating system and whatever else they put on.I could download Prime TV shows to watch offline when travelling, a great feature! The website said you could download Prime movies as well, but I could not find any that gave me the download option.The device came with a charging block (unlike the fire hd I bought last year).It was for these reasons I gave the unit 2 starts and not just 1. Keep reading to find out why!Second, the not so good:When you plug in the charging cord and the headphone, they are not flat and parallel with the unit. They stick up at about a 15 degree angle. Not a big deal, but it made me nervous in case someone accidentally set something on top of it while it was on the counter or desk. I think the damage would be catastrophic to the unit if that happened.The battery life is not great. This unit sucks down the battery faster than my fire hd does.Lastly, the terrible:I received the unit and spent the day loading it with videos and goodies for an upcoming trip. The last thing I did was sit down to watch a movie I bought specifically to watch on this unit's screen. I noticed a static buzz underneath the soundtrack that was annoying. I experimented until I found that the buzz was happening everytime the unit accessed the internet. Since the movie in question was streaming, the buzz was constant. I tried a downloaded movie, no buzz. I tried surfing the web with nothing on and everytime I clicked a new link, the buzz would be there until the new page was done loading. So, I called Amazon and they sent out a new unit (recieved the next day, thank you Amazon!).The new unit did the same thing. I tried some more experiments and found the buzzing happened with all my ear buds (cheap ones and expensive ones) and did NOT happen with my headphones (both cheap and expensive were clear sounding). The rest of the unit was so cool, I figured I could work around this even though the only reason I have expensive ear buds is to travel with my fire hd. So, I spent another day dowloading tv shows and other goodies to prepare for my trip. I was sitting reading a book and downloading a movie when the unit flashed a warning that I had used up 90% of the storage and did I want to delete something. I clicked no and the unit shut off. I knew the battery was a little low so I plugged in the unit for 20-30 minutes. I tried restarting the unit and nothing. I held down the on/off button for 20 seconds like the website said to and got a brief \"Kindle Fire\" screen flash but nothing else. I called tech support and we basically tried the same thing again and the tech said that they could replace the unit, again.So, I am sending this unit back and getting a refund. I've wasted 2 whole days dealing with this. I have 2 different covers on their way because the origami cover was terrible (see my review for the cover for that story) and I still have to deal with returning those.I'm very annoyed with this whole process because I feel like this was a great product that got rushed through testing and production and was just not ready for consumers yet. I Ioved my original kindle fire and still love my fire hd. Making the screen better with more memory was all I could ask for to make it a perfect product (for what I needed it for) and was really excited about the hdx.

Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0JZDWPQSSDE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the kindle. It has a great price, awesome screen, and with an advertised 11 hour battery life (up to 17 hour if just reading according to Amazon) I figured this device was the perfect companion.After a few weeks of testing and timing, I can confidently say that for the vast majority of user scenarios, the battery life is significantly worse. In fact, I have no idea how exactly Amazon came up with the 11 hour number.But lets start with the basics pros:- Screen is really nice (yes there is some slight blue light bleed around the edges, but Amazon has a complete explanation of why that is - and it's used to have the great color accuracy/gamut that the display has). Honestly, it was very little to bother me at all, and welcome the increase color gamut. The screen is superb.- Kindle Free Time: this is absolutely great. I can let my daughter play with the kindle with some serious restrictions. (what apps can be accessed, how long she can play, read or watch videos (3 distinct timers). She can't do purchases or anything else. I can't believe nobody had done something like this before. It's really amazing.Cons- Neutered android means that a lot of very popular android apps are not available, and you have to resort to side loading them, and not all work that well. I really wish they allowed a larger percentage of the Google Play store apps (all preferred)- thick border around the edges, where the display could be extended to be even more usable without increasing the size of the device. It's around a 1.5 inch diagonal of wasted space. The iPad min in contrast his just a 1/4 of an inch or so.- And the worst offender which causes this to be a 2 star product instead of 4 stars, is the misrepresented battery life. Partner has an iPad2, (10 hour claim) and it generally lives to those expectations, lasts all day off the plug, great.The Real Battery Life of the HDX which claims to be 11 hours (up to 17 reading!!) is closer to 5 hours.Here are the tests I did during the last 3 weeks:The first day, I downloaded several apps and got it setup, read some books to my daughter, and watched a movie. I used the mayday button to ask about sorting apps by age of your child (can't be done as of now). It couldn't have been more than 4 hours, and the device was already at 10% charge (down from a full 100% charge) so I was really disappointed, and started doing a series of tests:Things to note:* Wifi only model (3g would suck the battery even more)* brightness was set to 50%.* I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and this is the first Amazon product that has really let me down with their claims. I owned a kindle keyboard, and now a paperwhite 2 - both of which I love. Customer service has always been second to none. Basically, there is no reason for me to \"bash\" this product. I am a tech person, and I am aware battery life varies quite a bit by usage, but this is a serious issue not just a small variation. Amazon failed to deliver big time on their battery life promise.Test 1:* 3 hours of mostly reading (kids books, so they had colors and things, my daughter flipping through the pages)* 1 hour of videos (she was unfortunately drawn to Barney)* Half hour of games (some simple puzzle games, nothing 3D intensive or anything requiring full use of the graphic processor)* Battery was down to 20% and I started surfing the web and others until it ran down in 1.75 hours.So basically, during a reading heavy session (17 hour amazon claim), the device failed to last 6 hours.Test 2:- Charged it overnight, let my daughter do whatever she wanted with it (using the awesome Kindle Free Time). She mostly watched videos and flipped through some books. She also opened a game or two (Again simple puzzle games, no 3D battery intensive games). She had breakfast in between and then lunch. And then brought the device to me because the battery was dead. The device lasted just over 4 hours...In contrast the iPad, where she likes to play with 3D puzzles and several other 3D apps (Mr Potato), she plays with it several days before it ever runs down.  I can confidently say that playing with apps, the iPad lasts at least twice as long as the kindle fire.Test 3:- Sporadic use throughout he day. I figure I'd try a really subtle scenario.- Light web browsing (not more than 30 minutes)- Some videos (1.5 hours)- occasional book (only 5 minute spans, or flipping through pictures)- The device was on the sleep state most of the time.- Battery life was at 30% that night. So 70% of the battery was lost during some 3 maybe 4 hours of use.I will do a strictly video test and post it later.But nothing I have seen indicates that any normal usage will get you anywhere near the 11 hour claim.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "P.

I can compare them to a Galaxy Tab 7\" and they come out far ahead, particularly that Amazon has realized the \"natural\" position for a 7\" tablet is horizontal, not vertical. The screen is amazing, which you'd expect from the stats, but for a tiny 7\" device, the speakers are actually quite capable.

We also have several other devices, including the previously mentioned Kindle Fire HD, that don't have the issue. I decided to google the problem and found dozens of threads with similar experiences, including people who'd returned the device and had a replacement with the same behavior.The second problem I had was that the battery would drop as much as 50% overnight when left in sleep mode. That's just not acceptable to me. Again, we had the Fire HD to compare it to and the battery drop there was only a few percent. I tried deleting applications that might be activating the device while it was asleep, a factory reset, but nothing worked. Again, I found threads on the Kindle support forums with dozens of people experiencing the same issue, including those who got replacement units.I'd suggest just buying an HD, which is what I'll be doing the next time they go on sale.

I believe some places like Samsung Galaxy have a screen protection program they do. Amazon really should offer a better broken screen replacement program or at least let people send them in to get the screen replaced on theirs at a low price vs having to replace it at $149 just so they can turn around and resell yours at a $129 profit.Kinda sad program they have currently.Anyway..................I would suggest looking into other that are much more durable.

The original Kindle fire worked great and did what we wanted. While we have all the \"i\" devices from Apple, the footprint of the kindle was easier to deal with and overall it was a great product.The two HDX however have caused me nothing but frustration. One has FreeTime for my 6 year old, and the other doesn't. Let me go down some of the issues that have annoyed me greatly:#1 - The Kindle for my daughter has issues with staying connected to WiFi. It will drop connection and go into a constant state of searching for an access point. There are a total of 6 access points in my house, overkill yes, but I'm an IT guy... just goes with the territory. Going Airplane mode, Turning on & off WiFi, etc does not work. Only a full powercycle fixes the issue.#2 - FreeTime REQUIRES a password, and the only way to get to some of the kids apps is going into FreeTime. I trust my child, she is very mature for her age, she doesn't NEED a password MANDATED by Amazon. This is simply an annoyance and should be the choice of the parent.#3 - The Kindle with FreeTime also WILL NOT allow applications to be used when outside of WiFi range. It gives an Internal Service Error when trying any application in or out of FreeTime. I've researched the forums and this is a known issue which has not been adequately addressed by Amazon. I have tried every one of the suggestions, flushing the cache on the AppStore service (and one other, can't remember the name), deregistering & reregistering, reloading completely. I'm not sure what they have done to tie every app access to the app store, but this is a huge flaw and only seems to happen on Kindles with FreeTime installed (per review on the forums).#4 - Total Lockout of Google Store/Google Framework - Due to the 'pissing contest' between Amazon and Google, no Google apps can be installed. While the email app will pull your mail from GMail, you cannot load the actual GMail app, Google Maps, YouTube App, etc. You can force a sideload of an app, but it will be massively hindered because the Google Framework cannot be installed.#5 - Relating to number #4 - NO native YouTube app. My children watch a great deal of YouTube because they love MineCraft. However, because YouTube is a Google product now, they don't play nicely together. I've seen several times responses on the forums from Amazon folks saying to load one of the three third party apps which supports YouTube. Two of these are limited to only their selection of videos and have forced ads which my children don't need, and the third which actually allows access to searching (in a horrible non intuitive way) immediately started throwing up ads for ADULT WEBSITES. Great for the kids, eh?#6 - Also relating to #4, lack of access to the VAST number of Android applications which are available due to lockouts. While you can sideload after unlocking one of the settings, it still reduces the effectiveness of the applications due to their tinkering with parts of Android that truly don't need to be tinkered with.#7 - The 'Carousel' (the gigantic scrollable icons on the screen) is nothing but a history of past applications used. There is no way to keep your favorites in place, there is no EASY way to clear it. If the device was mine I would hate it as a privacy issue. Overall it forces you to use the text menus at the top more than anything else, or the search function to find applications you want to use. I personally just hate the interface.We debated long and hard between going with the mini-iPads, Kindle Fire HDX, or the various Android pads. Now that I have all of these for review, I would lean heavily towards something like my Samsung Galaxy Tab or other pure android device of quality. There are simply too many headaches totally caused by the effort to make this device proprietary and denying applications made by the developer of the OS, Google. Overall I've highly disappointed, this could have been a great product.For the Positives : Great screen, great size, better price than apple products.Once again, love Amazon as a whole... but I've tried to make these work for my family and yet my children run and get their 2 year old iPods which have tiny screens just to avoid using these.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely exceeded expectations.", "Author": "Frank L.

Can't speak to charging complaints because I keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and I plug my phone in every night and my Kindle every morning when I awake. After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40% and average end of day is about 65% so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience.

Kindle fire uses a modified version of google's android and limits you to Amazon's appstore which is mostly a watered down version of google's play store. I would consider this a con but there are some distinct benefits of the amazon app store. The first benefit is that amazon provides you the ability to use their amazon prime streaming service along with the major apps such as netflix, plex, ETC.Kindle Fire hardware- The kindle fire has top of the line hardware for a budget tablet. The quad core snapdragon 800 has great graphics capability along with great multitasking capability. The HDX technically has a better CPU than the 2013 nexus 7 and a much better CPU than the galaxy series. The screen has great colors and decent brightness with pretty decent viewing angles.Kindle fire battery life- I believe that the kindle fire battery life is subpar when compared to my nexus 7 and my wife's ipad mini. I typically get about 6-7 hours of streaming video whereas I get about 10 hours with my nexus 7 and about 11 with the ipad mini.Kindle fire durability-  The kindle fire is the only tablet that I've ever had a cracked screen with. The screen cracked just towards the edge because I stepped on it. I don't know if this is because I'm a fat bastard or because the screen is abnormally weak. I believe it was a combination of my fat bastard qualities as well as the thinner screen. I have dropped my other tablets and I have stepped on my nexus 7 and slatebook before and they haven't broken yet.Value- No doubt the HDX has great value. The hardware and software are top notch.Which should I choose- If you are a big google supporter then I would recommend a nexus 7 or a samsung tablet. If you are strictly using it for media such as netflix and amazon prime, no doubt you should choose the kindle fire HDX.all in all the tablet is great but there are some limitations which may or may not be the deal breaker. The reason I bought it was to use amazon prime instant streaming so that I didn't have to download flash on my nexus 7.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this tablet!", "Author": "Macy Banton", "ReviewID": "R2UUCOOFX42R5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I should say that I have very limited experience with tablets. Having received an HP Slate (Microsoft based tablet) at work, which I was allowed to keep when they replaced the HP's with Apple iPads (which I used for about a year).I wasn't even in the market for a tablet, but I had purchased a mobile hotspot plan through my wireless carrier (the hotspot was free with a 2 year contract) and was offered $100 off any tablet as a promotion for purchasing the hotspot plan.I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and am certainly glad I did. The Kindle performs flawlessly. It has a great picture - perfect for watching MLB TV games, offers a number of fantastic apps. (I especially enjoy my talking Bible, as well as many Bible trivia/quiz apps, and Hangman).I love the Kindle library choices and also love the fact that my Kindle can read my books to me. The Kindle HDX 7 also features excellent sound, so much so that I have yet had to use my external speaker.I find the HBX 7 the perfect size for carrying around - it is light, compact, and the controls are very intuative. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the Speaktoit Assistant app is not (yet?) available for the Kindle Fire HDX. I have this app on my smartphone and find it very useful.I have on occassion used the MayDay button, and found the customer service reps. & tech support people very helpful.I should mention that my wife has the previous generation Kindle Fire HD 7 which has also performed flawlessly, and my daughter has a Google Nexus 7\" tablet by Asus - which is also a fine tablet, however IMO not quite as well thought-out as the Kindles are. In fact for my needs I prefer the Kindle HDX Fire over the i-Pad, it's that good.I originally was going to use a case with a keyboard for my Kindle, but found that the touch keyboard performs flawlessly & there is no need for an external keyboard. (In comparison the touchpad keyboard on my HP Slate does not perform anywhere near as well as the Kindle's), and with the HP, I use a small external keyboard.I've owned my Kindle Fire HDX 7 for 4 months now and find it does everything I would expect it to do and more. I am surprised at how quick this little dynamo is. Kudos to Amazon for making such a wonderful little tablet. I should also mention that it has excellent battery life compared to the other tablets I have owner and/or used.I'm a completely satisfied customer, and keep Bibles and Bible Handbooks as well as a few other books in my Kindle library, and find it wonderful to be able to store all of  these on such a small tablet.

Yes, most of my stuff revolves around google for the same reasons so many out there are also tied to the google eco system.

Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware.

Bell", "ReviewID": "R27WLATCO02ZHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to a local electronics to buy the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and was \"talked into\" a Samsung 16GB Galaxy Tab 3 8\" tablet. I took it home, started set up and started downloading the apps I wanted from Google Play. Being an iPod owner, Apple had spoiled me to its user-friendly interface. I own a PC, so I didn't think it would be such a hassle, but BOY was I wrong. After an hour, I still had less than 10 apps downloaded , and the speed of the downloads was a snail's pace, along with YouTube and Netflix buffering every 10 seconds. I was sick with my purchase and took it back the next day to get what I wanted in the first place... the Kindle! I'll try to compare it to my brief experience with the Galaxy and my 4+ years with the iPod Touch 4.1.  Speed.  Kindle rivals the iPod. It's 2.2GHz quad-core processor is a speed king. The Galaxy Tab 3 only has a 1.5GHz dual core. You wouldn't think those little numbers would make such a difference, but they do.2.  Ease of Use. Another way the Kindle is similar to the iPod.  The UI for the Kindle is less cluttered and complicated than the Galaxy (and other Android devices I've seen in the stores). I realize the Kindle runs essentially on an Android platform, but Amazon made it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.(As a side note... the Samsung reps inside the store pushed the Galaxy 3 Tab with the following features that the Kindle does NOT have... rear 5MP camera, microSD expandable storage, multi/split window screen accessibility, and screen-mirroring--which would require a $70 device to control your TV with your device. All I can say is that those amazing features don't mean squat if the user experience with the interface is lousy.)3. Size and Feel. The Kindle HDX has a 7\" screen, It's about the same weight as the 8\" Galaxy I originally bought, but the difference is the FEEL.  The beveled edges and thicker casing make it ergonomically-friendly without feeling too bulky. The back has an almost \"rubberized\" feel, so it doesn't slip around in your hands. Here, it outshines the iPod/iPad and the Galaxy, whose backs are slick (metal or plastic), and both are VERY thin.  I found it difficult to hold the 8\" Galaxy in bed comfortably to read, no matter whether it was oriented for landscape or portrait.4. App Availability and Store Navigation.  Here, the iPad would win. Apple is known for its amazing apps, and Android seems to \"catch up\" at best. Not all the apps in the regular Android (now Google Play) Store are available in Kindle's App Store (which are actually Android apps), but the most popular ones are there. I have read about people \"sideloading\" missing apps into their Kindles from other third-party sites, though. If there were an app that I just couldn't live without, it would be worth a try. Kindle's App Store is very easy to navigate. It reminds me a lot of Apple's.  I will say that I like how there is a video preview of many apps in the Google App Store. But sadly, with the Galaxy, I could never get the preview to work.5. Screen Resolution. The Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad with retina display would be pretty close in comparison. The Kindle's colors are vivid, crisp, and sharp. And while some people would argue that the human eye can only process so much, I can say that my 30-something-year-old eyes which need glasses can notice a sizable difference between the Kindle and the Galaxy. The Galaxy's color was nice, but the resolution was not as good, and even my poor eyes could tell.  I can see the \"blue lines\" many people complain about in the new Kindle Fire HDX, but I only notice it on books with white pages (sepia color or night mode is fine), and it is not distracting to me at all. It's not a deal-breaker, and it only seems to show up on the edges.6. Price. The Kindle is the clear winner here. I purchased mine on sale for $199, and the 8\" Galaxy Tab3 was $269. A more comparable 7-inch, 8GB Galaxy was $139, but all the other specs were sub-par (especially the resolution and processor speed). The iPad Mini with retina display is closer in spec comparison, but totes a $399 price (the regular, non-retina iPad Mini is $299).Above all, remember this: If you go to an electronics store, beware of reps from companies inside the store. The Samsung guys were all over the tablet section of my local store like hounds pushing their products. I should have been smarter from the beginning and gone with a clear winner rather than something I knew little about. If you want a tortoise-slow, buggy tablet that will frustrate you in the first day with its failure to load apps or stream videos in a reasonable time frame, try a Samsung or similar Android device. If you want a winner with a smooth interface and a great price point, go with the Kindle. If your money grows on trees and is no object, by all means, buy the iPad Mini. For now, the Kindle is my choice, and I am so glad I returned the overpriced Samsung I tolerated for less than a day.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So much for so little!", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3OJUKKVEKI95B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a powerful tablet, just the right size to carry around with you without being too bulky.

I am absolutely in love with my new kindle fire hdx.Google Play issue:The main complaint for people is that being an android device, it doesn't have access to google play. Ridiculous right? Well, those people are kind of wrong. You can download them at 1mobile as apks and install them, but make sure that you change the settings to allow the apps(apks) to be installed from a non-amazon source. I installed so many apps from the google store available on 1mobile. You can even google them for apks and install them and they will work because this kindle is running on android. For example, i downloaded and ran dropbox without a problem. You can even sideload or root the device for the actual google play store.Speed:Apps open up quickly and the screen also rotates to landscape almost instantaneously. This baby is extremely fast due to the 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU, with Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Although sometimes, the app store does lag. Amazon probably needs to improve that aspect. The Silk browser is pretty amazing. Comparable to google chrome I would say.

The quad core is a huge plus. It's like saying 4 brains vs 2. Using 4 brains is obviously more efficient and faster. The processor is definitely nothing to scoff atAudio:Loud, rich sound with earphones. The sound is loud and clear without earphones too.

The HD screen provides a beautiful canvas to watch movies on netflix, play games, read manga, go on social media. When i played with the kindle in the store, the screen was just breathtaking.

I do notice the blue light on the edges of white pages, but its totally not an issue at all.  I love the smaller size, yet same size screen.

I have the 32gb version and it's barely enough for me, personally.  There's only something like 24gb (or is it 29gb?) left after the OS, and my music alone takes up 20gb.2)  No rear camera!!  Still!!!3)  If you're not going to give us a real camera, I can kind of live with that - though it would be fun to have - but you could at least make the camera on there be sensitive to the fact that you'll be using it for some sort of face-to-face interaction, and we don't like having our nose look huge and our arms aren't long enough to hold the thing far enough away so it doesn't distort our features.  All in all, the camera is pretty much completely useless.CONCLUSION:  Is it worth the upgrade cost?  I, personally, think so.

I thought long and hard about whether to buy an iPad mini and stick with the Apple ecosystem or get another Fire. I'm so glad I went with the Fire. The first thing that struck me was how light the new HDX is. I love the sleek look and the placement of the buttons. The HDX was incredibly easy to set-up. I also had no problem adding my FB photos to the cloud nor uploading my iTunes to the Cloud drive.The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The color and clarity are amazing. I opened a magazine and could read it without expanding the text which I couldn't do with the original Fire. I also found the sound quality excellent. The browser is very fast. I've viewed videos and had no problem with dropped WiFi connections; this was a problem with the Original Fire.While I still prefer my PW for reading, since the HDX is a new toy, I've been reading on it all week and found the reading experience enjoyable.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZF0QJKD88D1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 11/2/2013:  My family has been thoroughly enjoying our Kindle Fire HDX.  We set up Kindle FreeTime and it has been a huge hit with our 3 year old.  We started a free trial of Kindle FreeTime Unlimited that gives her access to thousands of books, games, videos and songs.  Some of these are junk, but many are items we have purchased for other devices in the past or were considering purchasing for the Kindle Fire.  There are Boynton books, Ivy & Bean, episodes of Sesame Street, Dora and Mr. Rogers, as well as Cut the Rope, Monopoly, Life, Bejeweled 2 and other great games.  You can find a list of what is available on Amazon.com (currently over 1500 items).  While the videos are not a big draw if you subscribe to Prime, like we do, Prime members get a discount on the monthly subscription fee, currently $4.99 / child or $9.99 / family.  Prime members only pay $2.99 / child or $6.99 / family.  At $2.99 per month, I feel that Kindle FreeTime Unlimited is, by far, the best feature of the Kindle Fire HDX for us.  If you are a Prime member with children under 10 years old, I would give my strongest recommendation to the Kindle Fire HDX.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that balances form, function and price.  There are some key differences that set this tablet apart from the iPad Mini 2 and the Nexus 7.  The Nexus 7 has a slower processor.  The iPad Mini 2 has a 7.9\" screen with higher resolution but a much higher price.  The Kindle Fire HDX has no rear camera and the screen has a bluish tint on the edges from the blue LED lighting, but neither bother me.  The Kindle Fire HDX has the least apps available of the three, but all the android apps I like are available.  On the plus side, the Kindle FIre HDX is very user friendly thanks to it's clear and smooth interface and mayday help feature.  If you are an Amazon Prime member or purchase music, ebooks and videos from Amazon then the Kindle Fire HDX is a very seamless way to enjoy your content.My setup consisted of pressing the power button, selecting my language and wifi access point, entering my wifi password and confirming my Amazon account.  It took about 50 seconds.  I was immediately impressed by the screen's resolution, vibrant, accurate colors and wide viewing angles.  The screen automatically adjusts for ambient light, not just with changing brightness but also changing contrast.  Speakers sound good for a tablet, but i wish they weren't rear-facing like every other tablet.  The tablet is incredibly responsive; everything is instantaneous.  Wifi is fast and gets good reception throughout my house without dropping the connection.  The tablet isn't too heavy and feels comfortable thanks to the contoured back with good grip.  I'm not really the kind of person to use the mayday feature, but I see it as being one of the biggest selling points.

Something not addressed is the lack of HDMI and the inclusion of Miracast.I like it the HDX. What I don't like that there is no micro- HDMI so I took off 1 star for this. I really liked being able to plug into any screen to watch movies, etc. Now we have Miracast which is unproven and seemingly being forced on us by Amazon. There's not alot of options and if I want my TV's to work I need to buy at least 3 adapters.My question is specific to the Miracast function. Has anyone used a dongle to use the Miracast function? If so what product did you use? Amazon support not to helpful as the Indian call center does not even know the differences between the HD and HDX. I finally got to speak to someone in the U.S. and they sent me to this page http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201370390 where they recommend the Netgear option.Updated 10/25/13I officially miss my micro HDMI. I set up the aforementioned NetGear which does what it says and was the recommended product by Amazon. Good (not excellent) overall picture quality when watching videos, but there is some lag especially when you have to transmit to the Netgear and download simultaneously. This may be better if you took 30 minutes to download a movie 1st, but i have yet to test this. This current hardware spec running through micro HDMI would have been outstanding in my opinion.

Feels really solid and well built. Appstore relative scarcity is not an issue since you can easily sideload APKs if you have them. But...1. When first reading about the purple border \"feature\", I figured it was overblown or exaggerated and wouldn't be an issue. I mean, I have a gen 1 Paperwhite and the faint light blotches seem negligible to me. However, the bluish borders on my HDX are neither subtle nor negligible in size and you can bet I'd be unhappy about them even had I not heard about them first. It is really distracting on anything with a white background. I read at least 10 industry reviews prior to purchase and I didn't see this mentioned once (apparently it was an aside in one review I missed). I have to think this means there is some variance between units and I got a bad one, while the reviewers saw the best examples.2. There's also some non-trivial screen flicker, particularly when I'm in the Settings pages. It's as if it's trying to auto-adjust the brightness, but I have mine set to manual.3. This is minor one, but how can a device whose stated purpose is multimedia consumption not have a graphic equalizer built into the OS?I'll probably wait a bit to see how this all shakes out, but I'm sure I'll be exchanging/returning mine. I'd be completely happy if the screen issues were resolved.***************************************Edit 10/25: Just had an interesting chat with the very courteous Mayday rep \"Cody\". I asked him if the blue haze is supposed to be the same width along all edges of the screen of all Kindle HDX's, and he said yes. I then told him the haze was wider along the long edges of my screen, and he said he's heard that as well (oops). I then asked him if the haze is supposed to be the same width and brightness along each of those long edges (where it's most visible), and he said yes. When I told him that the haze is much wider/brighter along one long edge than the other - the bottom edge opposite the camera, he didn't have a whole lot to say (oops #2), other than this is not considered a defect that warrants a replacement. I then asked him if every HDX exhibits this to the the same degree, and he said, \"they're supposed to\". When I asked him if they actually are all the same, all he would say was to repeat that they're supposed to be.It might sound like I was being a jerk, but it really was just a calm discussion where I wanted those specific questions answered, and there was definitely some waffling on their part. And they are going to replace mine, due to the screen flicker. But if you call with just the haze issue, be prepared to return rather than replace.

When the HDX model came out late last year, I was interested in some of the features particularly the stated improved screen, not that there were complaints about its predecessor's readability! When amazon offered the HDX on an  incentive payment plan, I couldn't resist so clicked the purchase. It arrived a day earlier than advertised, an auspicious beginning, and was packed in recyclable cardboard which pleased this Tree Hugger greatly. The minimalist box for the device was likewise showing consideration for the environment which still affording a design tour d' force. a simple decorative sleeve houses the box in which the Kindle nestles along with the power cord and adapter, plus a small, plain set up sheet for the beginner.This edition of the Kindle Fire is noticeably thinner. I did have some difficulty plugging the cord into it as it goes in at an angle, whereas the other model was a straight shot. Finding the power button, changed from the bottom next to the charging cord to the back of the device, was likewise confounding briefly but other than that, I'd have to say... it was all a piece of cake, and of course the amazon cloud had already registered this newest Kindle along with preparing to download all the eBooks etc. Couldn't be much easier than that.In the case of the Kindle Fire HDX, I'd have to say, it is truly a refined device in all regards and justifies the purchase. I strongly recommend getting one of the Kindle eBooks on the Fire HDX to speed up the use of your new device. I found it enormously beneficial in both cases, throughout time. I am currently using the Kindle Fire HDX & HD Complete Guidebook published March, 2014.As a further satisfied purchaser of the device, may I state that while I am a bonafide Apple User, I still prefer the Kindle Fire (HDX) for eBooks and definitely for the value that amazon provides in pricing them.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faster, brighter, lighter, better!", "Author": "Brad Shea", "ReviewID": "RF92BO14OA20C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have FIVE Kindle Fires in this house.

I have Amazon Prime and if your sole purpose for owning a tablet is to watch movies and shop online at Amazon, then THIS is the tablet for you.  iPad Mini and the Nexus don't compare to this Kindle for these purpose.However, there are downsides that became dealbreakers for me which led me to make the decision to return it.Dealbreaker #1:  The web experience is very sloppy.  It's not as smooth as the iPad Mini.Dealbreaker #2:  The camera quality sucks.  When using Skype, the picture quality is dark and very grainy. And, there's only one camera.Dealbreaker #3:  Your home movies do play on it.  But there is no easy way to rewind or fast forward smoothly.  Again, very sloppy.In the end, if your primary purpose for owning a tablet is to watch streaming movies and shopping online at Amazon, then you can't find anything better than the Kindle Fire HDX.

I've also wanted to upgrade my Kindle Touch, which seemed very slow to me, response-wise. With iPad being pricey the kindle seemed like a natural choice. I considered getting the paperwhite, but thought a little extra would get me a lot more. I underestimated myself.As an e-reader this kindle does what you expect and more. I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.The web browser is great. Nothing mind blowing, but I didn't buy this to surf the web. The ease of navigation in the Amazon store (be it through the Amazon app or the Bookstore app) is supreme.

It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it. If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Technical problems (old age)", "Author": "rolland r smith", "ReviewID": "R218QTPXG1E3UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love my old Kindle, it is very easy to use however, I am an elderly gentleman and find the new one a little complicated for me.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

I was unsure, wondering if the reported flaws were consistant throughout it's lifespan. But I will say now that I've had a chance to play around with it, it really is an incredible piece of technology, especially for people who are new to tablets and want to get their feet wet.As the case with the Kindle Fire HD, the HDX has a forked variation of android. This means that they are slower to update and their choice of apps will be limited. But this doesn't really mean that it's a terrible downside, especially since you have more access to amazon features, something that most android tablets do not provide enough of. The user interface itself is fairly easy to navigate, but limited in customization due to it's OS being heavily modified by amazon. As mentioned previously, if you are new to tablets, you can't go wrong with the HDX, in either of it's models. If you aren't used to technology in general, then this tablet will be perfect for you. It teaches you how to operate the tablet, which swipes do what and so forth. If that doesn't convince you, then the new mayday might do the job. When you press this button, you can communicate with a member of amazon's technical support team who can temporarily take control of your tablet to show you how to get from point a to point b. The difference between stock android and the modified android OS (aka Fire OS 3.0 as amazon calls it) are obvious, starting with the carousel. The carousel itself is a tray of apps and media that you use or prefer to use the most. Though I do love it, my only complaint is that I wish I could modify what gets added to it, so I could have more control over it. Below the carousel are your installed apps, which I absolutely adore, especially since stock android forces you into multi-home screen configuration (which I hate).The choice of apps may be few, but the selection of media is massive to say the least. If you live in north america, then you may know from experience that some videos, books, and music simply aren't available in the google play store. I have to be honest though, I never really did care much for google play's selection of apps, so having a limited selection really isn't that bad. Amazon offers a free app of the day though, so whatever app that is offered for free may vary from a free to paid variation. So downloading it will mean that you will have that app forever if you snag it. So the answer to the question \"what do you get out of the amazon ecosystem?\" is this, their entire cache of media, which is nearly perfect. Some movies and episodes might only be available for rent, but that is still more then what you get with google play. Let's be honest here, when you are buying a tablet, you aren't buying it for what isn't available in another person, but what is available to you. With amazon's x-ray, any x-ray enabled song gives you access to it's lyrics. X-Ray enabled movies and television episodes give you access to which actors play what and things of that sort, allowing you to find out who that one actor is through the help of IMDB. Books give you access to characters and which parts of the story they might show up in and so on. Keep inmind that while HD, HDX and paperwhite owners will find themselves enjoying x-ray, non-amazon tablets do not have this feature. If you have prime, then you will find yourself with the option to download prime-enabled movies and episodes. Having access to prime's library really is something to write home about, especially if you can't stand netflix. I have yet to fully test out the prime-enabled features, but I can safely say that prime owners will LOVE the HDX. The downside to this is that you can only download a handful of their videos (in my experience). But never the less, instant video is still a worthwhile feature to consider for prime members.If you have access to children of any sort (be they through babysitting or your own grandchildren), then freetime will be the answer to some of your problems. You can grant them special limited access to the tablet, which can be very helpful I'd imagine. But considering that I don't have kids nor do I babysit, I wouldn't know. So this is strictly up to you in how you prefer freetime. Playing a song, reading an e-book, or watching a movie is what the HDX is designed for. It offers incredible HD-quality graphics and stunning audio to make your experiences enjoyable. With specifications that are equal to what the nexus 7 offers and considering that there is a 64gb varient (which I own), it is the perfect media-consumption tablet to bring with you on vacation.If you use the internet frequently enough, then you will have nothing to fear! The HDX has a decent email client and web browser (aka silk). Silk is comparable to the stock android browser and should you not want to use the various side-loaded youtube apps, you can still access youtube via Silk and the quality does not suffer in the slightest. The email client does what any email client should and sticks to it, checking and deleting emails. Though I will admit there is a lack of \"select all emails\" option, but this hardly matters to me. Being able to check my email is all I prefer. The calender (or day planner if you prefer) is simple and to the point, proving that not every feature has to come with forty or fifty functions.If you choose not to pay that extra 30.00 to remove special features, you are treated to a lockscreen with ads. I understand that should you pay to remove the ads, you are treated to a handful of features. But having ads on my kindle is nice, since it gives me access to new sales and I like to save money if I can help it.In the end, if you like stock android and long for it's customizability, then don't get an HDX. An HDX is for one group of people, fans of the amazon ecosystem, people who are aware of it not being similar to a stock android tablet and are fine with it. This tablet does well at what it was designed for, media consumption. Which honestly, is something that I prefer to be honest. I have a nexus 7 here and it didn't offer HALF of the functions that are found on an HDX. There is no having to pay over 20.00 to fix the problems present in stock android and thanks to mirror cast, you can use your HDX to stream movies to any mirror cast-enabled device.

I do not think there have been any disappointments with this tablet, but I am finding out daily how truly amazing this thing is.  I believe the most important asset for me is how all the books I bought between my Kindle keyboard and HD Fire, automatically loaded on my HDX, and they were already placled in collections.  I was dissapointed with the Kindle collections app by M. Gallagher because it was painstaking for me to try to categorize all my books (approx. 1,300+), and after getting a little over 200, the Collections app. crashed and had to start from scratch!  Now, I do not have to worry, because I have no backlog and can find my books quickly.I have my Direct TV app on the HDX and I watch TV right from my tablet.  I am legally blind, so this is important to me.  I love TCM Classic Movies, and since many times the words are dubbed, I do not have to jump up and sit right in front of the TV set to read the lines.  Text to speech is improved, and I can go on and on.  The price is amazingly low for what this tablet can do and I have barely scratached the surface.  I understand that I can get a braille keyboard and even more features for those of us who are optically impaired.  The HDX is the fourth (4th) Kindle I have had--2 Keyboards (l was a gift to my sister) 1 Kindle Fire HD, and 1 Kindle HDX.  Each time I received/bought a new Kindle, I have donated the used Kindle to someone who will expand their education and love of reading.I have to add and huge pat on the back to Amazon!

So much easier and handier to carry.Its screen size give it an edge over a smart phone.  Everything is easier to see plus you can enlarge the view by dragging diagonally outwards on the screen.The reason I got the 4G LTE version is that I spend a lot of time where Wi Fi isn't available.  You need the ability to get online when you are out in the field and not at a wi-fi hotspot.-- My personal recommendation is to go with Verizon.  When it comes to 4G  I have found ATT just doesn't cut it in a lot of places. I found this out years ago when I made the mistake of getting a laptop modem that plugged into the USB outlet on the side of my computer.  I had been very happy with a Verizon 3G but thought I would upgrade to an ATT 4G.The ATT laptop modem was very slow...  almost as slow as dial up when it was out in rural areas.  It did OK hooked up to a Wi-Fi hotspot but wasn't worth much when it came to using the ATT wireless network.

I've been an iPad user for a few years and just wanted to try something different. Since I've bought the HDX I've barely touched my iPad.

Reading books and watching movies looks fantastic. The OS moves along with speed and I never notice a stutter. Even browsing with the HDX feels great. You can tell the Silk browser has come a long way. My only regret so far has been not getting the 8.9 inch instead of the 7 inch. Although, I may pick up the 8.9 soon anyway.If I had to knock one thing it would be what everyone else says, the limited app store.

Books are easy to read, Screen clarity is great, Movies play back beautiful (if you can get them downloaded), Mayday customer support is great and worked well when I used it.  Battery life is pretty good. Thin and user friendly.The Bad:The apps that they do allow you download are not like the Android ones I am used to.  Do not expect a ton of Android type apps.  You have little or no control over the information they can access on your kindle or amazon.  It seems to me that Amazon does not value the privacy of our personal information. Some Apps even make you agree to allow them to share PERSONAL INFORMATION with other advertisers and \"partners\" before allowing you to install.  If you don\u2019t agree, you cannot install.  The Facebook Application terms that are levied by amazon/Facebook are egregious, so I won\u2019t install that app.The Special offers are not so special...Basically they hold your screen saver hostage with advertisements and movie promos.  If you want to remove them, it will cost you a fee.  (I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.  It\u2019s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.  You must use it the way they want you to and accept their terms or don\u2019t use it.  Imagine buying a TV and not being able to watch certain channels, having automatic ads or commercials come on when you turn the TV on and finally, in order to use the TV you have to accept the fact that they will share the information you watch with certain advertisers.

I watch a lot of Amazon Prime video, and the Fire HDX display is a joy to look at. Sound is good too, or at least is much better than from my phone.

The nine-watt adapter is the one that really ought to be in the box to begin with.I like the tablet for why I bought it: watching Prime videos and reading Facebook and the Internet over my morning coffee.

I own the 2nd generation Kindle, followed by the original Kindle Fire, and then this one. When I opened the box, I couldn't believe how thin and light they had made it. The Kindle worked great. Loved the screen resolution. Much sharper than the original. Wireless seemed to have a better connection to the Internet as well. I downloaded a number of my books, music, and most of my apps. One thing I was surprised to discover was that some of the apps I paid for were not in the cloud for me to download. It would be one thing if it was a free app of the day, but was really hoping to move all my apps to this one as I was running out of room on the original and had to leave most of my apps in the cloud. Overall the new Kindle is a great little tablet. I have an iPad with 64GB and I have to say I like using this better since it is as sharp as my retina display and had almost all of my books and apps that I use. Plus it is a better overall value.One strange thing that I have noticed is that some of the apps may not be designed for the higher resolution screen. I have a word search app which you cannot see all the letters. On some other apps, the screen is smaller and hard to read. I will patiently await to see if the designers will address this. Not an issue, as it only happens on a few of them. Overall, I can access and use about 85% to 90% of the apps without any issues.Even though I have had a few challenges, I would still recommend this to others.

I know there was a problem with UPS over this holiday week--they were backed up, but this was no fault of Amazons.  The problem is that NO ONE wants to deal with the post office any more, so it seems everyone went with UPS or FedEx this holiday.  Amazon is the ONLY company I trust completely, I know I will get what I ordered, get it fast, and if I have to return anything it will be taken care of promptly and with no drama.

However, you need to go into buying a kindle HDX with eyes wide open: it is NOT a traditional tablet.  You are signing up for the Amazon ecosystem and the straightjacketing that involves.On the pro side: great price, brutally fast performance, great graphics, excellent selection of apps, books, and content in general.On the con side: no customizing the wallpapers or lock screens, and generally a black box system (short of rooting your system and voiding your warranty, there is little freedom to customize).  The biggest issue I have is no Google play store access.  (And the auto correct is a little overzealous).Overall I'd say:  -Price: 5/5  -Performance: 5/5  -Ease of use: 4.5/5 (takes some getting used to)  -customization: 1/5  -3rd party apps: 0/5  -Overall value:  4/5If you're looking for full-blown tablet powers and capabilities, do not buy the kindle.  If you want something n even as versatile as most smartphones, don't buy this.If you're looking for a great value with just about any apps you could reasonably want with fantastic library/ebook features teamed with excellent media player features tied to a nice browser and basic productivity tools, buy this now.Frankly, while I might miss the power user festures of having live wallpapers and custom lock screens - it's not why I got the kindle.  I got it to take advantage of the lending library, Amazon prime (eventually when I feel like taking the $79 annual hit), and the features it does offer.  The HDX isn't a camera or phone or \"I want to be everything\" device like an iPhone or iPad - it's more of an \"I want to be almost everything while remaining useful and not overwhelming\" device.While I've had some disappointing realizations about what the kindle does, I'm rather pleased overall...", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded expectations", "Author": "Paul T.", "ReviewID": "R1HUIWPVQ8ML9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased three HDX for my teen girls and they absolutly love them.

To tell the truth, I have been meaning to buy a similar reading device with tablet capabilities and couldn\u2019t figure out whether to buy the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HDX or the Sony Experia Z Ultra. Of course it\u2019s a matter of money. I am not made of the green stuff and even a $300 expense is big enough for me to think three times before buying something first in order to try it out. I read all the reviews, all the personal experiences put out by people, but still, it isn\u2019t the same as having the thing at home to play around with.This way works the best \u2013 they sent the 32GB version that I had chosen in less than 3 days.From the moment I got the package in my hands, I was in love. It is simply great \u2013 it does (almost) everything an IPAD does at a fraction of the cost.First, the cons \u2013 as I am sure there\u2019s ample information on the pros.1. The camera is ONLY on the front \u2013 there is no camera behind the screen. Makes skyping and taking pictures just a tad harder. Not a dealbreaker though, given all the other great stuff this little tablet does.2.  The page turning is by swipes only. When you are tucked in a cozy comforter on a cold night, you sometimes wish for right/left buttons \u2013 again, a minor annoyance.3. The weight \u2013 it\u2019s a tad heavier than the Sony Experia Z Ultra. But honestly, if losing weight means spending $400 extra, I can do without it!4. The included charger is really slow \u2013 I spent the extra money for the power charger. Only I didn\u2019t spend $19.99 on Amazon \u2013 I got it on eBay (new) from China, for $5.22, free shipping. Still waiting on it, but its guaranteed to arrive in a couple of days.  Works for me!5. I am an Amazon Prime buff \u2013 in fact Prime content is the prime reason why I chose the Kindle. It works great \u2013 only your \u2018watchlist\u2019 shows perhaps a quarter of what you have saved. If there is a way to see the entire watchlist, I haven\u2019t discovered it (yet).6. The carousel is annoying. It pops up unbidden whenever the Kindle\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t need to display exactly what books and movies I have purchased and would have preferred if there was a way to discreetly tuck them away only to be brought out when I wish.7. Browsing emails on yahoo can sometime be frustrating \u2013 scrolling is immensely difficult as the tablet, to me, seems too sensitive \u2013 whether I use a stylus or my fingers, it tends to pop open the email instead of allowing me to scroll thru the list.8. Downloading movies is not too cool \u2013 takes too long and if the Kindle powers off, there you go. Lost the portion that you had already downloaded and need to restart.That\u2019s the lot of semi-bad news, if you can call it that. To me, it\u2019s all stuff I can live with, nothing major. Here\u2019s the positive stuff:1. It is GREAT to watch a movie or a show on. The picture (we have a high-speed broadband Wi-Fi) is crystal clear; there is NO dithering or wait time as the video caches. It\u2019s like watching your own personal wrap around widescreen. You might think the size would be too small, but when you do watch it, the screen\u2019s placed close enough to your face comfortably and it actually seems like a much larger screen. Like I said, GREAT definition and clarity.2. The sound\u2019s amazing \u2013 clear, sharp and realistic. Even without headphones, it\u2019s powerful enough to give true surround effect and loud enough to make my wife complain. With headphones, you don\u2019t disturb anyone and the immersion is complete. BTW I bought JLabs Jbud J5 ear buds with this after doing some R&D; (read my review if you wish \u2013 I even bought an extra pair for the wife) and it\u2019s a perfect match right off the top. Tailor made for the Kindle Fire HDX.3. Reading books is easy, except that a couple of left/right/page turning buttons wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The light levels\u2019s just right and if a white page glares at you, voila, make the screen black, the letters white! Bunch of choices in terms of fonts (publisher\u2019s font included) and one can size them up or down as required.4. Browsing \u2013 the silk browser is really great. Fast, no nonsense stuff.5. People talk about the \u2018offers\u2019 as annoying \u2013 I find it extremely entertaining. Not just are the products good (no TV infomercials here) but also the entire ad experience is VERY unobtrusive. Flick it off whenever you wish and go back using the tab.6. Navigating the Kindle is great (except perhaps the carousel feature which I didn\u2019t like). Downloading documents and files, pictures etc is really fast, movies, not so much as explained in \u2018Cons\u2019.7. Best part is its portability. The 7\u201d is slightly too big to slip into the back pocket of my jeans and a jacket pocket is required. However if you do sort out the carrying issue, it\u2019s great to have along and works everywhere there\u2019s Wi-Fi.8. I took the Boingo Wi-Fi on the go service and so far haven\u2019t had too much trouble with it. Of course it\u2019s not as fast as it\u2019s touted to be and there is a tendency to hook you to the nearest network instead of the dedicated Boingo network, but hey, whatever works. I am not that finicky. It takes a bit of time to get hooked, but once it does, it\u2019s a strong link and stays hooked unless you move a few blocks.9. The case and paraphernalia. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $50-60 on the recommended sleeves and cases. I bought the Fintie faux leather package and for $20 approx, got a nice collection of stylus, sleeve, extra USB cable and some other small stuff. Works even better if you just buy the Fintie case for about $9.99. You definitely need a bigger case to stuff all those bits and pieces though \u2013 the charger, USB, stylus, headphones etc. I also bought a screen protector and a TPU Gel soft skin cover to be used in parallel with my Fintie case as added protection. It\u2019s a tighter fit, but works perfectly.All in all, it\u2019s a GREAT purchase and I am loving it. Will be happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

The video quality was awesome. It was the video that they had on the demo model that was crap. Yes the new HDX models have that blue border when reading books. The solution to that is changing the background color to back with white letters. If there is one thing negative I can say about this particular model its the size. While using it to browse the web, I realized maybe the 8.9 model would be a touch better just bc it is bigger. But if you are used to using a cell phone to browse the web then its not really an issue bc u would be used to swiping around a web page. And one more thing. Why not put a second camera on this thing like the 8.9? That would make more sense. That would make the HDX 7 awesome! IMO, the only choice you have to make is which HDX to buy.

May", "ReviewID": "R2AQU6NH2GG4A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the seven-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (64 GB, Wi-Fi, Includes Special Offers) today and have been using it now for about four hours. This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

Baca \"happy mommy\"", "ReviewID": "RTV91WXMRQCC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A Kindle was not even on my list of possible tablets to get. I was interested in the Samsung Note 8 (played with for a little bit at Best Buy). But Amazon offered me a 30-day free trial with a Kindle of my choice and I found that this was too tempting to pass up! Being an Amazon Prime member is awesome and it's truly the best way to get the full Kindle HDX experience! My 30-days are almost up and I plan on keeping my Kindle HDX. Here are my reasons why:1. MayDay. How awesome is this! I used this feature because I was having issues with one of my apps. The attendant came up as soon as soon as I pressed connect and was very patient and understanding while I was trying to explain my issue. Eventually I did have to get on the phone and speak with someone else but the attendant stay with me even while I was discussing my problem with the rep to make sure the rep understood what the issue was. This is by far the best thing about this device hands down!2. Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member then you already know that you can get free movies and shows but if you have a Kindle device you can also get free books through the lending library (this was new to me!) and there are a tones of books to choose from. Going back to the movies and shows, I like that I have the option of downloading them onto my Kindle for travel (great feature for kids!) or going places where I know I won\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi.3. Shopping experience. I shop a lot through Amazon (which is why I am a Prime member) and this device just makes it incredibly easy to do just that. I think the Amazon coin option for purchasing apps is a great idea and have used them on a few apps for my kids.The only down sides of the Kindle for me are:1. There\u2019s no true YouTube app. I love YouTube and watch it pretty regularly. There are ones available in the kindle store but the best one I found so far (vTube?) doesn\u2019t quite function the same as the Google app on my iPhone. You have option of viewing YouTube through the Silk browser but a dedicated app that functioned more like (or better than!) the Google app would be ideal.2. You can\u2019t customize your home screen. You have this huge carousel thing at the top of the tablet\u2019s home screen and some (random?) apps that are at the bottom. I would like the option of at least customizing this screen since it\u2019s the first thing I see when the tablet unlocks.3. The ads are annoying. I wanted to see how I would respond to having the ads on the tablet to know if it was worth spending the extra $15 dollars to have them taken off. It is! It\u2019s annoying! My kids have seen some ads geared towards kids and ask for the stuff! We watch Netflix, Amazon, and ITunes content exclusively specifically to avoid advertisements and this has reminded me why we do! Pay the $15!For the price and all the extras you get with being a Prime member, keeping the Kindle HDX is a no brainer for me!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Geek", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "RJP6U97N8ABF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yeah, totally geeked out on this one.I bought this for an upcoming trip.

The review lacking that one more star is because the device is somewhat a standalone device with respect to my TV, stereo, and laptop. There is no communication without hooking up a cable. I'm sure I could get copious guidance that if I downloaded some app or service or buy another communication device then I'd be set, but then that is not just the Kindle that I'd be reviewing.

I also have an ipad 2 and a ipad mini.  The display on this device is gorgeous and very user friendly.  As soon as I turned it on it was ready to go.  I watched a couple of episodes of Alpha House and it was the easiest thing in the world to go to videos and select.  It was instantly there for me to watch and enjoy.  The sound was fantastic and I only had the volume at 1/2 which was plenty loud.  I decided to go with the 30 day free trial of amazon prime and I'll be keeping that since I love the instant streaming and selection.  I also have a paperwhite kindle and was reading a book (Sycamore Row) and went and checked it out on the kindle fire and it was perfectly synced with no problems and no effort on my part.  I also loaded Words with Friends which I was playing on my mini ipad and that synced up with ease.  I couldn't resist the mayday button and I had a question which was responded to and answered by a very pleasant gal quickly.  That's enough to make me love it more since I hate voice mail and pushing a zillion buttons to get to customer service.  I've downloaded some music and everything I already had loaded in the cloud was available for me to snatch and use.  I'm so happy with my purchase and think it's worth every penny I spent on it.  I did get the 16gb with the ads (which don't bother me at all).  This is the first amazon device I've purchased that I've not opted out and paid not to have ads.  The camera isn't an issue since I don't plan on using this for taking pictures since I have other devices to do that with.  Even if you have an ipad this is a great device to have.

I've been using mine for a little over a week. It is a great replacement for my old Kindle Fire. I've read in the Kindle Forum that some people have had a problem with 'blue fringe' on the screen edges.  I noticed it when I first started using it but I don't notice it anymore unless I specifically look for it. Typically I read books with black background and white text. I have an iPad 3 with Retina display, too, that I am also happy with but for reading I definitely prefer the Kindle.Pros:01. It is very light and thin.02. Awesome display. The display is very crisp. It's very easy to read books, magazines and movies look as good as they do on my HD TV.03. The home page and Carousel are much improved. The home page area below the Carousel took a little getting used to but I like it now.04. The new options in the App Store, Book Store, Music Store, etc.05. Much easier to add items, such as books or apps, to wish lists.06. Silk Browser. Didn't like it on my old Kindle Fire but it's much improved on the Fire HDX, imho.07. I like the book recommendations displayed under the books in the Carousel. They aren't obtrusive.08. The new Shop tab.09. The (new) native calendar app.10. The improved native email and contacts apps which can be synched with my Google account.11. Mayday! I've used it a couple of times and it is easy and convenient.12. The physical volume rocker control.13. The charging port is much tighter than on my previous Kindle Fire.14. Being able to display the battery percentage with out an app.15. The camera is pretty cool. Don't see myself using it much, if at all, but it's cool that it's there.Cons:01. Even with a cover it is sometimes difficult to hold for long periods of time. I have arthritis in both hands so that may only be a problem for me.02. It is occasionally glitchy. I've had to do a hard reboot a couple of times. Hopefully today's update will take care of that.03. The Amazon App store. I realize this isn't a 'con' of the Kindle Fire HDX but wanted to add that in my review. The Google Play Store (for my phone) and ITunes (for my iPad) have much more to offer.If I think of, or encounter, any other cons I will add them to my review.My Kindle received the latest update today and it added some cool upgrades. The new lock screen is nicer now that it displays the number of unread emails, battery percentage, date and time and new wallpaper. The GoodReads integration is really useful and the ability to create Collections....at last! Smart look up is cool...not earth shattering cool but cool nonetheless. The alarm is nice although I don't know that I'll use it. Second screen is a nice function (assuming it works) but I don't have a Samsung TV or PS3. The print function is a really cool, convenient function although as of yet it doesn't work with my Canon printer. The Canon app is crap. 1 Tap Archive might not be something that I'll use but I suppose it could be useful. The Amazon Cloud Drive is very, very useful. It's an easy, convenient way to move photos and documents from computer to Kindle and mobile phone to Kindle.I received the original Kindle as a Christmas gift one year and the original Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift the following year and was very happy with both of them.

Wireless connects well and the tablet streams videos without a hitch.  I'm very excited to see how Amazon is going to take advantage of the Miracast technology built into the tablet.  I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.  If you have any fear of using a tablet, the Mayday function is a welcome addition.  If you're buying the tablet for a technophobe, Mayday will be a great help to them if they have questions or problems.  This function is a quantum leap forward in customer service.

Yes, you can access these services through the webpages but c'mon...get over this... competition? pissing match?... whatever it is with Google and get the apps a lot of people want on the device.  They released devices with gps chips....and no mapping software.  I used my iPad all the time for geocaching, saving tracks, as a chartplotter, as a gps, you name it.  When I saw the Kindle Fire HDX had gps FINALLY (for an extra $150 for the cellular version) I jumped on it and even  sold my ipad.  I was that ready to bail off the good ship Apple.  Well, guess what...I just bought another iPad.  :-(  Three things I do most often on my tablet is 1. GPS apps 2. Email and 3. Web browsing.  Two of the three are more difficult or impossible on the HDX.  Reading is a distant 4th...I have a Kindle KB too.Another thing I was all excited about was getting a BT OBD2 scanner and using the great Torque app on my HDX.  Nope.  Half of the best Android apps are not in the Amazon Appstore.  Yeah, I guess I can get it from Google Play and sideload it, but I'm sure Amazon has the BT function crippled so it won't work anyway.If your primary purpose in a tablet is to buy Amazon books and play Angry Birds you're all set.  If you want some other functions you should probably look elsewhere.I really, really want to love this thing....I love the screen, the feel, the interface...I don't even wanna send it back even though it doesn't do most of what I wanted.

Figured I'd wait and see how much they might improve them and I am really glad I did now.  I absolutely love mine, was truly impressed with all the functions this tablet has.  I already have the Samsung galaxy 10.1 tablet with google, apps, so I was not going to miss the fact that this one did not.  The picture quality, like others have stated is fantastic, along with many other things such as Mayday, which I have not tried.  Thought I would probably have to use Mayday since this was my first kindle, nope.  Took it out of the box, charged it up-mine was at 80% when I plugged it in, and within 2 hours was at 100%.  Have not used all the functions yet that this tablet has since I've only had it one day, but I will get ALOT of use out of it for sure.  I mainly wanted a 7 inch tablet that I could carry with me that wasn't heavy that you could read a book, watch a movie, access the internet etc. when I am out somewhere.  To me, the setup was easy which was a great thing for me.  As far as the purple haze everyone is complaining about-it is barely noticeable to me and very faint on the white screen and does not show up most of the time on mine if that is any help.  Also I am glad I ordered the 64GB-will definitely be putting stuff on it.  The orgami case is a perfect match for this tablet also, so I wouldn't hesitate to order it.

On the downside, I was a bit confused when I first turned it on and could not find the MayDay feature.  However, I soon realized that the operating system hadn't been updated since July,  Once updated, everything worked wonderfully.  It's a nice feeling to turn on a device and it's automatically connected to your account and information.The screen is beautiful and the the processor is very snappy,  I wanted something more compact for reading and traveling.  I like something the size of a paperback.  My primary tablet is an iPad.  I was able to sync my calendar and contacts with my iCloud account using CalDav.  No problem.One of the criticisms I've heard is that you are bound to the native apps on the Amazon store.  The Silk Browser is a much improved native browser.  Loads fast.  Works well.  Like my contacts and calendar I wanted some continuity with my iPad and Mac environment, so I side-loaded the Chrome browser.  Works perfectly.  Instructions for side loading and using CalDav are all readily available online.  However, if you are not comfortable with computers, stick with Silk.  It's good, it's integrated and it's straightforward.  However, if you like what you like...you can side-load.I'm surprised at  the sound. Given the size of the speakers in this small form-factor, the sound is surprisingly good and at a decent intensity.The one feature I'd like to see is an improved method for organizing apps.  However, this is a device designed to consume media and that focus is reflected in the interface design.

Amazon pushed me to Google movies and other tablets with business features.However, the new ability to download for no additional cost much of its Prime content for off line viewing for up to 30 days for each downloaded movie/show and the new wireless video display via Miracast was too much to pass up, or at least try.Incidentally, I bought the new Nexus 7 at the same time but returned it because you can not stream movies download to the unit.  One is required to delete the saved Google purchased movie from the unit and stream via the internet.  GO FIGURE.  Im not required to do this with my other android tablet.  FYI, you have to perform the os upgrade for the Nexus 7 to stream.I bought the 16GB, 7 inch HDX.  I did not notice the purple hazing some have reported.  Sixteen gigs seems to be okay because you have the option of what quality movie you download.  I think I will be able to save 15 movies or so, more than enough for a weekend.The display is excellent, the unit charges rather quickly and battery life good so far.I used a Netgear Push2TV to connect wirelessly to the TV.  It works great even without the latest Netgear update.  I didnt even notice a lag.  Only gripe is you have to enter into settings, then display and then connect, versus other units have a mirror connect when you swipe down the notifications.  You can disconnect more easily.NOTE OF CAUTION IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE CONNECTING:  All of these Netgear Push 2TV 3000's are not created equal.  I have three of these units, two that I have had awhile and connect to WIDI, though I have given up WDii and Windows 8, but wont connect to Miracast. These units say they have accepted and been updated, but they arent.I bought another unit two days ago and while it wont update, it works with both Miracast and WIDI (Windows 7).  If your screens simply instructs you to connect your PC/Tablet/Phone, you have the right model.  If you are asked to switch between Miracast v Widi, probably not gonna work for you with Miracast.  Hope this helps.I streamed documents and powerpoint, too.  Dropbox is not available, but Amazon's Cloud Drive may be a work around.I downloaded several movies for off line viewing on a road trip and the unit worked great.I expect I will buy a couple of more as stocking stuffers.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best in class", "Author": "Peter J. Weiss", "ReviewID": "R2APBTNQ2YD910", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The kindle fire hdx exudes quality in every aspect of the device. I can honestly say that there is no other tablet that provides the value for the cost.Screen: 5 out of 5In order to really appreciate the screen, you need to download at \"best quality\" an hd show or movie from amazon prime. Then you need to compare it to an hd video on another tablet. The screen color and clarity is absolutely amazing.Sound: 5 out of 5Coming from an Apple device owner, I never expected much for sound quality from tablets until I got the kindle fire hdx. The sound is crystal clear and loud! I don't quite understand how it works because I have tried covering the sound ports but the sound is still loud like it may be coming from around the screen as well. Try it, you will be impressed.Build Quality: 5 out of 5You can tell that this tablet has a magnesium frame built in. There is zero flex when holding or moving the tablet around. Compared to the Nexus 7 which also has a rubberized grip, you can tell that the nexus 7 is plastic and the kindle is metal on the inside. The build quality rivals the iPad mini.Processing: 5 out of 5Phenomenal speed doing any task you can imagine. Everything is instant with no delay at all. Loading up videos on youtube is much faster than on an iPad, which is most likely due to the dual antenna wifi for the kindle hdx. There is zero stutter playing hd games like Fifa Soccer 14 and watching 1080p videos.Battery Life: 5 out of 5This was the one aspect I expected to suffer being that it is an android based device. Battery life never seems to live up to what the manufacturer claims because android seems to just drain the battery. I have been using the device for a couple days and so far, it really does live up to the claims. After watching several hours of video I still find the battery life around 80%. Charging is also quick. I expect that it will only take a couple hours to go from 0% to 100% charged.Overall: 5 out of 5This is THE tablet to own for 2013-2014. Amazon has set the price of the kindle fire hdx to dominate the tablet market. Unlike other tablets such as the nexus 7, the kindle fire hdx doesn't sacrifice build quality to bring the cost down. This tablet should honestly be $329 starting like the iPad mini, but Amazon is pricing the tablet to acquire market share and make back money from app, video, book, and Amazon purchases. Even if your not a prime member, you should buy this tablet and become a prime member because it is very worth it.

If I hadn't been a satisfied Amazon customer for the past 15 years I would have returned my tablet and demanded my money back. But I knew from past experience that this is not how Amazon usually operates, so I didn't give up. When I ordered the tablet and accessories I was promised promotional credits plus amazon coins plus bonus credits for some of the app purchases. Half of the credits promised did not show up in my account, and when I tried to use the credits I had, additional credits were deducted that should not have been. After many calls to Amazon, it was finally discovered that a computer glitch was the cause of the problem and it was corrected. My first tablet was difficult to use and some of the menu options were missing and I didn't know it. The online help files did not include descriptions of problems that can occur with a defective tablet so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. (It would be extremely helpful if the help files could be downloaded as a PDF) After many calls to Amazon, I was finally transferred to a very unpleasant technician who determined my tablet was defective and sent me a brand new replacement tablet exactly like the one I had. When I asked about all the books and apps I had downloaded into the device he told me they would be in the new tablet when I got it. He lied.......the tablet was empty just like the original, but it was a new replacement so I didn't complain. It took me 3 days to reload 246 books and 65 apps into the new tablet........it would be helpful if there were a \"select all\" option in the cloud but there isn't and if the downloading is not monitored it stops after a short time. I now have a Kindle Fire HDX that works as it should and no longer regret my purchase! This tablet works extremely well and the graphics quality is amazing!

If you own a smart phone, you will adapt quickly, but if you are a standard lap top user, this think will make you want to pull your hair out and requires some practice.The worst thing about it is that it is set up to sell you stuff on Amazon, so instead of guiding you to free services like Hulu unpaid, it takes you to services you have to pay for and won't let you access the free ones unless you are really persistent and crafty about it.It is really easy to hit the wrong button and be convince to download or buy something you don't want.Other than that, the video quality is fantastic, the screen, though small is easy to read and can be enlarged without compromising things too much and this think has better stereo than my boom box and gets really good battery life.The camera is not very good. It takes decent pix, but only forward facing, so you cannot see what you are taking a picture of unless you are doing a selfie!I like the thing and it has good speed and connection and quality audio and video, but the touch screen type is awkward and slow and the learning curve pretty steep even for someone who has used computers for years, but in a limited capacity it is a fun thing to have and well worth the purchase.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the product, but...", "Author": "Kathleen L.

First of all it's only there on a complete white screen. Secondly, it's barely there, and you have to look for it. It's non in your main focal point, so you're never going to REALLY see it. I can't say this enough: It's very minimal! If no one mentioned it, you probably wouldn't even notice that it's there. The other things that the Kindle is great at completely overshadow this.The app store has plenty, and it's only getting more. With a little research you can get whatever Android app you want. For example, I like Chrome for web browsing, and I was able get the app on my Kindle in a couple of minutes.Being a Prime member, and able to download prime instant content is awesome.

I wanted to try out the Kindle since I've read so many reviews that mentioned that it was a perfect tablet for anyone who had a Prime membership.The tablet itself is pretty comfortable to hold. Some other reviews mentioned the ill placed power and volume rocker on the back of the tablet, but I found it intuitive after a few minutes of use.The screen is where the tablet really shines. HD movies looked, and the speakers were some of the loudest I found on a sub 8 inch tablet.The OS is quick and responsive, but the whole carousel layout feels a bit cumbersome, but it's merely a minor gripe.I think the only major flaw I found on this tablet was the lack of micro SD expansion. I purchased the 16 GB, and I was immediately bothered to realize that I only had around 10 GB of actual storage to use. 16 GB's of minimum storage should have been removed a long time ago. With HD streaming being the preeminent way of enjoying movies, it should have come as no surprise that most 1080p movies were going to be larger than the 10 GB that remained. I don't see why they couldn't add a small slot for an expansion. This is where the HDX falls to the Samsung Note 8.0.Other than that, it's a nice little tablet... I do have a little buyer's remorse.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.

The light weight is another benefit. Internet access is smooth and quick and accessing my email and calendar is a user friendly process.

All of the Fires have some flaws, that is to be expected.  BUT and heres the BIG BUT.  The fire, first and foremost is supposed to be for reading.  If it does not do this one simple thing well then why have it?  The blue ring literally hurt my eyes, to the point that I had to set on on dark mode to read.  Why have a Reader that hurts to read?  Every one that I have ever seen reviewed had this same issue. I figured that \"they\" were all being picky.  No sir, it was horrible.  I couldnt watch movies either because on any screen that was white, there was that blue tint.  In the end I returned it and am now using the first gen HD7.

I love it! It is much lighter weight ,a feature I was looking for,and the playback is amazing. The buffering during movies I've rented is minimal. The picture on a couple rentals was not the greatest, but then again on others was crystal clear. I use my kindle in the same manner I use my iPad. It searches the net very well, e mail great, music playback nice. Keyboard responds well to touch. Lastly I had to use the Mayday button for an issue on the keyboard. I somehow split it into 2 sections making half the board to the left the other half to the right, leaving a gap in the middle of the screen. I touched mayday and viola!  A screen appeared with a live feed from a tech ! He was courteous knowledgeable and marked my keyboard with a blue arrow showing me exactly where to go to fix the keyboard display. It was awesome.  It took maybe 3 minutes. Great addition. I have one gripe though. I' m not seeing my amazon account in its entirety on the kindle, nor is the order experience the same as it is from an iPad or PC. And I feel the amazon prime account has changed. From the kindle I couldn't find much in the way of prime movies. I was directed to other apps such as Netflix . Is Amazon getting out of the \"movie business\"? Experience with the book rental was similar . Not complaining really just saying.i love amazon!

I find very useful the text-to-speech to listen to the technical books I have to read as I do other tasks, like during morning ablutions.  I like the placement of the on/off switch, and the volume up/down switches, but the power connection being on an angle threw me.  I thought something inside got bent, but that I found out was by design.  Not sure why that is.  Really like the Mayday feature, this was a game changer for me, and had to use it right off the bat because my first HDX didn't deliver the right side audio channel when I plugged in my apple earbuds, but the HDX audio was fine withOUT the earbuds plugged in, not good for viewing movies in a public place. My older first edition KindleFire worked fine with my Apple earbuds, but not with the HDX.  With the Mayday tech, tried different settings, different earbuds, unplugging/ replugging earbuds into HDX audio port, various power cycling, resetting the HDX to default, escalated to deeper tech support, nothing worked, so Amazon actually sent me a new HDX replacement device and I returned mine that had no right side audio channel using earbuds.  The replacement new HDX device came in with  its right side audio channel working with the Apple earbuds!  I am very pleased.  The new technological advancements of this new HDX Kindle are very positive and noteworthy, and I would say it is worth upgrading to this HDX version, but for these advancements, there is a cost - battery energy supply gets used up sooner than the previous version Kindle Fire.  That is ok, and understandable for all the graphical/ sound enhancements and back end support of them in this new KindleFire HDX version.  Hopefully battery technology will catch up soon to keep up with the needs of our advancing electronic toys that are a driving force in technology.  I am very happy with this device.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "DOA", "Author": "Ocean \"Ocean\"", "ReviewID": "R1NZLJXZW1S8WO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First HDX was dead in arrival.

Cook", "ReviewID": "R2XQWM0FEHYNPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this Kindle as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive. If I had it to do over I'd probably opt for the smaller (less expensive) companion to my ASUS Transformer.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great buy for anyone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CA70OZ41J0W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome holds a great charge for battery easy and simple to use anyone can use it lightweight and fun great buy", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ODI2KL0Q7YAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say about this device.

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now. It is, essentially, a wall plug in with a USB port. I can use any USB to mini USB cord to charge it, and the cord it came with can plug into the charger or my computer with no problem. I remember getting the charger for the Gen One Kindle Fire and having to go out and buy my own USB to mini USB cord in order to transfer files manually (instead of by email) or use my computer to charge it and that was something I found relatively disappointing.

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications.

Kindle is really a ease way to move around and learn.I owned a Nexxxus tablet before, gave it to my husband. It felt less personal.Kindle and connection with Amazon.com. I feel connected and great support.Sadly within 4 weeks my Kindle HDX just quit . Didn't turn on anymore. Amazon.com Kindle support was very helpful.Via phone they tried to boost it or whatever they did. But it did not work. So we agreed that I needed to ship it back.Here is where it becomes a bit odd.I told them I do not want a refurbished one. I paid for a new one and would like to have a new one.Though the agent agreed with me and assured me, when the replacement arrived, it said right on the box, refurbished one.Wow. But Amazon.com always is willing to work things out. Unfortunately in this case, the only thing that was left to do was to return the broken one, the replacement one and now order a brand new one.Apparently they are not sending out new ones to replace one.I will keep an eye on the sales. Hopefully I can purchase one soon.Love the HDX, love the service via amazon.com, but don't get that I can't get a new one as a replacement since I paid for a new one and it was only 4 weeks later that I had a problem.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Renee L Browell", "ReviewID": "R1MCY0RYIOVX42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can do just about everything on this and I absolutely love it.

This tablet compares favorably to both, but is primarily useful if you are a significant consumer of Amazon products, and particularly if you are an Amazon prime member.\\In terms of design, it is a small, light unit.  It is not quite as thin in the hand as the Nexus 7 (2013) is, but it nevertheless feels very slim and light.  The shape of the device is less oblong than the Nexus, and seems more designed to approximate the Kindle size for book and other text reading, while flipping it to landscape mode provides a more than satisfactory width for movies and other videos.  The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.  The screen is bright and the high resolution is basically the same as that of the Nexus (less than the iPad Air, but that has a bigger screen).The operating system is based on Android but is essentially Amazon's modified version of it.  It is very fast and responsive, and everything is easily accessible with responsive swipes.  Unlike other Android-based tablets, however, you do not have access (directly) to Google Play.  This is because the Kindle is a device that is designed to be used primarily with Amazon-provided content.  If you are a big user of Amazon, and especially a Prime member (and therefore have access to the free prime movies and book lending and so on), this is ideal.  If, however, you are tied heavily into one of the other ecosystems (Apple or Google), then you may find yourself frustrated in terms of having your content (e.g., music) tied to another system.  Note that if you have that music downloaded to a computer, you can upload it into Amazon's cloud and listen to it through the Kindle as well, but that's a few extra steps you may not need to deal with if using a different tablet.The bottom line for me when comparing this tablet to others is that the potential buyer needs to understand (1) what am I going to be looking to use a tablet for and (2) what ecosystem am I tied into already, and to what extent?In my opinion, tablets aren't great for productivity as compared with laptops, but if you are looking for a productivity tablet you're likely best served with something like a Galaxy Note 10 or a Surface.  If, like most people, you use tablets mainly to consume media -- either movies or websites or books/magazines, etc., then it really comes down to what content provider you are most tied in with, because there are limits in terms of being able to access the content of the other providers from each device to some degree.  This applies in particular to people with significant music libraries that may be tied to iTunes at this point (music seems to be where many people stockpile more media than movies which tend to be rented).  Similarly, if you are heavily tied into Google's services (not just Google Play, but the rest of them as well), the Nexus may be more appealing because it directly links into all of them seamlessly.  However, if you are an Amazon content person, and especially an Amazon Prime member, this Kindle is a great device because it similarly links into the Amazon system seamlessly, and is a joy to use with prime movies, books and similar types of content.From my personal perspective, I find this my go-to tablet for content consumption at this point.  I am also tied into the Google ecosystem, but I mostly use my Android phone (or laptop) to interface with that, and view this device as my primary interface with my Amazon content.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "love this game,very addicting", "ReviewID": "R3PC9ALVKW82HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.

It's barely there, and certainly not an issue.While I cannot go to the Google app store, I've had no problem finding what I need.  I found a nice Gmail app (Tab for Gmail) on the Amazon App Store. The Silk Internet browser works just fine.  I was able to get my favorite games (Flow Free and Candy Crush Saga), and there is no shortage of others.When I started up the tablet and input my Amazon log-on info, it synched up with all the books I've obtained in the past from Amazon, and had on my Kindle e-reader (old version with the keyboard on it).Setting up my e-mail accounts with the provided e-mail browser was quick and easy.So far, I haven't had to read directions, but I did buy an after market instruction manual from Amazon, which I intend to use.  Amazon has a Kindle support page on their web site, with loads of good info.  Though I've not had the need for it yet, the Kindle Fire HDX has the \"Mayday\" option for free, instant help from a real live person.The speed of the tablet is very fast. Moving from one screen or app to the other, or changing pages is FAST.  No problem with connecting with my Wi-Fi at home, or at work.The display is excellent, and very sharp.  We also have an Apple iPad Air, 10\" size.  The display on the Kindle Fire HDX is just as sharp as the iPad.  I see no difference.I spent the $15 and turned off the \"Special Offers\", and disabled the suggested apps thing just below the carousel view.  There are instructions on-line if you Google something like \"turn off special offers on Kindle Fire HDX.\"  No problem.  All gone.The tablet comes with a $5.00 credit at the Amazon app store. They call it \"coins\", and you get 500 of them to use when buying \"paid\" apps.  Once spent, you can re-up the coins for future use.Things you buy, like paying for apps, books, and everything else you might like, goes against your \"one click\" ordering account on Amazon.com.  Very handy, making it quite easy to spend money if you like.There is a good variety of cases/covers available for these tablets, many available on Amazon.com.  I have the Poetic Slimline case, in black.  Great case or cover, for a great price.I haven't found any negatives yet, and I don't regret getting the Kindle Fire HDX at all.  In many respects, I like the Kindle Fire HDX more than the Apple iPad (which is a great tablet - but about 3x the price - for one with 32GB). The price for the 16GB version is very reasonable.  I lucked out and got mine for free, using up my credit card bonus points I had earned.The battery seems to hold up quite well.  I'd estimate that I ran mine about 9-10 hours before charging it back up from only 5% left.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Kindle Fire HDX, but HATE customer service for Electronic Arts/Origin.", "Author": "Robin Setliff", "ReviewID": "R2R7ZCSPM7USE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire HDX, but absolutely hate that you can't get any answers from Electronic Arts/origin regarding a forgotten password.

I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere.

First, it IS a fantastic device.  Incredibly versatile, lightweight, with an amazing screen.  I have always had (it's probably me) trouble using Apple products, as for me, they simply aren't as intuitive as others, and I don't like I-Tunes, so the HDX was a logical choice.  It is very reasonable in cost, and for those who need it, the Mayday feature is sure to be a big hit.  I've used it two times, (could have easily found the answer to my question myself, but wanted to give it a try) and the help Amazon gives IS all it's cracked up to be.  Very convenient. This device is super fast, and dependable.  I won't carry a cell phone, but with this, you can load on a free app from MagicJack, and you're good to go!  Free phone calls are always great, right?  So, why not five stars? As with most tablets, there are the occasional hang-ups while online, mostly while trying to view a video, say from Yahoo.  Can be frustrating if you're not ready to just let it go.....just don't need to see it that badly.  It can lock up the device.  Some videos DO work, but not all. Not a biggie though, just disconnect, get back on, and move on.  Hey, this can happen on my laptop, and who amongst us hasn't experienced that?  This aside, this thing is so easy to use, if you can work your laptop, or desktop, you won't have to learn a thing......no jumping through hoops like I-Tunes to load music......just drag and drop it from your laptop, and voila! Very intuitive. I bought, and suggest the 32gig model, just to be certain you'll have plenty of memory, as you cannot upgrade the memory.  The sound from the built in speakers is nothing short of amazing, and of course through the headphone jack as well.  Maybe I should have given it FIVE stars.  One last thing......I almost was set to pay for the 'NO OFFERS' (which you can also do at a later time if you don't do it when you first buy the Kindle) but was glad I didn't. The offers are GREAT, the screens shots are brilliant, and you find yourself looking forward to them when you power up.

Hockenbarger", "ReviewID": "R2QWZOMX7VK7Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  I love this tablet.  I've got multiple other tablets in the house for use by the 7 kids who have all but abandoned television to watch YouTube and other streaming media technologies, so I'm not new to tablet technology by any stretch of the imagination.The hardware is great. I wasn't sure about the 7\" size, but have found that I love it.  I certainly think larger tablets have their place, but the convenience of the 7\" form factor is really nice for media consumption (reading books and magazines, watching streaming video, etc.).  It fits in the hand easily, and for smaller kids the lighter weight and smaller size makes it easier for them to use when I want to loan it to one of the littler ones.  Battery life is okay, I went from full charge to around 60% after watching three TV show episodes back to back.  The display is crisp, colors bright; blacks could be a little deeper, but it's a 7\" tablet not a 4K TV!  Sound is good, but I still question why the only vendor on the planet that gets that you should put speakers on the front of the device is HTC.  This is SUCH a no-brainer and if you want the strongest possible device for media consumption, put the speakers on the front!  That aside, the back-side speakers are pretty effective and sound is crisp with a pretty good range.I like the fact the system has 5GHz WiFi, my other tablets are all 2.4GHz, so bumping up out of that spectrum was nice, especially for streaming performance.The skin on top of Android is one of the better ones I've seen, certainly better than Asus or Samsung's skins (but I haven't gotten an opportunity to play with the MagazineUX yet, which is similar to Windows tiles which I really like).  I'd like to see more configurability for the carousel.  I haven't quite figured out the logic behind how things get added to or removed from it.  For example I view a Prime Instant Video and it shows up in the carousel, but after I pause it and look at something else, it pulls it out.  I'd like to pin Prime IV to the carousel permanently, and I don't see a way to do that.Of course having access to all the ebooks I've been reading via the Kindle app on my phone is awesome, and my wife loves the Newsstand feature.One nit about the software is that it doesn't interface properly to my Prime Instant Video, particularly my Watchlist.  For some reason it isn't reading that properly, so it doesn't see that I've got all the seasons of Doctor Who, for example queued up for viewing in my Watchlist like it does if I log into the website.  Again, a nit.The main reason this doesn't get 5 stars is actually a huge issue to me.  Not having Google Play access is almost a show-stopper.  The refusal of Amazon to work with Google and play in the ecosystem relegates the Fire to a media interface device, and it cannot become my primary tablet device.  So instead of going into my backpack when I travel on business, it sits on my bedside table for media viewing and reading at night, because my larger Samsung tablet can do everything the Kindle does and more, albeit in a larger and heavier device.  The Amazon app store is simply deficient and weak compared to Google Play, and there are a LOT of apps I use that are not available, particularly around system administration.  Of course not having the native Google apps is a big kludge, especially for a person who has carried an Android phone for years, has multiple Android tablets, and is a big fan of that ecosystem.  Even Samsung understands that not allowing the native Android apps is a bad thing, and while they push their custom versions of things, still allow you to use Google Play.  If Amazon decided to go 10\" or so on a tablet, I wouldn't buy it for this reason alone.  Since I'm a geek, I don't mind having multiple devices, but for friends and family that want a single device for things beyond media consumption, I cannot recommend the Fire.  For non-technical users who want nothing BUT media consumption, the device rocks.And yes, I know I can sideload or I could root, but I don't want to have to go to that effort across multiple devices just to get proper Android access.Overall a very nice tablet implementation.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best on The Market", "Author": "Cindy Clark", "ReviewID": "R1ZA72FAD48COE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning several tablets,cheap to rated the best.

I had a relationship with it. Let\u2019s face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn\u2019t really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn\u2019t work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don\u2019t by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn\u2019t have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn\u2019t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It\u2019s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn\u2019t as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don\u2019t think this is a big issue to most people.  I\u2019m dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can\u2019t read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn\u2019t an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn\u2019t last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn\u2019t needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn\u2019t bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I\u2019m just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn\u2019t care to pay to not have them. I\u2019m really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don\u2019t.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn\u2019t for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I\u2019m sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.  It seems about a year is when the big price change happens.Good luck with your new decisions!", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "I had a Kindle Fire before", "Author": "Katgirl2", "ReviewID": "R3KM077T57GA51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used my Kindle Fire for 2 years before getting my Kindle Fire HDX.

The new Fire is harder to read a book on because of the glare of the pages.  Much prefer the old one's easy on the eyes screen.  I don't like the dictionary at all.  You have to page through from a to z to find the word you want.  Waste of time.  I don't much care for the games that are available.  I like word games.  I play several every day such as crossword and Scrabble on my old Kindle.  The choice of games on Fire are mostly juvenile ones with sound effects which are irritating and most of them will only let you play a game or two without paying the company who created them more money.  On the old Kindle you pay for a game up front and play to your heart's content.  I also don't like how frequently it needs recharging - even when it's just sitting around doing nothing it needs a recharge in no time.  I do like that I can pick up my email without starting up the computer. I can check it while I'm sitting around watching TV, etc.  However, you can't trash the email on your computer from your Fire, so you end up trashing it from the Kindle, then when you get into your computer, the emails are still there and you have to go through the process again..  I also don't like the front only camera.  It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.  Perhaps going up to the next level would have been better, but that was a great deal more expensive.  I'd say this is an okay device if you like to play the games a lot, don't use the dictionary very much, either don't read a lot of books or have young eyes.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

I didn't need a high end laptop or a desktop with an i7 processor or any kind of powerhouse. I just needed something with good processing power, an HD display, and something simple so that my mother could browse the web and watch Netflix or something. The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else. After registering the device it was good to go. The quality is superb, transitioning between apps and things are easy and fluid, and it even has a headphone jack so you can hear media in peace or without disturbing others. The only thing my mother wanted, though, was to play Papa Pear Saga and it isn't compatible with the Kindle Fire.All in all this product was more than enough for my mother. She was happy with the product and I was happy to see my mother happy. The only thing I didn't like, which has nothing to do with the product itself, was that Amazon had the May-Day $30 off Kindle's sale right after I ordered it so I kinda missed out on a greater deal. I'd recommend this to anyone who just plans to browse the web, check Facebook, watch YouTube or Netflix, or something like Skype.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Soo disappointed", "Author": "Kristin Gilpatrick", "ReviewID": "RK96E3OGZXP39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My only love about it is the camera.

Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for. It was an incredible deal. Returned it. Purchased apple mini with retina display for $399. Returned it. Purchased Kiindle Fire HDX 8.9. returned it.The HDX \"7\" and HDX \"8.9\" are both amazing. I settled on the \"7\" because I bought it from BEST BUY for $239. The HDX \"8.9\" was $429 for the 32 gig unit. Four things. The Display color is awesome! The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN. ( Reading View feature is only available on certain websites so  it's not on all the websites I browse but it's a fantastic feature to have!!) The audio is wonderful. I also am very impressed with the \"MAYDAY\" feature which connects you with a live technical advisor in 15 seconds by simply clicking on \"MAYDAY\".

I've had the device for a couple of weeks now, and have used it primarily for streaming videos via Netflix, reading books, and browsing the web.  On the positive side, the HD screen is beautiful, and delivers excellent quality for videos or browsing.  Likewise, the fast processor helps ensure that media is delivered more or less flawlessly (subject to the connectivity issue discussed below).  This is consistent with the Kindle's other strength, which is facilitating the consumption of Amazon content.Those positive things said, there are several issues that I have experienced that should give prospective purchasers pause.  And if the point of the ratings system is to help users assess whether to purchase the product, I would suggest passing on the Kindle and sticking with another Android-based device.First, the network connectivity is horrendously unreliable.  When connected to a wi-fi router that provides fast, reliable service to a variety of other devices (tested with an iPhone, an iPad, a Droid Razr Maxx, and a Windows PC), the Kindle for some reason cannot load any webpages or other internet content, even though it indicates having a strong wi-fi connection.  Occasionlly, if I restart the Kindle, the problem will temporarily resolve itself; however, even that step should be unecessary.In addition, the battery life is mediocre, even when the screen brightness is dimmed and the wi-fi turned off.  This tends to diminish the Kindle's value as a media consumption device, because the battery drains, sometimes at the right of 1% per minute or two.Finally, the Amazon app store remains a laggard - far behind the Google- and Apple-based offerings.  (Yes, you can side-load Android apps; however, once again, that's not a hassle that users should need to tolerate.)If you don't need to stream movies via Amazon (for which you need an Amazon device), go with another Apple- or Android-based device and just install the Kindle app.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "not impressed", "Author": "Jesica", "ReviewID": "R3MFXPSZBP4R14", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are just going to just use it as an E-reader then that's fine.

It just takes some time to get used to digital copies.

Can't change lockscreen background? Really?", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Hardware, Handcuffed by Inferior Software", "Author": "Nicholas J Littier", "ReviewID": "R2C3K9WFMDSIMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had been looking at tablets for a while, and for Christmas this year I received the HDX 7\" as a gift, but I finally made my mind up to return it in favor of another tablet.On the positive side, the hardware on the HDX is really impressive.  The processing speed and memory are among the best for 7\" tablets.  The screen is fantastic, and even the sound from the speakers is impressive.  Another great feature is the ability to view Prime Instant Video.  Access to free movies and TV shows (some of them are even downloadable for off-line viewing) is an added bonus of having an Amazon Prime subscription.The tablet is also great for kids, or individuals who aren't very tech savvy.  Its very intuitive to use, and the parental controls are fantastic--even allowing parents to set a designated period of time that their kids can play with the device.  If you are a parent, someone who is looking for an easy-to-use device, or someone that simply wants to watch videos, read books, and play simple games, then the HDX might be your tablet.However, I was looking for a more traditional Android experience and I just couldn't get past the Fire's heavily modified Android operating system.  First, the operating system offers very few customization options.  For example, you cannot change the background screen, have access to widgets, or customize/organize your home screen as you would for other Android devices.  I also use the Swiftkey Keyboard on my Android smartphone, which has helped productivity when sending text/email, however, the keyboard on the HDX cannot be changed and Swiftkey is not available for the HDX in the Amazon Appstore.The real nail in the coffin for me was the inability to access Google services.  This means you won't have access to the Google Play store, which has a vastly improved app selection over Amazon's Appstore.  You also cannot access Google Hangouts which I use frequently for text/chat messages as well as video calls and videoconferencing.  Further, I use Google's Chromecast to stream video to my television. The Chromecast app is unavailable on the HDX.The tradeoff of purchasing another Android device over the HDX is the inability to use the Prime Instant Video.  Amazon has provided an Prime Instant Video app for Apple devices, but has not (and I suspect will not) produce one for other Android devices.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over this because I didn't find the selection of free movies and TV to be all that impressive.  The selection of free movies that were downloadable to the device for off-line viewing was even less impressive.  Most of my video viewing on the tablet was through HBO Go, Hulu+, or Netflix.All in all, the HDX is a decent tablet with great hardware that unfortunately stumbles on its software.  If Amazon were to offer a Kindle device with the same hardware, but with a more traditional Android software experience with a slight Amazon spin (a la the Samsung Galaxy Tablets), I would certainly be willing to pay a higher price for the device.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's Only O.K.", "Author": "fearn0evil", "ReviewID": "R2CIX400A3M8VY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its alright.

I think we have to put all these tablets in perspective. I also have a 8.9\" Nook HD+. So, much as been said about the Kindle that I had to buy one to see for myself is it all that it is said to be. I like the Kindle because of its size and portability. One of the main reasons that I can really enjoy my Kindle is because it has been rooted. This means that not only do I have access to Amazon content, I also have access to the Google PlayStore. This is important to me in order to be able to enjoy ownership of a Kindle.With it being rooted I can enjoy both worlds. The Kindle is a fantastic tablet, but in my opinion only if it is rooted. I don't like proprietary software and if you keep it with Amazon's offers, ecosystem it gets really boring quick. I am a Prime and Netflix member, so this tablet is great. I am able to fit it inside my purse and travel with it with no problem. However, the only reason I can enjoy it to this point is because it is rooted. It is a beautiful tablet and I really like everything it can do.Pros: affordability, portability, fast and efficient software (speedy), beautiful display resolution, versatile (if able to root), impressive device (makes me want the 8.9\" just can't justify the purchase since I have a Nook of the same size)Cons: no way to expand memory, no HDMI ouptput, proprietary software, having to pay to stop special offers", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!!", "Author": "Barbie", "ReviewID": "R13C13DT45WADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, lightweight, no problems with using it immediately.

This is not my first kindle (or second, or...). This tablet is definitely an improvement over the previous versions, it's more responsive, it handles video and web browsing so much better than the previous Fire generation, and I love the slimmed down version.The overall design is an improvement. The video quality is great, and music does play with a decent quality. Love the feature where it can display lyrics while playing song (if the mp3 has the information), thanks to the whole X-Ray/Lyrics feature. There's a lot of new touches here that are fun. I really appreciate the volume and the power buttons being on the opposite sides of the kindle now (don't know how many times I've hit the wrong one on my Fire >.<).Also, being able to have more than two browsers open on Silk now w/out it crashing all of the time is a great improvement.Some minor quirks - not sure if it's me or the tablet, but still trying to figure out how to get pictures already taken from my phone onto the tablet and directly into the photo folder.Have installed several apps without a problem, downloaded files and opened them, so far so good. The kindle goes everywhere with me (literally, it's the perfect size to fit in my purse). I wish there were more cover options for the 7\", but it seems to be increasing the longer the kindle is out, and I think a cover/case is a must for one of these. This is the kindle that I do take everywhere, and on a recent trip, I used this more than my Surface as it has my most frequently used personal emails installed on it (easy to set up), I can access my social accounts, my music, and of course my books.The battery is... eh, decent. I can keep it on and play music for a few hours, video less, and use it to read books for most of a day.

Grinstead", "ReviewID": "RP5JLI47IGQSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had owned an iPad previously. And, generally, the concept of a tablet is really convenient and fun. I loved my iPad.But iPads are expensive: The Apps are expensive; the cloud for storage is expensive; iBooks is expensive; updating to a new model is expensive.And the Kindle Fire HDX proves that the iPads aren't worth it. The Kindle Fire HDX does everything I wanted my iPad to do. Further, it's Amazon; so even though technically all of the apps purchased are Android apps, Amazon prices many of these Android apps more advantageously to me than my Google Play store and other Android shops do.The graphic layout of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", i.e. its icon placement, \"the carousel,\" its menu placement is very intuitive and pleasing to the eye. It's a very minor thing, but I actually really enjoy \"the carousel\": You purchase a new book or app and it shows up as this huge icon among other often-used icons. It's fun and makes you feel like you have purchased an actual book.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels amazing to hold, too. I am a bibliophile and, hence, own too many books. Nothing will ever compare to holding an actual book for me. However, Amazon has managed to design this particular Kindle at least feel as much like a book as possible.This is great news because another thing that Amazon generally does exceedingly better than its competition is sell eBooks. As a former owner of an iPad, I was able to and did download Kindle, NOOK, iBooks, Kobe, and other eBook-purchasing and reading apps. While owning those iPads still I always defaulted to the Kindle Reader. Amazon consistently and for a long time has simply offered better and more popular eBooks at better prices. Amazon's \"Daily Deals\" are something to watch for. I have owned my Kindle Fire for less than a month and have already been able to populate it inexpensively with bestsellers like the Divergent series, the Legend series, Burial Rites, the Goldfinch, Doctor Sleep, academic books on behavioral economics, etc. But, going back to the original point, the fact that the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels so much like a book had made purchasing such a large quantity of eBooks as I currently have even more enticing at the time of purchase. As confusing as that sentence was.But, in deciding between purchasing this Kindle and one of its competitors (namely an iPad), here is likely the most important point: My five-star review is as much about Amazon itself as the Kindle.It is true that the Kindle Fire literally does everything that I have known my iPads to do. Like an Android phone, the big difference is in who supplies the apps. I, personally, love Android apps more so than iTunes apps. So considering nothing else, the Kindle Fire HDX was a worthwhile purchase if only because I was able to update my tablet without my credit card company deciding it needed to raise my interest rate because I had paid the equivalent of a new furniture set from Bombay for a tablet that had a logo whose bumper sticker would look great on my Subaru.So, whether or not you get full enjoyment from the Kindle Fire HDX depends on how much you use Amazon. Full Disclosure: I am an Amazon Prime member. I love it: Free 2-Day Shipping, streaming video, cloud storage, one free soon-to-be released book a month, etc. And, as a Prime member, my Kindle fully enhances that experience.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Was a gift--Husband loves it", "Author": "Satisfied Buyer", "ReviewID": "R1DVJMRORZE7GD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set up and operate.

Lee Jr.", "ReviewID": "R6MZ952XAW42Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Normally I am an Apple guy.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" wooed me because I am a Prime member and most websites inclined that it's almost absurd to not look at the Kindle Fire HDX if you are one. I was offered a free trial and enjoyed the 32GB model thoroughly.  The apps I could get were fun and watching videos looked great.The features, look and feel were great.  I was saddened to be limited by the App store and lack of Google Play access.  I find it ironic that when you turn off the limitation on app installation the warning states that foreign apps might not be trustworthy when a recent free app offered triggered people's spyware app on their Kindle Fires.  This wasn't a huge drawback to my enjoyment, but another thing Amazon needs to work on.  There was another new issue that Amazon Techs apparently don't know about.It was during my free trial I saw an odd glitch in the system with certain apps.  Apps such as Simpsons Tapped Out, Angry Birds Star Wars 2 and UNO & Friends, I saw a strobe-like light flicker on the screen.  I ignored it with my free trial Fire, but when it occurred again on the 64GB I got for Christmas I was concerned.  Thankfully it doesn't occur during any video playback.When researching the issue, I found there wasn't much.  There was only one other post on an Amazon comment board from a gentleman who revived his Fire for Christmas this year.  He posted a YouTube Video, but it's rough to see the flickering.  I found one other article giving tips to troubleshoot it and I tried them all and retried them when I used the MayDay button.The Mayday tech sent me to a kindle specialist who had me reboot and try the apps again.  He had never heard of this issue which worried me a bit.  In the end, Amazon sent me a replacement tablet.  Once again playing Angry Birds and the background starts flickering.  Not sure if there might end up being an OS update to fix it, but it's something to be aware of.It's a great device and priced incredibly for what it delivers.  The App store or app accessibility needs to be massively increased and this new screen flicker issue will hopefully be addressed.Overall, I'm pleased with my Kindle Fire to stream all my Flixster movies and Amazon Prime Videos.  There are just a few issues Amazon needs to work to really make me forget Apple's iPad.Updated 2/16/14As a Christmas gift, I can't say that I was disappointed in my purchase but after owning this since December and already going through a replacement I expected much more.  The Tech reviews made it seem like this thing could go toe to toe with the iPad but I had used iPads my family owned in the past and I've seen nothing like the issues this device has.  From repeatedly errors in apps, apps that stop opening and have to be forced closed several times in a row to the screen flickering like a strobe light (Yes the auto brightness is off).  The flickering is what led to my replacement, but immediately upon rebooting my replacement did the flickering come right back.  I led it slide because it happened in games like Angry Birds, UNO and Simpsons Tapped Out because I thought maybe the software was having a difficult time with games that pull a lot of memory.  I really shouldn't have since this is supposed to be the faster Kindle Fire and have the ability to portray graphics with great detail.  Now, apps with simple text articles like IGN are now flicking.  I'm not sure if it's their Android software but I think by next Christmas I'll trade this in for a new iPad Mini.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This product is on fire", "Author": "Al T", "ReviewID": "RHN3DZXIMUN4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an ipad 4 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it and I love it.

I was not impressed by it due to the unusual GUI, lack of true Android, and slow performance. I've owned every generation of iPad and type this from my 32GB iPad Air. I also own a Nexus 7 (2012).  I initially considered the HDX because of the special offers, namely the extra special ones where products are sold dirt cheap ($19 Paperwhite? Heck yeah!). But after buying the 16GB HDX 7, I changed my opinion. I ran out of space on it and returned it to order a 64GB HDX (at a much more reasonable price difference than Apple could ever dream of). I'm not ditching my iPad's anytime soon (too heavily invested in that ecosystem) but I can't stop gushing over the HDX. It's fast  the screen is crystal clear (blue tint on edges doesn't bother me), super light, and inexpensive.  I will always take it when I take a tablet rather than the iPad (which beg to be stolen). The origami case is also pretty impressive. I like how it holds on by a magnet and can easily be removed. And the folded stand is FAR more stable than the expensive leather Apple Smartcase on my iPad Air. As for the Nexus 7? It now feels far too sluggish and I hate the 16:9 aspect as well as the black bar that never goes away. I was using it for travel when working (looking stuff up in the field) but not when going to visit family or anything.

I have submitted one or two, but usually leave it to those more eloquent and well versed in the art than myself. That being said, I like to write about things, and why not write about stuff that I order off of Amazon.To be honest, I was going to give the Kindle Fire HDX a four star rating over a five, and that would have been simply for the apps available. I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole. It's as crisp and beautiful as it should be, displayed on such a high quality piece of hardware.I actually have not tried or used the \"Mayday\" feature. As someone who is familiar and adapts very quickly to new technology, it feels like more of a novelty - to me. To someone with a less of a background, it's probably awesome. I simply haven't felt the need to use it, but it's nice to know that it's there in case I suddenly forgot how to operate things, namely Amazon tablets.In conclusion, if you have some money laying around, and aren't starving, go buy a Kindle Fire; they're cool.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

Although I heard goodreviews of the iPad the cost was prohibitive although the store was top notched.  Likewise, I heard good reviews about the Nexus but I was concerned with the store.  The Kindle HDX 7 delivers both as promised: inexpensive and also linked to the largest store in the world.I have had it for about a month now and it has been worth every cent I spent on it.  I love toggling it on and instantly watching movies from either NetFlix or from Amazon Prime.  Its fast and pretty.  I did once have a problem with Netflix -- it kept telling me I had no internet when obviously I did.  I reinstalled the app and never had a problem again.Reading books is great.  Clear and crips lettering and easy page turning.  Magazines I find with a mixed bag.  Essentially the composition of digital magazines has a lot to be desired about, but that has nothing to do with the Kindle.  I configured one email to its mail application and it works well, with no real complaints.  Typing on any soft key keyboard is a chore and I am thinking of getting a pen (although most I have seen are outrageously priced for a plastic stick).Not overly impressed with web surfing on this or any tablet.  I certainly dislike the mobile versions of Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter.  Some you can convert over to the normal desktop experience, others you can't (pointing at your Twitter!!).  I love to surf the web and just jump from one site to the next -- this is awkward and difficult with the Kindle.I have had no real trouble with the device and I have not tried their special help feature where I talk to someone.

It is  so light weight. One handed usage is a breeze. The only negative which I had not realized was that I have no access to the Play Store . While the amazon appstore has tons of apps there are still some I could not get for this one. I had spent months making progress in games that I have to access on my 10\" tablet which I was planning on giving to someone else.

I find this unacceptable. There are too many of these apps. Why are they not available for this fire but only the others. I am still learning some of the features so hence only 4 stars.

I Skype a lot.The battery life is very good thus far. I can get about 12 hours of steady web use, 8 hours of constant streaming, and have left it idle for 3 days off charge and still had 99% battery life. I can take it to work for 14 hours with sporadic work related use and end the day with 30% battery life.The device functions smooth and quick. The processing speed is top notch.The display is so clear, HDX is great for viewing pleasure. No problems reading books in sunlight.The speakers are very clear and can get quite loud.Navigation is easy, not confusing at all.Amazon's free app of the day are usually high quality apps.Amazon also has these kindle customer only lightning deals that offer some serious value.Cons:The Device has, on 4 separate occasions, refused to respond from sleep mode. Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time.

I tried with all my power to like the Kindle. But in the end, I will be returning this device. The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well. But odd behavior kept occurring. The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger. It continuously rebooted all day long. Nothing I did would stop the boot loop. Finally when I got home and plugged it into the charger, it booted back to the UI. I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times. It's more of an annoyance than a problem. There are other odd things that I can't recall at the moment. But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle. Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use. Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours. Not heavy usage either, playing Candy Crush then browsing Facebook will do it. One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge. Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.

I bought the tablet so I could watch my television shows while I eat without having to hall around my laptop around. And for this purpose I would give the Kindle Fire a B+.After my initial posting, describing my disappointment with Kindles ability/or lack there of to watch free streaming media, Amazon reached out to me. Which really impressed me! They pushed out some updates to me, gave me pointers on how to ensure I am on the tablet version of common websites (since videos won't work on all of the regular sites), and ABC published an updated app for viewing episodes. Now I am largely happy with the Kindle's ability to watch streaming videos. The only downsides I have experienced is the Hulu is not available (you can access hulu plus but not the free site), the volume/sound projection abilities don't seem as good as some of my other devices (like my ipod), and you can only have one window/tab open at a time. So for instance if I want to check the news during a commercial you can't do it- which is a downside for me since I am a multi-tasker.

I don't care for all the fancy technical stuff or connecting to TV at really, I'm happy as long as it does what I need it to do.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great device but lacking output/apps for external devices (TV, Receiver)", "Author": "someone", "ReviewID": "R359D4Z06Q4KMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many reviews for this device, but not much information about how to output the device display content to external TV/monitor. So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lovely little tablet.

There is no way I could afford a new iPad and after using this, I don't think I would want one anyway. I use this primarily for reading, watching videos and movies, and occasionally surfing the web, so nothing terribly extensive. It suits my needs just fine, at a lower price point and makes me feel like getting an iPad would just be overkill for me. I purchased mine with the adds included and honestly it's not a big deal. They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality.

The first problem was that even though I marked it as a \"gift\" it was registered in my name. Her generation (mostly) is not tech savvy and we bought this model due to the mayday button. She lives 1000+ miles away so I could not help her with set up and it took her almost 3 weeks to get it set up, so she could use it. ( this was due to the fact that it was registered to me.) She was on the phone for several hours( at least 3+ hours and 3 separate calls ) with tech support before they figured this out.

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3RK1YPEQMC4EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to like? This is probably the best piece of hardware out there for the price hands down. I have 2 iPads, iPhones, iMac. I love the Mac environment and iOS.  The hardware is obviously quite expensive, but if you use the device even 1-2 hours a day I would pay the extra and get the iPad. If you don't use the device regularly or if you're an Amazon-o-phile and your whole world revolves around Amazon, the Fire is the only logical alternative IMHO.  I prefer my iPad in almost every way, but I like the small size of the 7\" to carry to town, mall, church or whatever instead of hauling around the iPad. It's an amazing price, and that's the best feature about this device.  I love the nice PPI resolution, which makes me feel right at home while reading.  The speakers are the next biggest stand-out feature that I really love about the HDX.  The first time I sat down to watch a movie on it, the sound literally blew me away!  It made the movie twice as interesting to hear the amazing surround sound or perhaps even 3-D sound if that's possible, awesome bass, great range, nice to hear it coming from both sides of the device when in landscape mode, all things I would expect from the more expensive iPad, but dont find! Also plenty of power if it's anywhere near close enough to see the screen.  I just have to gripe about the Amazon tweaks and control of the Android OS that just doesn't feel as customizable or as intuitive as plain old Android OS or obviously iOS.  Again for my purposes of mostly reading books, and the occasional movie, or browsing, this environment is actually just fine, but not my first choice, perhaps after using it long enough I'll learn to actually appreciate it, we'll see.  I wish it could be thinner and lighter of course, but I'd rather have the longer battery life that it does have vs. being lighter weight, with technology where its at right now.  I'm thankful for the wake sleep feature with the right case. I love that it has BT where a lot of cheap tablets in this price range tend to leave it out.  So far I've found all the Apps in the Amazon App Store that are important to me, so the App limitations haven't really bothered me yet. They seem to have a really good selection.  I do like not having to worry about bugs or viruses by only using Apps that are patrolled by Amazon, kind of like Apple does. It gives me a nice feeling of security.  Over-all, I can hardily recommend the HDX to anyone that doesn't use iTunes, or have an iPhone or Mac.  And to those looking to just get their feet wet in the tablet experience using it only occasionally. If you plan to really be using it a lot, I would instead highly recommend paying the extra money to get an iPad mini or Air, it's well worth the extra investment.  However this is a great starter tablet for kids or to just dabble yourself a little bit to see if tablets are really all they are cracked up to be!  I didn't get on the tablet bandwagon for almost 2 years, thinking they were just a passing fad, and were terribly limited compared to netbooks... well, after I saw they weren't going away after all, I got one, and I have never regretted it since! Good luck! There's a lot of good tablets out there to choose from.

Since my original review, I've had to return not only the original, but TWO more!!!  The first two would not hold a charge when in sleep mode.  The third one was charging for NINE hours and only made it up to 58% charged!  To make matters worse it came with no original box, which worried me as to if it was refurbished.  Amazon admitted it was a mistake and I was sent refurbished.  This has been a HUGE frustration dealing with having to call each time, packing them up and then making the 25-30 minute drive one way to our local UPS store!  I have no doubt I will love this device if I ever get one that works the way it is supposed to work!To date I have yet to receive an HDX that will hold a charge.  I am now on the 5th unit.  I cannot keep the internet on or will will drain within a few hours to dead.  In fact just downloading my latest books will drain at least 25% of my power that I had before turning on the internet to download the books.  Out of frustration I have kept this 5th one and just don't turn the internet on.  Now after just a month of using it, the screen keeps flashing like it is going to die/go blank.  This is the WORST problem I've ever had with any electronic device I've had!

There was a problem with me having too many Kindle devices registered, so my books would not open on the new device.  Even though I could have fixed that myself, contacting Mayday got the job done faster.  I talked with two Mayday operators since buying this new Kindle - both were easy to understand and knowledgeable.The sound and HD screen is very impressive, a big improvement over my Fire from 2012.  The processor is also impressively fast.  I have to say that battery life is not great, but adequate.  I have yet to try using the device with the WiFi off, which likely would improve battery life.

Winton \"cwinton\"", "ReviewID": "R2LJTXLNCAITCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first Kindle was the electronic ink version, which had the huge advantage of running for weeks on a single charge if you turned off communications.  Over the next 4 years I purchased the Kindle Fire, the Kindle Fire HD, and now the Kindle Fire HDX (64Gb), all 7\" models.  Each Fire model has been a significant improvement over its predecessor, although of course none come remotely close to the battery life of the electronic ink models.  That being said, as a reader, battery life for all the Fire models is fine for those long airplane trips, where you have the bonus of the device playing music while you read.  Other reviewers have covered battery life for those willing to watch movies on such a small screen.  Being able to mirror movies from Amazon Prime onto my TV is good enough for my purposes.So what else is noticeably improved?  First off, the HDX is noticeably thinner, lighter, and faster.  Second, if your email requires VPN, there is an integrated VPN client that is almost trivial to set up (you may have to download the Thor OS upgrade for this, I did).  The provided email app connected easily for me. and I found new versions of apps I typically use, such as ES File Explorer and a really good (free) SSH terminal emulation app that works great on the HDX.I debated long and hard as to whether an upgrade from my HD was advisable at this time, and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm glad I did.  The HDX is living up to the hype.  I even found the help feature useful.  It connected immediately to a knowledgeable individual who pointed me to the need to upgrade the OS in order to get the VPN client.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade", "Author": "Bobbe", "ReviewID": "R2G7JIXDQYES45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loved the original Kindle Fire, this one is better.

I've only had it a little over 3 weeks.  Since I had it.  it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day). Then to get it to reconnect I have to stand right next to my router.  This has become very annoying.  The other issue I am having is random shutdowns of my kindle for no reason.  It doesn't matter if I am in the middle of something on the kindle or not.  I have contacted support about these problems.  He did everything he could to help and then said he would have to contact the managers and he would keep me posted by email.  He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..  I think he had forgotten we had already checked that and my kindle was up to date.  Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.  I have had 3 other kindles prior to this and have never had a problem.  I have the kindle for reading with the keyboard, kindle 1st generation, and the kindle fire 7\" hd.  The only one purchased from Amazon is the new kindle fire 7\" HDX  which I was very excited to receive and now I am having these issues.

After exactly a week spending with it, I have couple of issues which in my opinion were the deal breakers and with me ending up deciding to return it.So here's the list of good & bad:Disclaimer: The Kindle Fire was at it's latest firmware during my use & tests. No, I am not on payroll of either Google or Apple. I am just an tech geek who owns various devices and wants to see Kindle Fire tablet fix it's Achilles Heels for good.(GOOD)1) Device is extremely light and comfortable to hold.2) It looks & feels gorgeous.3) The display is one of the best. I already have a ipad2 with me and I enjoyed watching movies on the Kindle Fire to be honest.4) It's very fast when it comes to streaming stuff.5) One of the best speakers. The bass and clarity is amazing.6) Got just the apps to get you started.(BAD)1) The power and volume buttons on either side are badly placed and poorly designed in the sense that, you can't differentiate which one is which by just feeling them. I had to keep turning it back to see if I wasn't pressing the power button. Many a times during the first couple of days I ended up pressing the power button instead of volume. So if the lights are off, you will be groping in the dark for those buttons.2) The wifi suddenly loses connection and shows an x mark in spite of it being connected to the wifi network per se. But, it won't go to the internet. The only solution is to reboot the device, after which the x mark on the wifi goes away and everything is rosy once again.3) The sound suddenly stops working. It happened to me twice and both times, the reboot was the solution. I felt like I wasn't using an Android tablet, rather a Windows OS for a minute.4) I am sure the above issues are software bugs which can be fixed in the next firmware update. But, after shelling out 200$ one expects some basic functionality like Wifi & Sound to work without a hitch every other time. These are the things which can't be overlooked. I can overlook the limited app store,but not basic stuff which we ought to take it as granted.5) This is one is not a deal breaker, but wanted to lay it out there with the hope that Amazon will listen to it's loyal customer. If you are looking to side-load Google Apps(G+,Maps,Hangouts,Gmail,etc) with the exception of Youtube, you are out of luck. The youtube app too is just barely functional in the sense that you cannot sign in to your account. That's out of question. I am not impressed with Amazon's closed ecosystem policy even though I understand it's business reasons. What might be good for business in short term might hurt the company in the long term. I feel, Amazon has handicapped such a capable & powerful hardware by limiting the software ecosystem. Every person on the internet,whether Amazon likes it or not uses Google Services one way or the other and by alienating that user base, Amazon not only is slowing the adoption of this beautiful tablet, but also losing lot of customers to Google nexus.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended", "Author": "Sherrie L.

That mean no Google Play, Google Maps, Google Navigation, Google Search, Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Translate... You get the picture.  Why would anyone want to limit themselves to the offerings at the amazon App Store with such a great little tablet?  Kindle Fire HDX is just a version of Android with an Amazon makeover.  Every aspect of this experience of using this device seems to be geared toward getting you to spend money at Amazon.  Right off the bat you are given a free month of Amazon Prime, the service that costs $79 per year.  They offer streaming videos, but, everything here is on Netflix.  Netflix has more.  Most TV series let you view the first episode for free, but all others cost money.Did I mention, the startup screen is a full-page add for some random irrelevant gadget on Amazon?

I am changing 1 star to 5 stars. After posting the original review, amazon contacted me and worked with me. I finally spoke with someone in the kindle support who could help me. The problem was the Comcast Arris Modem/Router I was using. Last friday, I bought a Netgear modem from Best Buy and an Belkin N+ router. All problems have disappeared. My kindle is now working fine. If you are having wifi problems and battery drain issues, it might be your Comcast router. Do not return your kindle, just get a new modem/ router and the problem should be solved.Original Review:**********From the outset, I want to state that I will not recommend the Kindle HDX 7. I own five Kindle devices, 4 Kindle HDs and 1 Kindle HDX. I had pre-ordered the Kindle HDX when Amazon announced it and I received it three days before it was sold to the public. Within a month of receiving the HDX, I had problems and had to contact Amazon for a replacement. They quickly sent me a new replacement kindle. The new kindle has been giving me lots of problems: disconnects constantly from the wifi, drains battery power even when it is not in use. Keep in mind, none of my Kindle HDs that are already over a year old have any of these problems. At first, i thought the problem was the Amazon kindle hdx case I had on it. I took the case off and still experienced the same problems. This has been going on since December. I have factory reset several times and the problem is still not solved. Last week I contacted Amazon, they sent me a refurbished replacement kindle (nervous knowing that the kindle I received had prior problems and that is why it is refurbished.). It looked used. I used it for a day and noticed problems with it. I contacted Amazon again and insisted they should send a new kindle because I am tired of driving to UPS to return defective kindles. The representative said he was placing an order for a new kindle for me. Today, i just got another refurbished kindle. I contacted customer support and I was told that as per the terms of agreement, a replacement kindle may be a used device. She informed me that if I have any problems with it, I should contact them and return it for a replacement. I am again nervous this might have issues again. I am crossing my fingers. If I have any issues, I will just return to a kindle HD. I like the new kindle because it is smaller and the display is better. Amazon will never tell us how many people have returned these kindles but I am sure a lot have been returned. I love amazon and I spend a lot of money on Amazon but unfortunately this might be my last kindle if Amazon does not make right with me. For now, I will not recommend the purchase of the HDX until amazon is able to deal with the technical issues with this device. I feel like I just paid $230 to buy a beta device.

Even though I had the original Fire I have to look up answers to his questions about navigating the HDX. This is really not a fault of the Fire's capabilities, but I definitely think the iPad would have been easier for him to learn to use.  I also wish we would have bought him the bigger screen. He has arthritis and so does not have fine motor skills. He is constantly accidentally rewinding his books when he wants to press the home button which is at the bottom of the screen where the bar is that tracks where you are in the book.

Since then I have tried out different tablets, smart phones and computers and over the years I have been buying more and more Apple products (I currently have the 5s, Ipad 3rd Gen and MacBook Air) and I still think Apple makes a hell of a product but my wife and I also still enjoy our kindles.  I am also a Amazon Prime member so when I saw the new Fire HDX and the good reviews I thought I would give this \"mini\" a shot.  So far everything has worked very well and the first thing that pops out if the graphics...  they really pop and it is eye candy.  The second thing you notice is the speed, this little guy is fast and while I agree the application store is a little limited it does well with what is available (and I am sure since Amazon is selling a lot of these things that the developers will make many more and ensure popular Apps from other devices are also offered on this...  might just take a little time for them to show up).  The third thing I noticed is the OS is clean and user friendly.  Some people might think its basic or limited but they have a very common sense approach on how to get to all the content.  when I was using this I was thinking... if I was going to get a tablet for my parents or non tech savvy friends and family this would be it.  With the clean easy to use OS and the mayday  option I could see this being a cost effective option for many people.  I end up being the tech support person for my family when anything breaks or has an issue or just end user questions so I think this device would take care of most of that.  Also after trying this out the last few days I now notice the weight of my full size Ipad and while at home I still enjoy using my Ipad the HDX is what I grab when I walk out the door.  Its does everything I want when I am out and about but in a much smaller lighter easy to use bundle.  So if you picked this up for the Cyber Monday deal of $179 this guy has a lot of bang for the buck, if you already use a lot of apple devices I am sure the Apple Mini is just as good though it costs a little more but if you want to try something new, want something that is a little more cost effective or easy to use for the more technology impaired (or if you have Prime membership) then this is worth the shot.  Amazon also has a great return policy if for some reason you decide the HDX is not for you once you give it a shot.  I think it's a keeper and I might end up getting a few more for my Parents and In-laws as I think this is something they would enjoy and could handle that would cut out the ongoing IT support I usually have to provide ;-)", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible value, and just plain incredible.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3PTBYQ85CD7V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in awe. I have just unwrapped the Kindle 2 hours ago, and I am still marveling at the wealth of features that this tiny tablet continues to display.Value - 5/5Especially if you bought it during the $50 off promotion and are a Amazon Prime member (tons of free movies + borrow a free book every month). ~$179 for a kindle fire HDX 16GB (Less than half that of a similar iPad2 which goes for $399). It can do everything the iPad2 can, and better. Just compare the two models:kindle fire hdx student gaming tablet[...]- Much lighter (303g to iPad2's 601g, though iPad2 is slightly bigger)- More than double the pixel density (323ppi compared to iPad2's 132), meaning way better graphics for movies etc- Faster (2.2 Ghz Quad core processor compared to iPad2's 1Ghz dual-core)- Better audio (Dolby Digital Plus)- Better front camera (720p compared to iPad2's VGA - only advantage that iPad2 has is that it has a rear camera)- Instant LIVE help just on the touch of a button (Mayday)- AND MORE.I do not usually write reviews, however for a truly amazing product at a great price, I am motivated. Had Apple bought over this product and named it iPad Fire, it would easily have gone for $500 and above (yes the Apple brand name is worth that much.)Kudos to Amazon for filling me with wonder at the capabilities of technology.

The screen crystal  clear and it is very easy to read  without any eye fatigue.  I am a prime member and I think that a prime membership is needed to get the most out of the Kindle.  I was disappointed with the video application because it is not easy to browse the videos by genre.  Also I would think that you should be able to filter out videos  with mature content or to quickly see which films are included in the instant video collection.  The audio quality on the kindle is great and very clear through it's speakers.  The seven inch model is very comfortable and fits my had very well.  Overall the Kindles just keep improveing as time goes on.

I never thought I wanted a tablet until my best friend got this. I use it far more than she does: every night, in fact, reading up on the latest jobs on a favorite website, grabbing free titles from the kindle download store, and so on. This does everything I would want it to do. Kudos, amazon.

I'll update the review as I get to know the HDX as time passes. I use the HDX daily for 2 hours on average reading and surfing. I use a PaperWhite 3G at work and at home and have used previous E-ink Kindle generations for daily reading in the past. Kindle Fire is growing up fast. The vastly upgraded device response and fluidity are already well commented on. The extra speed when surfing the web and navigating the HDX are again a big step up, good work. There is very little display reflection, improving reading once again this gen. Text is totally, faultlessly sharp.A very cool software feature in the Kindle app are the extra Wikipedia and Translation boxes that come together with the dictionary definition box, totally cool. Silk works better, taking many opened tabs in its stride and making the most of the display size with the cool article mode and nicely working full screen option that takes away the tabs and adress bar to move the page upward. I always found the iPad 4:3 display ratio appealing, but the Silk features mentioned above make the 16:9 ratio enjoyable for web surfing while keeping the device as small as possible.The form factor is again much improved with the HDX generation, no apologies necessary anymore. It's much more manageable than my previous generation HD 7; noticably less circumference and a third less weight. The physical buttons are very tactical, unlike those on the previous gen., and the sometimes mentioned \"angled\" USB port feels and looks solid, not at all awkward. The bezels are smaller and the plastic outer enveloping rim much more so giving a very tight, high quality appearance compared to the previous gen.In my opinion, Amazon have at this generation arrived at a wonderful compromise between \"boutique\" (like iPad) and \"utility\" (previous gen. HD) moving steadily toward the iPad. Also with the HDX, there is a better compromise between Amazon presence (say, like an Amazon website-type environment) and an open Android presence (like any generic android tablet) with the HDX showing beautiful, eerily sharp lockscreen wallpapers, app icons matrix and book covers, with removable recommendations which, removed, leave an \"Android or iPad like\" home screen save for the background, which is (in my opinion) nicely dark with classy icon shadowing.Battery life is at least as enduring as on my previous gen. HD. Sound is as good to my ears.UPDATE:I have some clouding, showing a brighter spot of about an inch in the centre of the display, which is visible on an even background like when reading. I can only get rid of it when switching to white text on black. The slight blue border bleeding is also present, but doesn't bother me at all.UPDATE 12/3/2013: I've requested and was right away permitted after a short live chat an exchange HDX to arrive in a couple of days, amazing stuff!UPDATE 12/5/2013: I received my replacement HDX today. What a miracle of logistics; from across the Atlantic traceable almost to the hour. Even my return HDX I can track. Boggles the mind. Well, I must say the clouding is less with the new one, but I can still see it. My daughter (painter artist) shakes her head and says: \"You exchanged it for that?\", when I show her the \"faulty\" one. Must be me then. I'll accept it as a HDX character trait.UPDATE 12/14/2013:The HDX performs excellently, the smaller size and mass, and the very sharp, defined characters are more appreciated as time in use passes. The new ability to sort cloud content in collections is much appreciated. Silk occasionally froze. Disabling page load acceleration solves that.This device is a big improvement over the previous HD; better ergonomics again, better display, less glass glare, much more zip, diminishing the E-reading gap with the glorious PaperWhite. My PW is certainly used less for reading since the HDX is here. As we live in the real world, I think the price:quality ratio is very important, and the HDX has made that ratio more favourable again for my ends, which are: reading E-books, internet news and watching news videos with the best possible display quality and low weight and size at a good price. Weighing the above factors, the HDX-Amazon combo is unbeatable. What I would call a Serious Tablet.Job very well done,Recommended!UPDATE 1/5/2014:For an Epub reader app, I can recommend Aldiko, downloaded through their website via a sent link for the free, non-ad reader. Really hassle-free, with only the basic options for good reading, not playing. The only caveat is crashing of the app with large .Pdf's. But it's not really needed for those; the embedded Kindle Reader app is superior for handling .Pdf. No need to waste space installing the Adobe Reader.For a good enough productivity app, I can recommend the King Soft Free version through the Amazon App Store. No ads, no hassle, easy connection to Google Drive.Good File Manager app: Free no-ad ES File Manager through the Amazon app store. (You can get easy access to your Cloud Account by adding in ES through documents/network/add (+ key at bottom, pick your account)Good Task Manager: Free no-ad ES Task Manager through the Amazon app store.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX is even better!", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"Chuvasia\"", "ReviewID": "R1FRVSKFODHZFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being able to download Prime instant videos is sweet!

I had the regular HD and only changed up because of problems with that device. The HDX is still a 7\", which is what I wanted. I read my books with a black background and white letters. I noticed that on the HDX, the white letters are more gray that bright white which I really liked. Also, on the front page where the books I am reading show up, there are related books below them. The pictures are much smaller than the regular HD and I can't even read what they say. So I have to press on each one and go to the actual bookstore to see if they are even books I want to read. I realize that there are differences between the 2 devices, but would have liked some of them to be improved, not worse. The biggest problem so far (I haven't had this very long) is that the speakers in the back are on the sides instead of down the center. That means that that I can barely hear when speaking to Mayday unless I am using earphones. My hands are holding the device exactly where the speakers reside. I can keep moving them around to uncover the speakers or using my earphones.
