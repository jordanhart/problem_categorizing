{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointed.", "Author": "AM", "ReviewID": "RPP3CYBAQM3AB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I saw only good reviews for this product and I thought it was a reasonable price, so I purchased it. I was really excited the day that it came in the mail. Everything was there and I got ready to charge the tablet for the recommended 8 hours before the first use. The AC adapter was very small and thin. I was worried that it would break when I tried to insert it. When the 8 hours were over, I turned the tablet on and used it for a few minutes. It lagged terribly and had only charged to 80%. After 2 days of charging my tablet had still not charged fully. It actually appeared to loose it's charge while I had it plugged in. It also started to make a crackling noise. The small manual is written in broken English and I was unable to find any support for this product online. I was really disappointed and contacted the seller to send it back and get a refund. The seller was nice and helpful. BEWARE though, there is a 15% restocking fee that I was charged. The seller did not inform me of the fee until after the product was returned. So, you will lose money if you return it. :-(", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for kids!", "Author": "sparrow", "ReviewID": "R55IR0BAM163J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great for kids!

Random issue with the screen. It turns gray with horizontal lines across the screen. Like a channel on tv you can almost see but haven't subscribed to. If I put pressure on corner where faulty port is the screen clears normal. When I release pressure the gray returns.Seller has offered replacement. In process of submitting request now. Hoping next tablet will be as perfect as our other one!The good one is fast, clear, handles games efficiently and has loads of storage! We also use 16gb micro sd card. We install clean master to help keep the tablet running smooth. Many times the tablet slows because there is too much memory taken by cache. So far clean master is our favorite to keep this tablet fast.Pic and video quality are as others have stated, pretty poor. Video is very choppy and not bright indoors. The sound capture leaves a lot to be desired as well.If you are getting this for web surfing, playing videos, watching tv, playing games or checking email, in my opinion it's perfect. If you want a good camera, get a camera.=-)", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "xmas gift", "Author": "Angie Staten", "ReviewID": "RLEN4EUJ5I41N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My daughter loves it,  she says it doesn't get hot nor freezes up, she loves it.
