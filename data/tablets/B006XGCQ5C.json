{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Acer A200", "Author": "D. McKean", "ReviewID": "R3H7S0PM0MWNE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased my A200 about a week ago.  It was tough to find locally and it appears as though Android tablets in general are hard to find...quantities are very low right now.  I ended up checking with about 10 different local electronics chains and office supply type stores until I finally found someone that had just received 2 in.While not the cheapest nor the best peforming tablet on the market, I really think this is a winner in the value category.  While I am typically a latest and greatest type person when it comes to electronics/computers, I really just didn't see the need to drop another $150+ on a high end tablet.  I'll use mine mostly for Internet access, some gaming, email, Netflix, etc.  With the exception of the more advanced games, a dual core versus a new quad core just isn't going to make much of a difference if at all and even right now on the gaming side, I don't think there is a whole lot that will take advantage of quad core chips. If I do want to do some photo and/or video editing, I will break out my much more powerful laptop. I really think buyers need to evaluate their true needs when it comes to buying these.One of the first things I did once I got connected via wifi, was to do the upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich and I definitely wasn't disappointed.  It is a beautiful OS that seems to run quite well on the A200. Transitions run well and smooth, and only until I enabled live wallpaper did I see any lag to speak of when moving from one home screen to another.  Even then it wasn't an issue for me and frankly a quad core may not make a difference.While this tablet isn't the thinnest nor the lightest, it is still in the same ballpark and frankly I really appreciate a little extra heft and thickness since I have larger hands.  The textured back feels nice in my hands and not as slippery as an iPad and overall it just feels very solid and robust to me.  I think it will hold up quite well...I'm very impressed for a $350 device.To summarize, here are the pros and cons as I see it:Pros:Value, value, value - can't beat it for $350 for a 10\", with ICS and level of qualityIce Cream Sandwich...yummy yummy ice cream :)Solid designGreat screen resolution - better than iPad 1 and 2.  Screen is sharp and very bright even at lower brightness settings.  Default is around 40% and I see no need to go higher.Colors are vibrant and seem to be accurate and text is clear...looks better than my 17\" Dell laptop and wife's Lenovo screensFull sized USB - used with USB sticks and it worked great for transferring files and photos.  I haven't tried any other accessories yet, but wondering if a USB game pad would work???  Doubt it but would be great if it did.Micro SD card slot - I plugged in a 16 gig from an old blackberry and it was able to read the photos and music I had on it.  Astro file manager is included with ICS and works well for moving files around.Battery life is great...the first night I had it, I had it off of the charger for 5 hours straight (4:58 to be exact) playing games, surfing, and installing apps and it still reported 52% battery life left...very impressive!Cons:Current lack of accessoriesLack of rear camera - really a non issue for me as I don't anticipate using the camera anyhow.  My Android phone has an 8 mega-pixel camera already and I have a mid-range Canon DSLR that I take if I anticipate shooting photos.Sometimes when bringing up my browser, the A200 will tell me it doesn't have an Internet connection.  I refresh and all is good.  Not sure if this is an ICS issue or an issue with hardware but likely ICS.Sound levels are little on the low side although I don't have any other tablets that I can compare to.  It's certainly acceptable.  I did download an equalizer program but I started hearing a weird crackling sound through the speakers so I uninstalled and all is well again.  I may try a different program but so far a non-issue.Stupid built-in Android browser defaults to mobile sites, not full.  This is an Android built-in browser issue though (seriously why don't they fix this for Tablets).  The normal work arounds didn't do anything...debug mode and browser check box for full sites didn't work.  My workaround was to install Boat browser which seems to work well for displaying full sites.Big con, is that my wife initially thought I wasn't smart buying yet another gadget, but now that she has tried it, I can't get it away from her.  Same thing with 4 year old son...he thinks it's his now (istorybook is awesome app for kids BTW).In summary, evaluate your needs for a tablet.  If this is a back up device and you already have a PC/laptop/Mac for more processor intensive apps and you want/need a device for surfing, portability, easy of use, game playing and don't need a rear camera or 3/4G connectivity this is a wonderful device for a wonderful price.  I love it!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well built and reliable tablet at a good price point !", "Author": "Androidaholic", "ReviewID": "R3SPTA4DZIDRIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this tablet since January 12th. I saw some in the cage when I was about to purchase a Sony S tablet and told the girl that I wanted it. I was afraid they may not sell it to me since it was not supposed to be released until the 15th but they did. I have thoroughly researched and tested all of the available tablets at Best Buy which include the I-Pad 2, Galaxy Tab, Motorola Xoom, Ausus Transformer, Transformer Prime, Sony S, Toshiba Thrive and the Motorola Xoom Family edition. I must say that I wish the Prime did not have all of the issues that it has especially the wi-fi signal dropping while bluetooth is connected. I tested two different floor models of the Prime and was able to replicate intermittent signal drops of the wi-fi signal. Proof of this was not only evident in the signal icon but also while watching you tube videos. At one of the stores I even switched from a wi-fi router to an AT&T; mobile hotspot. Even though I was pulling over 20 mb download the videos would constantly buffer. The Galaxy Tab seemed very tempting but I did notice some lag with the 10.1 and 8.9 as well compared to the Acer A200 especially when trying to type on them but also in some transitions. I blame the Samsung overlay of touchwiz for this. I also noticed that the whites did not look as pure when compared to the A200. These things along with the lack of ports and the known issues of the oil slick screen defect problems many are having deterred me from the 10.1 tab. Moving on, the Sony S was also a tempting tablet for me but I have read about some of them having wi-fi issues and also about them shutting off no matter what you set the screen off setting to. Ironically, both of the Sony units I tested had the screen shut down issue which was very annoying. The Toshiba Thrive was worth a good look but It to me is not to aesthetically appealing and one of the units did a random reboot while I was testing it so I dismissed it after careful consideration.The Thrive and the reboot issue is a known issue that I am not sure if Toshiba has a solution for.  Both of the Motorola units were alright but I never really considered either one to much because I know that they have inferior screens and I am not to interested in a tablet with kids apps built in as the family edition has. I wanted to like the original Transformer also but in a side by side screen comparison The Acer A-200's screen just looked a lot better as the Transformers screen would not get as bright and had a blue tint to it's whites. Then there is the good old I-Pad 2 which I did take the time to test and it is a nice piece of hardware with a good screen. The problem is it does not have an operating system that suits a tablet well in my opinion. It is boring with no widgets and customization like Honeycomb and a locked down Apple ecosystem. NO Thanks ! Well that leaves the  Acer A-200 which I have had since mid January. In my opinion it is the best looking Tablet out right now. I can also tell you that it is very well built and well optimized on the software side. I had the Acer A-500 before I returned and got this one and both of the Acer's seemed a bit snappier than the others. I returned the A-500 because the screen looked to washed out when I was in some browsing situations. Some people have been complaining about the sound on the A-200 on the Best Buy review section but all you have to do if you are not happy with it is download a free app from the Android market called Equalizer by Smart android apps and  you can make it sound however you want. It gets plenty loud after adjusting the EQ and if you buy the Key you can save presets for different situations like you tube or music. I have been very pleased with my A-200 and have not had any issues with it accept that I noticed the mic seemed a bit low when trying to do speech to text but not while using the voice recorder. I have read about some people saying that it is low on skype also but I do not use it for that so I do not know exactly how it performs with that but I would say maybe try a different app like Fring or something. If you can live without a rear camera and HDMI out then I would highly recommend the Acer A-200 because for $300.00 I think it is the best deal out there right now. It does have a full size usb port that I can confirm works with a PS3 controller and a logitech pc game controller as well as an old ps2 logitech keyboard I had lying around. I also have been using a microsoft mouse that I have as a spare and it works flawlessly. Other than that it has a headphone jack, Micro sd card slot and a proprietary power jack and this thing charges in an hour and a half tops. I would say just buy it if you do not think you want a quad core or feel like waiting for one that does not have the issues of the prime. For $300.00 you can not go wrong with this outstanding piece of electronic technology. It really is an awesome looking tablet and it feels great holding it with the rubberized backing and smooth curves ! Oh yea it has the best Wi-Fi reception out of the three Android phones and the two other 7\" Android tablets that I have. None of them can get reception out in my driveway by the carport but the A-200 does. It also locked on to 7 satellites with stand alone GPS outside where my A-500 could only get three ! My other devices are the HTC EVo 4g LTE, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Epic 4g (wifes), Nook Color and the Huawei S7 tablet. Thanks for reading and I hope you all found this review informative!Update! It is almost 6 months Later and I have updated my review! Changed the price from $350.00 to $300.00 and added my two new phones the Evo 4g LTE and the Galaxy S3 and Gave my Epic 4g to my wife. A whole slew of new tablets have come out and yes some of them are definately better than the A200. Galaxy Note $500.00, Galaxy Tab2 $400.00, Ausus Transformer Prime TF700T $500.00,Ausus TF300T $350.00 Acer A510 $420.00, Acer A700 $430.00  the Toshiba Exite 10.1 $370-$400, Toshiba Excite 10.1 LE $400.00 to $435.00and the New Sony Experia 10.1 $399.00  to name a few. All of these with the exception of the Galaxy Tab 2 and the Toshiba Excite are Quad Core and all of the Quad cores with the exception of the Galaxy Note 10.1 have the Tegra 3. I Have not tested all of these but I can tell you that the Galaxy Note 10.1 with the Samsung Exynos is the best Processor and the Transformer prime TF700T and the Acer A700 have the best screens.It is also worth noting that the Galaxy Tab 2 and the Toshiba Excite LE have the Ti Omap 4430 dual core 1.2 ghz processor and that processor is not necessarily better than the Tegra 2. I have actually read a review about the original Galaxy Tab with the Tegra 2 and the new one with the Ti Omap 4430 and they said that the Tegra 2 actually outperformed the Omap in some areas. I have also read consumer reviews about people complaining about Tablets with the Omap Lagging. Amazon also has a Toshiba Excite listed with a pxa270 processor saying that it is a TI Omap clocked at 1.2ghz. The pxa270 is a marvel processor clocked at 520mhz. Marvel bought it from Intel years ago and the Toshiba website does not have anything like that so it is either a typo or worse a knock off I would suspect. I really do not think Toshiba would put a Marvel processor in one of there Tablets as they are found in the cheap chinese Android Tablets. I have now tried out the Galaxy Tab 2, Galaxy Note 10.1 the Toshiba exite Le 10.1 and the Ausus Tf300T. I really liked the Galaxy Tab 2 and it is getting pretty good reviews about on par with the Acer A200 which by the way still rates really high with consumers on Best Buy and Amazon. The Acer A200 is on par with the Galaxy Tab 2, Ausus TF300T and better than the Toshiba Excite any model if you look at the review ratings. In my testing with HD videos the Tegra 2 in the A200 handled them better I noticed some hesitation with the Omap 4430 in movement especially on the Toshiba excite. Playback was smoother on the Acer A200 with the same You Tube HD video. The Excite and the Galaxy Tab 2 screens may have a higher PPI which could be one reason.  They are both good chips with the Omap having dual channel memory with a lower clock speed on the ram and also a lower clock speed on the GPU which could also contribute to slightly lower performance than the Tegra in certain areas and video being one of them . The Omap will slighlty out perform the Tegras CPU but is known to be harder on your battery. I liked the Tf300T and the Tegra 3 worked great with the video playback It just felt very flimsy and bent really easily. So with all of these new tablets on the market and new ones coming out all of the time. One thing has not changed and that is that the Acer A200 is still one of if not the best values in a 10 inch tablet.  Now If you have $500 dollars to spend the Galaxy Note 10.1 is an outstanding tablet. The Ausus TF700T is also getting good reviews but is also $500.00. I had a person comment on the Lenevo Thinkpad which is now $320 at Best Buy for the Tegra 2 version but I have read about it having a lot of shortfalls in reviews. Lenevo has a lot of new models out now that do not have to many consumer reviews. Lenevo is not as mainstream when it comes to tablets as other Brands. If you want a good 10 inch tablet that won't break the bank the A200 is still a great buy and I seriously doubt you would be dissapointed with it. It responds and transitions very quickly through screens and into the app drawer and such. It is a very high quality device and a great deal at $300.00 !", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "Jack L.

I love my iPhone but couldn't see why I should pay for what is basically an oversized iPhone WITHOUT A PHONE. I have been looking at other tablets and was not impressed because they were slow and I could still use'my phone for what the pads would do. In the back of my mind I knew I should wait until Acer had a couple of models on the market because I have used an Acer laptop for several years and have never had a problem with it.Then I saw the review for this Iconia A200 written by Androidaholic. I decided to bite the bullet and jump into the tablet realm.My beautiful new tablet arrived yesterday afternoon. I plugged it in and was charged completely in 53 minutes. This thing is fast easy to set up and really amazing. I am not a Techno wiz at all; that is why I like my iPhone. What really irritated me about the I pad was no flash player and Apples obsessive control over what you may put on YOUR DEVICE AFTER YOU PAY THEM TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THEIR PRODUCT. I could live with it on the phone but not on a tablet.This Iconia is as fast as any I pad I have seen and I know I will enjoy it as much as my Acer laptop. Acer is undervalued in the US because they do not waste money on advertising. They invest in their product and keep giving great value for money. Yes this review was written on my sweet new tablet. I do not think you can go wrong with this tablet.******************It is now March 29 and I have used this tablet daily.  NO problems, very fast, still quite pleased.  I use this for web browsing, ebook reading, social networking, basically everthing that I don't want to sit at my desktop for.  No complaints at all.

Everything looked good except that it kept dropping the wifi connection. Netflix looked good, YouTube looked good, and the video streaming from the USB drive played perfectly.  Then on Thursday it did a major OTA system update, presumably to version 4.0.3.  It took over an hour to update and everything worked fine after it rebooted itself.  But on Friday, the day after the major system update, when I tried to power it on, nothing happened. Thinking that I needed to hold the power button down longer, I tried again.  Well, I tried several more times, and finally I decided to check to see if the thing was even alive with the charger on. There was no light, red or green, on the button. It was DEAD!  Four days after I received it!Needless to say, I contacted ACER customer support, and after being passed on to two different off shore customer support persons, I finally talked to a technical support staff based in the US.  There was nothing he could do to help me if the tablet wouldn't power on.  The technical support person was nice and arranged all the paper work for the tablet to be sent in for repairs at their Texas facility.I liked the way it looked and the fact that was slightly smaller and lighter than the Viewsonic G Tablet that I already owned but very, very disappointed with the product for failing on me 4 days after receiving it.  :-(Update:  4/26/2012So I had the tablet sent in for repairs to Acer's repair facility in Texas.  It took 5 days to get there by FedEx ground, and another week for the repairs, and it was shipped back to me on a Monday and I got it on a Thursday.  From the repair report, there were two things that were replaced - the side cover and the processor itself.  The tablet has worked flawlessly (except for the dropped wifi connection that happens occasionally, and I gather that has more to do more my wifi router because it never drops the connection when I used my iPhone as a modem when I travel) since I got it repaired, and there was one more major OTA system update since.After the initial disappointment, I am quite happy with the product so far.  I am adding another star to my review.

I read every one of the reviews here before I bought mine...thinking I might have trouble also, getting it to turn back on...I find it takes nine to twelve seconds to get it started...like a reset on MP3 players or my Nook.

I wanted the most bang for my buck and the Acer Iconia A200 is really the best price for the most tablet in my opinion. I did a sizable chunk of comparative research. This tablet is just as good as the ipad 2 or the galaxy tab. The only con, for me, is that you have fewer choices for internal flash drive space. So, I recommend that you get an sd card. I have the 16GB version and picked up a 16GB SD card. This tablet is, of course, a bit thicker than the ipad 2 or galaxy pad because it has an honest to goodness USB port. Some of you may not be too crazy about this but for someone who lives and dies by a flash drive this is very convenient. It is by no means 'heavy' just because it is a bit thicker.Its design is very sleek. It also does not have a rear facing camera. It does have a forward facing camera for Skype and video chat. This was a plus for me. I did not want the camera in the back. It also has a large vibrant screen and is very responsive to commands. The screen orients easily and there is a lock screen slider by the volume buttons if you don't want the screen to move. I take notes, stream movies, and work on my online classes with it.

Barnes", "ReviewID": "R5ERYQ9EX2HZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first state that the Iconia Tab A200 (16gig) that I received from Amazon has a manufacture date of March 2012. Some of the issues that I was concerned about, after reading many reviews, may have been addressed by Acer with this manufacturing date. That is only a guess on my part because I have not seen earlier models.Two issues in particular that concerned me were the WiFi reception and the screen glare. These are no longer concerns. The wireless reception on this tablet is fantastic. In a side-by-side comparison with my i-Pad 2, screen glare is on par and there is virtually no difference. In fact I love this screen: extremely bright and sharp. Touch sensitivity and accuracy are right-on.I just love this tablet. The build quality is second to none, with a nice rubbery feel on the back side. It's a little heavier and chunkier than my iPad 2, but not by much and for me the difference is negligible. I have owned a few Android tablets, but this is the first with 1gb of system ram. That, coupled with the NVIDIA Tegra 2 mobile processor with Dual Core ARM Cortex A9, makes for a very snappy tablet that does not disappoint. I know those specs are a little outdated with the latest and greatest seemingly released every week, but the A200 sure is fast.The internet experience on the Iconia Tab is terrific. This factor is probably my number one motivation for this purchase. The supplied Google Chrome Browser is very fast and, because I use Google Chrome on my desktop computer, all of my bookmarks were immediately synced and transferred to the Iconia Tab. That's pretty cool.I could go on and on: battery life great; Android ICS amazing with seamless coordination of contacts and calendar from my Android phone; movies and music very impressive; recognized and connects to my desktop with little effort (I hate iTunes)... Needless to say I highly recommend the Iconia Tab A200.

I got a cheap android e-reader a few months ago and between me and the kids, we found quite a bit of usefulness in it but it just didn't have the extra features to be enjoyable as a tablet.  I have been looking around for quite a while and happened across the Acer Iconia A200 tablet for such a fantastic price.  It had the features I wanted (expandable memory, Ice Cream Sandwich, 10 inch screen, USB port) with none of the ones I didn't want (rear facing camera).  The price was just too good to pass up so I took that plunge and finally got one.  It's been one of the best purchases I've made recently.  It does everything so well.  It's fast, much faster than I even expected it to be.  The Acer tweeks to the interface with the little application ring you can customize is absolutely superb.  It just works so well and it's so easy to use.  I can surf the web using full size web pages, remotely control my PC when I want, transfer files with a USB stick so there is no need to connect to my PC if I don't want, keep up with e-mail, play games, etc.  The kids love it even more than I do.  Since I've gotten it the only time they go to their computer is when I'm using the tablet and make it clear I'm not going to be giving it up any time soon.  Battery life is fantastic, screen display is beautiful.  I can't think of much of anything to say bad about it.  It's been that good.  I honestly had a hard time validating spending the money on a tablet, but once I got one I see, at least for me, it's money well spent.If you're always online or needing a PC, laptop, or mobile phone to look things up, keep track of things, or have access to games or information, then a tablet would be useful to you.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its tough too", "Author": "robin", "ReviewID": "R22I9JN13DLRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a mid priced tablet and I saw the Acer A200 on other websites.

I got mine direct from the Acer Store. I was looking for a Honeycomb OS Tablet which is flawless, I've been reading reviews on various tablets already out there in the market but, couldn't really come across a tablet that have all the positive scores. To give Honeycomb tablets a try, I first got myself a Lenovo Thinkpad tablet, I still can not justify why I went with Lenovo brand as my first choice, it was a horrible expensive experience, It used to restart every 15-20 minutes of use, drops wi-fi within a strong wi-fi zone, GPS never worked and there was ZERO technical support for it. This is where I realized, why so many people write issues in various tablet reviews.Tablets aren't everybody's business...by now there are so many vendors selling tablets in the market but, most of them are here for the sake of having another 'product' linked to their brand. Majorly I see only, Apple, Acer, Samsung, Amazon being serious in the business of Tablets, rest all are just offering sort of trial products.Based on various tablets reviews; being a little hesitant to try another tablet, I selected ACER A200. The choice turned out GREAT ! At $350 it is a gem. The Tablet physical appearance is good with nice rubberized feel to the back.It's 10.1\" screen is very good, colors are bright and fresh. The touch sensitivity is perfect and screen touch response is excellent. I like the full-USB availability, where you can plugin your Flash drive, Mouse, Keyboard etc. The battery life is very much acceptable, it runs on Wi-fi for 7 hours straight and it takes 3.5 hours to charge from 15% (low battery mark) to 100%. GPS works brilliant, I use it at far flung places away from Wi-fi and it locks on satellites in less than 10 mins.The GPS feature alone is a heart stealer for a tablet at this price, it doubles your device from a wi-fi tab to a GPS navigation. The 16GB storage (the maximum offered in A200) is pretty much enough (else get a Micro SD card to be plugged in the slot). Off the 16GB storage, 12GB is available for user applications. This is after my A200 recently got a Ice-Cream Sandwich (ICS) official upgrade and some applications I installed. ICS isn't shipped installed when I got my A200 but Acer marketed this product to be upgradeable to ICS when it launches hence, it was a pleasure to have this model. ICS upgrade have made tablet experience a whole lot smooth, screen enhancements and of course web surfing is more responsive. The Speakers on A200 aren't that bad as many reviewers commented, I ran various music test and it is more attributed to the quality of sound encoding, it may not be that thunderous but still i don't want it to be as I don't use the tablet for room filled music listening....I rather use a nice Bluetooth headset which complements the tablet very much.So for those of you, who are reading reviews to make a buying decision....I'd recommend this Product. It's 10.1\" Screen, 16GB storage, ICS OS, Perfect GPS are some of its great features. There aren't any issues I've found, no warming, no quick battery drainage, no screen bleeding or color washed out effect...nothing of that sort. To me ACER has build its reputation, they really worked on this model and it will remain a choice for many who are looking for an Android OS tablet. There is and will remain competition in Tablet offerings but, as I mentioned earlier, Tablet isn't everybody's game. Few vendors have already dropped their idea, few like Lenovo will soon look somewhere else.

I started with the Acer Iconia A100 (7\" tablet) And when I got that, I was really impressed, but it wasn't much bigger then my cell phone. So I decided to upgrade to the Acer Iconia A200 (I bought them at Best Buy, 14 day return/exchange policy on tablets).This tablet is amazing. It does everything I want it to. I do not care that it doesn't come with an HDMI port, or the fact that it only has a camera on the screen side (you can take pictures of yourself basically) I have a phone with a camera, and a real camera too.It connects easily to WIFI networks and stays connected. It has the full Amazon market, which was the number one thing on my list while shopping for tablets. I have had the tablet for 1 week now, and last night when I turned it on, it automatically prompted me to download the new Android Operating System, 4.something? 'Ice cream sandwich', the update probably took 20 minutes give or take.For the money, this was definately the right tablet for me.The only downside is that there are not a lot of accessories specifically made for this tablet yet. Acer released this tablet mid-januaryish i think, so not many companies have made cases and screen protectors yet. There are a few on Amazon, but I am waiting for some cheaper options to become available. A screen protector is a must, this thing fingerprints very easily!", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm very satisfied with the A200", "Author": "Mark J. Welch", "ReviewID": "R1Z0TMD6GIC7CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Two days after receiving my A200 (16gb), I'm quite happy with it, and probably much more satisfied than I might have been if I hadn't read the earlier Amazon reviews warning of many specific issues.No, it doesn't have an HDMI port, and yes, it's thicker and a little bit heavier than an iPad or Galaxy Tab.  And no, there isn't a rear camera, and the camera that faces me doesn't seem very good, but I can't really imagine using a tablet as a camera. (At a conference I attended last month, I saw people holding up their 10\" tablets over their heads to capture video, and it looked absolutely ridiculous.)The Acer Iconia Tab A200 has a regular-size USB port, and a MicroSD card slot, both of which were important to me. (I actually bought a USB keyboard/case combo for less than $20 here on Amazon, and it works fine when I want to use the tablet on a table or desk.)I'm pretty sure that my tablet came with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) pre-installed, although the box said it wasn't.  (It's possible that it just did the upgrade really quickly when I first turned it on.)Like every other touchscreen device I've used, this tablet's screen was quickly covered with fingerprints.  A third-party screen protector reduced this problem significantly.I'm very price-conscious, and honestly wasn't willing to spend more than $400 on a tablet right now.  I certainly didn't think 7 inches would be enough, and when I looked at an 8\" and several 7\" units in stores, I definitely didn't think I'd be satsified with those smaller sizes.  I was also concerned that using a 10.1-inch screen on a tablet would be a huge \"step down\" from the dual 22-inch monitors on my desktop PC, but it's surprisingly comfortable to work with the 10.1-inch screen.This product works spectacularly as an e-reader (using the Kindle android app, which was pre-loaded). I had used my old iPhone for this in the past, but the screen was just too tiny.I've installed at least a dozen additional apps from the android store (play.google.com), but the tablet is pre-configured to not allow apps from other third-party providers. Fortunately, that notification included a link to the settings page to enable third-party apps.Other folks have complained about the sound volume, but it sounds fine to me (though I don't agree with the fellow who thought the sound was fine when set to 50%). After I installed the Pandora app (streaming music), I did find myself turning the volume down. Perhaps the sound volume levels were changed with the ICS upgrade, or perhaps I'm just less picky.Normally, whenever I buy any new device, I find myself swearing at it during setup or the first few hours of use. I don't think I've sworn at my A200 yet, though I have found myself cursing some App developers who seem incapable of accurately describing their products.I'm very satisfied, so far.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "amazing tablet", "Author": "aidan", "ReviewID": "R1I010TRGTFHMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a tablet that isn't directly for pictures, and is at a great price, this is the tablet for you.

I have a laptop for work but I as not able to easily connect to Audible, Kindle and Zinio because the work network had them blocked.  I just wanted to be able to read my beading magazines and listen to my audible books and read my kindle books and watch movies and TV shows and movies and play games like solitaire and mahjongg.

This table already had Zinio and Kindle installed - they are working great.I had one must have option that I wasn't going to compromise on - (hint to Amazon on the Kindle Fire -Micro SD) I wanted to make sure I had some kind of extra storage.  The Acer 200 has that slot.  The main thing that put me over the edge was it also has a USB port that you can connect a mouse o keyboard into as well as a thumb drive or external hard drive.  It also has Honeycomb installed which is one of the newer Android OS's.This tablet has a good feel - feels well built.  It has a textured back so fingerprints on that back side won't be a problem.

The speakers are much better than I expected with enough volume if one is using it in his hands, but I'll still use it with headphones because of the sound quality.  It has only a front facing camera, but I doubt I would use it even if it had a rear facing camera since I have a nice small 14 MP pocket size camera.  The GPS works great, but again I have a Tom Tom GPS that I have used about 3 times in 4 years.  I usually know how to get to where I'm going.  Google maps are also great and give good directions.  Since the initial set-up The battery is at 33% after 61 hours with about 7 hours of actual use and the remainder of the time is at \"sleep\".  The first night I did the set up and played with it a little and downloaded about 10 apps that I use frequently in less than 2 hours.  The overall feel of  the case is superb.  It has a nice quality feel.  I downloaded a couple of books and it makes a great eReader.  Price aside, this is one of the best tablets that I've seen displayed in stores.  If anyone is in the market and can get one for under $275, don't hesitate, just do it, as I did.  The suggested retail is normally $349.  The info card at the display said Android 3.2 (honecomb), but when I got it up and running I found it using Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

However, I have used another tablet, that a friend bought at best buy, and it seems to match the performance.  The seller did not have the 8gb tablet on hand after I placed my order, rather than cancelling my order and refunding my money, they did a wonderful thing and sent me the 16gb tablet that they did have on hand with out any additional charge.  I recommend the seller and the product.  Nice job!Product review update: 5/25/14Still using this product.  Actually this review is being updated by using this tablet.  I like this tablet because it was low cost and works fine.  The tablet sometimes freezes as of late, so I downloaded a ram booster app.  Think it did the trick. I hardly ever use the camera, but it works fine for Skype. Speakers are hard to hear, but downloaded equalizer app and it increased the volume a lot.  This is a good tablet for the cost conscious and maybe a first tablet for kids.  Why spend over 4 hundred bucks for kids that drop and break things all the time. Hope this review helped.

The device itself works perfectly. I can honestly say it is wonderful to work on for surfing, reading email, watching Netflix and Youtube. Documents and videos open flawlessly. One of my main concerns was the onscreen keyboard as I like to type - The A200 has a great onscreen keyboard. As others have reported, you need to decide if you need a camera on the back (I don't), or an HDMI out (I don't) - and I'm glad to not have to pay the extra dollars for those features.

Considering the price is half or less of the iPad, it is a very good bargain.  It paired quickly with my Creative Bluetooth stereo speakers and plays music with good volume from 25 feet away sounding good in an open 25 x 50 room.  I really want to watch TV episodes of Showtime on it as soon as Showtime puts out an Android app (it promises \"soon.\") The clips I was able to watch were good HD and the built-in sound is really amazing.  The only complaint I have (thus 4 stars) is a fairly short battery life. I know the unit would be heavier if the battery had more capacity, but that's what there is.  This was recommended by a friend and I will recommend it to my friends.But wait! A couple of days ago when I booted up the pad, it gave me the Iconia logo on the opening screen and froze right there.  I tried rebooting several times without getting into the tablet.  I charged it overnight and retried several times without help.  I'm going to see if it can be retuned for repair because I want to know what went wrong.  Otherwise I'm going to return it for a refund and forget about it.  What a disappointment!  I've downgraded it to one star and withdrawn my recommendation until I see what happened to it.10/7/12 Received email response from Acer Support asking for serial number, etc., etc. before they can authorize sending it to depot repair.  Since I registered the pad with Acer the moment I received it, I fail to see why they don't just access that information. I sent info and am waiting.Did all the hoop-jumping and sent unit for repair and received it from the repair depot in a timely way.  They replaced the main circuit board and it has been working fine for the past several weeks so I changed to a four-star rating.It is now January 20, 2013 and my Iconia is still working very well.

Which is it, Pros and Cons", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "R3AV0CP7AURAOQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've worked on computers most of my life, so I didn't just fall off of the turnip truck when it comes to technology. I was never really into android, linux, or any of the mac based operating systems, always been a windows guy myself. I've used Android a little bit on other people tablet pcs, phones etc. The learning curve isn't bad at all, once you realize how everything works it's a bit tedious but you get use to it. I've also been using Acer products since about 1997 or so, so I tend to stick with what i know is good and what has treated me well. Acer itself has had it's ups and downs just like any other company. Other than the IPAD, the Acer Iconia along with the Motorola Zoom were some of the first out on the market with what's now referred to as \"tablet PC's\". One of the main reasons i chose the Iconia Tablet is because of it's USB abilities, being one of the only ones i've seen on the market with an actual port. The problem is, it's very fickle whether or not it will recognize the device you plug in, some may, some won't. Also once you plug it in, it's extremely difficult to find out where the content is, and/if it will indeed play it or not. Even syncing it up with other devices was a task and it took forever to bring up hardly any of the content from an actual external HD. You can just plug it directly into the PC to transfer files, but that defeats the purpose of me getting this model. It i wanted to do that i would have gotten and IPAD, Sony Tablet, or Samsung Galaxy. So here......Pros-Good battery life, decent sound, plenty of apps, great wifi connectivity. Decent speed, good graphics for the games it gives you, lots of free things. Updates to Android 4.0 ICS. Supports the latest version of Utorrent, which works great. Nice solid feel, the USB port(was a plus).Cons-Bulkier than most Tablet PCs. Even though i said the sound is decent it's not really loud enough. The screen is washed out, definitely not as good as the Iconia A500, non vibrant. Navigation isn't that smooth, lags a bit, (of course remember this is the cheap version of this tablet), and it's NOT an IPAD. The USB recognition problem which i have yet to fix. Also finding files from your USB device is a pain. Color is very drab. Camera is awful.So like most reviewers have said it's basically just your BASIC tablet pc, nothing special, and there was no real need to go from the A500, A100, to this. So i may keep it, i may not, it all depends on the USB issue. That's why the biggest percentage of people get this one, so they don't have to sync up or plug into a main computer to get files they want. Although there are plenty of apps on this thing, if you don't have WIFI your dead in the water for anything to do on it. So be sure you read this before buying, and if you want to use the transfer cable, be my guest. But there are much better tablets (more expensive) to do that with. And it defeats the purpose of the Acer Iconia.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "acer iconia a200", "Author": "brandon", "ReviewID": "R3BPM8I5W5P0HY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is a very good quality for the price.

The bottom line is the 2 major things that sold me on this unit was the 10.1\" screen and the fact, according to Acer's own website, that the unit was capable of being wi-fi and/or bluetooth tethered via a tethering capable phone (which mine is).A couple of things happened while attempting tethering: 1) When trying to tether the unit via WiFi - the A200 does not even see the SSID (even tried to set it up manually to no avail), and 2) When attempting bluetooth tethering, the A200 actually shows that it is \"connected for internet\" via bluetooth when in fact it actually is not. I did a live chat with an Acer tech yesterday and after they had me go through their routine of resetting the A200 (which I had done prior to contacting them) - their final word was that it must be a problem with my tethering software. That would have been ok except that I also own a bluetooth enabled laptop and with the same software they are telling me is flawed - was able to tether my phone to my laptop for internet using BOTH methods (WiFi & bluetooth) with no problems whatsoever.The ability to do this was a must for whatever tablet I purchased so this thing is basically useless to me. Additionally, another problem that Acer does not wish to recognize about this product is when you attempt to shut bluetooth off, the unit simply hangs up for about 10 seconds - then reboots itself.The things I have mentioned here are discussed heavily in Acer's own forum, yet they refuse to acknowledge that the unit has issues. Not everyone's tethering program in their phone can be flawed and others, like me, report the same thing: able to tether to other units but not the A200.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "What I paid for...", "Author": "M.

It was a 10.1 inch (diagonal) display, and ran a dual core CPU of some make (ARM, perhaps?). Until it met its end, it was a completely satisfactory tablet. The only complaint I had about it was that it's heat level grew while the battery was charging; but not so bad as to make it unusable.The most irritating complaint I *do* have is the sturdiness (NOT) this unit is made with. A mere fall from 16\" was enough to shatter the screen glass (death to a touch-screen device): it fell lower-left-hand-corner first, and it actually struck the hardwood floor on that corner, as far as I could tell, there was no direct contact between the glass and the hardwood. But the craze pattern shows that the cracking started from the LLC (lower left hand corner), then grew like a tree in the direction of the URC. The \"branches\" of that craze tree (there were 14 of them, in total). I'm surprised that so little a force could do so much damage. I've tortured tested laptops by dropping them 7' onto cured cement, and the damage was nowhere near total as this one. I've also tortured other tablets (iPad all sorts, Galaxy all sorts, several Nooks, etc.) -- none of them exhibited this kind of damage at similar stresses. My **phone** (original Samsung Galaxy S) is more durable than this: I can run it over with a car and not damage anything non-superficial.I took it back to where I bought it: Staples. I am asking all to seriously reconsider buying anything major from Staples at all. I declined to purchase their rather expensive warranty when I bought the tablet, and because I didn't buy that warranty, Staples wouldn't even accept the item for warranty service, never mind that the Iconia was still under factory warranty. I have permanently fired Staples: they won't be receiving any more of my money -- Wal-Mart does a better job of customer service and satisfaction than Staples does.I now own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1\", which I bought from Wal-Mart, along **with** the reasonably ($28) priced two year replacement warranty.I have had a most amicable relationship with Staples until today. As of today, I have fired them, and ask all who read this to reconsider spending money there. I left my Staples Reward card on the counter just to remind them of the revenue they'll be missing from here forward. You know, all they had to do was temporarily absorb the $270 or so I spent on the Iconia to begin with, and perhaps Staples would have stayed in the running for repeat dollars. NOT ANY MORE.
