{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent tablet (if you can get it for the right price)", "Author": "Blake", "ReviewID": "R1MOKVVDJUR9VJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this tablet a few days ago because it was on sale. It's decent. The build quality isn't great (when you push you fingers on the back panel you can see warpage in pixels on the screen). But if you take care of it, it doesn't seem too bad. The performance is decent enough. I am mainly using it to hook up via mini hdmi to my 2nd tv to stream netflix and hulu. As the other reviewer mentioned, the sound isn't very good. I've also noticed that the battery life seems to be terrible. I've only had it for a couple days, but I charged it before I went to sleep, did some minor website viewing for 10-15 minutes and when I woke up 8 hours later, it was at 18% and a couple minutes later was requesting a charge. I may try and root and see if theres any skytex software on it that may be causing the issue (uninstalled other skytex apps). Will update if that works. All in all, a decent purchase if you can get it at the right price.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "XMAS gift for husband, again", "Author": "leslie benjamin", "ReviewID": "R24JSQFXGV2LKS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Seems very pleased with the Skytex, although the name was not a real familiar one to me.

No warranty there.Have now received a new skypad and it seems to be working fine.  Thank you Patrick, the only thing missing was the charger for the wall.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "If you know how to work this thing . . . .", "Author": "twins mom", "ReviewID": "R23I08X4AW3J2B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product has a lot to offer, however the software is not standard and if you are unfamiliar with the Skytex system, you won't be able to use as you would other tablets or your standard software, web browsing, downloading apps.  I had to reconfigure the system to make it more user friendly.  Love the camera and video feature which I wanted for my 10 year old daughter.  I bought a Kindle for me but even at almost $200 it doesn't have camera/video.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what i expected", "Author": "Vic Buchanon", "ReviewID": "R32M0IMOPG03RH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this item for my wife. She loves the idea of being mobile and not having to carry something around too heavy, however the one thing that really upset her about this item is the battery seems to only last 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The specs says the battery life should be closer to eight hours. If she is on a long flight, the battery will die out before she gets to her destination and once she gets there she still has to wait for it to charge.This factor alone would give me pause to recommend this item.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sucked", "Author": "james broadhead", "ReviewID": "R1UVEVYN6NHR6D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible tablet.
