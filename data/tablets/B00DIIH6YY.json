The setup time from the box to working was less than 10 minutes.  Every App that I have downloaded works well. It boots fast and the response on my wireless network is the same as I experience with my HP laptop. Screens render fast; almost instantaneously.I was a little hesitant on purchasing reading the negative reviews. From my research before purchasing, some of the issues I decided are operator related. For example, when  plugging in the charge cord, the tablets starts up. That is common with Android devices; it works the same way with my Nook.I cannot see any practical difference compared to an iPad other than price. In fact, the screen resolution is better on the Dragon tablet.  Overall, it exceeds my expectations as a generic tablet in lieu of purchasing an iPad. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone.If you decide to buy, make sure to purchase the tablet with the 4.2 Jelly Bean OS and not an earlier version. The earlier OS versions may be problematic.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "FAST, GOOD WIFI RADIO, BRILLIANT SCREEN, JELLY BEAN", "Author": "J. F.

Also the camera at 2.0 front and back could be left off completely.I compensated for the camera because I use a Kodak and Nikon digital . I bought this to replace a 7\" ainol basic which was ok,but did not have gorrilla glass and got broken. Its all about price. Where is the customer support ?

Unfortunately, the first Nexus 7 that I received suffered from freezing and shutting down issues, as did the next two replacements. I finally received a refund last week. The whole process was time consuming and tied up my money for almost 2 1/2 months. Now the dilemma as to what to order next... I looked through what Amazon has to offer and found the Dragon Touch 9.7 with its' high resolution. The price was right - same price as the Nexus 7 and with a larger screen. So, after much deliberation, I decided to order one and received it in just two days.The Dragon Touch now comes with Android 4.2 already loaded! The tablet operated perfectly right out of the box (great packaging). I have downloaded several apps now (including Kindle Books) - everything, including games, run great - fast / no lags. The sound from the single speaker is loud enough... just not stereo (the Dragon Touch 9.7 comes with ear buds which are good). Its' camera takes acceptable pictures. It is a well built tablet and easy to use (basically same screen set up as the Nexus 7). The case fits well too. I am very pleased to finally have a tablet that works!!!", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not great", "Author": "JR Brown \"Buckstar\"", "ReviewID": "R39FZ7C4GB0ZWW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was happy with the product for the first week.Then I started downloading more apps & I noticed the performance significantly slow down, to the point where I no longer wanted to use the device.  I put it away & stopped using it.I began using the device again as an e-reader on a cross-country road trip.  However, the power button broke so I cannot turn on the device.  When I tried to contact them through Amazon company's response was that it was past the return/service period.  This was less than 4 months after purchasing the device.Overall, the specs were good.  However, it appears as if they have taken some shortcuts on quality and service and it really shows.  I wish I would have paid for a better tablet because now I just have a piece of garbage.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Dragon Touch R97 Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1MJLNGJGHX20W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'm comparing this tablet to a Kindle Fire Happy. The Dragon Touch screen is quite comparable to the Kindle vivid colors, bright and quite smooth scrolling. Processor wise,  this is way faster and provides additional storage  (Kindle doesn't)  Wifi isn't up to the Kindle, it is not capable of seeing the 5 gigahertz frequencies nor does the Dragon have the better antenna. The sound of the Dragon is better than most tablets but isn't Dolby. Battery life is better than I anticipated. Google Apps work great and I have yet to find any of the any apps that don't work. Amazon's sensorship of apps does not come into play. I could continue on praises.The down side, so far my only complaints are with touch screen sensitivity and that Dragon Touch does not build auto brightness into their devices. Neither of these items deter significantly from my enjoyment of this tablet. If you take the differences in cost,  this device is well worth the investment.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am luving it :-)", "Author": "lt_4ever", "ReviewID": "R14MBAXLTPHYDD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must say it was worth the money I've spent [bough mine for $217] At my purchased price, it beat all other brand name tablets with same system specs. I have it for 2 months and I am super happy with it :-) The only downside to this tablet is that it does not come with larger internal storage. with so many great game out there and 16gb does not hold much [A good game file is averaging 1gb] There are 32mb tablet with same system specs but the cost is $80 more, around $300 and that was too steep just for 16 more gbs. Also its camera are not so great, only 2MP. If you looking just for a tablet for browsing online + Game + Video [forget those brand name tablets which are overpriced] get this one. It is fast and retina display is amazing. Battery is great, last up to 8-10 hours of watching video or game play.For all Android device, I do highly recommend some best FREE useful apps from play store: [video player] Archos video player + Archos codecs [CLEAN & RAM BOOST] Clean Master from KS mobile. And last but not least, you also can make FREE UNLIMITED CALL within the US on any Android devices using WIFI by combining these two apps: Google Vocie + GrooVe IP Lite [google it]PS: The reason I give this tablet only 4 stars because I had it only for 2 months and I always reserve the last star for when this tablet quality & performance do surpass at least one year of usage.. Also if you gonna get it from else where, make sure the Android OS version is from 4.2 and up [Mine came with version 4.2.2] because I do see user reviews complaining of its performance when use with Android OS lower version.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Price/Performance ratio", "Author": "Craig R.

Email set up along with wi fi networks all loaded and set up automatically.I have ordered the micro HDMI cable and the USB OTG from Amazon a minute ago so we will see how all of this works but surprised with the quality so far.Highly recommend this purchase at this point in time.UPDATE: Received the OTG cable today from Amazon and it works like a champ. Easy plug and play since all I did was insert the micro into the micro input, plugged in a flash drive and VIOLA it worked!Went into settings and mounted the USB storage and the tablet recognized the drive right away.I am a little confused by the HDMI Micro cable that I purchased since it states that it has Ethernet but I am not clear as to what do they mean exactly?UPDATE: Well now that a little time has passed the tablet is beginning to lag once more apps are loaded.The sound levels on this are terrible and I have tried to boost the volume but no real improvement with Volume Boosters from the market.The touch screen sounds are just about non existent and the music and video playback volume is terrible.This is beginning to lose it's shine.UPDATE: So Tablet Express has instructed me to reload the software from their site in order to fix any problems.Their severs will not provide the download and the customer service phone line goes unanswered.Amazon are you there to resolve??", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "First impressions = Awesome", "Author": "JPhill", "ReviewID": "R2HFJEOBG8DDGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been doing the third party shuffle trying to find myself a quality tablet without paying AAA brand premium mark-ups. I've only had the tablet a day but I am blown away by the craftsmanship. The tablet has a steel frame and back. It's about half an inch thick and the supporting frame is also steel! The touch screen is protected initially by a frame with helpful gesture instructions along with warranty/ replacement fulfillment information.  The speakers for this unit are located on the sides of the unit which is great because it allows me to use the device with my portfolio stand/keyboard case without losing sound quality.

Finally, something with a nice screen not limited by the apple universe.  Was willing to accept some compromises for the price and realize it is not an ipad.  The screen is very nice and the hdmi out is a great feature. It's a downer that you can't charge it with the usb.  Seems decently responsive but some apps run a little slow.I upgraded it to android 4.2 successfully using the website instructions, since then it has locked up 3 times in way that is impossible to reboot.  There is no way to remove the battery and no hard reset button.  Could not determine any combination of buttons that would reboot it.  You have to wait a day for the battery to run down before it will reboot.4.2 is nicer but the netflix app no longer works.

All my other mobile devices can be kept very far from my HotSpot such as, on another floor and on the opposite end of my house.  Otherwise, I receive very poor reception.  Don't understand why.3. Biggest complaint is that the volume is not very high.  I can keep the tablet plugged-in for extended battery use and place my modem close-by for decent signal strength, but I have to sit/lie very, very close to hear the volume (unless I get a pair of earphones.)  I can hear my Nook in another room on another floor, but I have to strain to hear the volume on full blast with this device.I needed a full-functional Android tablet, since the Nook has limited Chrome OS capability.  The Kindle has its own limited OS as well.  One can not download streaming video from simple broadcast, as well as, basic cable networks.
