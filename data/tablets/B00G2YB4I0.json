{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautifully built, incredibly fast, the best tablet computer ever!", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3CXMI18TV70OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer.  Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about.  If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game).  Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\".  Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"Luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems.  It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay.  Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together.  The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online.  Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading News stories.  As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the UK Daily Mail newspaper Online - personally I prefer a web digest from free app Zite).* Reading Books.  It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages.  Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films.  I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Reading and replying to mail.  I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos.  Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games.  From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio.  With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.  My personal favourite is London UK based XFM - alternative rock* Listening to music.  I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* The list goes on and on.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen.  If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay.  Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet.  A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen.  Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air.  Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference).  Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options.  The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store (which I would highly recommend - fantastic service), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory:  Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc).  However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+$100 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air).  But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads.  Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out.  Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular:  Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about.  This will add an additional +$100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card.  This means (for an additional $5-10 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move.  Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover.  Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it.  There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen.  Apple charge from $35 to $65 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from $10.  Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard ($20-$70), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor).  I'd recommend the ogitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Grey and the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully.  For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone.  Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.How should I set it up?--------------------------Well, if you already own an iPad or iPhone it's incredibly easy.  Just log in with your existing iTunes and iCloud accounts, and select the option to either set this up as a new iPad or restore from backup.If you've never owned an iPad before - read on to hear about how to set up an iTunes and iCloud account - it certainly confused me the first time I used them.+ iTunes account - is how you buy your music, Apps or films from Apple.  You register your credit card with them, and protect the account with a secure password+ iCloud account - is used to identify you as an individual.  This gives you 5Gb of backup space (your iPad will be automatically backed up when you charge it), and also means your iPad will work together with your iPhone.How to set them  up:1) Create a SINGLE iTunes account for your immediate family and children.  Then when you buy an App, it's immediately available (for free) to all the family members.  Maybe once the children reach 15-16 they'll want their own account (as otherwise they'll end up spending your hard earned cash on your credit card to buy music you don't want).  Until then - it's a great way to share the Apps.2)  Create YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL iCloud account for person.  That means if you buy an iPhone you can share data (eg. reminders, notes or calendar events) across both devices.  If you're partner (and maybe even children) have their own iCloud account they also have 5Gb of space, and can keep their own notes and documents private.Easy when you know how.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip.  Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including  + iMovie - edit and publish home made movies  + Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad  + Pages - Word processor  + GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit  + iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat.As the UK based consumer magazine \"Which?\" magazine put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested.  Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.  If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Longer lasting power, faster, lighter, with free top quality apps to

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version.  My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot.  Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad.  In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long.  Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed.  The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing.  The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user.  The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air.  I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.  The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce.  The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size.  The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps.  It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved.  It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!  This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.  You can see the difference in the photos, videos and reading quality of the screen.* Dual speakers in the bottom* Free high quality Apps* iPhoto* iMovie* GarageBand* Pages* Keynote* Remember to download these from Apple!Overall this is a superior product that really outperforms the older iPads that I have.  I was disappointed that the new iPad Air did not have the home button with the fingerprint sensor built in.  Since I have used it with my iPhone 5S I have really become attached to it and it just seems like a way to cheapen the unit and be more competitive instead of showing and using the enhanced technology.  I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "ReviewID": "R2RCYFJ9NNSROC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is everything I imagined it would be and a lot more. This latest generation iPad is so much lighter than previous versions; it is now approaching the weight of a Kindle - meaning it is easy to hold for a long time. The body is about two inches narrower, making it easier to hold. The retina display is so darn sharp and looks great.The iPad Air finally pushed me to upgrade my original, version 1 of the iPad. I bought that iPad on release day, seemingly millions of years ago. I loved that device, my one complaint was that the iPad was too heavy - everything else about it was great. Now that I've used the Air, I'll never go back. This was an upgrade well worth doing.November 2, 2013 Update: After using this for two days and thinking harder about the iPad, I figured you might want a few reasons why this might not be for you. Your iPad works just great and you don't do much more than read email, play angry birds, and look at websites all at home. In my case I went from a slow turtle first generation iPad to this lightning fast new version - I'm blown away. And if you have a latest previous version and get a great deal on recycling your current model (read at least $200) then it might make a lot of sense. This is an expensive device, and a MacBook Air is not all that far away from the iPad, after you add $60 for a case, $100 for two years of accidental breakage coverage, and maybe $60 for a keyboard. A MacBook Air at $1100 suddenly doesn't look all that expensive anymore, especially if you opt for the 128GB option of the iPad. Of course there is nothing like holding one of these new iPads and they are super sweet. If you are super logical and conservative, this is probably not the device for you.On the other hand, I decided to jump in both feet first.Setup was super fast and easy. There is a good step-by-step wizard to get the device running. Since I have an iCloud account, I was blown away with how fast this thing synced. That whole improved WiFi antenna is not hype - the device connected quickly with my network. Most devices take a while to connect to my network, this was painless and fast. Filling in the information for my mail account, it seemed like seconds and new email was downloaded - significantly faster than my other iPad.I had a choice during set up to restore from a backup or set up the unit as new. I chose new device, so none of my apps loaded right away. If I had chosen a backup, I could plug this into my computer and with iTunes could have grabbed my purchased apps. All incredibly seamless.Video is stunning. Amazon Prime Video took seconds to start (I've gotten used to 15-20 seconds). The video started in standard def, and within 15 seconds switched to high def. So much faster than happens even on my PS3. I have never seen buffering move this fast, scanning forward, there was a 5 second delay for buffering and the movie resumed. Sound is much better than the single speaker. It is still not great, just more passable. It is silly that they put two speakers on the bottom of the iPad. A speaker on top and bottom would give movies stereo. Music sounds better. Two speakers put out more sound, the stereo effect is minimal, the two speakers are one inch apart.This is an incredible display for films. The blacks are deep, rich, and have great tone range. Out of the box, this display looks fantastic.Everything moves so darn fast. Switching apps is a snap. New apps load with a blink of an eye.I'm glad I bought the full size iPad; Apple got this size and weight exactly right. I think this is well worth the extra $100 over the retina mini to be released the end of November. Apple has blurred the lines between these two devices. I guess they've done the same thing with iPods, so it makes sense they would do it with the iPad.If you've used iOS 7 on an iPhone, the iPad is essentially the same thing - you will feel right at home.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful product, non-premium hardware.", "Author": "Avenging Taco", "ReviewID": "R52KR35VM0NQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several Apple products, and the iPad is the most distinguished among Apple's line up relative to its competition.  The most compelling aspects of this tablet are the beautiful design, and the 10 hour battery life.  These are the two features that made me decide to purchase another Apple product irrespective of their business practices which try to squeeze money out of their customers by not supporting devices properly after they are released.After having used this product for over a month now, I can say it is an improvement over my iPad 1.  The browser now crashes on the original to the point of making it worthless.  My original iPad had 256 MB of RAM which is not enough to load a lot of modern web pages without the browser crashing.  That is why I had hoped the 1 GB of RAM in the iPad Air would be sufficient, and it has improved, yet I still find that the browser crashes on occasion.  The scroll latency is very subtle, but noticeable to me.  It doesn't really impact my usage, but it could create problems for people who game on their iPads.  Putting in 2 GB of RAM (which is what I have in my Nexus 4) does not cost that much, and would improve the performance greatly.  For a premium product, I expect the best, and Apple has consistently under-delivered on processing hardware which created the same problems all the way back to the iPhone 1 I purchased on launch day.I take 1 star off for business practices which burn through your pocket, and the second star is removed for needless low-RAM browser crashes that are still a problem on the latest iteration (which is likely planned to force relegation of old devices and compel new sales.)  Still, I can say that this is the best 10 inch tablet available, and android has no viable alternative worth purchasing.  If you can overlook the two biggest strikes I have against Apple, you should consider no other 10 inch tablet at this time.UPDATE 1/17/14Today I called into Apple support because my browser is crashing frequently.  I am now experiencing 5 - 10 browser crashes a day when it was only 2 - 3 times a week when I first purchased it.  Speaking with the Apple support technician, he said that they have not received many complaints about this issue yet, so I may be experiencing a rare software or hardware problem.  I looked through my crash log (which had over 100 crash reports in it since Nov. 11th) and the vast majority of them were low memory crashes.  However, the tablet did not operate this way when I initially purchased it, and it began to increase in frequency about 2 weeks ago.  Therefore I suspect that there is a software conflict (I still have 4 GBs of free flash hard drive space, so I doubt it is a conflict with virtual memory, although a RAM hardware problem is possible).  I went through some basic procedures the technician recommended, and I was advised to do a system wipe if the problems should persist.  I will test the tablet for a few days before wiping everything and starting over. I'll update this review once I am confident of what the issue was.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple still rules the tablet world.", "Author": "Makavelli02", "ReviewID": "R3AWGSO5C50M8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me tell you I am not an apple fanboy. I own and support samsung products. I carry a galaxy note 2 with me every day and would not consider an iPhone until the make some huge changes to it. Last year I bought a nexus 7 and loved it. Now that it's specs are getting a little dated I had to look for an upgrade. The new nexus 7 didn't impress me with it's dated CPU. So I looked to the note 2014 and the iPad air. I used both side by side and researched every detail. I sell these things for a living. The note is very impressive but, for all it's stats and hardware features it still struggles with simple movements. You can point out is 3 gigs of ram and the very good snapdragon 800 quad core CPU. Then you have apples 1 gig of ram with the measly dual core a7 CPU. ????? Now for the real world facts and it pains me to say this because I love android, but the fact is the a7 in the iPad air with it's upgraded clock speed at 1.39 gigs has yet to be matched in any bench mark from another mobile processor including the quad core s 800 by snapdragon. And with the future in mind the 64 bit tech is hard to beat. Them to the 1 gig of ram vs the 3 gigs in the note. If you can't use all that horsepower why put it in there. The air is twice as snappy as the note with no lag what so every. The note on the other hand lags even on swiping through home screens. It all comes down to the operating system apple remains king. Android may be pretty and customizable but that all comes at a cost. That cost is performance. You can take a car with 500 horsepower and put it on a curvy bending road. All that horsepower doesn't mean a thing. The car with 200 horsepower will still win by going straight.So I bought the air and love it.

They all went back to the store after much disappointment & I would go back to reading on the Kindle App.The iPad Air has become my mini workstation, paired with an Apple wireless keyboard, my library, my entertainment zone where I watch movies, play games & listen to music. I can also shop, do research-the list is endless! The device is as light as air even with a leather cover. It stays cool-no overheating. It is fast & with 128g, there is room for what interests me.

I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing.

I am neither an apple/pc/android fanboy, I use the tool that gets the job done reliably. (Ever have a paper due and your computer breaks down?) I own a macbook, iphone, windows desktop, and had a Nexus 7 for a short time but wanted a tablet with a larger screen.So lets get down to it- initial impression was \"Wow!\" and I never realized how chunky or laggy the Nexus 7 was. The resolution, animations, user interface, and general build quality is superb in my opinion. It feels like a device \"that will get work done\". Unfortunately, the iPad out of the box feels like a digital storefront for the App store as opposed to something I can do school work on. Bluntly, the device is unnecessarily handicapped. For me to put my own videos on it, I have to use Handbrake and waste 3-4 hours to convert the movie to something the iPad can play. The Nexus 7 played almost any format out of the box. Using textbook PDFs is horrible, there are only a few quality apps that offer continuous scrolling. If your course requires mymathlabs, webassign, or one of those other edu-gimmicks to do homework, good luck, most of them require Flash which is unsupported. Then I went to use safari.. advertisements everywhere! Same with every free app, constant advertisements! Occasionally I have to download PDF to read for course work. Ain't happening in safari- there is no way to download and the page will refresh if you close the app. Good luck reading where there is no wifi.Then I jailbroke it, installed f.lux, adblockerNetworks, safari downloader, nitrous, retinapad, vplayer video player, and videopane. That took care of the blinding blue light at night time, killed off 90% of advertisements, I can download files now, iPhone only apps are now in HD, I can watch almost any format of video too. Now the device is useful!After that, I installed DocsToGo to read PDFs with continuous scrolling and to write papers. I also HIGHLY recommend Notes Plus if you intend on hand writing notes. Lastly, I would suggest getting the \"Papers\" app (no typo) to read PDFs with multiple columns.Overall, iPad has a lot of potential but is held back by Apples walled garden. After jailbreaking and eliminating the majority of the artificial handicaps, I feel OK with heading to school only with it and not worrying about it not being capable of doing something.

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video. The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce. The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size. The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer! This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch. You can see the difference in the photos, videos and reading quality of the screen.* Dual speakers in the bottom* Free high quality Apps* iPhoto* iMovie* GarageBand* Pages* Keynote* Remember to download these from Apple!Overall this is a superior product that really outperforms the older iPads that I have. I was disappointed that the new iPad Air did not have the home button with the fingerprint sensor built in. Since I have used it with my iPhone 5S I have really become attached to it and it just seems like a way to cheapen the unit and be more competitive instead of showing and using the enhanced technology. I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the purchase", "Author": "Xiaodong Cheng", "ReviewID": "R39R44Y8UD95AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a beautiful unit, with solid construction, gorgeous display, and of course very light and thin compared with older models.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice hardware for the price! Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do.

However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty.

I told we would both have to download Skype to teleconference with eachother and she said forget it. too much trouble.  then I'd have to buy new extra chargers/cables etc. just too much incompatibility. so I returned it and bought this and I'm thrilled and happy with it. if I wasn't used to Apple products I would have kept the the Kindle. just being honest as I don't want anyone to think that the Kindle wasn't good", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed first time apple customer", "Author": "Ginfx", "ReviewID": "R3PXX0AJCUBKMP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to purchase my first apple product. This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out.  Sadly it will be going back.  iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp.  Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed.

Amazing product.  I have an ipad 4 and this in my house now.  The size and weight of this is terrific, though the comments about the brightness being less and the screen feeling a little cheaper rang true to me as well.I am also having the memory loss issue on the ipad air some have mentioned.  First, there is an ipad 4 in my household and it is also 16gb and, having passed it down to a family member, was very happy with it.  That said, the 16gb Ipad 4 has about 13.5 gb of usable space prior to loading anything, while the air somehow has 12.8.  Not really a big deal.  However, I have noticed my usable memory dropping dramatically (500 mb) on the air when doing streaming or using facetime.  I don't recall that happening on the ipad 4.  The memory does not recover afterwards, even after days and seems to continue to drop 100mb every other day even when I'm not using it.  It is not the apps or newspapers loading, as I pulled a lot of stuff off to check it.  I'm a light user of apps and don't store content, so 16gb was enough in my prior ipads, but on this one I'm getting worried. I was able to free the memory back up, but only after doing a full restore of the ipad as new and letting my cloud stuff stream back.  I really don't want to have to do full restores every few months.  For those interested, when connecting to itunes, it is the \"other\" category of memory that keeps expanding.  Tried calling Apple several times, but all they could offer was to do the restore.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long", "Author": "RUSH46", "ReviewID": "R3TO3MYT3N3189", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this specifically to download and use some speech therapy applications for my wife who had a stroke.

But not without some downfalls due to recent changes.", "Author": "Sean Cushman", "ReviewID": "RNGUUYGUJBQ80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright so I know if you are reading this then you already have your mind set on a new iPad and hey you know what? That's great. I'm a dual user. I love my PC products and Android and I love my mobile Apple products as well. I don't take sides or at least only when it concerns the best bang for the money at least. I've been using iPad's since I bought my mother her first one at release (she is disabled and iPad's (or tablets in general) are wonderful tools for those less than capable of using a keyboard and mouse. I also fell in love with it , the design was just amazing , the feel was great and the capability was very impressive when you consider at that time tablet's were barely around at the consumer level. Seeing the look on her face made it worth every single penny. Prior to getting the iPad she suffered a horrible infection and was hospitalized for 4 months fighting it , nearly losing her life in the process. She lost the capability to stand and only has use of her left hand now (with about 80 percent capability) and couple that with MS and you get someone who can't really use a mouse and keyboard setup easily.I wanted to state that before what I'm sure I will be accused of being a critical troll about the latest iPad version compared to a recent Android tablet I bought.Now onto the experience thus far with this new iPad , here is a list of what I like :1. LIGHT. Seriously , incredibly light. I can hold it in one hand very comfortably and its not meant to be held in such a way for the regular Joe ( I got big hamhocks for hands). I love it when technology trims up as it shows that its forward march is continuing without pause.2. FAST. Even over the iPad 4th generation this lean machine is even faster at multitasking which is good because it will help versus the recent Android tablet I bought which is a multitasking god.3. THIN BEZEL. If there is one complaint I have for the consumer electronics of the world in general its that we haven't done enough to remove overly large bezels from products. I hate them. I find they are a waste of real estate but I also realize that this is part of the technical limitation and the need for space for various reasons (board hardware , batteries and so on). The iPad Air's bezel is at least half of all previous iPad's. Very much appreciated Apple.Those are the biggest reasons to buy an iPad Air and they are really good ones in my mind. If you already own an iPad 4th gen though I don't think they are enough to justify the upgrade unless you really want the reduced weight (the iPad 4th gen is a pound and half while the iPad Air is only a pound flat).Now to the cons. And there are some that are very concerning and especially so if you tend to treat your products poorly (many people do..) :1. THIN PIECE OF GLASS. So while I realize that Gorilla Glass 3 is very impressive and amazing tough for its extremely thin profile .. I also feel its wildly out of place with a product like the iPad. People who buy iPad's and especially families tend to treat them pretty rough. I've seen children as young as 4 drop a 3rd gen iPad like a brick onto hardwood and it remained intact without a mark to bare. This new iPad Air has a very thin piece of GG3 that helps reduce the weight (and I would imagine the cost of manufacturing for Apple) but its recently been shown in several Youtube videos that when it comes to endurance its actually pretty fragile. Its very easy to crack it and especially so if it lands on its side. So while all the previous generation iPad's had a nice thick piece of glass to help protect the product this new one .. does not. It also sounds hollow when you tap it. And for some that drives them crazy. I don't mind this as I know its glass and not plastic like some \"claim\".2.COST. Since Apple did so much to slim down the cost of this new iPad and they used the EXACT same guts as the iPhone 5 (with a different layout and power profile) and yet they also trimmed down the battery size then how come this isn't any cheaper? The iPad mini is supposedly Apple's response to critics about the fact that its always the same price in each iteration. Apple , Android has fantastic alternatives now and the Google Play marketplace is becoming quite a fleshed out competitor , its time to start taking Android more seriously as a competitor and stop living inside your own eco bubble.3.SUB PAR HARDWARE VERSUS PRICE. Even with a new 64-bit chip (which isn't supported very well but that will change) the iPad is quite a puny product in terms of hardware specs. NOW BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT.. I know that Apple has optimized it heavily and that living in a very closed ecosystem (versus Android) gives it this advantage HOWEVER.. for what you are paying for you should be getting more. 1GB of RAM for instance? That's what I expect in a mid to low end smartphone these days. I can imagine those who complain (and have for a while now) about the random crashes because of running of memory would really love an extra 1GB of RAM for the iPad. I would also imagine it would do wonders for those who love to open programs by the truckload and not have to worry about random crashing errors due to running out of memory.Could you imagine a quad core A7 chip with 2 GB's of RAM? That beast would sing and you could do even more with an iPad that powerful. I would bet that when Apple moves towards 4k resolution that we will be getting those exact specs to run at that monster resolution but still I would have loved that right now.So my remarks about a recent Android tablet purchase.. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and I just have to say its a real beast and outshines Apple's best in many ways. The resolution is higher (2500x1600) and it comes with the S-Pen and S-Pen software plus an office suite of apps. Now the Note Pro 12.2 is made for business applications the price of it versus 64GB iPad is about a hundred more. But for that hundred more you get massive hardware support , with an OTG USB cable you can connect external hard drives to it , you can also add memory through SDXC cards (up to 128GB's) and Samsung's Touch Wiz is getting quite mature and really offers a very set of apps. Not to mention the screen size of 12.2 inches versus 9.7. However the iPad beats it in terms of weight , the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a massive battery (but it lasts about 11 hours with heavy use) and the weight puts it into a class that speaks more towards laptop replacement that competitor to the iPad. However you can buy the non-pro versus for $100 less (you won't get the S-Pen) and still a get a monster solution.Android's tablet app market is getting better and better each week and there are plenty of apps that support landscape mode without issue. One thing I always thought Android did better was application scaling , something Apple could learn from frankly. The Galaxy Note 3 Pro in my mind is a Android finally getting its ducks in a row and Apple is going to have pick the pace to keep with Android's MASSIVE market share which is over double what Apple's is now.THAT BEING SAID.. I'm keeping the iPad Air. I love the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its just a great tablet but I don't really have need of its business level features. But if I were going to recommend a tablet for a business minded individual I would recommend they go for it because it blows the iPad away for business use. The free office app it comes with is more fleshed out than MS Office for the iPad and the extra screen real estate is a big bonus for anyone attempting real work on it. But for a guy like me the iPad has an easier to consume profile and that's what I really love about it.If you intend to buy this product however (the iPad Air) I HIGHLY recommend you buy the Apple care warranty.

I wont buy another iPad from amazon though because what I have come to realize is that the warranty starts from the date the seller purchased the product meaning that I only have a few months left on this warranty.

Excellent product overall and great customer service from amazon in sorting out the issue.-Update- I have since received my refund and purchased a new iPad from Apple.

I got it the day it came out in stores. It starts with the ultra-sharp exterior. If you loved last year's iPad Mini, you'll feel right at home with the Air. Apple essentially built a larger version of the Mini with the Air, by slimming the beveling of previous iPads to achieve a sleeker framework.The lack of heft makes the Air just a little more comfortable: An LTE-equipped Air weighs all of 1.05 pounds. Wrapped in a comfy and protective Apple Smart Case, the Air weighs 1.368 pounds, still lighter than a third-generation iPad by itself. Despite the lack of size, the Air is no less tough. It's sturdy and not at all easy to bend.The Air feels that much more like an electronic magazine. The Retina display, once the standard for all screens but also facing more competition this year, helps that; reading text and viewing web pages on that crystal-clear, pixel-dense screen is the same joy it was when Apple first built Retina screens into its tablets early last year.If this is all Apple did, it would likely still be enough to keep it on top. But the iPad Air does far more, starting with the new processor powering the entire experience, the A7. The same dual-core, 64-bit A7 chip that debuted in the iPhone 5S is in the iPad Air; and initially, this seems like a disappointment. In theory, you expect something more in Apple's flagship tablet, something a bit more powerful, with perhaps more graphical horsepower.In practice, you won't notice a thing. Web browsing and apps still handle as snappily as ever, even if you have a gaggle of things running in the background. Top-tier games such as Infinity Blade 3 continue to deliver. A pleasant surprise is also how quickly some of the beefier games, such as Anomaly 2, loaded, compared to previous iPads. You'll move into and out of levels just a little bit more swiftly, and that helps make the entire gaming experience more friendly and natural. It's hard to know what this really means for Apple gaming, but don't rule out the possibility of more console titles being ported to the iPad.Apple realizes the limitations of the 64 GB storage too, offering a new 128-gig model. You'll pay a more-than-average-laptop premium here ($799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for an LTE version), but the improved storage is intriguing, especially for those planning for a game-heavy future. I can now easily and comfortably load all the music and movies onto the iPad Air that I want and still have plenty of room left over for games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Civilization: Revolutions.Battery life is steady, even if it's not mind-blowing. Apple claims the iPad Air can get you 10 hours on a charge, and that's definitely true. Even when using Apple's navigation for a long trip to Washington, I easily got through a day without needing to charge; and more casual usage, such as Web browsing and email checks, is no problem.The Air's lone shortcoming is that it lacks the fingerprint identification technology that debuted on the iPhone 5S. But I'd be hard-pressed to claim that this was some glaring omission; every other tablet you're going to use this year lacks such tech, and I've never seen that tech as an absolute must-have.The resulting tablet is as pleasant to use as they come, and it's backed by some consistently solid software. Android has made a tremendous run over the past few years, and a plethora of both Android and Windows Mobile devices are truly intriguing this holiday season. But if there's one consistent shortcoming on those devices, it's the up-and-down support of operating systems.It's hard to know whether this Android tab or that will support Google's latest OS, but that's almost never a problem with iPads. iOS releases are generally consistent and stable, the lone knock on Apple being its lack of Android-like customization.And while the Apps Store and iTunes are also battling competition from Microsoft's stores and Google's Marketplace, Apple's setup continues to set the bar, managing to be intuitive and easy to use and enjoying more and more high-profile digital releases.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Amy Leftis", "ReviewID": "R9JQAS7K7K0PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much faster than the original ipad.

Apple constantly thrives to improve there products, and this one is no exception. The new IOS coupled with the blazing fast 64-bit a7 chip makes this one of the fastest tablets I have used! The ease and simplicity of this tablet makes everyday emails, messaging, projects,etc. no problem. This is the only tablet I have looked forward to using.Now for more serious activities like gaming and other intensive applications, the iPad has no problems what so ever. The graphics are very smooth, almost life-like.  From the outside, this is the most beautiful tablet hands down. From the chamfered edges to the sleek aluminum back, this is a high quality device. Most other tablets are made out of cheap plastics, not this one. Everything feels well made and solid. Even though apple chose to use metals and other high end materials, the iPad remains one of the lightest and thinnest full size tablets you can buy. Another high point for the iPad air its the battery. It seems to go on forever! After using it throughout the day, I end up with 70 to 80 percent battery! Its unbelievably how much juice this thing holds! Some miscellaneous things about the iPad that push it even further over the top are the decent cameras and the excellent microphones and speakers. The speakers have a good base tone and very clear high pitches. Overall I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a device that can do pretty much anything. I just don't see anyway the apple can improve on this iPad. I guess we will just have to wait and see.

Instead I spent $3.00 for a 6' USB extension cord to extend between the charge module and lightning cord. It works fine and will keep the battery at 100%  while I am working.

Works great. In doing this, I have scrapped my cell phone and installed skype phone on my iPads... Flawless voip service, full feature with dedicated phone #... All for $6.00 a month a $.o2 a minute pay as I go. Compare that to the cost of a smartphone with data package! So saying, a mini will fit in my pocket as a large smartphone and serve all my needs on the road...

After a few days of using the iPad Air and iPad 3 I can tell that an upgrade would not be worth the hassle of putting my older iPad on ebay and making up the difference which would be around $300 I guess (I have the 16 GB version) . Actually, a lot of professional reviewers online recommend exactly this: don't upgrade if you already have either an iPad 3 or iPad 4.The difference in size and weight is (slightly) noticeable when you are picking the device or holding it in your hands. The thing is that I never just hold my iPad in my hands when using it (and I do use it a lot!). Most of its weight goes either to the desk when I am at my desk, or to my lap if I am in my chair, or to my chest if I am on my couch. Which means I am basically using my hand(s) to balance the iPad not to support it. In such situations extra 7 ounces is not a big deal at all.If you are using your iPad differently (for example, playing games a lot) then you might appreciate the iPad Air better. Also, if you just want to have the latest and the coolest iPad then of course that would be worth it too :)Seems like Apple is following the same pattern with both the iPad 2 and the iPad Air, mostly squeezing the same device in a smaller package. This is not good enough for me. I waited until the iPad 3 came out to upgrade my iPad 1 (yes, Retina display was totally worth it!) and I hope that the iPad 6 will be worth an upgrade. But I am not getting into the hassle of replacing my iPad just to get a little bit thinner/narrower and lighter.Making the decision to return the iPad Air got even easier when I realized that its screen has a noticeable yellow tint which makes my iPad 3 look a bit bluish which I like better.Good bye, iPad Air, and lets hope that Apple will be able to impress even the most conservative of us with the iPad 6 in October 2014!

It is lighter, thinner, narrower, faster and has stereo speakers. Its almost half a pound lighter which really makes a difference when holding the ipad in your hands for long periods of time. I no longer need to use my ipad stand. Typing and holding it in portrait mode are much easier. People with larger hands will be able to hold the ipad with one hand very easily. Performance is also much improved with new A7 processor. Apps open, close and switch faster than on the ipad 4. Wifi is now double the speed with the double mimo antenna. For those who have supporting routers loading web pages, downloading apps, books, videos, music is much faster. The new stereo speakers are much loader and have more bass than on the previous ipad. The stereo affect will only be noticed when holding the iPad in portrait mode. This is a shame since you wont enjoy the stereo affect when watching a video or playing a game in landscape mode. Also the speakers are very easy to muffle if you cover one or both of them on the right side in landscape mode. The main flaw of the ipad air is its lack of 2GB of ram. When browsing and having more than a few tabs open this is very noticeable. The tabs have to reload when switching back and forth. This also becomes an issue when switching between apps that are open. Both the ipad 3 and 4 had 2GB of RAM. The only reason I can think of why apple decided not the upgrade the RAM is to make customers upgrade to the next ipad. The other downside to the ipad air is the fact that its running ios 7. ios 7 for the most part is in improvement over ios 6. It is faster and has more features, but, it also has many bugs that still need to be fixed. Even with 7.04 installed I still experience rotation issues. The ipad doesnt auto rotate when switching between portarit and landscape mode. This issue occurs atleast once a day. Mainly when the multitasking gestures is enabled and auto rotation. There are many threads on apple discussions forums about this issue. I thought at first my ipad was deffective even made an appointment to see a genius. I was told there was no way to test the hardware but was offered a warranty replacment. I decided instead to exchange the ipad and the replacement also had the same issue. I have to add also my ipad 4 had the same issue also when I updated it to ios 7. I hope apple fixes this issue in 7.1. This is very annoying and not something I expected from apple. The ipad air also doesnot have the ability to run 2 or more apps at one time which both the new samsung note 10.1 2014 and Microsoft surface tablet can do. I did try the samsung tablet briefly and found the screen and speakers much better than the ipad air's. The ipad still is the best larger tablet on the market because it has a huge selection of tablet apps and it gets the apps first before any other platform. I also love the battery life on my ipad air. I was getting about 15 hours of usage on my ipad 4 with the brightness at 35% and about 5 notifications with browsing and email. Now with the ipad air I am gettting more than 15 hours. Anywhere from 16-18 hours of battery life depending on my usage. The new ipad air is must have for gamers, power users and people who take the ipad on the go. If you can wait the next ipad will defeintly have 2GB of RAM and wont have as many bugs. There is also a good chance a new ipad will be released in the next 1-2 years which will be larger in screen size and more powerful named the ipad pro.Update after owning for more than 4 months: Apple just released the 7.1 update. My iPad Air is finally stable, this is what ios 7 should have been from the start. There are no more crashes, reboots and the auto rotation issue is fixed. I am still giving this ipad 4 stars since it took apple more than 4 months to fix these issues. Also the ipad lacks 2gb of ram, there are no widgets, thrid party keyboards, expandable storage or way to run 2 apps at once side by side. The iPad Air is till the best 10 inch tablet on the market.

In hindsight, I\u2019m glad I did otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bought this tablet.Before deciding on the iPad Air I considered the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The Microsoft Surface wasn\u2019t an option since I really don\u2019t like the operating system or customer service and I wanted my tablet to last longer than a year. Samsung wasn\u2019t an option after the torture my Galaxy S3 put me through, which also ruled out Android, which then ruled out the Nexus 7. Some people are a fan of Android but I find it to be slow, unreliable and choppy. The aesthetic design isn\u2019t my favorite either. But these are all a matter of personal opinion and experience. :)The Kindle Fire HDX looked great at first, but in the end I decided it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m a writer and a student so being able to edit documents on the go is my main concern. I have an iMac so this unfortunately made using the Kindle for these purposes a little more difficult for me. While I can edit and share most documents on my iMac, including Microsoft Office, I primarily use Pages which isn\u2019t available on the Kindle. I just don\u2019t care for either Microsoft Word or Google Docs enough to use them all the time. Also, I never use the Amazon store to watch movies or shows or download music so that feature wasn\u2019t appealing to me. I took a trip to Best Buy to try it out just in case that made me change my mind. This actually solidified my decision against it. While the Kindle Fire did feel surprisingly solid, I didn\u2019t like the position of the buttons, smaller screen size (although the screen quality was pretty awesome) or the thick boarders around the screen. Again, all of these are a matter of preference.When I went to try out the iPad Air I was surprised by how much lighter it felt than the previous model iPad. I also liked the flat back and thinner edges on the side. It made using it easier for small handed people like me. The larger screen size made typing on the tablet much easier in those rare instances I might not have my keyboard. Keeping my documents in one place is amazingly simple and I like the applications I use for writing and classes. Also, iTunes U is just awesome!The only drawback for me is the price: I paid $300 more than I would have with the Kindle Fire HDX. I don\u2019t think this is outrageously expensive, considering the larger screen, better hardware, operating system and customer service-- not to mention iTunes U-- but I do think the price could be lower.While there are other great tablets out there, I really enjoy my iPad Air. Electronics are all a matter of personal preference anymore anyway. If you don\u2019t like a device, don\u2019t buy it.

I've noticed this with my \"old\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus, but this may not matter to some people.The Kindle HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) are, in that order, reported to have better screens- ppi and gamut display. However I'm not interested in buying too much into the Amazon App Store because I'm already in the plain Android ecosystem. The Samsung tablet line is not in consideration because I got burned by how the copy and paste function just stops working- a reset would fix it and soon after it would stop working. This issue first showed itself months after I got the device. I also wasn't interested in taking the time to jailbreak the Samsung tablet for that reason alone.I recently got a deal on the Nexus 7 (2013) and I'm getting it this week. I may keep it as a backup tablet and it's a plus that I'm already in the Android ecosystem. It has 2GB of RAM instead of Apple's current 1GB of RAM standard. It also comes with stock Android and the operating system can be easily upgraded without relying on mods. I'm hoping it will last 5 years but I've learned from the Amazon customer reviews that hardware quality control is an issue.Now back to the iPad Air. Aside from the screen I wanted the \"Apple Experience\" of \"It just works.\" I like using a tablet for browsing and reading books. I also liked the idea of having access to apps that are exclusive to Apple. I've had the iPad Air for a little over a week and I'm really enjoying the bigger screen. I'm not sure I can really switch back to a smaller screen. I've downloaded a few apps, cooking related, that are exclusive to iOS and they're nice to have. Multitouch gesture is ok but the Android way of switching between apps and viewing running apps are more elegant.Why I took off three stars is because the iPad Air crashes a lot. It got to the point that I'd add a tab on Safari and it would crash even though I only had two other tabs open. I installed Chrome and the crashes happened less but they did not disappear. Search for iOS 7 crashes and low memory and you'll see this is a problem with a lot of iOS devices since the iOS 7 was introduced. I noticed other apps doing the same thing but maybe because I use them less I don't see them crashing as often.I had set up a phone appointment with Apple Support on Sunday and was told that upgrading to iOS 7.0.4 via WiFi might have caused the iOS to not fully update. I couldn't stay on the phone for too long so yesterday I did reset my tablet and set the iPad as New. I didn't buy their reasoning but I did like the Customer Support experience- setting up an appointment online etc.I really like the bigger screen and it's probably better for my eyes so I'm keeping the device. I'm also counting on Apple to fix the issue sooner rather than later- in various forums you'll read about people resetting their iOS device and doing multiple exchanges with no relief from the crashing.

Up until then, I had never owned an Apple product. I have always had Windows pc\u2019s and I have an Android phone (Galaxy S4).I read that people just love the iPad\u2019s and thought it would be time to try out an Apple product. I bought it from T-Mobile to get their free data promotion. Now that I\u2019ve had one for about 3 months my overall opinion is \u201cmeh\u201d. It\u2019s ok.I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s light & portable. It\u2019s great for watching movies and listening to music. However, there are limitations that make me wonder why the devices are so popular. For example, Swype doesn\u2019t work on iPad\u2019s and if you\u2019ve ever used Swype on an Android device you know it\u2019s a great feature but one I consider very basic. True multi-tasking doesn\u2019t exist and you just don\u2019t realize how much you\u2019ll miss it until you don\u2019t have it. You can\u2019t print, for example, pages 1,3,&10 of a pdf. Instead, you can only choose a range, such as 1 thru 3. I still remember one of my first calls to Applecare+, where some young woman explained to me that you can\u2019t do a search in a pdf. She actually suggested that I add hundreds of doctors that were in the pdf to my contact list so that I could then find individual doctors. I quickly ended that call. The Apple browser, Safari, is slow. Chrome, on the other hand, is fast. These are only small examples but in general, the iPad seems to be much less flexible than my Window\u2019s computers or Android phone.As an aside, the support on Applecare+ varies widely. I have been connected to people that seem knowledgeable but have also had plenty of people that knew less about the iPad then I did, even after only 1 months use. Many of the young women referred to my iPad as an IPhone and didn\u2019t have a clue how to help me.They are also expensive. I bought the 32GB version and thought it was a rip off to pay $100 for the extra 16GB.Now, my iPad Air is 3 months old and needs to be exchanged under warranty. After 10 minutes of use it can\u2019t access the web anymore. Regardless of whether you use a browser or an app. They had me reset it back to the factory default but it didn\u2019t fix the problem. It's stayed in a case and never left the house. It's been babied. I\u2019ve never had any device fail after only 3 months use.I really wanted to love this device and thought I would based on other people\u2019s feedback.

I was a previous Iphone user that moved on to Android because I didnt like the size of the 5.  I have two kids so consumer level usability is high on my list especially with a son that has autism.My choice came down to a samsung or the ipad since the nexus 10 2 is still MIA. :)  The samsung had several things going for it.  MicroSD, customization and control, mutliple user profiles but to be honest their overlay is a huge turn off and the plether backing with fake stitching just looks horrid.  I would say that the plastics are fine but why bother with fake stitching? I spent time in a B&M; and the feel was good, but visually as a whole it felt less...high end even with the price being in the same range as the IPad.  With several cloud storage options and knowing that I would be using it for light work related items and sharing it with my kids to some extent the MicroSD while nice was not compelling.  I do wish apple would realize that multiple user accounts would be helpful because that is one of the things that almost moved me to the samsung.  Both screens of course are amazing and I have to give it to the samsung on using a better aspect ratio for media, but the samsung felt klugy when trying to use it in portrait.  So with all this being debated in my head for a few weeks back and forth I decided on the IPad.  As an aside, I love the build quality and would have seriously considers a Kindle Fire HDX but the lack of the google play store put it out of contention.  It is one thing to have a walled garden like apple where just about any app you can think of is available, but it is quite another to have a walled garden like Amazon where you either have to root or sideload to simply get some basic useful apps.  If the Kindle Fire HDX had google play store, this might have been an entirely different review. :)Two things have stood out as I have delved back into the walled garden that is Apple...One, It may be a walled garden, but it is a gorgeous garden.  The app quality and availability is outstanding. If they allowed Google Play Music I would not have any issues at all with the app store.  I think that the tighter development control that apple institutes on its apps is a double edged sword in some respects but I have not had anywhere near the amount of bugs that I find in the android store apps so in that respect I appreciate that 98.7% of the time when I download an app it just works.  I use it with several google services including chromecast and have been very happy with the results. On a side note, the hardware and build quality is meticulous and the IPad itself is even more impressive after prolonged use, but that has been discussed and beaten like the proverbial dead horse.Two, battery life.  Apple seems to know how to eek out the battery life with more finesse than some competitors.Overall I like the IPad Air much more than I thought I would.  I bought it knowing from a techie nerd stand point what I was giving up with the ecosystem and I have had no regrets at this point.  I can use it for work emails and presentations and come home to play netflix or games with the kids.  An outstanding product that I am sure I will use for the next year or two without issue.And my non-verbal autistic son can run this thing like a beast ;)", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely stunning", "Author": "grittynitty", "ReviewID": "R1KA2I41NUYYUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally got a good chunk of cash when my tax return came and decided to get my own iPad (family had an iPad 2 but surely couldn't call it my own).

But I do believe it's typically more stable than it's technological counterparts, and easier to use for newbies.  Which is why we bought an IPAD 2 for our 8 yr old a couple years ago.  He took to it right away, it's intuitive enough.  There have been some slight issues, but it's still going strong.  Now 10, we just bought him this IPAD AIR... his 2 yr old brother gets the \"old\" IPAD 2.  And yes, the IPAD is intuitive enough for even a 2 yr old!  The screen on the AIR is so much better, clearer, sharper, and not just because it's \"new\".  Its resolution is just that much better.

Lifeproof too expensive for what it offers... The 16G in the IPAD 2 was ultimately not enough after a year or so of use... Even with no \"movies\" or \"music\", games are much larger now, a few big games, and there is little left in a 16G device.  Without removing games, we didn't have enough memory left to upgrade the OS... so we opted for 64G this time...

The mini is actually not showing the whole color spectrum like the Air and it is very obvious.  The mini looks like the brightness has been switched down considerably.

Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R99F4BEOZO0JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple does it again", "Author": "Robert Garner", "ReviewID": "R2A8NVDAH0DGG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first iPad.

It was great being able to transfer my photos daily into the iPad to view them as opposed to trying to look at them on my camera!  With the 128GB of storage, I can keep quite a few photos stored on the iPad.  There are many apps available for photo editing and sharing.  I love everything about the iPad!  It was also nice having it on the long flights....between looking at my photos and playing all the games I have loaded into it, the time just flew by!  Of course, there are many other reasons to love the iPad, but for me, being able to view and edit photos while away from home is priceless.

The hardest choice.", "Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R1EP8MRB01CCTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people have already talked about the merits of this device and the pros and cons. For me the decision wasn't so much which to buy but rather which one I wanted. Originally I got the mini to replace my kindle touch because of the price and the pocketable size. Ultimately I ended up with the air. Here's why:Grip: despite the very comfortable dimensions for 1 handed holding of the mini the extra thin bezel proved problematic. The palm rejection tech is supposed to be quite good but I found it unreliable and for those times I wanted to gets.  Eventually I always wanted to get a hold of it with  the bezel between my thumb and forefinger but either ended up with a thumb right in the middle of whatever I was watching or a hand cramp.Real estate: getting smaller means text is smaller especially on we pages In portrait mode. You can set the text size up for dynamic type but it doesn't work everywhere and when if does work and you change to landscape, then the text is far too big for the screen. Furthermore, in games where part of the screen is used for the controls I ended up wishing for a larger screen.Keyboard: the keyboard ended up being the main reason I went for the Air. While it is surprisingly good on the mini (really it blew me away how good the keyboard was in the mini) typing at that size for any extended period is taxing and it just can't compete with the Air if you plan on writing any amount. Furthermore, using the GarageBand keyboards are fairly awkward on the smaller screen. Unlike the accessory keyboards for the full size iPads, I found the external keyboards for the mini were actually much much worse than the onscreen keyboard.Pocketability: the mini fit quite nicely into a jacket pocket, in the climate where I live jackets are only really feasible about 3 or 4 months out of the year. Other than that it needs bag of some sort, which is really the same situation I'd be in with an Air.Weight: this made the choice the hardest. Holding the iPad mini feels like hardly anything at all. The iPad air feels considerably heavier. That affects everything you do with the tablet and the entire interaction with it. Fortunately it's mostly a matter of perspective. Put down the mini for a day and all of a sudden the air seems  quite light.For me the decision was made for the larger version but what about options?Cellular of no cellular? The free 3G on my kindle touch has gotten me out of a scrape more than once and having access to a no-strings-attached internet connection is guaranteed to come in handy at least once during the lifetime of your tablet. $130 is a lot to spend though, especially if you have a smart phone and free tethering on your plan. Originally I went for the wifi version for precisely this reason. However, the ability to tether is dependent on the carrier you happen to be using. Should you switch phones, carriers or plans or simply lose the phone while traveling tethering May no longer be a option and it's never going to be as convenient as simply opening the settings on your iPad and activating a plan. In addition you also gain the ability to use gps with a cellular modem and gain the benefits of enhanced find my iPhone accuracy in the event that it's stolen and the thieves know enough to keep it off wifi. Finally though, the possibility of a free 200 mb per month with t-mobile and the ability to switch carriers at will ended up pushing me to get the cellular version.So, after having initially been interested by the mini, a lot  of research, even more indecision and having bought, lived with and sold multiple versions of this thing I can safely say that the iPad Air with cellular is the  version I'd pick. If you don't plan on typing a lot with it though or watching movies, go for the mini.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Ever Apple Product - First Ever iPad - LOVE IT", "Author": "JoHarley", "ReviewID": "R1X2GEOQACNWD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The has become a great tool for my photography needs.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "They Sent me a used iPad......WTF????", "Author": "Marcus Scott-Morgan", "ReviewID": "RUZ0K3ME024YE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cant believe these guys had the nerve to send me an iPad air with no factory seal around the unit.I then proceeded to charge the iPad for the first time.

I was led to believe that document file transfers would be easy between my MacBook Pro and the iPad. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. The two machines cannot be directly connected. To send a doc you have to do it via an e-mail attachment or iCloud. Use e-mail and formatting is lost unless you use  iWork, and that does not have many of the capabilities of Microsoft Word. You even loses page numbers when transferring Microsoft Office docs--a pretty basic function. The ironny is that MSOffice is designed for MAC! There are third party workarounds that are very cumbersome. So much for MACs elegant design brags.  The alternative is the Cloud which also only syncs docs made in iWork. As for photo transfers, unless you have the same bandwidth as NASA, forget it. Apple--wouldn't it just be simpler to create a USB connection?

First, try to buy the product through Amazon.  If you get lucky you will avoid 38+ dollars in taxes.  In my state I get charged that anyway.  I bought mine a few weeks ago and I now regret my decision.The ipad Air, full size not the mini, is expensive for what you get.  The much talked about retina display really isn\u2019t much better than Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s normal display.  I take a lot of photos and even at full zoom I can\u2019t make out much difference.  The Apple ipad Air does NOT come with an SD card slot, and if you want to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb you will be looking at over $100 additional dollars.  Many of Apple\u2019s competitors have the SD slot and cost less.Apple sells an SD card \u201creader.\u201d  You can download from the card to the ipad but NOT the other way.  And the ipad SD card reader will run you $30 plus dollars.  You must buy other $30+ dollar accessories if you want to use a USB memory stick for example.  I purchased a non- Apple SD card triple reader (USB and SD for example) for about $9 dollars.  The machine complains at me but it still works (but, once again, it only loads to the machine not from the ipad as a normal SD slot does).An SD card reader would have been easy to install as part of the iPad, and this gives their competitors an edge, especially when one is taking photographs and trying to download them immediately to examine on something other than a 2 inch screen.  As I shoot RAW (large files) photos with my Canon this inability to use an SD card is a real pain.Downloading music from Amazon to iTunes isn\u2019t any picnic either.  My wife has an android device from Dell running Jellybean and she downloads everything with zero problems.  Plus, she has an SD card slot which really helps.  Her screen is as sharp as mine.Finally, the OS systems.  Jellybean has about a million apps written for it while I have about 200 - or that is how it seems to me.  Her system is faster than mine AND her system is intuitive and mine is not.  I\u2019ve had to read over the Apple manual for ipad three times trying to get things done.  Maybe my largest gripe is I bought the Apple thinking several Apple machines could sync up and trade information easily including photographs and music and documents.  Wrong.  I\u2019ve tried numerous syncing ideas and none of them work.  I started using Pages (an Apple word processing program) instead to Word to get it to transfer.  Finally, I saved it to the cloud and managed to get the document to the other machine.  Photographs that are in the photo stream do transfer; however, getting the photograph into the stream when it was not automatically placed there by the ipad doesn\u2019t work.  And finding photos to look at in the ipad, when the ipad did not take the photo and the photo is on another machine (with the photo stream on and home sharing on) the photo still does not come up.  Very frustrating.After using the ipad and watching and using Jellybean and Android in action I think the Android devices are a much better deal.  Get one with an SD card slot.  I am certain Apple has designed their machine so the user cannot get extra storage on the machine (as an SD slot would allow) and must buy a more expensive machine if they handle large files.  If you like buying music at Amazon good luck getting it to iTunes onto your machine if it is an Apple (Yes, I have Amazon cloud player).  My wife got her music downloaded in about a minute.  It took me an hour to get one of Mozart\u2019s songs I had purchased downloaded to my computer.In retrospect, since the programs do NOT sync up as advertised, the machine has little storage unless you pay an enormous additional price, the retina display is not revolutionary, and the number of programs are minimal compared to Android I wish I had purchased an Android.  Samsung seems to be on the cutting edge there, although my wife\u2019s Dell is performing just fine.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad Air", "Author": "Oscar Crumby", "ReviewID": "R1LFVGKI48DRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a tablet.

Those reviews are biased and only bring up the minor upgrades from the old ipad and base the comparisons off of those few things. And the only two really bad things they had to say about the ipad Air was that it didn't have a fingerprint scanner and it didn't come in gold. The 80's called and they want their gaudy flashy gold bling back.Most of these reviews will only focus on those points and will not mention all the other advantages the Surface 2 has. And for the few reviews that do mention the other features the Surface 2 has, they still favor the ipad because the camera was nicer or more apps. Really?I will use the Surface 2 as comparison because it will show how ridiculous the bias is regardless of capabilities.What the reviews usually leave out or down play.Surface 21. Full office software. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.2. Wide screen optimized for wide screen movies. When held in portrait when you are surfing the web for example, you get a a longer list so you don't scroll as much.3. Sd slot. Easy to download or upload data on the fly.4. 3.0 USB so you can easily backup files to a hard drive and not have all your eggs in one basket. Or transfer files with anything that has a USB plug and also charge your phone. Ipad? No, unless you have the adapter and you can't charge your phone.5. Can print to almost every printer.6. Hdmi port7. Flash support so you are not limited browsing the web.8. Built in two position kickstand.9. Thin keyboards that double as covers. Can get them background lit, flat, with real keys, and a new one coming out with built in battery to recharge your Surface at the same time on a charge. Battery in tablet is good already though. Some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the Surface and adds to the cost. Ridiculous. You do not. It will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document. With an ipad you don't need one because what use would it be for? Sure there are apps. but they are limited to what you can create or edit. You have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it.10. Hook up to your t.v. or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen.11. Do a split screen on the tablet.12. Run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music, watching a video and doing something else like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode.13. Wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t.v, stream videos, pictures, etc.14. Drag and drop files.15. Can set up individual separate accounts on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet.Now these are not all the Surface 2 offers. I am finding new things still.The ipad Air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks. It's faster and lighter. Still does the same thing as before, nothing new.ipad Air1. Powerful processor. For doing nothing new. Future fingerprint scanner? Tablet will still only run apps. as before.2. Lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard.3. Upgraded camera. Put it down, your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play. Use a real camera.4. No USB or sd slot. Need adapters for just about everything. And with the Surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables. On an ipad you can't do both. You either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something. And if it is dead, you have to wait until you charge it first. Also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the Surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable. And the cover/keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight. And justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not valid. It is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not support mouse functions. You are stuck with third party hardware that is Apple specific whereas with the Surface you can use anything that supports micro SD or USB. And having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad.will not be cheap. People gripe about the Suface cover/keyboard costs too much. Well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost $40.00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost $100.00 that you have to carry seperatley.5. Having to convert simple files with Apple software a hassle.5. Tons of apps. Android not far behind. And Microsoft growing. How much apps. does one need?6. What good is the Reina display if it isn't widescreen? Picture is actually smaller than 9.7 with the black bars.7. Only compatible with Apple products i.e. cant print unless it is an AirPrint printer or stream to t.v. unless Apple t.v.8. Slightly upgraded camera. Put it away! Your blocking my view! And people with a 4.8 inch phone look ridiculous? At least they are not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9.6 tablet that takes two hands. Kind of contradicting.The ipad Air has more negatives than positives, so how can it be better? Android tablets have more features even than the ipads. I guess if you want one just for games and apps, then an ipad or a higher end Android tablet might suit your needs. People are not weighing in that the Surface 2 can do more than just play games.Now back to the Surface 2. There was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do. It didn't take long though. Look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of. There different ways to open, close, move, split screen, multitask, etc.The tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it I admit. But the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as I didn't think it would. I don't have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also. And even if I put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle.The boot up time takes a little while when completely off, but remember it is opening real office programs. When in sleep mode it opens up quickly.I went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge.The tiles are nice because it is real time data so I can glance at them without opening up an app. for email, weather, etc. On Apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up, Android you can use widgets.With a real browser and Flash I can use full websites rather than a mobile version. And also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs.As I mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn't be.The only two cons I find on the Surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long. You have to be really close to an outlet of some sort.And the main con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don't have the full gigs of memory stated. So might have to get an sd card. Yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs, but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can't do what the Surface 2 can do.If you are waiting for a ipad Air Pro to come out. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come with a Retina display, finger print scanner, nice camera, etc. You will have to wait for the Pro S, Pro S1, etc. to get one feature at a time and not several at once. I mean come on, cant even throw in a simple camera flash. The ipads shouldn't even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run Office software. There should be a category for Dumb Tablets that only run apps, a category for Smart Tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not just limited mobile versions, and Extreme Tablets for ones that can run full blown Office suites.If your a die hard Apple fan, please back up your arguments with something valid other than ipad rocks or a childish angry comment.

If the iPad Air is anything like their other iPads it will be a hit with us and it get a higher rating than 3-stars.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't assume you'll like an ipad", "Author": "Philip Walter Bonsell", "ReviewID": "RXBWTZZSD232R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello.I just got one of these tablets from Apple. I assumed I'd like their products as I had a high opinion of them as a company. Most of these reviews are full of how great they are and tech data. I'm 52, I'm not dumb, I can work a PC, I've got a BMW, a Bang and Olufsen system, a couple of homes and the rest.Well it's an education; we're all used to be expected to work stuff right out of the box, but if you're an apple novice, if you don't have a smart 'phone (I know that's putting me in a minority but why would I need one when I've been out the workplace for ten years?), if you still use CD's for music and DVD's / blu ray for films, well take my advice and don't bother. A nightmare to set up, impossible to put right if you get it wrong; mines back in the box three hours after delivery and there it will stay. I'll put up with windows instead.For all you guys who want to do loads of stuff, well good luck to you. I just wanted Amazon, Google search and my mail live on a screen next to my seat in the living room and was prepared to spend $500 to have that in a nice package. It didn't deliver, and no I don't want to have to go around to my local Apple store and ask some guy pursuing an alterative lifestyle how to do it. Much easier to make do with the $150 Acer notebook, even if it does need to be on a mains lead most of the time.Farewell Apple; if it had worked I'd have bought a pricey Mac, but that ship's sailed and I'm $2000 ahead.Phil", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "A joy to use!", "Author": "Sandra E.
