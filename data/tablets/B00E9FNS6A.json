I can't say I would replace it for a laptop if I needed a computer for business, but I think for personal use it is great. Sooo much better than a heavy laptop or tied to your desk. I did have issues with waking it from sleep mode but Samsung Tech Help got me through it.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Somewhat harder to figure out", "Author": "Ex-Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1V2AMWUGQLKRW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is so many features on this tablet you do spend the first week or so just keeping up with all the updates and everyday you learn something new about how to use this PC. We only use it with the keyboard so we don't have that problem with the noise but did need to discover the button that makes it easier to select the keyboard (the right control key) it's maybe a little too much but we'll figure it all out one day. Went from an iPad so, but we have Samsung TV, Blueray and Galaxy phone. This is much different.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice table PC but requires patience to learn.", "Author": "K. Afsar", "ReviewID": "R25R2UNC4GHIVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Give yourself a few days of playing around with Windows 8. Basically Windows 8 offers both a Windows XP/7 like interface, as well as applications or apps (like android or iPad) that can be downloaded from the MS app store. Took forever to download the Win 8.1 update. Make sure you run all the updates for Win 8, or the Win 8.1 update will not show up in the app store. After all the updates, it's a fine machine to play with. Like the ability to hold it in my hand, write with the stylus using my handwriting which can also be used to serf the net. USB, Micro SD and HDMI connections.

(FYI: Samsung DOES NOT honor transferred warranties, so I'm on my own)I was using it for about an hour as a tablet one morning, and when I was finished I put it on the keyboard dock, and put it to sleep. I turned the unit back on about an hour later and the touchscreen did not work; no indication that it was going to fail before-hand, just completely did not work.I have nearly 20 years of technical experience with computers, with certifications, and even I can't resolve this problem, which looking in forums all over the internet, is a VERY common problem for this and ALL Samsung ATIV tablet PC models (500t and 700t).Samsungs ONLY solution is to return and replace.My unit:- All Samsung updates are installed- All Windows updates are installed- Unit has been lovingly handledThings I've done to fix the touchscreen problem:- Wiped drive/factory recovery 3x- Repeatedly uninstalled/reinstalled Wacom and touch drivers (even tried older versions, and some 3rd party)- Windows restore 3x- Spent days looking on forums for answers- Cleared CMOS- Hacked BIOS update program and reflashed BIOS firmware- Disassembled unit, cleaned all cables/connections with isopropyl alcohol, reassembled- Replaced digitizer with exact OEM- Cried inside...Why Samsung???Short of replacing the main HannStar board, I've done everything in my power to fix the number one major feature of a tablet. I didn't give you $1400 for a TOUCHLESS TABLET!!!!It wouldn't be so infuriating if this thing wasn't perfect for me :(That being said...
