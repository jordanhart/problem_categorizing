The face of the tablet needs to be  perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight to see a perfect display. Not a big issue. I  used it for skype, email, facebook, facetime, web-browsing, taking picture, video, screen shots ... We have ipad mini, and I don't see big difference. I ordered on Monday and got it on Friday with a free shipping. I would recommend this $150 tablet that can do the job of a more expensive other tablets.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery Life", "Author": "Franklin W. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1C7QIZKEL5YU9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet to see how I liked using a tablet. It was not the least expensive tablet, but it had a lot to offer for the price. It was delivered fast and packaged well. I've been using it now for over a month and still learning all the features.  Its great for email and Facebook. The battery life is only a couple hours of continued use, but it charges fast and can be used with the charger. This tablet is definitely worth looking at.  After using this tablet for a couple months the battery life has gone downhill to being able to use it 15-20 minutes before hooking it up to the charger.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK for the price", "Author": "Alec", "ReviewID": "R2T881FOMNG0FE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, the screen resolution is 976 x 600, not 1024 x 600 as stated in the product description. It's fast, but the poor quality of the screen creates rather negative experience when you try to use it for reading, so I would consider this as a toy for kids who want to play games rather than an office device for business.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what was implied", "Author": "Markk1pe \"Marko\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y2EGHF2O3CW7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was disappointed when I opened the shipping package and saw a plain looking white box marked \"Tablet PC\".  I was expecting something marked \"American Pumpkins\" or something like that.  Because the details stated that it \"ships from American Pumpkins in Columbus Ohio\" I mistakenly thought that it was made in America.  I've had problems with my existing tablet that was made in China (it keeps going to Chinese language web sites for example).I was hoping for a non-Chinese tablet which is why I was interested in this.  However the tablet comes with an inspection sticker on the corner with either Chinese or Japanese characters so it's clearly not made in America.The description also says the color is white, but only the back is white, the face that you look at is black.  I did see that in the picture but thought that was just a stock photo.  So it is white rear, black front and sides.It comes with a small manual that has a title of \"MID-android\" inside the front cover, no mention of American Pumpkins.  The grammar is poor as if it was written by a non-English speaker, hard to understand.  It refers to buttons on the device by symbols that are very hard to read, I couldn't figure them out.This device depletes the battery quickly.  I only browsed the internet with it, battery went down fast.The product description says\"32GB Storage Space, which can be further expanded up to 64GB using the SD card slot. Features include ... + TF card slot to further expand memory. \"so it implies there is an SD card slot and a TF card slot to further expand memory, but the SD Card fits in the TF card slot; they are one and the same - 64 GB appears to be the maximum memory.The description also says earphones are included, but they are actually ear buds, minor detail but earphones are more comfortable and can block out noise. Not a dig on the product, just information for you.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet fast and big.", "Author": "joseph jackson", "ReviewID": "R31HGTTYW96OHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Speed,screen size, are both great sound with Bluetooth headset is also great.The quick start is quick.

I can even do everything I need to do with very little trouble. It's fast enough to view you tube and Netflix without buffer lag. The SD slot will take a 64gb card and even mount a USB drive.
