He absolutely loves it.He has downloaded many games on it. I have also played the games with him on this tablet and I think this is a very nicely built tablet at a amazingly low price. The WI-FI works good and the screen is responsive. This tablet is perfect for kids and also very good for elderly who wants to stay in touch with their grandkids. As an adult, I will probably go with Ipad as I can afford it but if you are looking for a good device to browse internet, or as a second device, this is awesome. I would recommend this tablet.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.95", "Features": "Fastest Quad Core processor.
