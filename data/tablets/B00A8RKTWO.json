I must say that after a few weeks using it and becoming aquainted with it's functions I couldn't be happier with it. There is no hesitation going from one function to the next. Picture is very sharp. The camera isn't the most accurate as it doesn't have a focusing square in the center like my phone so pics have not been sharp enough to save. Sound quality is poor but I use earbuds and they work just fine. Only App I haven't been able to use is HULU Plus. Doesn't have GPS but I have it on my phone so it's not really necessary. Tried to get a GPS App but won't work on it as tablet doesn't have GPS in the Google choices. Definitely a great bargain for the price!!!! I'd buy it again!!", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "keeredd", "ReviewID": "RTBNYKB6NO05Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best decisions I have ever made.

My husband purchased himself a tablet for Christmas for a lot of money and he was thrilled with it and wouldn't/couldn't stop talking about it!  I felt pretty stupid for not doing my due diligence on the tablets prior to my original purchase.  Or maybe I was suppose to have that one so I could learn about androids and downloading apps ... needless to say, I am thrilled about this purchase!!  Reasonable price, has all the necessary stuff and after you enable Google you can do everything anyone else can do and then some.  I use Chrome on my laptop, and I was able to get Chrome on my tablet!love, love, love it!! The size will take some getting used to ... I did purchase a sleeve for the tablet and am also very happy about it!  nice fit!  Thanks Amazon for yet another great product.I highly recommend you read as many reviews as you can before buying so you can learn all you can about these tablets.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Buy", "Author": "Ruth R.", "ReviewID": "RBW1MQ09AUL2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my Studio 10 had yesterday. Previously I had an IdolPad 10.The Studio 10 is much brighter and faster than the older IdolPad 10.  The older IdolPad 10 had a single 1.0 GHz processor.  With dual core 1.6 GHz processors the Studio 10 is capable of running three times as fast.  It definitely shows.  The Studio 10 searches the Internet much faster and plays videos more smoothly.I need the pad for traveling to other countries. Often there is no wireless Internet service in the hotel rooms but there is an ethernet cable. I purchased a USB to RJ45 LAN Ethernet HUB internet Adapter from eBay  (about 16.00 USD shipped).  It works great. Just plug it into the micro USB port via the supplied adapters that come with your Studio 10.  There is no set up. Just insert the ethernet cable in the hub and you can surf the net.  This particular adapter worked fine for me but I'm sure there are others that work as well just search for USB to RJ45 LAN Ethernet HUB internet Adapter.  Be sure it for Android tablets and for Internet.Before buying this tablet, I went to Best Buy and looked at the variety of tablets on display.  None of the tablets surfed the Internet any faster then the Studio 10.  If the displays were any better, I could not tell. in fact, I was most impressed with the display properties of the Toshiba tablet.  The Studio 10 seems to be on par with the Toshiba. I had planned to buy the ASUS four processor tablet. I'm really glad I did not. It was a lot of extra money with no apparent advantage.The sound is fairly reasonable considering it is a tablet. The cameras is okay.  I gave the tablet five stars  because of the price advantage. For twice the money you can get exactly the same performance with a slightly better camera.The Studio 10 is very thin. it has the same look and feel as the brand name tablets.  I didn't consider higher-resolution cameras an advantage because my cell phone already has a good camera and video built in.  I can't imagine taking a 10 inch tablet around town and using it as a pocket camera.Battery life is excellent. There are three brightness adjustments. I use medium because it is bright enough for most conditions.  It appears to be good for 6 to 8 hours.  I'm sure it will last just as long as the \"up to 10 hour\" tablets. It depends on how you use it.Google Play Store is already set installed and works very well.  I believe the tablet is \"rooted\" which means that you are not restricted to the manufacturers preferred apps.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "great for price", "Author": "Lana", "ReviewID": "R2K14WKQCR5T4G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it as a present for my husband BD.

It was working fine. I was using it mainly to view photos, emails, and reading digital books.  I noticed that when the screen stayed inactive for a while, it freezes. It happened a few times. The only thing I could do anything to this was to turn it off by pressing the switch on the side for several second. When I press the switch button for a few seconds again, it would turn on and starts android. Last night, the screen froze again, showing a photo I was looking at for a while. So I had no choice but to do the force shut down like before. When I try to start the android, by pressing the start button, it showed the start up screen of Idolian, then black screen with android logo. This as far as it goes. I don't want to keep doing this as I'm afraid that it might wear out the hardware. Fortunately, all my important data files are either online or on a mini memory card. But I spent a lot of time adding and setting up apps. Since it's been more than 30 days, I'm not sure, what I can do about this. I'm too busy to do further research right now. I was hoping to bring this to my upcoming vacations business trips. Just so sad....  Before buying this tablet, I read most of these customer reviews, and read about the 30-days return policy. So I paid extra attention not miss the 30 days, and kept checking the functions of this pretty much every day, just using it normally for email and net browsing at home. It's been more than 50 days since purchase, and sure enough the nightmare hit me. I wish the Amazons return policy were not just 30 days. 30 days are not enough to see all these defects.

It works great for skype and my youngest son download a siri app on it and it actually works! The camara works pretty good and the video is easy to use. I bought a 16gb sd card and put it in before I even turned it on so its has 32gb which is more than I need but for 15.00 extra, you can't go wrong. I worry about the other reviews talking about the charger and plug so I have been very careful about charging and have not have any problems ( I've only had the tablet a month so far) and the battery life has been as advertised.

Charged it up out of the box on Valentine's Day and never had a problem. I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" and sure, the Idolian doesn't have as nice a picture, but it's pretty good and it plays games my Kindle won't (*sigh*). It's fast and I get mail fine and read with my Kindle app. Have downloaded all kinds of stuff to it and works great, including all my weather and news apps. I get about 4+ hours of streaming fun on it. It also does my Netflix fine. Sure the sound is tinny, but for the price, who cares? Want great sound? Get a KFHD!!!! But for $200.00+ it is fine.I won't go into the technical aspects of this tablet, others have done it so much better than I ever could and I don't know anything about computer specs (nor do I particularly care excepting that it DOES run). What the knowledgeable reviewers all say about Google Play is true...it's right there in the settings and once you know to turn it on, it works fine. I would not have known how to do this if not for the tech reviews, so \"Thank You!\"I was going to buy a Galaxy 10, but for the tiny, tiny price, I thought I'd try this Idolian and it has really been a wonderful addition to my nascent tablet family! I sincerely recommend this tablet to anyone who wants to play games on it, read and surf the web who doesn't require a lot of fancy schmantsy stuff in a tablet that does a lot of things that I don't even know about!!!

I have always being an Android fan and this tablet has made my love for android even stronger;) If you don't have the money for an ipad , for less than half the price you can get about the same value with this tab. The only negative thing is that it has a specific charger that it comes with and doesn't charge with the USB port. I can only charge it when I'm at home.

This is the same for ALL electronics. Some people said they turned it on right out of the box without charging it first, and they thought the tablet battery didn't work. They are dead wrong, they just didn't know what they were doing. Charge it fully first, then the first time you use it, use it until the battery completely drains before charging it again. This will increase your battery life.And you can't just stick the charger in, you have to push it somewhat firmly until you hear a faint click(don't be too rough though). That is why some people complained of loose charger connections. These seem to be the main complaints other people had who rated this with low stars, and they aren't really problems, you just need to know the proper way to use the tablet.Anyways... I adored this tablet for the entire first day I had it. It was perfect, lightning fast, excellent graphics, not too much bloatware, lightweight but quality build, excellent sound(for a tablet). Much better than my laptop in every way imaginable, and somehow it was SO much better than all my friends' $500 tablets.By the second day, I had the same problem several other people have mentioned having. It starts up but gets stuck on the Android load up screen. Hard resets, pressing the factory reset button, charging it for several hours then trying again, waiting a day then trying to start it, starting it over and over, letting it stay on the android start up screen to see if it ever continued(an hour later, still nothing). None of this worked.Luckily, it was still within the time frame to return it to Amazon, but unfortunately by the time I got my refund the price for the tablet just went way up so I can't afford to buy another one to replace it. Hopefully the price will drop back down soon so I can replace it. I have high hopes that the one I got was a dud and a replacement one will work better.

Display looked great, fast response time, and not a lot of pre-built apps so I didn't have to lose memory on items I was not interested in, which I also liked cause it saved me time from having to \"clean\" up the icons. It had standard android features and easy to setup wifi.  Not too complicated for a user like me (busy, working mom, tech savvy but not expert, and someone that appreciates finding quality items for lower prices- I'm not brand driven.  I like one item that I can carry around to help me stay organized and relax when needed.  I have an iPhone but only 8GB so why I was looking for a tablet).After the first week, the tablet started responding slower. This is after downloading a whole bunch of apps and taking pictures (which btw you can tell you had a very low megapixel camera, bad exposure). I also kept on getting an error message that actions were not being able to complete due to lack of storage. I knew it was impossible- tablet was 16GB (I know you don't get entire space) and had a 16GB SD card so I checked settings and realized that the built in 16 GB was split in two. There was a system storage space then a separate storage space with a majority of the memory, like an internal SD card, then another section for my SD card. I wouldn't care about the split for the internal system if it would allow me transfer between the two but Nope, i had to transfer to my memory card, which was a lil annoying but didn't really bother me.Then a couple days after, after charging the tablet overnight using the charger that came with it, I turned on the tablet and the screen flashed a bright red color on startup, white backgrounds were showing up as a blue color, and tablet felt really hot. So I turned off tablet to allow to cool and when I turned on it was fine. So I got a lil concerned but still not thinking badly about it.  The same issue happened again a few days later, but this time didn't go away (I bared with it for 3 days before I decided to report it and return the item).Since Amazon was great and gave me a hassle-free refund, I started thinking if I wanted to give this tablet a 2nd chance (every brand can have one defective item) so I started thinking of the features I didn't like about it so I would know if I can tolerate it--Had Flixster app but I couldn't download or even play to watch Flixster movies directly to the tablet. When I am with the kids in a place that doesn't have public wifi, it's great being able to pull up movies to entertain. I do it with my iPhone so was hoping it could be done with the tablet.Speakers sounded good but when I used headphones, sound was muffled and was very low. I know it wasn't headphones cause I use with iPhone and portable DVD player and sounds great.Low quality pictures - it didn't advertise better but I'm thinking the low megapixel and the size of the screen just made the picture look more grainy so I think I need a higher megapixel camera.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2AN9PJZQ0Q4B3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm happy with the purchase have not used it much in terms content but slowly getting thier.

I really wanted to purchase a product that was American made. I try to support American companies. After reading several reviews and looking at the price point, I determine that I was about to make a good purchase. When I receive it,it was package very nicely and when I took it out of the box, I charged for the time that was required to be charged. Then, I had the opportunity to use it. I was very impressed. It was very fast a responsive. I was instantly in love with this tablet. Allwas well. The only issue Idid have out of it was youtube videos with stop playing half way through, No, about a minute in they would just freeze. But I think it has more to do with the app then it did the tablet. I could go anywhere else on the Internet and watch videos and they were fine. A a little over a week later, it stops charging. It's not the charger. Is the charging port. So needless to say I was a little disappointed I was ait wouldn't have been that big of a deal if I could have used the USB port to charge. That's the only problem that I had, but that is a major problem. Even though I know that I have a year warranty on it, I didn't want to take the chance. So I sent it back got an Asus transformer 300(which only costed 20 dollars more).

It boots to the white Idolian screen then goes to the android screen and loads forever. I let it sit for an hour before shutting it off just make sure it wouldn't factory reset itself like it did with a previous, similar problem. I filled out one of those tech support claims on their website but after keeping the box and order receipt for 3 months I threw them away so if I need either of those things to send it back to them I'm screwed(my own fault, but products shouldn't crap out after a few months).Supposedly their support is good so I will have to wait and see what happens but I'm already planning on getting something different because I don't have much hope for it.Specifically this: http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-TF300T-A1-BL-10-1-Inch-16GB-Tablet/dp/B0082CPCR4/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1364053792&sr;=1-3or a cheap chromebookIt sucks that real companies like Asus don't make cheaper, slightly watered down products like this Idolain for $80 more its a pretty sweetUPDATE: So,  I found my order number and emailed Idolian's customer support and the we're quick to reply but they weren't so quick when I called. So if you do buy this and need help, email them. They told me to hit the reset button which is apparently supposed to factory reset it. I already diddly that but I tried it again and I had to mail it in. It took about 3 or 4 weeks to come back (ironically, the day I got sick of waiting for it I emailed customer support for an update only for them to email me back within 5 minutes to say it was coming that day). The sent me one in a new box with a set of cords and everything. I like extra cords so I'm kinda forgiving. The tablet itself (which I'm writing this review with) is probably a refurb and there's a slight yellow color on the top of the screen by the camera but other than that it's fine. I still have the same issues as before, putting it in sleep mode disconnects my micro sd card so I kind of stopped using it. Before I had a problem because whenever I turned on my device it would use the stock keyboard instead of swift key so I'd have to set swift key as the default but that doesn't happen anymore.After using this for the last month I've decided to not buy a different tablet because this one is working fine. Of course, now it's even cheaper than when I bought it so it's still an ok deal for this device. If you can't afford anything else, this tablet isn't your worst choice cause otherwise you'll need to spend an extra $100.

So I bought it for her, received it and she opened it and here is our review.....................did u enjoy the review? Cant review anything if u cant get past the damn opening screen yea? We can't even get past the unlock screen, swipe and motion on the tablet is disengaged, won't work, after about 25 swipes over the unlock button it finally unlocks and freezes, no buttons respond, no back button or anything, so we lock the screen again to see if we can unlock it again, guess what....NOT AGAIN!!!! REALLY?????? Won't unlock again and this time we swiped over the unlock about 35 times and nothing. We cant even power the damn thing off because THAT button doesnt respond either!!! Sitting there frustrated we try rotating the screen, yes it rotated but then that also stopped working...figures. Yes we understand there will be same devices that work flawless which get raving reviews, good for them, this is our story. We have requested a refund on the product and shipping because we paid for 1 day shipping and will leave a seller comment to let you know how the seller responds, and if they refunded our express shipping (sry but thats important) Here is another key point I should of brought up to her, when we were looking at new devices there were also refurbished ones, I believe there were 12 at the time, we waited to buy because we were doing more research, when she wanted to buy a new one the refurbished numbers had gone down to 8....we still waited, when we were ready to buy the refurbished numbers are back at 18...just saying, if those numbers keep going up and up the device cant really be that reliable if u ask me", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Promising Start- Disappointing ending", "Author": "Summer's Mom", "ReviewID": "R114DTORV98QFO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Started off very impressive- met or exceeded the ipad 1 and 3!
