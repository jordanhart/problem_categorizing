{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Nice Android Tablet!", "Author": "Lana C", "ReviewID": "R5Z3VQ7YW4NS0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello, I didn't buy this tablet through Amazon as it was a gift for my birthday. They come in an array of colors and mine is purple. :) After discovering that Google Play wasn't pre-installed, I came to Amazon to read the reviews in case someone had posted a tip on how to download GP to the tablet, but none of the reviews addressed that.So, I decided to share how I downloaded it. I found this video and used it. It took about 15 minutes. Make sure you choose the correct version for your OS, i.e., Android 4.0 or 4.0.4 (mine), and so on. :)[...]This tablet is great for its class. It has a slight delay of maybe ummm 2 seconds when an app is tapped. It's processor isn't super fast (a nano second), but it's just fine for me. Now that I was able to download my favorite apps, I can watch HBOGO, Showtime and videos very well. It's camera isn't the best, but other reviews on the web say that the video portion is nice. :)  It's too large for me to use as a camera anyway. I have a Samsung G3 for that. :)I hope this is helpful!", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Visual Land Connect 9\" Android 4.0 8GB Tablet", "Author": "Bert Murphy", "ReviewID": "R199QKKSX3IHGJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Satisfied with the performance of the tablet.

Shieff", "ReviewID": "R1TY1QANDAFN0G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I found this tablet at a major wholesale club for about 1/2 price, and thought it was a great deal. Well, at first it seemed that way, but when I gave it to my 7-year-old daughter for Christmas (after setting up parental controls, and browser), all was well until she opened Netflix (which I neglected to do), and when I logged into my account, I found that there was no video; just audio and subtitles! I spent hours trying uninstalling, re-installing, and downgrading both Flash Player 11 and Netflix! UGH!! If it has Netflix pre-installed, it should just WORK!!! Also, I can't get YouTube videos to play very well, if at all! I don't care about that, since I have parental control app and browser installed.If you don't care about streaming video, this will do OK. Not the greatest, but for for a youngster, just fine.As for the lack of Google Play, since my daughter is only 7, she doesn't (and won't for a long time) have a Google account, so I'm OK without Google Play. The Amazon app store has a wide variety of free apps, and they give out 1 paid app for free daily, from the front page of the Amazon app store.Honestly, I would've rated 4 stars if Netflix and YouTube worked!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "not a quality tablet as you might expect from a company you have never heard of", "Author": "fatguy1nalittlec0at", "ReviewID": "RX0018GFZ1DLN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this tablet as a gift. Although this may be alright for some people as a tablet, I have found it does very little. The netflix app which comes pre-installed does not actually run the netflix software efficiently and as a result you can enjoy about 15 seconds of streaming video before it closes but please bare in mind that you have to wait approximately 3-6 mintues before that video plays.The wireless receiver is not very strong as it registers 1-2 bars when my laptop in the same location has full bars.The internet browser is slow and cumbersome. It takes a long time to appear to load a page, then once it does load if you try to click on a link you will quickly realize it did not finish loading, it just stopped loading the page.the games that came on the tablet run fine, however some that require tilting do not play very well as the motion sensor in the tablet is not very sensitive.All and all if you are thinking of getting a tablet, save your money and buy a different one. This may have a better price than other tablets, however it is poorly made, poorly programmed and is just plain cheap as you quickly find out after turning it on.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent product.", "Author": "Barry", "ReviewID": "R3TNI2CUNKZ4ZR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have no experience with tablets and do not have a cellphone that goes on the internet. So I had nothing to compare this product to except my experience with computers. But I do know they are separate animals.  Pretty good for the price I would say. Only drawback is that when you first start it up, it takes forever for your email to load up, so for like 10 minutes it is useless until it goes thru all of that.

I was able to load Google Play (with some easy hacking). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the screen has serious glare but I am sure with an anti glare screen it would be better. And it is not as fast as my 1gb tablet. Its not slow it just takes apps about 20 seconds to load. Mainly I wish it had google app store on it. Other then that it is a fantastic little tablet. Works great, loads all webpages, watch movies, play games, read books ect. Really worth the money. I dont know why you would pay more for higher end tablets. This this is great. However finding an after market case is providing difficult. I cant find a 9 inch case. Only 7-8 and 10. but i woulnd trade it for anything.

Google Play is not supported on this device and the Google Play website can verify that. This tablet is NOT listed on their site!!!!!!I got this tablet for work so I could update my spreadsheets while out in the field. It could get damaged or stolen, so I wanted a cheap one. This fits the bill, but the other reviews are right, this tablet is slow!!! Its like having and old 90's PC with dial-up all over again. HOWEVER, it does have its uses. It has no problem with my spreadsheets or connecting to my home network to view shared files. It will also run a youtube vid with no problem - once connected to a wireless signal. I can recommend this for someone looking for no frills. But I cannot recommend it for someone who likes fast devices. This is my first tablet and its ok for a starter.

I contacted the company well within the return time and was told I could send them in to be fixed for $50 plus shipping.  That's what I paid for them in the first place!  I told them that was unacceptable and after getting the run around for a few weeks they ended up coming back to me saying that it was now outside the return period and they would do nothing about it.

My daughter would have never used it out of pure frustration.  So, I ended up having to make a late night run to walmart and purchase an entirely different tablet.
