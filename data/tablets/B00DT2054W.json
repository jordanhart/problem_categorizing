Sulewski \"Stan JS\"", "ReviewID": "R3JNW1BFAAU7XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I have a problem with any of these tablets I have a problem with the Android OS, not with the tablet. It's simple things I don't like. The book reading app had me going nuts when I picked the tablet up and my thumb changed the brightness setting and it ended up being too dim. I hit the brightness control everywhere I could find it but it was still too dim. After messing with it for a long time I found out that there was a second brightness control in the reading app as well as the main brightness control. The second control might have been part of the Amazon book reader app but not knowing that can have you chasing your own tail for a long time.  I found it by accident and I set the brightness to the way I like it. The tablet itself is a winner. I can't find a flaw with it so far. I'm glad that I chose this tablet with the 1GB RAM. I think that the tablets with 512MB RAM could end up slowing down or locking up. When I set up a new PC I always install as much RAM as the mother board will recognize. A tablet is a small PC after all and they run better with more RAM. In the end I think the 7\" Latte is a great little tablet. I'm glad that I purchased it instead of any of the others. I purchased a second Latte for my son as well. It's a nice little machine!", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this Tablet", "Author": "Ruben Dario Perez", "ReviewID": "R2NI3EIO3RB8CR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Tablet, its compact size and weight.
