{"Reviews": [{"Title": "3rd party seller scams. Your NEW Amazon iPad might be USED. Here's how to tell.", "Author": "Reader44", "ReviewID": "R1CLDLMEVLXZUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product itself is fantastic and my stars are based on the product being a great deal and a great device.But for anyone thinking of buying from Amazon, be warned. I purchased one of these for someone on her birthday and it was listed as new.  Amazon seems to only sell iPad minis from third party sellers, not from Amazon.com itself, meaning another company gets the iPads from any source they want, sends them to Amazon, and Amazon ships them. One of these sellers listed an iPad mini slightly above retail price, but cheaper than all of the other iPad minis on Amazon. In fact, when I searched for iPad mini, it was the seller and product page the site automatically directed me to. The page indicated it as new, and sold it to me via Amazon.  When my friend got her iPad mini, it looked new, was packaged and sealed like new, but when she turned it on, it was tied to someone else's icloud account. I called apple and gave them the serial number. Sure enough, the item was used, only had about 60 days left in the warranty (instead of 90) and was registered through Apple to a different customer.  If I wanted a used iPad Mini, I would have paid less. Much less.I even emailed the user who had previously owned it (since her email address via iCloud was showing up when my friend tried to access the app store. I emailed the previous user just to make sure it wasn't a stolen product. She explained that she had purchased it a few weeks back from At&T;, not from Amazon. She wanted a wifi + 3g version, not just wifi, so she returned it and somehow, the third party seller got their hands on it and sold it to me as new.In the defense of of the third party seller, once I got their phone number from Amazon and called them (most seller numbers are not on Amazon, you have to call and request a phone number), they provided a scary explanation: They explained that there are problems with Amazon's FBA system (fulfillment). Sometimes, iPads are returned with nothing but index cards in the box and Amazon thinks there is an iPad inside. Sometimes, products mingle, and so another seller's used iPads might be with a different seller's new iPads. They explained that they have a very legitimate source of iPads and have been selling iPads for years and that this is a rare occurrence, although it has happened before. I have no way of verifying any of this, so I can't blame Amazon or the seller. All I can say is that for such a large purchase, and one that is a gift, you are better off buying from a major retail store that doesn't sell used items at all (or buying from Amazon when it is shipped and sold and fulfilled by Amazon).  Right now, this product is actually on sale at Walmart.Amazon refunded me but now my friend has to return her birthday gift. I recommend buying from someone other than Amazon. For this particular product, it's probably the cheaper route to do that anyway. If you do buy from Amazon, call Apple with your Serial Number and verify it is a new, unregistered product with a full 90 day warranty. Don't get scammed.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "A phenomenally portable twist on the iPad that finally breaks the mold of 7\" tablets.", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R18KRNCDSS963I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Conceived from its sleek, glossy 10\" counterpart, the new iPad Mini boasts one gigantic new trait over the full-sized iPad: the ability to hold it in one hand. This almost revolutionary twist on the device that sparked a frenzy in the tablet world has finally brought joy to those that have held out hope of such higher portability in an iPad for so long. But does the iPad Mini live up to the hype?  Absolutely.Turns out, the iPad mini is indeed more than simply a shrunk-down iPad, though there may be an argument for it actually resembling something more along the lines of a blown-up iPod touch. In any case, the big question: is the iPad mini right for you? I'll endeavor to answer that for you here by taking you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share from my past few years of iPad ownership experience altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own.Plus, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad mini review on Amazon, I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My reviews tend to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to help you quickly locate any specific info you're after. For example, see the heading \"Downloading Apps and Games\" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's compare hardware specs between iPad mini and iPad, and what each means for you:+ Device: iPad mini vs. iPad (4th gen)+ Weight: 0.68 lbs vs. 1.44 lbs -- over twice as light as the iPad+ Thickness: 0.28\" (7.2mm) vs. 0.37\" (9.4mm) -- thin as an iPod touch+ Display: 163 vs. 264 pixels per inch -- less-crisp text, but equally long life for a smaller battery+ Resolution: 1024 x 768 vs. 2048 x 1536 -- half as many pixels as the current iPad, but still sharper than an iPad 2+ Battery: 10 hours (16.3 Wh) vs. 10 hours (45 Wh) -- smaller, lighter battery lasts just as long as the iPad+ Processor: A5 (dual core) vs. A6X (dual core with quad core graphics) -- same as the new iPod touch, but not quite as powerful as the latest iPad, yet it doesn't need to be because the iPad mini display totes a quarter as many pixels!+ Price: The iPad mini has a price tag that is indeed much more attractive than the 10\" iPad. It's actually closer to that of the iPod touch.===== First Impression =====At first sight, there's a feeling of novelty to the iPad Mini, especially if you've used a 10\" iPad or tablet. The more you use it, however, the more you realize that this is the size an iPad was meant to be: perfectly portable. The 10\" iPad is so bulky and heavy in comparison, and I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed and awkward taking it with me and using it places, especially waiting in line. Not so with the iPad mini! It's super light, more than half the weight of the 10\" iPad, and its sleek rounded edges are much more comfortable for carrying than the sharply-tapered edges of the iPad.My initial reaction to the unveiling of the iPad mini was one of slight disappointment, mainly because it was closer to 8\" than to the desired 7\" of other tablets in its class. Why would Apple bother bringing a smaller iPad to market that's still not quite as small as some of the other 7\" tablets floating around? Ah, but I was wrong.Until I held it in my own hand, I failed to realize that Apple had made better use of the iPad mini's size than most 7\" tablets do. What matters in a 7\" tablet class isn't the screen size but the actual device size. The iPad mini is 3mm shorter and 7mm wider than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD, yet it touts nearly an inch more of physical screen size.===== Interaction Experience =====Naturally, the iPad mini shares the iPad's same phenomenal multi-touch interface that is undisputedly second to none. Android tablets and other devices may tout \"multi-touch\" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. Apple, on the other hand, gives a whole new meaning to the term, supporting up to ten simultaneous touches, and app developers have certainly leveraged that capacity. For example, one popular app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the Piano app.===== So What Can the iPad mini Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad mini right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos from your computer via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music, movies and media via the iTunes app. Another popular app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad mini. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat face-to-face with other Apple-device users via FaceTime.Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad mini doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with an iPad, and the same goes for the iPad mini. All iPad apps work on the iPad mini. After all, the iPad mini is still an iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a \"netbook killer\" (due to its ability to surf the web, check email, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. But along its path to success, it sparked a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines, news and now even ebooks via Apple's iBooks app. Now, it's quite clear that Apple had the goal of a much more comfortable ebook reading experience in mind when they set out to create the iPad mini. You can easily hold it in one hand, just like a real book, and it's as light as a real book, two traits many users have been hoping to see come to fruition soon.On the other hand, to use the iPad mini for more productive purposes, such as editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps including: Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets) and Keynote (slideshows). Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad mini for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad mini alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad mini into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad mini couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card (or iTunes gift card), all you need to do is launch the 'App Store' app, browse or search to find the app you want, tap the download button (usually it says the price rather than 'download', which then changes to 'install app' after you tap it), then tap again to confirm. Enter your password, and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple then charges your card (or deducts from your gift card balance) the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new purchase. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it's perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this in hopes that you'll write a rave review for the temporarily-free app. The secret to your success here is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.In hopes of making this the most helpful review on Amazon for the iPad mini, here's how to obtain these special promotional-sale and temporarily-free apps for yourself!There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad mini itself. I prefer to use an app called \"AppShopper\" which lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the \"popular\" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad mini =====Typing on the iPad mini has certainly become a bit less burdensome than with its 10\" iPad counterpart, especially in the way of thumb-typing. However, typing lengthy messages can still be a concern. Obviously, the iPad mini is no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.Alternately, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard, you can choose to split the keyboard, which makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom. Undocked keyboard can be split or merged, per your preferences.Typing Method #2: Two FingersIf thumb-typing isn't your style, try holding the iPad mini in one hand, like a book, and use your index and middle fingers to go back and forth across the virtual keyboard. Alternately, if the iPad mini is resting on a surface and is in landscape orientation, you could try using two fingers from each hand, but I don't think the iPad mini is big enough to type with your full range of fingers like the 10\" iPad is.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextWith iOS 5 and Siri, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing.You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'question mark', 'exclamation mark', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen', 'single quote', 'double quote', 'ellipsis' and more. Siri is built into the iOS software and is a free service, but one caveat of using Siri for speech transcription is that you must be connected to the Web at the time of transcription, because Siri is a primarily Web-based service (albeit a free one). At times, network congestion has been known to hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, but that happens much less frequently now and usually only occurs if your device is connected to a poor cellular signal instead of WiFi.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps like Dragon, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad mini's small stature is no less capable, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad mini is in landscape orientation, Apple's built-in Safari Web browser or Google's downloadable Chrome app will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site. Chrome lets you keep an unlimited number of browser tabs in the background, while Safari limits you to 9 tabs (at least until iOS 6 is released).The good thing about Web browsing on the iPad and iPad mini is that you can rotate the orientation. Content on the Web was born to be viewed vertically (in portrait orientation), not horizontally (landscape orientation) as most laptops and desktop computers use. In general, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad mini allows you to see more content at a still-decent size. Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by quickly double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and the browser's interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Flash content is now being used less and less, in favor of newer content technologies like HTML5's canvas and JavaScript effects, which can emulate some of Flash's most familiar capabilities, but sites using Flash do still exist. Flash is often used for advertising, video playback, browser-based online gaming, and for many other interactive site components, from graphs to product demos. However, the Flash experience on tablets that do support it is still quite poor in the interactivity department, especially considering that Adobe never intended for it to be used on touch screens. Thus, certain Flash content may expect a mouse hover and you can't emulate that with a finger on a touch screen.While I found browsing the Web with a 10\" iPad to be a literal pain in the neck, the lightweight and small stature of the iPad mini has certainly improved the experience. It's easier to handle, to hold upright with a single hand while browsing the web with the other, and it's more comfortable to hold. Since I didn't surf much with my 10\" iPad, I have no qualms about the lack of a retina display. I'd rather have this iPad mini with the same resolution as the iPad 2 and a 10-hour battery life with a much smaller batter, than to have an iPad mini with a retina display and either a 4-hour battery life, or a battery as heavy as that of the 10\" iPad!===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad mini's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad mini.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad mini. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad mini to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad mini is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad mini coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad mini. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photos and Video =====The new iPad mini brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad mini!Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, if you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad mini, you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad is making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad mini's greatest strengths, especially with it being about the size of a book. Magazine, newspaper and now book publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own iBooks and iPad apps, taking their publications to a whole new level, interactively and financially too.My experiences interacting with some of these digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becoming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single book.As far as Amazon ebooks go, you're not losing out by passing up on their Kindle line of tablets, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad mini via Amazon's Kindle app. If you read a lot outdoors and don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite (not Kindle Fire) is more your style. Kindle uses e-ink which is much easier to read in the sunlight.All in all, the iPad mini is an great e-reader on a whole new level. Had it touted a retina display, text would be slightly more crisp, albeit at the cost of long battery life. I'll take longer battery life over slightly more crisp text any day. Text on the iPad mini looks fine, unless it's really small, and that's usually only the case for an occasional website, but not ebooks.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad mini's strengths because of its single-app-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", lets you do just that. For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad mini. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents, Numbers allows you to create and edit spreadsheets, and Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). Keynote has been pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings with an iPad, but I'm not sure the iPad mini would be as comfortable using for presentations.There's also a productivity category in the App Store dedicated to additional apps geared towards helping you be more productive. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone and iPad will run on the iPad mini, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps specifically made or updated for the iPad and iPad mini. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad mini is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of iPad users with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are better for the 10\" iPad than the iPad mini. Meanwhile, games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction are much conducive for use on the iPad mini than the 10\" iPad.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad mini is really hit-or-miss. Apple's iOS 4 brought the ability to print documents from their devices, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support \"AirPrint\" or, if yours doesn't, you might have success using Printopia software, so long as you have a Mac with a shared printer. Search Google for 'AirPrint' or 'Printopia' for more info and printer compatibility. From there, printing is easy, for apps that support it. The first time you attempt to print something, the iPad mini will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options. For more information about printing with your iPad mini, I'll link to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad mini delivers surprisingly well in the area--it provides several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service). Apple even provides a free device-location service.===== Praise =====+ Clever use of space to cram an 8\" screen into a 7\" class of device that can be held with one hand!+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close.+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking.+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the dual-core A5 processor, despite the same 256MB of memory as the third generation touch.+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do HD video.+ 4G LTE - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi+ Supported on Sprint - previous iPads only supported Verizon and AT&T;+ Lower iPad entry price point===== Caveats =====+ No Retina Display - But at the added benefit of a lighter battery that holds its charge just as long.===== Disappointments =====+ No GPS (or assisted GPS with 4G model) - IP based location just doesn't cut it at times. GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use+ No NFC - Near Field Communications is what powers PayPass in credit cards, and there are certainly uses for it in devices, especially for data transfer, if not for making payments or redeeming passes with the Passbook app.+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos, or hold more of those 1080p videos you can shoot+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, for importing pics from your external camera for use with the new iPhoto app+ No numeric character row in keyboard, despite plenty of space on the iPad and iPad mini's screen.===== The Bottom Line =====There's really not much to complain about in an iPad now. Sure, retina display would be nice, but if we'd been given that, we'd be complaining about battery life, heavy weight or performance issues. Meanwhile, the 10\" iPad has its uses, but portability isn't one of its strong suits. The iPad mini now fills that gap, and it's really been a dream to use. If 10\" is comfortable for you, go with an iPad. As for me, the iPad mini has mostly lived up to my tablet desires.Do you really 'need' the retina display? The honest truth is, no. See, Apple has certainly come to spoil us with its latest and greatest hardware, including the retina display, but I really don't see the iPad mini's less phenomenal display as a real deal breaker. I also a believer that the original iPad or iPad 2 are still great devices if you like the 10\" class of tablet, and they don't have the retina display. So, really, why wait around another year for something better to come along? Then again, there's no absolute guarantee that the next iPad mini will even have that retina display.The bottom line is, don't wait around and waste these precious cycles of your life hoping and betting on something better to come around, when you can always buy the current iPad Mini now, enjoy it now, and resell it down the road. Apple products always hold most of their value for a long time, because they're in such high demand.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Slower at buffering video than my I-pad Retina (and the I-pad 2)", "Author": "D. Fichtner", "ReviewID": "R2QAXZKLNZHPDM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, I'm not going to rip this thing apart.  I feel the Mini is an absolutely wonderful form-factor, and I recommend it -- just not yet.The good:The size of the mini is just short of an inch wider than your typical competitor.  You might not think this is much, but seriously, it is.  I absolutely love this aspect of it.  In addition, the Mini is just wonderfully light and easy to hold (I have big hands, though).As much as people rip on the screen, it is comfortably bright, and the battery life seems to last quite well, even if brightened up a bit.  No complaints there.The bad:That same screen, as others have said, suffers from its low resolution.  Had this tablet come out a year ago, it would have been earth-shattering.  Now, when other offerings from Android are coming out with far better resolutions, it's just meh (the Apple Mini's contrast and color are still superior to the Nexus 7 by far, though).  If you are someone coming from an I-pad 2, you won't care about the resolution so much.  For everyone else who is used to I-phones with substantially smaller, yet sharper resolutions, you will notice the difference.Also, and this is a big one for me, I have found that the I-pad Mini is slow to buffer YouTube videos.  I'm pretty sure this has to do with it having half of the Ram of its larger pad family members.  Cutting the Ram in half was a big mistake.  It also seems to cause lags in surfing on only some sites that are more graphic intense.  I wasn't sure if this problem was one of my own, so I tried out some other Mini's in the store side-by-side with I-pad 2's and Retinas.  Same thing... slow Youtube buffering.  Quite a bit slower.I want to tell you to buy this thing, but I just can't.  I want to tell you to wait until next year when the tech is there to up resolution and add more Ram.

Bowman", "ReviewID": "R1A9CEFMDUNOVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid reader and a writer who has tried every portable device under the sun. Smart phones (even the large ones) are too small to read comfortably or to type; laptops simply are not portable enough due to short battery lives; and other tablets were uncomfortably large for me (I've got small hands.) I've tried taking notes directly on screens with a stylus; I've tried Bluetooth keyboards; and I've tried typing directly on screens. Everything was either too large or too small. Other, similarly-sized tablets tend to lag, or the battery life is very poor.I've been an Apple holdout for a while. I had a little iBook a long time ago, and the system issues, general uselessness of the battery, the severe problems with transferring Word, Corel, and other word processing documents, and all-around, irritating, proprietary nature of Mac turned me off for several years. Don't get me started on what I thought of the pricing.After doing a lot of research, however, I took a chance on an iPad mini. It was the perfect size (decent screen, super thin, super light) the battery life is supposedly long (it is--seven hours on the brightest screen setting, several days on standby, 10-12 hours with a low or medium bright screen) extremely portable (very, very important) easy to backup (and from the backup, export to different formats if needed) and does exactly what I need it to do (word processing, graphic art, reading, and surfing.) I have never been happier with an electronic device. (I also use it as an iPod. And as a player for my Google Drive. It's fabulous.)To repeat, it's absolutely perfect for me. I can work on it for hours, it's powerful enough for professional art programs, it's great for writing (the native note app, Google Drive, the Corel app, and a couple of others) and it is by far the best screen for reading I've come across.I tried a Bluetooth keyboard, thinking the screen would be too small to type on. The Bluetooth was a dud--it only worked once--but that was a happy accident. The iPad mini is exactly the right size for me to comfortably type onscreen.I have no complaints with Safari. It's super-fast and while it isn't my favorite search engine ever, it naturally does the job. The only issue I had was figuring out how to open a link in a new tab. (This took me a week. I can be a little slow.)Now that the rave is over, there are a couple of caveats.First, while the screen is the perfect size for me to type on, I'm a small female with hands about 2/3 average size, so it may be too small for some people to comfortably type on.Second, there are (as noted by other reviewers) no USB ports. If you need a lot of memory, this is not the device for you. There is no easy way to expand it. This was actually a little disappointing for me, but Google Drive and Dropbox solved the problem for me. (I'm a lucky person who is never far away from a WiFi signal.)Also, there is no way to replace the battery. When it starts dying, it's done.It doesn't have the retina display that comes with the larger iPads. (It's still a better resolution than many other devices, but hey--no retina display is no retina display.)Finally, there isn't really any way to get around the price. It costs more than some laptops, and certainly more than the other tablets of its size.Personally, I think it's worth it. The sheer portability and quality of the item is incredible. The fact that it is literally perfect for everything I need to do makes it even better--for me.I strongly recommend the iPad mini, with one caveat: do your research. Make absolutely sure you know exactly what you need and what you want, and invest in a product that meets that. This is not the item for someone who needs a lot of onboard memory or a ton of power. Someone who wants just to surf or just an e-reader may be better served with another product, too--but then again, maybe not (like I said, this functions as the most delightful e-reader ever.)I love it, and I think most people will.

Or actually, Amazon did (I think it was fulfilled by Amazon).The Apple ID numbers were covered up by a sticker attached by the re-seller.  I had to carefully peel this back so I could call Apple and get the smut on this particular device (more on that below).  I wanted to make sure that is was not a repackaged, used device, as others have reviewed, or that it was refurbished, or purchased over 30 days ago (and thus ineligble for AppleCare- also reviewed below).  I was able to peel off the sticker without ruining the plastic wrap, which would have made my return 'opened'.A corner of the box was slightly dinged in, and the plastic wrap on the box looked pretty well scuffed up, and definitely gave the appearance that it had been bounced around quite a bit.I did not open the box, as I found out from Apple that this was not actually a brand new device.I looked for but did not find a Mini sold directly by Amazon.  It appears (and an Apple Tech confirmed this) that Amazon does not sell Apple products, instead relying on resellers to take on that onus.  Is this all cause of the Kindle?What impact does that have on us?  In most cases, you will be ineligible for AppleCare. AppleCare is a huge benefit for most purchasers, covering all types of damage up to 2 years.  If you buy an Apple product from someone other than an Apple store, you can still enroll your device in AppleCare, but it must be done within 30 days of purchase, and it must be done at an Apple store.When you purchase an Apple product through Amazon, you are getting a device that in most cases was purchased by someone like us, at a BestBuy, WalMart, Target, etc, at some point in the recent past.  They then 're-sell' the device on Amazon.  Apple uses the origianl date of purchase from the Apple vendor (the BestBuy, Walmart, Target, etc) to start the 30 day AppleCare counter.  In my case, my Mini arrived on the 30th day from original purchase.  I had 3 hours to get my device down to an Apple store, get it enrolled in AppleCare, or else I would be SOL.  Fortunately, Amazon's incredible return policy enabled me to just go online and in a few clicks print out my free return label.As an FYI, Apple stores are the absolute best way to purchase an Apple device.  Not only are they cheaper (mine was actually the same price, with tax, as it was from Amazon), but they will spend over an hour with you getting it set up, linked to your iTunes, your iPhone, iCloud, etc.  It's an amazing experience, and it's all free with your purchase.I challenge Amazon (and Apple) to combine their two excellent companies and develop a strategy for online buying experience that actually enhances each other's products/services, rather than detract from them as they do now.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another used iPad Mini sold as new", "Author": "Robert Fisher", "ReviewID": "R2Z7IM6NCKWAUK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I echo Reader44's review (above) about getting a supposedly new iPad Mini from Amazon that turned out to be used.  My Mini arrived on Friday with paperwork showing that it was being provided by Freebie Electronics.  I had no problem getting it configured on my wireless WiFi network Saturday morning.  I then called Verizon and provided the necessary information to connect using 3G.  However, it would not connect even though I had the Verizon logo and three bars on the screen.  I called Verizon back, and another person told me there was a \"problem,\" and I needed to speak with the Fraud Prevention department, which was not open weekends.  Or I could go to a Verizon store and have someone there look at it.  I opted for the latter and drove to the Verizon store in Torrington, CT.  Someone there checked it out, entered some data from the Mini on her computer, and confirmed that the Mini had been previously sold to someone else.  The unit was \"blacklisted\" because that someone had neglected to pay his or her Verizon account.  No, Verizon won't unlock the Mini, so I have to return it to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon's web site says Freebie Electronics gets 4.9 out of 5 stars, which seems hard to believe if that company makes a habit of providing used electronics to Amazon for sale as new.

My friends said it was pointless but its not. It is physically smaller than the iPad but it has the same excellent quality. Its a lot lighter than the iPad. You may think its to small it's not, the commercials kind of make it look smaller, you get used to the size very easily. The size is very convenient  and it still feels like the full iPad experience.It is fast as well. The camera is nice and the speakers aren't bad like the iPod touches. I actually prefer the size it's not big and bulky, you can take it out in public and feel a lot less awkward than with a real iPad. If you want a tablet for strictly work use maybe the iPad is a better choice, however if you're just going to use it for a work and games, entertainment, photos etc. I definitely recommend it.Display  It has a gorgeous display. It is not retina display but I've compared devices with and with out retina and there is virtually no difference in the display. It also has an awesome battery life. It isn't less than the iPad. Apple really did go back to the very beginning and put a lot of effort into this device. It is much better than the kindle fire. This device's light weight, beautiful display, fast speed, quality speakers and camera, makes it easy to use, take on the go, present, and enjoy!Camera  It has a camera, the pictures are like cell phone pictures, but if the room which you're in is bright and you give it a second to get focused the camera is magnificent, especially outside on a sunny day!Siri  As you probably know this device includes Siri. Siri I often don't use because I'm not in the habit of it. But when I do remind my self it is helpful. Not only is it helpful but to play around without, it has a (specific) response to everything you say. Also I find it really neat that if I'm typing a document I can just press a button and it types what I say, which is wonderful for rough drafts and stuff! This also works if you're searching something etc.Space & Apps  I got the 16 gb version however the space I had available was only about 13gb, which really wasn't too bad, just take in to consideration, that 3 of the gbs  won't be available for use because of what is already installed (no, you cannot delete what is already installed). So, if you're someone who takes lots of videos, photos, plans to make movies, have apps where a lot of data will be contained (iMovie, pages, etc.) Get the 32 gb one, or you can do what I do is take videos and photos, then upload them onto my computer, then delete the data entirely from my iPad, beacause videos and pictures take up a lot of space, however one or two short videos are fine. Just manage your space, but 16 gb is really a fine amount (I'm only at 7).  The apps on apple devices are magnificent, it's not just fun games, there are some for creating documents, educational ones, apps for teachers, photo editing, the Holy Bible! Even medical apps, that give you instructions for medical emergencies or problems, and there is a really neat one on the brain, apps that help you find your iPad if it's lost!  There also is iMovie, if you are unformiliar which it, it is this really neat program that allows you to make movies, it simple, and looks extremely professional it s only $5 in the App Store, so worth the money!  V.S Other Products  Yes, there are cheaper things like the Gooogle Nexus tablet, Samsung Galaxy Note, KINDLE FIRE, and other android tablets/computer tablets, but if you have any i-device (iPod touch, iPod nano, iPhone, etc.) you know the experience is way different than android and for many people way better. It isn't much more, and I know people who have gotten rid of there other tablets (in perfectly good condition) for the iPad mini. And it also had a variety of e-reading apps. And the computer/tablet devices are neat... but $700 more. Besides flash it has all the abilities as computers (refer to \"Space & Apps\"), and for the few flash-involved I'm sure there is a computer somewhere in your house.  In conclusion, this device is wonderful. I've been exposed and experienced with multiple devices, this is still awesome!  In conclusion, this device is amazing.  I switched several people to the iPad mini. Tablets are all made by intelligent people, but this device is made my geniuses. It has, Siri, good speakers, nice camera, very convenient size, for watching movies viewing photos etc, still light, compact, portable.

Yes the ipad mini screen display could've been a lot better and sharper than it currently is but to be honest, I think users of iPhone 4/4s/5, ipad3/4, and all other iDevices that currently use retina screens are just spoiled by being accustom to apple having retina that they have a state of mind that they won't accept anything less than retina quality from apple.A lot of other mobile companies have screens a lot worse than retina but yet still people accept it mainly because their expectations for the other brands aren't as high as what they'd expect from apple...people love the non retina MacBook Pros...and reading texts on that machine isn't a pain or unbearable right?I'd love to see retina on the next releases of the new ipad minis schedules for later this year but in the mean while, I'm pretty satisfied with the existing display...it's not great, but it's also far from being bad.A5 PROCESSORThis is the reason I took away 1 star from making this product earn a 5 star review....the major blow to me of this device is that it has an A5 processor and not that it lacks a retina display...for those who are unaware, the A5 chip comes with built in RAM which only has the capacity of 512mb...doing basic things on the ipad mini doesn't require an A5x or aA6 chip but with the more intense apps like Waze, graphic intense games, and even Facebook, you'd begin to experience some slow downs on your device...again, not unbearable, but definitely not a smooth experience as one would like.Is it a dealbreaker? If I'm relying on just specs on paper, then YES....however, if I'm basing my purchase of an ipad mini on actual use of the device forgetting specs and just seeing how the device works in real life situations...then NO...although the ipad mini only has 512mb of RAM it's not a slouch. iOS is very hardware efficient and you won't feel the lack of 1gb RAM on iOS as much as you would on an android device running jelly bean for example.SCREEN SIZEthis is honestly the best screen size I've experienced on any tablet thus far. You can easily type with both thumbs while holding the ipad mini in portrait mode (something that wasn't possible with the classic sized iPads unless you split the keyboard).A 7.9\" screen is a joy to carry around as its not too large and not too small neither. My sentiments are that 7\" is a little too small for a tablet as they're phones already close to that size such as the galaxy note series. At first I wasn't too sure how I'd feel about the extra .9 of an inch thinking to myself that it's not a significant amount of extra real estate to satisfy me seeing as I previously owned an ipad 3, but to my suprise, it's just the right size for my personal taste.I know you probably heard this countless times before but I too think that this should've been the size of the iPads all along as now that I own a mini, I'd never go back to that 9.7\" of the classic iPads...I find myself carrying around and using my ipad mini a lot more than I did with my ipad 3 even though it was faster and had a better display....this ipad mini simply is what a tablet is supposed to be....PORTABLE!!!PHYSICAL BUILD QUALITYThe ipad mini is a wonderful piece of hardware. Detail given by apple in the production of this machine is simply amazing. From the moment you hold it in your hands you'd feel the love and great R&D; they put into this device. It does come with a few drawbacks but the pros by far outnumbers the cons.It is the nicest lookin ipad yet, best screen size in my opinion, best with regards to portability and it does everything it's bigger brothers do, a bit slower, but in real time it's only a few milliseconds slower though which to me is not substantial.Next gen ipad mini with a faster processor and retina screen WILL be the best ipad you can possibly get, but for now I'm pretty satisfied with the ipad mini and can safely recommend this device to anyone looking for an excellent, lightweight and portable tablet", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Is the best it gets", "Author": "Kristin", "ReviewID": "R2KPJR0H5SDUSY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, this product exceeds five stars. If you want to know the honest description of this product, hopefully this will help you.I bought this product at the apple store the day it was released, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this product from apple, that is if you want to save money. Otherwise there is no point in buying this product from amazon unless you are one of those people that wants to spend an extra 80 bucks. From the apple store, the 16 gig iPad mini is 330$, while the same product sells for 417$ on amazon.Simply, this is the product for a person that wants to take a tablet places and needs to slip it in there handbag without a second thought. If you want a more enhanced display and a larger body, buy the iPad with retina display.This product is definitely better than the iPad 2. It is lighter, faster, has a much better display, streams clearer photos, is much lighter and more portable, although the iPad 2 is a wonderful product.

This tablet is excellent for social networking. Because of the brilliant I sight camera I can snap a photo of anything, anywhere, and double tap the image, and post. Everything is simplified on such a sleek device.Now, for the cons, I will say there is one thing: if you were like me, and looked at all the videos and documentation a they show you, almost all the apps, books, movies and music costs money, so all of the special features cost extra.

There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2.

I use it everyday mostly for reading. I've tried many games on it and found the game experience to be wanting.iPad mini changes everything.Before taking the Mini home, there were things I obviously liked, and some things I was a little worried about. For instance, although you can hold the Mini with no effort because of how light it is, I heard talk that comic books were harder to read because of the smaller size.i haven't found this to be true. After reading several comics, I am very pleased with the experience.And games - all those games I couldn't quite get into because of the size of the larger iPads have now been opened up to me. The lightness of the mini, combined with the positioning of your hands on it's smaller frame have changed the experience. The thin bezel at the sides has proven to be plenty wide enough for me. The same games I tried on the larger iPad 2 are now much more enjoyable on the iPad mini. A big enough screen to enjoy the action, but not so big as to introduce awkwardness.Oh, also the speakers on the Mini are great. You will not be straining to hear what's going on in the videos you watch and games you play, unlike the iPad 2 experience.Throw in Siri and a respectable camera, and the iPad mini is the defining iPad experience in my opinion. I don't even miss not having retina, as some theorized would be the case.Do yourself a favor and get at least the 32 gb size. You don't want to continuously have to delete stuff in order to make room. Also, iPads slow down when they start getting low on memory. 32 gb will give you plenty of room for lots of stuff to enjoy, while leaving enough room so your iPad doesn't get bogged down.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet: And Notes About the EcoSystem", "Author": "W. Zimmerman", "ReviewID": "R1VWIDDX9QNDOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ABOUT THIS REVIEWERI'm a Prime Amazon customer. In this household we use Amazon to shop for all sorts of things.  I am an early adopter and love tech, but as we have come to rely on technology more and more, it has become less of a toy and something that simply has to work all the time, whether for an online web conference or for the kid's homework.ABOUT THE iPAD MINIConstruction: I was getting ready to write this review and managed to set my iPad mini on a bar-height kitchen counter top precariously, and it fell to the floor.  Hitting a wood floor no less.  Happy to report nothing happened. No scratches, no dings, operating just fine.  Didn't plan to start by writing about the construction of the iPad mini, but this is a device you'll move around a lot, take in the car, stuff in airplane seat pockets, cram into backpacks.  This thing is amazingly light, but built like a tank.  It can take it.Use: It is a joy to use.  Clear screen, easy operation, all the features work all the time... And of course you can find an application for just about anything.  Here is the best part, if you have more than one Tablet around (we have a couple iPads in the household), everything works the same way on the regular and the mini sized iPads.  Even better, using one account shared on these devices means that we only have to purchase an App once and we can use it on a couple different iPads.Choices: My wife prefers the larger iPad for email and my teens like the larger one for movies and drawing, but I love this mini size for travel.  It's just personal preference.  You can argue specs all you want, but basically the mini and the regular sized iPads are identical in function, battery life, apparent resolution, and so forth. The only question is your own preference as to size and weight. (And the Mini is less expensive than the full size.)Apps: Email is a breeze, web browsing is simple and quick, and if you are into photography, this little gem offers an amazing still shot and video camera. And with all those apps it can be just about anything from a network diagnostic tool to a book collection, from a banking tool to a game pad, or a weather forecaster to a music player...COST OF OWNERSHIPWhen it comes to picking a Tablet, think about the purchase price over time. I have PC netbooks in the house that lasted less than a year.  Most of the PC laptops lasted 2 years or so.  But the Apple products simply don't quit.  We have an original iPad that is as good as new, and Apple desktops and laptops that keep getting handed down from one family member to another because they don't stop.  Yes, they are more expensive to purchase at first, but we save a huge amount of money because they keep working for years and years.  We don't have money to waste, that's for sure.TOTAL ECOSYSTEMAnd here is the real decision point, at least for this household.  It's all about the ecosystem, or the suite of hardware and software that work together.  I'm no longer content to have a cool laptop, or a great Tablet.. I want it all working together, and this is where Apple products shine. We have personal and family calendars that update on our phones, tablets, desktops and laptops.  We do the same with email and magazine subscriptions and so much more.  We can share photos and music on all of these devices and on the TV as well (hooked to an Apple TV box). We can save files \"in the cloud\" and access them from anywhere, anytime, on any device.  This is how it is supposed to work.  My son is into programming and finds the Unix-based environment of the Mac to be the best place to work.  My daughter is into photography and has professional-level tools at the ready.  My wife is doing genealogy research and helping the kids with school (and life in general), and I have a company to run.  It's all on this integrated, connected, suite that works all the time, without nearly any effort from me to keep it running. And backups?  All automatic and all in the cloud, and yes, I've had to recover from backups before and it worked like it was supposed to.As I said at the start, we use Amazon Prime all the time. Love it. But I want the technology in our household to be what we want it to be, not a constant reminder to buy more.  Really disappointed that Amazon created their Kindle Fires as a way to sell more stuff. And yes, you can turn off the adds (by paying to do so), but not the recommendations. Beyond that, though, the Kindles and Kindle Fire are not part of an overall solution that can work together.SAFE and STABLEWe used to be a PC household, but that required 10 to 15 hours of month of \"tech support\" time from me to keep the computers and laptops and network operating.  No longer. It just works.  I also appreciate that the UNIX backbone of the Mac OS is less susceptible to viruses and the like. I don't have time to worry about the problems that Android phones are having now with viruses or hackers either.  True, all platforms can be attacked, but we are dealing with orders of magnitude here; the Apple world is more locked down, but in return I get more stability and we spend less time making it all work.CUSTOMER SUPPORTBack to this theme of saving time.  I love the fact that I can open up my iPad or my laptop and reserve an appointment at my local Apple Store with a few clicks.  Walk in the store, have the person up front confirm my arrival and be working with a decent tech person in just a few minutes.  I've had nothing but great service, and several times they went well beyond: as with older machines that were way past warranty but fixed at no charge, or the time I had an iPhone with a scratched camera lens. Replaced on the spot, no charge. If you are honest with them, they will be with you.So, that's our story.

Despite my being a huge Apple fan, I wasn't sure I'd put this to good use. In the past month I've really come to love this thing.First off, while this does not have the advanced retina display of the iPad3, it produces a very clear and crisp image. It makes this the perfect device to use as an ereader because it can be held in one hand, yet it has the full functionality of a full size iPad minus advanced retina display.The speedy processor makes this lightening fast and unbelievably responsive and zippy. I use this just as I use my iPad2 and that means I can use it not just recreationally but also for some vital business functions. Like my iPhone, it keeps me in touch with my mail as well as the net while being easier to manipulate. If an app works on the iPad it will work on the Mini..I like the screen size which is just about perfect for a portable device that can fit in my hand and in a smaller purse. In fact, one of the reasons my husband popped for this is because it is comparable in size to a Kindle and is really portable and does not require a special carrying case, etc.The iSight camera, at 5 megapixels, is great. Produces clear and vivid pictures without any distortion.The all aluminum body is solid and the mini's construction is flawless. It is razor thin and weighs in well under a pound.I like the Lightening connector, but that does have a downside in that this is not interchangeable with the 30 prong connector that powers all of my other devices except the iPad4.Another new feature I like is SIRI. All you have to do is depress the screen button to activate SIRI which functions as a personal assistant. I'm still learning how to use it, but it is great to be able to access information with verbal commands.My only real complaint re: the mini is its price. It seems about $50 to $75 too high for what it is and how it compares to other tablets out there. Still, if you are a happy Apple user you'll pay the asking price.Ideally, this is best utilized by people on the go. It really suits my lifestyle since I am usually all over the place. Since there are hot spots everywhere I go, it is never a problem to find free wi-fi.I am updating my review nearly three months later. I really love this baby iPad. I'd be hard pressed to say whether I'd toss my iPad4 or my mini if I had to make a choice. I also have come to view the mini's price as fair given its quality and ease of operation. Of late, my Mini has gone everywhere with me. It is so compact, convenient, and discrete that it adds no appreciable weight to my purse and I can even carry a smaller purse now.  I love this thing.

The build quality good but not any more impressive than that of my Asus RT tablet and the Dell Venue Pro 8 I worked with for a few days. My hat off to Apple for getting folks to accept a consumption device that does not support flash or something as simple as downloading MP3 files from sites other than iTunes. I spent $4.95 for a browser app that supports flash. In all my years of using computers, this is the first time I have felt compelled to buy a browser!If I want to view and hear a YouTube video posted in the Facebook app, I must display it in Safari. The Apps store and iTunes take an exceptionally long time to load. I had to add an app just to be able to download our MP3 files! Speech commands and dictation require you be on line for Siri to connect with Apple servers (shades of Chromebook dependency on a Wi-Fi connection.) We all know how \"secure\" our internet data is so why not? (cough, cough) In Windows 8 tablets,the free built-in Microsoft Speech to text and control software is designed for off line as well as on line use.Even after adjusting font size options, screen print is often too small to read comfortably and zoom does not always work. Wi-Fi is slower than any other portable device I own. I can't argue against success but am dumbfounded such a limited device with an equally impressive high price has become the tablet standard. I am spoiled by tablets that allow full access to flash sites, true off line accessibility and file downloads.

I couldn't believe what I'd been missing!

I'm a student.I couldn't have picked a better Christmas present for myself.It's is larger than I expected and honestly, I prefer the smaller- than- iPad size.

Is it my imagination?In Apples defense, I have yet to behold the retina display everyone raves about. But you can't missed what you've never had is my moto.

Even my downloaded games lag.It is NOT just a wifi issue.Its smaller thus less powerful. It's not the iPad fault. You appreciate it for what it is.

I proceeded to sync all my music, movies and games/apps onto it and then came the fun part: testing everything out. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the speakers especially for a tablet. The sound was loud and crystal clear. Movies look absolutely gorgeous even on this model which DOES NOT have the retina display. Since I stream movies through Netflix and Amazon I felt it wasn't worth spending more money on extra hard drive space that wasn't going to get used. Games that I usually play on my iPhone work awesome on the Mini mostly due to the larger display. While some might like the bigger screen on the iPad, this one is just a tad smaller (1.8 inches to be exact) which in all honesty is plenty big in my opinion.

After all, do I really need a third iPad?  There was a decent sale at the time and I decided to go for it and I have not regretted the purchase for one minute.Overall, the features, speed, front and rear camera, etc. are very comparable to its larger counterparts, however it is available in this smaller, more lightweight, compact and easier to carry mini form.  I find that taking this with me on a business or personal trip makes the bag much lighter and for equivalent features.  Taking photos with this product is much less awkward looking too than when i see people posing for the full size iPads (I still can't bring myself to do this).  I would say size wise, it is about 70% of the full size iPad but this has no great impact on the ability to read emails or type any differently than the larger iPad.  The full size iPads almost seem too large now that I am accustomed to the compact mini.I don't want to get into all the features of the iPad overall as I have not noticed any differences between this and my other iPads.

I accessed my work desktop using Citrix Receiver and it worked great for reading email and other documents and impromptu typing. Sound quality was excellent as usual. The new power connector is easier to plug in. The battery life far exceeds than any other device I own except the Kindle Touch.The things that I thought could use some improvement were few but an annoying few.  WiFi performance is really lacking.  At home, at work and on travel the Wifi is really slow.  App downloads are horribly slow on connections I know to be fast.  I tried connecting at 5G also and it didn't make any improvement. Every once in a while I think the screen jitters.  It would be an artifact from the scree auto-rotating.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with some nice Apple earbuds. For the price I would have expected it. The power adapter is yet another Apple-proprietary connector.

Among those tablets were each generation of the larger iPads and even though those tablets kept managed to shed some weight they were still uncomfortable and awkward to hold.  Honestly, they caused me major neck strain and then my wallet started to hurt when I had to make multiple visits to the Chiropractor.So, this brings me to the iPad Mini which, should have been the answer to my problems with the larger iPads.  I'm not going to lie, it did correct the problems with the weight and size issues that much is true but, please allow me to explain the title with more detail below.PERFORMANCEThis is about on par with the iPad 2 or iPad 3 and that's really not surprising given the fact that internals are pretty much Identical to the 2nd Generation iPad 2 in a smaller package.  Overall, it is still pretty fluent and is more than capable of running some good graphics.BATTERY LIFEWell, this is a tough situation because the battery can go 10 hours in a perfect setting but, it can actually be as low as 6 hours under slightly compromising to severe conditions.  This will be explained a little more as we go on but for now, it is about an average performer in this area.CAMERASThe Front Facing Camera is a typical 1.3 MP Camera that pretty much is only used for Video Chat.  It isn't going to win any awards and is about on par with other tablets.The rear facing camera is pretty good but, not going to replace your point and shoot cameras and certainly isn't going to replace your DSLR cameras.  Overall, this is the one major upgrade from the iPad 2 as this camera is significantly better and is the same camera that was in the 3rd Gen iPad.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality is top notch and it is very tight overall.  The finish on the rear is nice and it appears to be pretty resistant to minor falls but, you'll need a case because the finish can scratch very easily.  Still, the build quality is the best part of the Tablet and it is top notch.SCREENOkay, In the larger iPad models, the screen has always been what set it apart from most of the competition.  With the iPad Mini, Apple shrank the screen and figured the increase in resolution would be enough to carry this over to the smaller model...  They were wrong!The display on the iPad Mini has actually been tested and it is one of the worst on a small tablet to hit the market!  I can vouch for this as the reflectance requires you to crank the brightness in well-lit rooms or it is unusable!  On top of that, reading on the tablet leaves the fonts edges smeared and the places where there should be spaces often run together (this makes cl look like a d at times).The power consumption is another issue because, cranking the brightness literally takes 40% of the batter life on any given day!  These are the circumstances where you only get about 6 hours of battery life.Amazon removed my link so I would encourage you to search John Gruber (John's wife says Eww about the display), Zach Epstein, CNET (CNET says to pass on the iPad Mini if you want it for reading, where have I heard that before), and Displaymate (Displaymate shows the reflectance issues, mentions competitions screens being noticeably sharper, and the covers the power issues)  for their views on the screen, I am not the only person who feels this way about the iPad Mini screen.  Marques Brownlee on youtube also compared the Nexus 7 and the iPad Mini and he came to a similar conclusion as well.CONCLUSSIONIf you really want this tablet, look for some type of screen protector that will reduce glare because it really is that bad.  If you're just looking for a smaller tablet that you can use, I recommend the Google Nexus 7 or the Amazon Kindle HD 7\" as the display, performance, and battery life will be far better on those tablets.  If you absolutely want an Apple iPad, grab the 4th Gen 9.7\" Model as it is far superior to the Mini.I personally went with the Nexus 7 and I'll be returning my iPad Mini in short order as it is a highly disappointing product.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this iPad, but the specifications could've been so much better.", "Author": "Learna21", "ReviewID": "R13T760E5A0SPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not an \"iSheep\", I'm not a total tech person and I don't prefer everything to be Apple, but they really do make premium products, and to be honest, I really like this tablet. It's the perfect size.. it isn't too small or too big. It's so much lighter and so much better looking that my previous ipad 3 which I ended up getting rid of just to get this. I bought this at Best Buy a few days ago and I love it! It runs so smoothly, and I can hold it up for a long time before it strains my wrist. It's so portable, I could carry it anywhere. The charger is less clunky.  The tablet is so smooth.. feels really nice. I like the smaller bezels, it gives so much more space. Why I love the Mini is because it's not too small, but it's not big either. It's almost the perfect reading device. I can also type easily.My biggest obvious complaint is that it has no Retina display. Yes, I know the second one will have Retina, but I really didn't want to wait to replace the heavier iPad 3. And truthfully, the screen's resolution isn't horrible, but it's a much better improvement from the ipad 2. However, looking at the Mini, you will notice text will be blurrier and you will see individual pixels if you are used to Retina. Had it had Retina and better specifications, I would've given it five stars. I can't complain, I chose to buy it. Plus, Apple seems to still be selling their iPad 2 for $399.

When the original iPad came out I purchased it, but later sold it because with having both an iPhone & a MacBook, I couldn't justify having another portable device - but the mini changes this. I absolutely love this smaller design, it is so much lighter & fits in one hand so it is so much easier & enjoyable to use and the way the edges are curved it just fits perfect in the hand. All of the full sized iPads (especially the latest Retina generation) are beautiful & wonderful, but if you're looking for something that's more comfortable in the hand where you don't have to constantly hold it with two hands or rest it against your legs because of the size & weight, the mini is your best bet. I now find that I use my iPad mini ALL THE TIME because it feels so right in my hands. Plus, since it's smaller it's much easier for me to slip in my purse & carry on the go.As with all iPad's I've used, it functions & performs just as beautifully. Of course, the mini doesn't have the power that the full sized iPads have, so if you're wanting to do graphic intensive games or videos, go with the full sized iPad. I have played lots of basic games & constantly stream videos all without a problem, but it may be an issue if you want to do graphic intensive games. I stream video from my iPad to my Apple TV daily (cuts cable!) and I've never had a problem with any lags or graphic problems (unless my wifi goes out...my wifi company is iffy & has been for years, but that's a whole different story).The only thing that would make this iPad mini perfect is if it had a Retina display. I know it is only a matter of time & we will (hopefully) see a retina display on the second generation iPad mini, but I really wish they could have done a retina display the first time around. Switching from my iPhone 5 to the mini I can definitely see a loss in the sharpness of text which is unfortunate since I love using my iPad mini for reading books. It's not a huge deal since everything still looks great & is more than useable (in fact, if you don't have any other Apple products with retina you probably won't know what I'm talking about), but if you're going from a retina display iPhone or iPad you really will notice the loss of quality.Overall, it's a great product & I highly recommend it!

After reading a previous review about receiving a used IPad Mini instead of a NEW one, I made sure to check it out completely by taking it out of the packing before giving it as a present.  I definitely think I got a refurbished IPad Mini and here are my thoughts on why:I watched a YouTube video on unboxing a new IPad Mini to see how an IPad Mini came packaged.  At first I noticed the box had a few dents but thought this was due to shipping.  Also the serial number on the back and all the bar codes seemed to be rubbed off and not easily visible to read (I still have my Ipad box after 2 years and the bar codes never smudged).  Next I noticed a lot of particles on the surface of the screen which is odd and the back of the IPad looked a little worn (not so silvery in a few spots).  When watching the YouTube video, I saw that there should be three papers included in the box, a card with all the buttons, an apple sticker, and some other information.  My box had no apple sticker and only one card.I turned the IPad one and it worked and was fully charged (Ipad\u2019s and Iphone\u2019s usually never come fully charged).  When I eventually gave it as the gift I set it up for my mom and it was not linked to anyone\u2019s account and turned on like new.To double check I searched the serial number on Apple\u2019s website and the Ipad Mini only had about 3 days left of phone support when it should have either 60 or 90 days (I forget the exact amount).I decided to keep the Ipad Mini and give it as a gift anyway as I don\u2019t think it would have been worth contacting the vendor and filing a claim however I am disappointed that it most likely was not a new Ipad Mini.  Also Apple does not sell these models in stores anymore as the Ipad Mini Retina is now available.My review is mostly to inform you to buy this product directly from Best Buy or any other electronic store if you can or order a used IPad instead of a new one.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Christmas present to my mom", "Author": "Fran", "ReviewID": "R1QMPXM8AZVM51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mom loves this gift we sent her.

I had toyed with getting a Nexus 7, but the Google Play Store just didn't have enough tablet specific apps. I owned an iPhone so I chose to stay within that ecosystem. The app selection for the iPad/iPad Mini is great. The non-retina display is not a concern for me. The display is still very good looking though. The size and weight feel great in your hands and is a great in-between of a smartphone and a laptop. I particularly like the aluminum back. It's cold to the touch when you first start using it, but then adapts to your hand temperature. It's solid hardware and feels very premium.Cons:Speaking of premium, the price. When I bought the iPad Mini in 2012, it was $330 and the processor was already a year behind at that point. The price point as of late 2013 is $299, with the new iPad Mini at a whopping $399. The hundred dollar difference between the 7.9 inch iPad Mini and the 9.7 inch iPad Air makes it difficult to decide. Especially since the new Nexus 7 is only $230 and Amazon Kindle Fire at $139. The processor is still OK, but it can lag on graphic intensive games. If you don't play much of those, you'll be fine. Movies, Youtube, etc all play extremely well.Rating: 5 out of 5.Recommended: Yes.

Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "RX3FK3E02GAZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every edition of iPad. Each one has had 64GB storage plus Wi-Fi. Each \"old\" iPad has been passed down to lawyers in my office where it has been an essential tool in our practice. In our office all of our computers, save one for very specific software reasons, are Macs. One of my associates has even bought his own Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION). Our phones are Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (White) - AT&T; and my own Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (Black) - AT&T;The effect of all of these iPads and OSX computers has been to take full advantage of iCloud and numerous critical apps such as Square, RocketMatter, Lexis Advantage, WD2Go, Dropbox, TrialPad and Sign My Pad. Our Mac office is essentially a model for Apple products as high end business tools in the legal profession.For the past several months I been constantly asked if I was ever going to acquire an iPad Mini. Until this past week, when I began to reconsider, my answer was emphatic-NO!A smaller iPad was not likely ever to serve as an everyday tool, one that could replace a laptop in many (but not all) situations. I have been critical of WiFi only iPads believing that by maintaining access to the Internet is critical when traveling, in WiFi free courthouses and opponents' law offices. I have also insisted on 64GB iPads believing that storage should never be an issue, particularly as we move into an era where FaceTime promises to reinvent video testimony.So what am I doing buying the lowest end iPad Apple sells? The answer is that not all users are created equal. Our office manager is uniquely involved in all aspects of the practice. She monitors my emails (and I might add she is my wife so this isn't as dangerous as it sounds), reviews accounting issues including billing and time keeping. At times she has simply taken my Apple iPad MD371LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, White) 3rd Generation when I get home for these uses instead of sitting with her Apple iMac MD093LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop (NEWEST VERSION) that is our home computer.The reality is she is primarily monitoring the life of our firm, not creating pleadings and doing trial prep. When this occurred to me, I realized that the smallest iPad mini was the best way to provide her with the same 24/7 access to the file server at the office (using WD2Go) that we all enjoy and need. On the other hand, she is unlikely to need a 4G LTE connection since most of her work is done either in the office or at home. That said, as I considered this, her Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (White) - AT&T; is a personal hotspot, a capacity which is useful for those moments Internet access is necessary but unavailable on with tablets or laptops. 16GBs is in fact a massive amount of storage for most purposes and users.The iPad mini is light and while offering less \"display real estate\" is as fully functional as its big brothers. I loaded it from my App Store account with the essential apps for her needs. If you are wondering about cost, the additional cost is zero at least for the number of iOS devices-four-now on my App Store account. For those who would consider buying a cheaper non-iOS tablet, the costs of apps can be significantly more than the price differential between the iPad mini and smaller Droid tablets.While the iPad mini does not offer Retina Display like my new iPad, none of the older iPads my associates use do either.

Plus you can load all your previous iTunes purchases, including movies, to the iPad mini. If you use iTunes and have purchases thru iTunes, the kindle WILL NOT allow sharing of any of all those iTunes media files. Only the iPad will. Battery last an amazing long time. Much longer than the old 11\" iPad's. Probably because it is smaller and uses less energy? Uses the newer apple plug. Same connector as the iPhone 5. Charges with the same smaller apple usb-cube power wall charger. Comes with the same power cube as the iPhones come with. No special high powered cube, as does the larger 11\" iPads require and came with. What a treat to use. I sold my iPad 3 for the same price as this mini costs, so I broke even. Plus, the old iPad 3 included ATT cell service. This iPad was the only wifi version. What to do? Get the ATT hotspot, nearly free and same monthly fee, and use this mini with the hotspot. Plus, hotspot allows multiple wifi devices to tap into the wifi hotspot, where as the built-in cell service on the iPad-3 only supplied cell service to that one device, your iPad -3.Save a lot by getting the iPad-mini wifi version, PLUS a hotspot. Best of all worlds. Much more functionality. Same fees.Don't let only one device hog your cell service, share it with a hotspot to all your iDevices (as well as all your non-apple wifi devices).PS. If you want your iPad mini NOW, this price is not that bad.And it was in stock.And shipping with prime was excellent.Just compare what other non-apple supply sources/stores are asking, like HSN or ShopNBC.

I also do notice a difference in speed. I think what is slowing me down is my router and possibly having too many things connecting to it. Unfortunately, I Lso find that I have a hard time connecting sometimes and sometimes the screen freezes and does ot let me do anything. This does not happen at regular times or during specific times, but seems to occur randomly. I recently was unable to connect to the app store, though I had full internet access, etc. after about fifteen minutes I was able to connect. I do not know what happened or what changed. I still think the keyboard is too small for me, but I have large hands and nobody else in the family seems to be complaining. Maybe I would do better if I got to use it more. I did see someone with a kindle fire and with nly a short look at it, I think the mini blows it away.....thought I like that the kindle has the sd card slot......if I find anything else worth noting I will update my review. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Ok, so here's the thing, I have an iPad and a second generation iPad. My wife wanted the mini, so I bought it for her.....I just ordered a second one for me! I really like it more than the others. While it is significantly smaller, almost half the size, the actual screen size is comfortable and does not feel small. The borders are narrower than the full sized iPad, so the actual screen size is 4 13/16\" x 6 3/8\". The screen itself is very sharp and clear, and I feel like I'm 20 years younger (or at least my eyes feel that way). I wish I could say the same for the video quality. I take off a full star for that. Indoor quality with good lighting is mediocore at best (I wonder if something is wrong with mine?). Very grainy playback. I'm not impressed....I have not been able to play this on one of my HDTV's, perhaps it will show better, but I doubt it. My cell phone takes better video. I don't think I can be very happy about it, and I find it very hard to believe that this records at full HD, 1080p. If there is a way to tweak it, I wouldn't know because (here comes complaint number 2) it doesn't come with a user guide! No paper guide and no tutorial app (really, apple? There's so much new stuff, and no app, nothing???). I shouldn't have to search online or go to the apple store for information on how to maximize the use of my tablet.That should complete my complaints.....though you might hear a little more later. Now for the good stuff.... This thing is light! Two fingers light. The screen is also very bright and does a good job resisting finger prints. The LED Backlit display is crisp when viewing images and video that are actually made in good quality. The screen resolution looks much better than my second generation, but that's kind of an optical illusion I guess. They say the resolution is the same for both, so it must just look better because the screen is smaller. Here are some more stats:FaceTime camera: 1.2 mp photos and 720p video.iSight Camera: 5mp photo and 1080p video; f2.4 aperture; video stabilization; tap to focus and control exposure.Browsing is speedy, but honestly, I don't see much difference between my 2 and this. Viewing pages are fine and everything looks normal and sharp. Pages come up quickly and scroll fast. Zooming is also quick. I LOVE that you can multitask! Updating apps occurs in the background.Lots of great app, including photo and video editing and FaceTime, but for me, the reason to order a second one is Siri. Yup, that wonderful little digital assistant who will do anything for you...well, just about. I didn't know how much I needed Siri until I started to use it. I can now make appointments on the fly, make reminders, and organize my life in a way that was not previously known to me. This is THE best way for me to deal with so many different appointments, reminders, etc.. The sad part is that now I know I need an iPhone, as well! The children love the novelty of Siri, but I find it to be probably the most useful technology for me. It will be life-changing for me.....as long as I continue to use it. It will be so nice to finally be organized. Along with Siri is the ability to dictate message, etc. Just hold the microphone icon down for a second and start talking. I think that it is in need of some real sophistication, e.g. dragonspeak type quality. It will not place punctuation, and needs to be trained (I don't know how to do it yet, as I am still searching to see if that is even possible) to get better accuracy. An unofficial test estimates 70% or so accuracy, sometimes better if I speak slowly and there is no backround noise.The sound is also very good. Very clear. Not that loud, but then, you can't expect room filling sound....still, it is very acceptable. No complaints there. The only problem is with the lightning connector. I will have to buy an adaptor to connect the mini to all of my docks/speaker systems/etc. That's another thirty or forty dollars depending on which adaptor I decide to get.If you are looking for the user guide, go to the applestore and click on userguide, sorry, you're stuck, that's the only way. You would think they would include it in the iBooks app! I mean, really? How hard would that have been?I can't tell you if this is better or worse the the Kindle Fire because I have never seen one. If I find someone who has one I will do a full comparison. But for me, I think I need the technology that Siri offers (that's why I ordered the second one). If Kindle Fire has something similar, I am unaware of it, and will likely kick myself. :-) If you have any questions, I check for comments every couple of days.

It is pretty much practically new (though I only can speak for myself, others may have gotten iPads in worse conditions). I don't see any damages on mine and it works fine. If you want a brand spanking new and NOT PREVIOUSLY OWNED then don't buy from sellers on amazon. The iPad I have was bought roughly three months ago and my guess is the previous owner did not want it and sold it to one of these sellers you see here. I don't think these sellers can guarantee that the iPad is fully functional with nothing wrong with it but that it looks new and wasn't used for very long. I still have 9 months left on the warranty and the technical support is almost up in a few days this month. I don't know how iPads are packaged but it seemed to be packaged nicely though I can tell it was not brand spanking new from the box. The serial number and more stuff on the back looked smudged and the box was slightly bent at the corners. At first I attributed that to the shipping but it wouldn't look like that through shipping alone. I just want everyone to know what they're buying. If you can afford to buy it here then I suggest you go to apple and purchase a new one even with the tax. It's worth it I promise you. If you don't mind buying a previously owned iPad mini that is like new then by all means. I bought from iPadShop btw and it was fulfilled by amazon not that really means anything it just ships from an amazon fulfillment center instead of directly from the seller and I doubt they really check what they're getting but it just gave me peace of mind that if I did end up getting a lousy iPad atleast I felt that amazon would be held accountable for it. :) Anyway good luck shoppers and savers. <3", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useful and Convenient", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2PWSC4DH4HSAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad mini is an excellent little tablet. I use it every day and it works flawlessly.Pros:-Battery life is very, very satisfying. 9-10 hours as promised.-Light and compact. I can hold it for long periods without getting fatigued.-It just works. Apps work as advertised. Everything operates smoothly. Some juts or pauses every so often but nothing to get you frustrated (unlike my Galaxy Nexus).-Brightness. The screen can really pump out a bright image in direct sunlight or as a flashlight in the dark.-Premium feel. I almost always keep a case on it, but when I take it off I can really appreciate just how lavish the metallic finish and sturdy build feel in my hands. It really is a premium tablet that you wanna show off, as opposed to the new galaxy tabs that look like giant plastic phones.-Perfect size for media consumption. I read the news and watch videos daily, surf tumblr, Facebook, etc. The size just feels right for all of it.-Fantastic speakers. The bass won't \"boom\", but sound is clear and VERY loud for the size of the tablet. Easily fill a small room with ambience.Cons:-Screen resolution. It's alright with iOS 6. But I have the iOS 7 beta, which everyone gets in fall. The font is much slimmer and therefore looks VERY pixelated and jagged. They may change it before the official release but I doubt it as it's a huge part of the system overhaul. I'm still waiting for the retina mini.-iPhone-only apps that aren't specifically made for iPad look like crap. They don't show them in retina resolution, but pre-iPhone 4 QVGA blown up. It looks terrible. The only workaround I found is jailbreaking and downloading Retinapad, which forces the apps into retina resolution. They look great after doubling the pixels.-The usual apple limitations. No direct music download, no SD slot, limited customization. Here aren't really downfalls of the mini, just apple's devices as a whole.Overall I love my iPad. Like I said, I have the iOS 7 beta and I know everyone will love this little tab even more when that rolls out. Better notification drawer, intuitive multitasking (no more little X's to repeatedly tap!), quick controls, it's all boss. I highly recommend it.

The Ipad Mini maintains the full functionality of any other Ipad and can download an run any application the Ipad runs. It is convenient that it has the same application base built with reliable apps.The machine runs smooth. It hasn't really glitched or froze on me in the month I have had it so far. It runs video very smoothly, and is very responsive. It connects to the internet with no problems over a wi-fi connection.

I also get most of my recipes online/pinterest and off the internet so I wanted something small that I could transport easily through the house to the kitchen, rather than lugging my laptop from room  to room.  I did some homework by reading reviews on the biggest selling mini tablets:  Kindle Fire HD, Nexxus 7 inch tablet, Ipad Mini, and the Nook.  It came down to two...the Kindle Fire and Ipad Mini.  Since the Fire got great reviews by almost everyone, and was 130. cheaper for apparently better visuals and sound, I ordered the Fire so that I could have it in time for our holiday travels.  I loved the Fire's display and sound, but as I was watching an Amazon video, I noticed how heavy and thick it was, and was annoyed by the fact that it had almost a one inch margin around the edges of the screen (reducing the screen display area).  I read that was because of the speaker hardware inside the tablet.  The Android system also annoyed me.  It's just not as straight forward as the i0S system. I decided to go to Best Buy to get a hands on view of each device (so should have done that to begin with)  I immediately fell in love with the Mini Ipad's looks and feel and visuals looked great to me.  I figured the sound would be ok since it was an Apple Product and I didn't want a sound machine anyway.  I regretted buying the Fire and decided to return it and order the Ipad.  I have absolutely no regrets.  I can have the Kindle App and access to Amazon, I can get the Amazon streaming videos with Prime (not a big deal since their video selection is lame) And all of the Apple apps I have grown used to with my iphone.  What I like best:-The Mini is much lighter and delightfully thin.  I can hold it forever without noticing the weight.-Unless I did a side by side comparison on display and sound, I notice no real difference.-7.9 size is perfect.  The Fire is smaller and narrower in comparison and when I read I want as much width as I can get without being bulky.  Also, the screen goes out almost to the edges of the tablet with slightly larger margins on top and bottom, which just makes more sense and makes a big difference in how much display you get to see at one time without having to enlarge.-More straight forward and user friendly in my opinion than Android system.-Sound is just right for most things.  Not a sound machine, but still sounds great and will play a tune without tinny sound and videos are loud enough for anyone except maybe those with significant hearing loss.  My son made a comment on the fact that the sound is surprisingly good for a small tablet.  I read that the sound is an improvement over older Ipads anyway...stereo sound.-Extemely portable.-Since I got it, I haven't used my laptop and probably won't unless I need to do alot of internet surfing or typing.-The Fire in comparison is thick, bulky, heavy with smaller screen size.-I just love it.  If I'm going to spend more money on a small tablet I want to be completely happy with the product and I am.  It's worth the extra 130.00.  I don't know why Amazon sells it for over 400. I got it through Apple at 329.00.-The size is perfect and just what I wanted in a mini tablet.  Not too narrow.What I don't like or wish was better:-It wouldn't hurt to be comparable to the Fire in sound quality or display but really I don't care at this point. Its good. If a better version comes out next year I think I'll still be content with this item.-Its so thin and smooth you will want a case to keep it from slipping off of things.*Also the battery life is impressive.  Reviews speculated approx 10 hours of usage.  On my first charge I got over 15 hours of usage (which included a lot of internet surfing and video watching) and on my second charge I already have over 5 hours of usage and 62% battery charge left.  This will help me conserve battery charge on my iphone.  Oh!

I Chose the wifi only model figuring I would tether to my iPhone when I wanted to use the web away from a wifi connection.As soon as I turned on the mini I was sold.1. Much easier to hold. A good portable device between the small iPhone 5 and the full size iPad.2. The display is better than the 2nd gen iPad thanks to the smaller screen, yet easy to read and good detail for apps ment for the iPads. Note that there is a magnifying capability for iPhone apps that gives a small display full screen display.3. Typing is easy as the keys are spaced apart and large enought for touch typing.4. Believe it or not the mini fits easly into to the side pocket of my vest when housed in a Roocase filo cover. Try to do that with the larger tablets.I spent several hours at Apple's AppStore building a library of iPad apps, most which we're free.  I also purchased apps for using Excel, Word, PDFs and found these worked very well when converting files I placed in iCloud. Reading the converted documents is easy as the print on the mini is large and clear enough not to cause eye strain.A couple of disappointments:1. Teathering to the iPhone 5 is simple, but I found that I use the mini more and more now for web search, texting , etc. and the iPhone 5 primarily for phone calls. A result is i now know that I should have purchased the mini with the cell option. Not a fault of the mini.2. Without the cell networking option, apps that use your location do not work, even when connected to wifi or teathered to the iPhone. This was a disappointment as mini will make a great GPS screen when driving. It also means that apps  that \"find\" your device won' t work either - I should have thought of this.3. Third party accessories are slow coming to the market. If the accessory uses the lighting connector it probably won't be seen until early 2013. I have also found that cases with keypads are slow coming on the market. The top brand protective cases such as Zagg and Clamcase have yet to release their promised cases.Would like to see: A mini with cell phone connectivity, i. e. a smart phone option. Why some of the smart phone manufacturers have not offered this would be an interesting article.Recomendation: My Windows PC has not been started since the mini arrived. After a month of using the mini without the cell network option, I have ordered one with cell networking. When I get it will probably write a review and if the cell networking works like the larger iPad it will get five stars.Sandbox 2", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product but easily broken.", "Author": "Jalynn \"Jalynn\"", "ReviewID": "R2PNUJDBQ507YG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first Ipad purchased was a black 32 mg mini.  I bought it at the Apple store because it cost much less than here and my name was engraved free.  I really like this mini. I can put it in my handbag and take it with me without needing a big bag to put it in.  I purchased the leather case sold on amazon to go with it as the magnetic case from apple is not much good.  Pretty useless actually.I am glad I waited on this mini as downloads and playing games going to FB or wherever is so easy.  I gave this a five because I really like this product.Update:OK, so I dropped it on the floor.  I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right.  Here are the steps for repair.  You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple.  Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair.  I say ok.  I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass.  They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired.  I call apple care.  They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things.  After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it.  I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back.  I said for what.  You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple.  The moral to this story is forget their repair center.  IT STINKS!  I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait.  That would have been a lot easier.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not perfect but it suits my current needs", "Author": "SH", "ReviewID": "R2JOCWV89GY850", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reasons I used to choose the iPad mini. I put my specific needs above buying the biggest and the brightest. The following are what I thought was important for me, it may not be for you.As much as I wanted the retina display, the larger sized iPad was simply too big for me to regularly take outside the house - I made that mistake with buying a too big, too heavy laptop once. But the mini, at 7inches, is big enough to watch movies, read books and magazines on my couch and bed with ease. Those who think a smartphone or ipod does the same thing, are mistaken, even at 7inch, a tablet makes the world of difference - I typed this review on my iPad, I would still be typing if I had used my phone.  If you have never experienced the quality of the retina display, you probably will not miss it here. The thing is solidly build as you would expect from an apple product; the speakers do pack a punch, you can literally feel the air coming out.As for choosing apple over android or windows 8. The need for the use of flash (a deal-breaker for me when the first iPad came out) has lessened substantially, as HTML 5 is now the go to standard for web pages.  Even though I'm a PC user,  I am familiar with apps via my iPod touch. The amount and more importantly, the quality of apps in the apple eco system are far superior to the ones on android. although the novelty has somewhat worn off on the appeal of my impulse buying of apps, it's still a major reason for buying a tablet. Take for example - my optimum cable iOS app, it is so far superior to its android cousin, it's hard to believe that it was written for the same product. Based on my experiences with dubious apps in the (for better or worse) largely unsupervised google play store, via my Samsung Galaxy, there is an advantage to being part of the paternal Apple market. Although, I expect this to change dramatically, the next couple of years, Windows isn't even on the same planet, in terms of app selection.  If you need to multitask, are price conscious, or simply despise Apple, the Android based kindle fire HD or nexus, with their better screen quality, may be for you.I bought the 16 gig version, using the extra $$ to buy 4G capability instead, to take advantage of the growing options of cloud computing when I travel. If you have kids and travel a lot with and without them, or for business, you should seriously consider the 4G option, as ubiquitous, free, reliable Wifi, like flying cars, has yet to be a reality. If you get the wifi only version, don't have an iPod, but still can't live without your stored media, you probably should consider 32 gigs minimum, especially if you don't get the 4G. The other issue of Verizon CDMA vs AT&T;'s GSM network, is a whole other story. One slight peeve. The \"lighting fast\" connector looks nicer than the older one but it's clearly a money making device (apple could have finally accepted the virtually USB standard but why give your loyal customers the option of using a ubiquitous $10.00 cable, when you can charge triple times that, if you need a replacement) Mine still does not charge my iPad, when connected to my \"older\" (30 month old computer,) I  have to do so from a wall outlet.Long story short, I've had mine for a few days, with no regrets. Yes, the retina display will be tempting but is not worth waiting months for on the mini. Life is short.

I had heard about the iPad mini and decided to go to a store to look at one. After picking it up for the first time, I was sold. It is incredibly light! It just felt so much less bulky than any other iPad I'd had and bonus for the first time ever I can just slip it in my purse instead of having to have a bigger messenger bag on days when I wanted to take my iPad out with me.As for versus the high resolution displays, to be honest I have an anti-glare screen protector on all of my iPad so at the end of the day it makes no difference. I can watch a movie or read a book or send and email quite comfortably. To me this is what I never knew I always wanted in my iPad, and I do just love it.As for the price, I do think it should have been price 10% lower to give it the solid under $300 mark on the 16GB. For me though I like iOS, I've tried android and it just wasn't for me. Android devices in many cases are also quality but at the end of the day I always say try both and figure out what you like best.

I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Seller and Product!!!", "Author": "L", "ReviewID": "R1E24CE4HMD80V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This seller is trusted and highly recommended!!!

I loved it mainly because I could download all these wonderful syntheziers, and music applications. I would occassionally use it at a restaurant when eating dinner, or while waiting at the DMV or soemthing like that. Sometimes it came in handy at home if I didn't want to turn on my computer and watch youtube videos. But this is not an iPad 2 review, sorry. But I was not using that much because it was heavy, and bulky. I would put it in my backpack, and after awhile that would get old. So I wanted to get this smaller tablet, which is really what I wanted to begin with.Immediately after trying it, I realised I had made a good move of selling my iPad 2. It was a joy to use, and I found myself enjoying configuring it, and downloading apps just like the old days when I would configure my old computers. I have at least tripled the amount of time using it, because it's so handy.Now there are some slight compatibility issues with apps designed for iPad. Mainly they have to do with not being able to read the really fine print on some of the synthesizer apps. Once I figure out what those virtual knobs and buttons are for it's not a problem. Sometimes it will be difficult to tap on a really small button. Hopefully developers will quickly adopt and come up with iPad mini optimized apps, but that's not really a big deal, I just need glasses, and a stylus. I think it would be a good idea for Apple to sell a stylus with it at a discount to make up for this slight inconvenience.The display looks nicer, because I believe it's more pixels per square inch, so scrunching all those images down makes it look like a high end 7\" tablet. Also I'm glad they made it this size, that's well thought out. If it were a smaller 7\" tablet it would be too difficult to use. At 7.8 inches or so it's perfect. I would not recommend everyone going out and selling your iPad 2 to get this, but if you don't have an iPad yet, and are looking for something more affordable, or more compact than an iPad 2, or iPad 3 etc, then this is a great option to have. I'm not sure how many of these have sold, but I would not be surprised if it were a hit, and a retina version came out. As far as improvements that they could make, I am mainly interested in a faster CPU, and a MicroSD slot.  Also, I had some accessories like the Line 6 Mobilekeys 25 keyboard that used the old 30 pin cord. So I will have to buy an adapter.

I edited it a bit:  First of all I would like to thank all of those people who wrote the reviews that guided me to find the perfect tablet:) I had changed my mind many a times, first from android then to Apple's iPad 2,etc... But finally, I was sold on an Android. Asus Tf300. It was perfect, it had a big screen, fluid and responsive. It would be perfect for my note taking as a student. It was light, and had a secure rubbery back. Wonderful! But then......  (Insert dramatic Phantom of the Opera piano playing. Horrified gasps! Scream! Get the smelling salts! Faint! Oh no!) Well, here is where my review gets useful, hopefully. My mom suggested that I reconsider the iPad mini. She felt it was the best size for me to be transporting to my classes.  First of all, I bought it direct from Apple with engraving. When we purchased it right before Christmas, Apple seemed to have the lowest price at $329 for the most basic model. I got a white, 16gb iPad mini. I also bought it with the smart cover, which is overly priced. However,it really is ingenious and it folds into a stand that I use while reading an e-book. I absolutely loved the device at first sight! It is fluid, I love the screen etc...! I know I have no experience on Retina anything, but the screen really is pretty good!(but you might notice some pixilation on white screens or when you're reading, but it really doesn't bother me.) I really like reading on it on the NOOK reader/app.(I know some of you like the Kindle. I just got the NOOK app because for Christmas I recieved a $25 Barns&Noble; gift card.)Over all, I absolutely love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love it!!!!!!! I am sorry if this did not help you at all.I see you going \"wack-o\"! Don't deny it.[Mother's note: The screen is large enough to comfortably view/edit photos and videos. The screen is the size of a paper back book page. The photo quality is better than expected. It feels and looks like a high quality product. Our elderly,yet hip, neighbor is so impressed, she's going to buy one instead of getting a laptop. If you have an iPhone you will easily know how to opperate this device.

I, myself, have tried the Android phones and tablets but have come back to Apple for two main reasons: Consistency and Quality,I have always wanted an iPad but the cumbersome and awkward size was always the turn off to me. I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS! I cannot say enough good things about it; it's the quality hardware and software Apple is known for. I can always count on my iPad Mini to work and do so like it did the first time, never slowing down.So...

I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small but powerful", "Author": "Leonardo Dugarte", "ReviewID": "R2MUZQGQ6271RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Talk about Apple products is to talk about excellence, innovation, design, simplicity, utility.

This iPad mini easily slips into a purse or jacket pocket making it easy to carry around for either a female or male.  You get all of the perks of the regular iPad with the extra benefit of being able to carry it around with you everywhere.  Simply amazing!I love my iPad and use it more than any other electronic devise but I mourned its lack of portability.  The iPad's size is great for watching tv, movies, reading books or light document work but a hassle to carry around.  I had to dig out my huge purse to carry it around anywhere and the weight and size was cumbersome.  This iPad mini is slimmer, lighter and smaller and oh so convenient to take with me when I leave the house.The smaller size does impact my document usage but since I use it mostly for entertainment, this is really minor for me but will affect those who use the iPad for work.  I keep hearing the iPad mini lacks the same power (slower processor) as the iPad but I don't feel it.  I've played games on it, watched videos, etc. without any noticeable difference.  Maybe power is an issue with heavy document usage?  I did deduct a half star for the lower screen resolution than the newest iPad while keeping the price tag around $350.  Seriously?  The lower resolution is not so much apparent on iTunes purchases but more visible on home video or other sourced digital media.How does Apple seduce me into wanting their newest product (although, I'm proud so say I avoided their siren's call for the iPhone 5) and after using it, making it the newest best thing I cannot live without?  Husband says it makes the regular iPad positively clunky and almost archaic but I think it's more sinister - it makes me appreciate the iPad for home use and the iPad mini for away-from-home use.  Great, now I've used up my gift allowance for all of 2013....but you won't find me complaining this Christmas, birthday or anniversary because the iPad mini is worth it!Overall, if you can splurge this is the one thing you really want to spend your money on.

However, the computer got uncomfortably warm and thus was not ideal for using in a sofa. She loves her iPad Mini. I no longer have to worry about viruses, updates rebooting the system, \"your computer is too slow\" errors on Skype... And a touch interface is certainly a lot more intuitive for people not too familiar with computers.A few of the bad things about this are:-Since it's small, my mother sometimes have to press several times on onscreen buttons until it activates. I guess at least for native apps they could have adjusted the size of the buttons so they remain as easy to press as in a big iPad.-No ability to download music directly to the device to the Music app... Unless you purchase it on iTunes.

Everything else gets slimmer and cooler and thankfully the ipad mini has been redesigned from the ground up to be the slim sleek product apple is known for.

If they had matched the specs of the larger ipad OR charged less to better match the pricing of other 7\" tablets I'd have one right now.  Yes it is true I do not own a mini, but I have owned an ipad 2 and played around with my coworkers mini.The following are from my brief use of my coworkers mini and so this is not an in depth or long term insight on this product, but I think many of the points are valid.PROS:-Size, weight, thin profile - all considered standard on most apple products.-Lightning connector... it's true they have hosed everyone with their new connector but their old standard 15-pin was becoming dated... too large and not reversible.-OS is streamlined and comfy, those that own apple products are at home and folks that are not tech savvy are more comfortable with this OS-Tons of appsCONS:-Pricing considering that android competition is selling at $199-OS is limiting. No where near the customization available to android users.-Stereo speakers are welcome, but not when they are placed one inch apart, come on apple...-Itunes is a pain (not as bad as Microsoft, but still cumbersome at times)COMMENTS:-People keep stating NFC is a con.. it's an apple, get over it. buy an android product-People complain about lack of Retina display.  Get over it, the pixel size is still comparable with the ipad 2 and the goal was portability, not pixel density.INNOVATION:I think apple would benefit from incorporating GPS into every product they sell and then offering free 3G for all location services, no email, no internet, BUT free location updates for all those apps that rely on location services.  Maybe your comments won't post until you get home (or a free wifi location), but you would get the benefits of integrated gps for accurate navigation and location info.

It pays to be an Amazon Prime Member!!!! You get the best deals, no hassles on returns, you have 30 days to return something, and if you have a problem, all you have to do is call them!! I love the ease and the customer service!!! I've yet to have any kind of issue with Amazon!!! For this whole package, it said 2-3 days max for delivery!! It was here the next night at 5pm!! I was shocked!!!! But, it was here and that's what I love about Amazon!!! They ROCK!!! Now reviewing all the books I've bought for my Kindle, I'll try to get to them!!! LOL I already have tons of books, and every single day I get BookBub in my Email and it's the books on sale or FREE books!!! Amazing....I love them!!! I do most of my shopping on Amazon and because I'm a Prime Member, I don't pay for shipping. I hate going to Malls...you get better prices on here for Bluray movies, electronics, kids toys, and shipping is free as long as it's a Prime item. I've talked enough!!

What a difference buying it made.  Imitators never seem to make a product that can do what Apple can do (but I'm still a PC believer.). 2 years ago I bought a BB Playbook because I had a BB phone.  I soon learned BB had over promised. App development was lacking.  Same thing with the Amazon Fire I brought a year later. I had high hopes for their Fire HD but alas the apps I needed weren't available for the Fire HD. I also heard the $50 annual 4G connection was only good for the 1st year after that AT&T; would charge outrageous rates to keep the 4G connection. Seems like the critical apps I needed were only being developed for Apple IOS.  I checked used pricing and was amazed that even broken Apples were going for what a new true Android went for. That speaks well for Apples resale value. I've had my mini for a week now and I'm not sorry it's soooo much better.  I chose the mini because I prefer the 7.9\" size over a 10\" model.

I can say from experience, as I have all of the three other items as well ... It is not fair to classify this item as either.Yes, it is true it is an intermediate size in between the 4-5 inch Touch-Phone and the 9 inch Pad. But with exception to certain other characteristics, it is for a class of its own. The pod/phone can't really be considered feasible for VIDEO Entertainment. For that the PAD is the only really feasible unit.Now, if I already have the big pad, why would I go for the mini as well, ... In summary .... Portability .... Plain and simple. I take it and stick it in my back or side pocket of the 24-7's or the inner pocket of a jacket .... And it is like unnoticeable. That's one thing I couldn't do with my regular IPad.Would I prefer the mini to the regular ... For communications and browsing and book reading ( for which I consider the 4/5 inch Pod and Phone way too small) sure, it is fine. But I still hold on to my IPad 2 for video entertainment, because, as Jobs put it, \"for that purpose, anything less than a 10\" unit is too small.\".For regular users, I suggest a SCREEN PROTECTOR, and a HARD CASE, preferably with screen cover as well.But in summary, a highly recommended item...

Things I enjoyed about the iPad mini: perfect size in my opinion, easy to set up and use, wide availability of apps and accessories, Amazon app available, nice email interface, bluetooth capable, clear high quality display. The things I didn't like about this device:1. Moving files from a computer to the iPad mini has to be done via iTunes, you can't just copy over a folder of music or videos which is do-able just not as easy as on Android based devices2. Price is quite a bit more than other 7\" tablets, but the screen is actually 8\" and for an Apple product, I'd say a pretty good value3. Keyboard has no tracing or 'swype' like abilities which makes typing cumbersome without a keyboard.4. App store makes you give a password for every single app you download (even the free ones)5. As an e-reader, I'd chose one of the paper-white options over this, but it works fine for reading.6. Its not a laptopThe last reason is my primary justification for returning the device. For a tablet it does what it is suppose to do. But I found myself still preferring to use my small laptop as multitasking is so much easier. I'd say if you really like using apps or playing games or simple web browsing, a tablet is the way to go. I personally found that for me the full computing power of a laptop is worth the extra weight/size, especially given the cost of this device (i.e., you can buy a small laptop for the cost of the iPad mini). However, if you like tablets, you will find this one a good option.

To be clear I am writing this review on a fourth generation iPad, so I'm not a hater, but I do think Apples prices aren't justified with their hardware.  I am an AT&T; rep who has ample time to use the mini and formulate an opinion about it.  Simply put the screen is garbage.  \"Every inch an iPad,\" is Apples tag line for the device and I must say, no, it's not.  The iPad I'm using has a truly beautiful screen, that only until recently has been able to compete with.  The mini does not.  Now this is what's true about Apple.  They do not care about the end user.  They don't.  Or else ere would be A RETINA DISPLAY ON THE IPAD MINI.  If they can put it Retina on their phone and their full size iPad then seriously. The second generation will have it for sure, by why make their very loyal and sometimes crazy customer base go through with this?  I guess it's because they can.

There are so many tablets to pick from. There are tablets by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Nexus, Windows, etc. There are so many different choices, so many different brands. Every single tablet is different. But what tablet is better? How do you know which one to buy? Some like Window products other like Apple products more. Each and every single person is different but there is one iPad that fits all. I believe the iPad Mini is probably the best choice of all, it perfect for everyone. Why should you buy the Apple iPad mini? Well Apple is a very well known company all across the globe. They have created some of the best computers, laptops, created the iPod and the iPhone. Who does not love Apple products? They have the best and most advanced technology. Apple does not let you down, it meets all the expectations, and you will be surprised with what you can do with their products. Mostly everyone has an Apple product these days; personally in my family we own eight Apple products, in which the iPad mini is one. We are very happy with all our Apple products from our laptop and PC to our iPods and iPad. We can say that Apple has not let us down with any of their products we have bought and I know probably many out there agree with us. Why is the iPad mini perfect? First of all the iPad mini is the perfect size, it is not bulky at all. It is only 5.28 inches by 7.87 inches and it is 0.28 inches thick. It can easily be carried in your purse or in you backpack and it won't weigh anything at all. It is also perfect for all college students out there, you can easily take notes with the iPad mini and will never have to worry about forgetting or buying a notebook, so the iPad mini helps you save trees. The iPad mini is also perfect for your children; you can download games, TV shows, or movies. Its perfect for them to use any day, and very perfect for when going on a road trip you can play a movie, give them headphones and make it a peaceful ride where your child wont be bored and start bothering you. The iPad mini is perfect for anyone out there, no matter what it needs to be used for. The iPad mini also has a great camera, which takes very nice pictures. And iPad minis are also starting to be used in schools, which as you can see iPad minis are starting to be used mostly everywhere, why not have one of your own. The iPad mini will make you happier. You can download movies, books, its also can have Wi-Fi. Having an iPad mini will make you very happy, you don't have to carry around bulky books anymore, and you can easily download more then one book on your mini iPad. The iPad mini changes your life, it makes you more modern, and you become more technological. The whole world is becoming more technological, might as well buy an iPad mini and keep up. In conclusion, I believe the iPad mini is the best choice of table. Its produced by a very well known company all around the world. It has the latest technology and it fits all your needs and your families. The iPad mini is very family oriented its perfect for your toddlers to your college students. It perfect for everyday use, for school, and for work.

Of course it's not bad quality, just not clear like I had expected.Besides that, it's great, convenient, fast, has fantastic sound, beautiful crystal clear screen and really, really, really fun!!!!!!

I immediately tried to cancel the item, but was unable to. Then after reading reviews about issues people were having regarding the product arriving used, I wanted to cancel it even more and continued trying up to two days after ordering. Again, unsuccessful.It was also eligible for Amazon Prime and was supposed to arrive within two days. I ordered on Wednesday afternoon and said it was expected (not guaranteed as with all other Prime orders) to arrive by Monday at 8 PM. It's Monday at 8:30 PM and there's still no iPad mini here. It was supposed to be a Mother's Day gift that I planned to give yesterday. Also, with tracking info, it says the item was shipped and is in transit, but there's no tracking info. I put in my tracking number on USPS and the only thing it shows is that the item was given to the shipping partner in KY.I'm still waiting... I'll post an update if/when it comes. I already spoke with an Amazon rep who told me they could give me a full refund if the item doesn't arrive and or arrives used (instead of new, as listed).

We take lengthy road trips roughly once a month for fun (more frequently when the weather is nice). And we like to do take these lengthy trips with our three year old, whose patience for the third drive to Canada in one year is...not super good.Enter: iPad Mini, ultimate toddler entertainment device.My son started off as a wee little pudgeball using my iPad 2, and I noticed that he and the iPad had an unnatural connection. The predicable nature of iOS and sensitive touchscreen were easy for his baby brain to puzzle out with trial and error, and the many restriction options allowed me to lock him out of most things he shouldn't get into. He was better at using the thing than I was within weeks, and when that iPad met an untimely death on a concrete floor, we decided to get our son one of his own. The iPad Mini is a much smaller, sleeker device that fits chubbular fists quite easily - a perfect size for children.Armed with a suite of educational apps and Curious George episodes, our son and the iPad have now driven thousands of miles and visited several countries. The battery life lasts us most of a day without being plugged in (and that's with constant video playback). It has quieted innumerable tantrums while on the road in the middle of the Cascades and on the most hideously boring stretch of road known as I5 in southern California. I expect it will also survive our upcoming six hour flight quite nicely.On a less child-oriented level, the screen looks great and the slender device is a pleasure to behold. The white one looks a bit cheaper than the black one, in my opinion, but that's all rather subjective. The software is fast and responsive. The touchscreen is a delight.Note for parents who might want to grab one of these for their children: iOS7 now defaults to showing ALL videos you've ever bought in the video library, including those you haven't downloaded. You can turn this option off in the settings. If you don't want a frustrated child without WiFi trying to download your copy of Dredd 3D, you should really make sure to do that. :) Also, make sure to set the \"require password\" setting from \"15 minutes\" to \"immediately\" so that you don't end up buying a few extra seasons of Curious George. And make sure to turn off in-app purchases, too.Last thoughts: I wish the restrictions were somewhat more comprehensive. You can prevent kiddos from deleting apps, but not from deleting videos, and it's hard to bring Blue's Clues back in the middle of nowhere when he accidentally deletes the whole season. I also wish this tablet were a bit cheaper - it's an awfully expensive device to risk the child throwing it out a window. My son's been surprisingly responsible with his iPad so far, though. Whether the investment is worth it for your family probably depends on the child in question.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "ipad mini", "Author": "firefly2550 \"stacy\"", "ReviewID": "R17KBRBOBH259Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "whats not to love about the ipad mini? i have several android tablets and i personally love how simple the ipad is to use and set up i am a video blogger on youtube so i use my ipad to record and upload my videos dont have many apps as i just got it ordered tons of cases and skins for it battery life with full brightness is def an issue when i pulled the lightning charger out for the first time it dropped to 97% is this normal or does my brand new ipad already have a glitch? havent tryed any games yet planning on downloading some soon thats my review for now will update as i use my ipad......", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "christmas present", "Author": "gary ferrell", "ReviewID": "R2567AQR9E51XV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "christmas present for the mrs.she has been waiting this for awhile now,and dont even know that i got her one for christmas!lol", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Vanessa Pavlik", "ReviewID": "R2KKMO13LCUBTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this product April 2013 for my husbands birthday.

I'm Very happy, also I know it doesn't have a retina display but the picture is still very good, I'm comparing this to the my Previous Kindle fire, I know I know this going to be harsh but the kindle feels like a kids tablet but I guess you get what you pay for I got my kindle fire in 2012 mothers day special for 139.99$ that being said it's quite a bit more for the iPad, i'd rather work more and buy the iPad Mini that's how big of a difference I feel there is.A++I have to say I bought my iPad mini 16GB black from an Third Party eBay seller, because amazons price was higher and that's the only shame in this that amazon almost wants you to buy there tablet and keeps the apple jacked up maybe that isn't the case, but how it looks.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "great buy", "Author": "LUIS", "ReviewID": "R3RLWD7N9LY85U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got it for my son and he uses it like 8 hrs a day. its awesome and easy to use.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Was worried but turned out great", "Author": "Randy Shuayto", "ReviewID": "R3R12AH7FJQAXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looking for a new Ipad with plenty of storage and found it here.

The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the \"fire\". The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the \"fire\", but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.

Also, it is a little slippery but nothing a silicone sleeve can't handle. My biggest gripe is that it doesn't have text reflow and the text starts out tiny in the browser.  The android os leads in that category because no matter how large the text is magnified it reflows to fit the screen. Apple products need a true text reflow.

And every other owner of an Iphone, IPod, Iwhatever... is aware that the glass/screen/digitizer can shatter pretty easily. I changed the digitizer on my 2nd Gen Ipod before and it was a breeze, so that's not a big deal or a big cost ($9 for the IPod touch) digitizer).Shortly after getting our IPad Mini the screen somehow cracked/shattered!!!! We have no idea how it happened and were of course irate. Knowing that the 'basic' warranty wouldn't cover such a repair, I look at how much the screen/digitizer costs (60-179 btw). I found one for around 60. The removal went ok...minus some added difficulty due to the shattered glass. BUT HERE's THE PROBLEM.The Home Button does not come with the digitizer and MUST be transferred to the new one if/when it has to be replaced!  The issue here is that this REQUIRES SOLDERING!!!! Search for it if you'd like: Ipad Mini Home button soldering.  Here's where it gets real bad/funny: all of the videos that I viewed never mention needing to replace the home button; they just show how to take it apart, and put it back together so I didn't think anything of it at until I reached that stage (too late!) So no I have to either find someone local who knows how to do this (no luck so far due to it being pretty new (and super difficult) or send it off and spend some $$$. Here's the best part.... the part that you have to solder the new digitizer to (a circuit) ISNT EVEN AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY!!! So if anything happens to the super delicate wiring in the removal process, YOU CANT EVEN FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!What confuses me the most is that the ease of which their glass screens break is no secret and is not difficult to have happen.... SO WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT SOOO DIFFICULT TO FIX ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS!?!?!So, if you have or get an IPad Mini and experience any issue dealing with the Home Button (not responsive, intermittent, stuck, etc.) or the digitizer/glass screen (not responsive, scratch, cracked, or shattered.... all which are fairly common... I wouldn't suggest doing this on your own and be prepared to open the wallet. Most online services offering to replace the digitizer are around $125.I hope that, maybe in the next generation, this is fixed/addressed. For something soo common, this needs to be a plug in solution...not having to find a specialist to solder it back together. My suggestion would be to 1) get a very durable/strong case (otterbox?) and 2) DONT USE THE IPAD UNTIL ITS IN THE CASE!!

Now, I wish my husband had purchased something else. It took about four hours for Apple to get it up and running. Four hours! I knew it wouldn't be as simple as turning on a button, but four hours is a bit much.There is a problem with this I-pad mini. I have had other difficulties with it.Another thing, no instructions came with this that even told me how to turn it on. I had to figure that out all by myself.My daughter purchased a cheaper brand, took her about one minute to set it up, and it works better than my expensive mini. Maybe for social media it's great. I don't do social media, so I really wouldn't know about that.I ordered three albums from I-tunes on it: one I was charged a dollar for. Then that was taken off my bank balance, and I still haven't been billed the correct amount. Another was supposed to have been $6.98 plus tax. It came to $17.something. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to their pricing.Grrr!Another problem is the battery. This definitely does not hold a charge, even though I turn the device off when I'm not using it. This is just annoying, and I've decided not to use it for an e-reader. I have my Kindle,and the battery holds a charge much better. I am thinking about purchasing a kindle fire. I really can't see the I-pad mini as any kind of substitute for an e-reader or lap top.Update 1/11/2014: My I-pad mini has died. It isn't recharging at all. I deeply regret having purchased this. Other problems, when I type a comma, it switches it to an s or a totally different word! Disgusting. I don't know for sure, but I bet this was a used one sold as new. Too may problems to name here, but I will say if this is representative of an apple product, I'm not purchasing anymore apples. My Ipad mini has Itunes I've purchased. That was wasted money because now I can't use the Ipad to play them. Don't buy the mini. It's just a piece of junk!Update 2/17/2014: Took my iPad mini in. The UBS adapter was the wrong size for my mini. Also the UBS cable wires were bent. I bought a replacement for both items. Yesterday, I opened up Siri. I hadn't tried to use that before. I discovered all kinds of names in it. For instance, e-mail Shirley. Make reservations at a restaurant in Paris. It is loaded with other names and instructions. I know none of the names, and I've never even asked Siri for anything.

I have two original ipads (a Gen I and recent Gen III).  The big ipads are very robust; kids play with them, drop them out windows, use them to build forts, teach the dogs to fetch, etc., and I throw them in my pickup, use them on the jobsite, whatever.  Ive had the Gen I since 2010, and the other one for more than a year, and, although they both have extensive damage to the metal cases, and although the screen seal of the Gen I is half gone, neither screen has ever cracked.Both of my ipad minis have cracked screens.  One broke while bouncing up and down on the floor of my truck while driving on a dirt  road. The other screen broke when two of my kids were in a tug o war over the ipad. They didn't drop it, one just twisted it out of the others' hand and it cracked.  The ironic thing was when I went to the istore, and some \"Genius\" explained to me that I am totally wrong, and the iPad mini is much more robust than the ipad original.  Obviously I know the \"Genius\" thing is supposed to be ironic, but this was still a little irritating.Here is the deal. The ipad mini with a broken screen costs $219 to fix.  That is right. $220 to fix a product that costs a hair over $300 bucks.  I sold the first one on ebay for $170 (I mean, seriously, who would pay $170 for a broken ipad mini? What is going on there? Who knows?)  I am about to list the second.Bottom line: If you are a very careful old lady who uses the ipad mini once or twice a month on foam rubber on the floor and caresses the screen gently with a hypoallergenic goose feather before your servant locks it back away in a padded vault, this is the perfect device for you. On the other hand, if you are like a regular person who might actually use the device in the real world, the ipad mini is a little too dainty, especially if you have kids. I would definitely recommend the big ipad instead.Go on the apple support forums and you will see that my problem is very common with the mini.

I am not a happy camper.AHA..not to worry.THAT restriction is ONLY if you call AT&T; and prebill contract for two years.If you buy the service yourslef month to month you CAN add international immediately.At least right now!You can buy from ipad mini...or online<...>you first MUST buy a data plan..and THEN you can immediately purchase an international plan.AND you can start the international plan any date up to one year in advance.It starts midnight eatsern time on day you select.I just picked the day before to be sure I had service AND you can log in and change the international date.And if you CANCEL att domestic plan..if you do they charge domestic data to international data or something. Read the terms and conditions.The att ipad domestic plans are month to month...you have to cancel 7 days in advance. They say they bill two hours in advance.RIGHT NOW...if you exceed your data..they do not bill you for more..your plans just stops until the next autorenew date. That is awesome!. Phew. However you can go online and add more time. Thischanges to a new 30 day period. Data does not roll (bummer).They allegedly have a non-autobill option for doesmetic. I could not figure it out.They give your device a cell data number for billing.International does NOT autobill.Use this address to view your iPad Data Account.<...>If you already have data you can use the email address / password on the right side to log in.If you don't have data you can use the Sign Up For Service button.There is not a lot of information on the page, so not sure if it will fit your needs or not.You can show the credit card information used on the account under the Edit User & Payment information page.I got the Ipad mini unit asap in person..on BLACK Friday...so I could get the unit immediately...and buy one with a data provider.Be careful in your choice of data provider.Love the ipad mini. It is much better than the Kindle Fire for travel/web access and photos.It has a camera and with dropbox, it automatically backs up pictures online, etc.I can share folders with friends using dropbox.The unit is small enough to take with.Battery lasts fine (8 hours) and the smart cover shuts it on and (sleep mode).I did have problems because I oops kept failing to fully plug it in. Make sure the usb is fully engaged.You do not have to turn unit off...just put it in sleep mode..uses very little battery.However it charges BEST when the unit is off.FYI-It does NOT use a jump drive.  Mini has the tiny \"lightening\" port.I suggest dropbox on a big pc rather than hacking it...and reformatting the jump drive.Someone said they got jump drive to work using a camera attachment.I just wanted a small device for traveling, taking pictures of my rental car, checking in online to get boarding passes.However...I can  use it at home and sit out by pool or in the living room...and it is kind of cool.I'm new to these devices...I love it. Not so much Apple support.And AT&T; is very very very hard to find IPAD info. Use links above.YOu can set up plan from your device....but I had trouble and had to go through a live person.Using the links I gave you can check your usage online.Once they make international sims with the NANO chip, of course you can get your own international data plan through them.Be very careful with your ipad mini sim.In summary:check to see if you can load latest itunes on a pc or mac first. (optional)check to see what data provider you want. (optional)you may need to get a larger unit 32 or 64 if you want one right away.for att...go to att.com.ipadlanding to see data pllans for ipad.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$329.00", "Features": "7.9-inch LED-backlit Multi-Touch Display; 1024-by-768 Resolution\nApple iOS 6; Dual-Core A5 Chip 1GHZ\n5 MP iSight Camera; 1080p HD Video Recording\nWi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n); 16 GB Capacity\nUp to 10 Hours of Battery Life; 0.68 lbs", "Name": "Apple iPad mini MD531LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White / Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E0YyTaNtL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00746W9F2"}}
