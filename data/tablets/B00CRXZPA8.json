So, I bought this tablet for my 6 yr old daughter because her older brother (8) had one and she really wanted one. I figured that it is probably an appropriate age to get her acclimated to technology as everything she will experience in her life will be technically related (most likely). As long as we monitor her screen time it works out well.  On to the tablet...it is way better than my son's quad core, feature rich no name tablet that was actually the same price on a big sale.  Way better means, more responsive, way faster, brighter/clearer screen and sounds better with speakers.  So all around, my son was very upset about this recent acquisition.  Oh, i forgot the batter life is about 4 x as long as my son's tablet as well he has a 3500mAh battery (it says).  Anyhow, this is a great tablet for the price and is as good as most I have seen up to the $175 price.

The unit was clearly opened but otherwise like new as indicated on the website.  I have been looking for an electronic solution to handwriting in a notebook for work and having to retype notes.  Using handwriting apps on my phone is less than ideal.  My hope is that on a 7\" tablet it will become a great solution.The tablet looks and feels much like my Android phone but has a few minor differences and not all apps available on my phone can be installed on my tablet but most that I want are available.Memory usage is the biggest issue.  Although it has 8 GB of memory the important point I missed in the tech specs and did not appreciate until I started installing apps is that out of the box only 500MB is available for program storage.  Downloading the OTA (over the air) upgrade increased the internal memory to 1.5 GB.  First attempt at downloading the OTA upgrade took many hours and had to be resumed several times and when finally downloaded it did not work and I had to start over again.  My suggestion is if it takes more than 30 minutes to cancel the process, restart the tablet and try again.  Second attempt downloaded in under 30 minutes and performed the memory repartition successfully.My android phone has all 16 GB of internal memory available for apps, OS and storage so this is something unique to me and perhaps to this tablet.  Hopefully a future upgrade will unlock and repartition all of the memory for app and storage use.  Right now it is divided into Internal Storage and \"USB Storage\".  The later is a strange use of terminology as this memory is not from an external USB connection.  Nonetheless it is essentially RAM and Flash memory.  Some applications can be relocated to the USB/Flash memory which frees up much needed space but this is not an option for all apps.  My hope is for app makers to one day allow this option (moving to \"external storage\") any application or data cache that is not critical to the devices function.I am now on the hunt for a fine point capacitive stylus.  The typical ones you find online are blunt, rubbery tipped tools.All in all it may prove to be just what I need and, for the price I really can't complain.

In the past year or so I have purchased several different 7 inch tablets from Amazon, and I have read hundreds of reviews in making these purchases. I have purchased, and have or will review, the Asus Memopad HD for myself, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, Asus Memopad, and this item, the Lenovo Ideatab A1000, from Amazon, for gifts, since I don't think anything you can buy in this price range makes as good a gift. I have also purchased the Dell Venue from Dell.Price notwithstanding I rank these tablets in this order:1. Dell Venue2. Asus Memopad HD3. Samsung Galaxy Tab 24. Asus Memopad/Lenovo Ideatab (tie)Before giving these as gifts I unpackage them and load some things on them to add to the gift, so I know what they do. The Galaxy Tab 2 would be #1 were it not for as of yet unresolved power issues. Any slight disruption of the proprietary charger or the plug you put it into on the machine will brick your machine. I wrote about this machine and this particular problem on that product page, and that problem seems to be a manufacturing defect. Otherwise the Tab 2 is the smoothest and best of the bunch. The Venue sits on top for specs alone, and as for performance it is right up there with the Tab 2. The Memopad HD is what I use now, and so far it has done everything well, with the occasional hiccup (common to all these tablets) probably more due to Android than the tab itself. It is not #1 because of specs inferior to the Venue, and because of the BLOATWARE you CANNOT remove unless you root your machine. Why companies continue to force this stuff down the throats of their customers for a few extra pennies is a mystery to me. While bloatware you cannot remove is a problem with all these devices, Dell has the least, and so also wins and those grounds.As far as performance goes, the Lenovo gets beat by the HD Memopad and the Dell, but not by much, especially considering the price difference. All in all my advice is to buy the least expensive one, especially if the differences in specs (like a 2nd camera and hd screen) are of little concern to you, but be aware of the power problems of the Galaxy Tab 2, and, if you're looking at this Lenovo, give a good long look to the Dell or Memopad line first, which I think for the price difference are the slightly better buys.I would be happy to answer any specific questions about any of these devices.

It booths faster then any of my previous 4 tablets, launches apps quickly, picture and sound quality are excellent, and the screen is highly responsive. The only problem I have is in loading applications, it continues to attempt to load them to the main memory, which is limited, even when directed to load to the internal 8gb or to the external 32gb sd. Then it refuses to let app2sd apps move them to either of the other resources. However this is only a mild irritant, as is great when giving presentations and lectures, as well as, getting information from the web when connected to wi-fi. It handles the 3 major book apps well, as some of the reference materials I need are sometimes only found at one source. It is very responsive to both Google play and the Amazon app store and downloads and installs quickly, even with the minor problem. I have no qualms in recommending it.Update 9/28/13 As stated by others with both the firmware and software updates, the earlier problem has been more than satisfactorily resolved. Others have stated they have difficulty with movies and I have found, as with other systems, it depends on the format the movies are in and the app you use to view them.

I purchased it because it was cheap and I have a Lenovo desktop computer that is a fine product, reliable and a very good value.This is a tablet that represents a failed try by Lenovo to enter the market with a compromised and unsatisfactory device. I would not repurchase if it cost $20! My experience with this tablet also makes me seriously question the wisdom of buying another electronic device from Lenovo.The performance of the A2107A is adequate. It's not fast, but it isn't very slow either. It is running Android 4.0, and will never be upgraded unless it is rooted and you install a new o/s.Where its defects are very apparent is with the included features (or, more specifically the advertised features that don't work). Lenovo lists features such as GPS and Bluetooth.What you discover about the GPS is that it works only if connected to the internet with WiFi or 3G service. Since the US version cannot get a mobile net 3G connection, that leave GPS capability only through WiFi. I don't often drive where there is a continuous WiFi connection. This device should never list GPS in its specifications.How about Blue tooth? Well I see it listed as a function under system settings, it can be turned on and off, it can even search for a Bluetooth device connection. So, what's the problem? Well, according to the User's manual (which does not come with the new tablet) only Lenovo approved Bluetooth devices can connect. And, what are those Lenovo approved devices? The manual doesn't have a list and apparently, you're on your own. I couldn't get either a keyboard or my lovely Panasonic speakers to connect.My problems with the features of this tablet are symptomatic of the problems of a device sold in different iterations of the device sold in different countries. You can go mad trying to discover information about your version, trapped in contradictions and with no help from the Lenovo website, which has good intentions but little or no germane information.The bottom line is that Lenovo will release an inferior product and I don't believe that Samsung or Google would", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "No 8 GB very very disappointed", "Author": "Chris Franz", "ReviewID": "R2UAO6UOKRPGF7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Says 8GB but its only 2GB you need a computer to get the other 6GBNo 8 GB very very disappointed.
