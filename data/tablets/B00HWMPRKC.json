{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My so far successful attempt at a laptop replacement.", "Author": "Teutonic Speedracer", "ReviewID": "R8E5RPDT0GZD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from a 4yr old bogged down Toshiba laptop running Vista, this was purchased to be a laptop replacement.  I plan to use it for email, internet, netflix, social, games, minor word/excel, etc.  I wanted to get away from Windows, have something light and portable (this 12.2\" weighs 1.61 lbs  nearly what the original iPad (1.50 lbs) --3rd and 4th gens (1.45lbs) weighed which was never considered \"heavy\").  I wanted it to have multiple user support so my wife and I can have separate profiles.  I wanted to get away from the larger laptop power supply.Some of the features that allow this to be a laptop replacement:12.2\" screen that can allow 4 apps split on the screenLarge touch keyboard (likely will get Logtitech Pro Keyboard for occasional heavy word/excel usage)Hancom Office2yrs office link to my desktopThings I like:Beautiful screenSplit screenQuick, snappyEasily expands to 96gb with ~$35 64gb microSD cardPlays nicely with my existing Android ecosystem$25 Google Play creditThings I dislike:Hancom office is great,  but I've struggled with a few things in its version of Excel like moving a graph and their website is lacking at this time.Wish more apps were available for multi-window.Magazine UX still needs top allow more customizationOther comments:I see a lot of negative reviews saying it costs so much compared to the competition (first off I think most are comparing to the Note vs Tab).iPad Air 32gb - $599Tab Pro 12.2 32gb - $649You get a lot more for that $50 as well as a better operating system in my opinion.To compliment this tablet,  I plan to get the Logtitech keyboard case as well as a soft mount/stand for more comfortable use of the tablet on the couch.**Update 3/22/14**  With poor reviews on the Logtitech keyboard,  I saved a bunch and am really happy with a $26 Anker ultralight and thin BT keyboard.  The ipevo stand is great too.  This combo is working better than expected as a laptop replacement!", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Is it even big enough?  :-)", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RFWYO40BOCZH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have a Nexus 10, an HDX7 and HDX8.9 but I wanted something larger to actually be able to read a magazine - I have a Next Issue subscription and I wanted to be able to view all those magazines in almost-normal-size.  Plus - getting to watch HD videos on a larger screen size was a bonus.For those of you who don't have or know what Next Issue is (and I'm not connected with them) - it's a monthly subscription - 2 choices of plans - basic for $9.99, premium for $14.99 per month - includes over 100 magazines, weeklies and monthlies, well worth the cost.Didn't need the Note Pro - I couldn't see spending another $100 to get a stylus.  The one concern I had was - was the storage large enough?  Comes with 32gb.  There's a microSD slot .. plus with Galaxy Perks you get 50gb with DropBox.  And I already have huge storage with Amazon (Prime member) and Google .. so yes, the 32gb on the tablet are fine.I've streamed some videos - TWC TV, Hulu Plus, Netflix, plus HBO GO - all work pretty good.  If the picture on the video is primarily black/dark grays - you will see the screen isn't quite as smooth or sharp - but it was okay for me.  I was having problems with HBO Go at night and just thought it was either TWC or HBO having streaming issues - turns out it was HBO Go getting bombarded with folks streaming the finale of \"True Detective\" - I was watching something else but it was causing fits for HBO.  So video works pretty good.The interface is pretty snappy - I've tried loading Go Launcher EX which I use on my phone - the Samsung interface works better for me - Go Launcher Ex isn't ready for a table this size.All in all - I'm really happy I got it - now I'm just waiting for my cover to arrive!So - now for a few things that could work better -1.  Amazone Prime Instant Video - does not work at all and as far as I can tell there is no workaround right now.  The Note Pro 12.2 ships with Android 4.4.x (4.4.2 I believe) - and if you sideload Flash it doesn't work - I've read there are some incompatabilities with 4.4.x and Flash - doesn't make a difference which browser you use - it's not working as I write this.  I've got this beautiful screen - and (listen up AMAZON) it would be great to be able to stream Amazon Instant Videos on it.  Yeah, I have an HDX 8.9 - it's a beautiful screen - but a bigger screen would be nice.  Again - listen up AMAZON - how about coming out with an HDX 12.2?  Or releasing an Amazon Instant Video for non-Kindle Android devices?2.  Last week Samsung released \"the next big thing in music\" (their words, not mine) - MILK .. it's only good on Galaxy devices .. well this is a Galaxy PRO device right?  nope, it's only good on Galaxy phone and and (smaller) Note devices .. I don't understand that - listen up SAMSUNG - your MILK radio app should be available on ANY Samsung device - phone and tablet - not just phone!Rant over .. :-) .. overall I'm liking my Tab Pro 12.2 .. for me it's not too big .. and it even could have been a little bigger .. definately a recommended tablet!", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "What a tablet !

I got a chance to try the 12.2 in work environment and I am completely amazed at the power of a large inch tablet. For reading documents/pdf/books this is awesome. Especially for students! First let us compare the PRO lines from Samsung. The regular Galaxy Tab series will be out in summer based on past trends. Love the Tabpro and will do updates within a month in more detail. I will compare first the TabPROs briefly, and then give a crisp overview of the popular Tablets in market now. Then I will do in depth into the current tablet itself. I feel this will give a good perspective and enhance your buying decision. I am sure you are looking at multiple tablets to determine which sits you. If you have any questions, do ask in the forum and I will respond within a day. My video review shows Temple Run 2, YouTube, GPS Navigon, Sketching among other things.The single most fascinating part of the TabPRO lines is the resolution. Astounding 2560 x 1600 on all lines . In comparison last year's Tabs have much lower resolution.key_specs: { model: resolution, ppi, CPU, RAM, Flash memory, SD_card, camera spec, weight, OS_type, size, charging/sync port type, GPS:y/n }Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 8.4-Inch {B,W},  WQXGA 2560 x 1600, 359 ppi, 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 331 gm, Android 4.4 Kit Kat OS, 8.62 x 5.06 x 0.28 in, microUSB, GPS yes.  4800 mAh battery (best resolution on a tablet!)Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 10.1 {B, W}, WQXGA  2560x1600, 298 ppi, Exynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 469 gm, Android 4.4 KitKat, 9.57 x 6.75 x 0.29 in, microUSB, GPS: y, 8,200mAh batteryWow, a 12.2\" tablet now!

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!RESOLUTION:The resolution of WQXGA 2560 x 1600, and has a pixel density of 247 ppi. All the TabPROs are same resolution,  so we increase in size, the pixel density decreases. The videos were very crisp and text so sharp. The new Magazine UX interface makes the screen really pop. I was able to read magazines very easily. Aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app. Resolution will blow you away.  This new Multi-Window UI that now supports up to four apps running simultaneously, each in its dedicated window. I was reading documents/manuals at work and the resolution and clarity is stunning.PROCESSING POWERExynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 3 GB RAM. Very powerful indeed! I have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies. Though the chip is octa core, do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time. This is done for minimizing heat.PRO MEANS?Tablet is certainly is a productivity tool.  This tablet is touted as Enterprise-Ready Email/Microsoft office support through a third party app.  It also has Hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in Korea. Hancom Office consists of Hanword, Hancell (Spreadsheet), and Hanshow (Presentation program). Since there is Google office, I don't know if this will be any sell in the US and other countries. does all this sound familiar to you. Yes, you have it in your laptop!STORAGEThis tabpro comes in 32/64 GB configurations.  Having the expandable memory to 64 GB is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Well, putting bunch of video/audio/books on the SD card which is so cheap these days, the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed.  With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.CAMERA:Having a tablet is a plus on smaller tablets, though I hate the feature on 10 or 12\" tablets.  I personally don't use cameras as much on 10\"+. If you use publicly, it is like having a big magazine in front of you. Imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you! The resolution is 8MP Rear + 2MP Front. Video is 1080 p 60 fps. Nowadays there is nothing much to sat of cameras, they just work for the required purpose.ERGONOMICSI personally like for home uses 8\", but  at 12\"+ this is truly a laptop replacement. At 717 gm, the weight is definitely not single hand holdable.  Still less weight than laptops. For example, 11\" MacBook Air weighs 2.38 pounds. Size of this tablet is 11.64 x 8.03 x 0.31 in. The battery is 9500mAh and it came for easily couple of days for me at nominal usage in an office environment. The best part I liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet! HD videos are crisp.  The tablet is marked as PRO which means Samsung us really trying the enterprise customers, though nothing prevents one from getting for home personal use.SOUNDExcellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone. I was able to ask questions to Google Now and get precise answers.MISCI tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.Having a GPS is great for immediate needs and I could get immediate lock on this tablet. Wi-Fi is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band. Also has infrared which cas be used for WatchON as a TV remote control. Worked straightaway on Samsung TV. This is also great for sharing your tablet with family members, multi user mode lets different users log in separately, so you each see only your own apps, backgrounds, and email.APP POWERI tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have. Apart from official tasks, I tried apps from my personal Google Play apps.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate.

I quickly discovered that the Tab Pro is a little workhorse all on its own, and I'm using it a surprising amount of the time in place of my office PC.  I did find the Hancom Office app, which is pre-loaded on the Tab 12.2,  to be severely lacking in function and usability.  I switched over to the Kingsoft app and haven't looked back. That made a huge difference in the ability to productively edit more complicated (yet faithfully rendered)  Powerpoint, Word and Excel documents.  Both that app and the Tab in general are well-integrated with Dropbox, so it's easy to save what you're working on to the cloud.  The virtual keyboard on this tablet is one of the best I've seen, with well-spaced keys, but it's still a virtual keyboard.  At the office, I added a Bluetooth keyboard which has sped up the typing considerably. I don't know if it's Samsung's doing or Google's, but the text selection controls and cut/paste functionality is much more efficient than on older Tabs.  I've also used a stylus with this (just a cheap one from Amazon) and it works beautifully - very little lag on the display when handwriting, and nice responsiveness when highlighting or selecting text.  Multi-window makes it a snap (literally) to view two apps at the same time. Be aware, however, that there are only a limited number of mutli-window-capable apps right now.  If you want to view two web pages in Multi-window simultaneously, you'll need to open two different browsers.  Need to print out what you're working on? That also works very nicely (provided you have a wifi printer that you can connect to.) You'll need one of the apps at the Play store to do it, but it worked flawlessly for me.The charge on this is pretty decent - it lasts all day without having to plug into a charger, and that's with the screen on a good portion of the time.  This battery has a pretty big capacity, but the downside is that the time to charge a nearly-dead battery might be longer than you expect (I believe around 6 hours at minimum).  My 2 year old laptop was topping out at around 2.5 hours of run time, even with a fairly new battery, so this is a huge plus for me.What I love about this tablet is that I get everything that's awesome about Android combined with the productivity tools of a PC, on a tablet that i don't have to squint over.  While my office PC is stalling while it updates windows, download the latest antivirus updates, or whatever else it wants to do during bootup, thanks to the Tab, by the time the PC is ready to go, I've already checked and responded to email, critiqued documents sent by colleagues, and caught up on the latest news in my field.  I agree, it's not the most portable Tab out there - I'd highly recommend taking a look at the 8 inch if you need a tab to constantly carry around with you - but for what it is, it's a thing of beauty.ADDENDUM:  Five stars for the ease of contacting Samsung's tech support (24 hours by chat? nice!).  One star for the ability to redeem their Samsung Perks. I have spent nearly an hour on registration websites and in the chats trying to figure out how to get the magic email that entitles me to Google Play credit, Dropbox space, etc.  So far no luck.  My request is being \"escalated\".  Update: Well, to Samsung's credit, I got an email back from their \"Perks\" coordinator the next day, which contained all of the promotion codes for the various services.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tablet.

There are a few things that don't feel comfortable or might feel jarring, but then you are here because you want a huge tablet, so they should be expected.The screen if gorgeous!  And Samsung has done a great job of making the icons proportional to the screen.  Because at this super high resolution, if you left the icons to the normal size, they would be TINY.  That said, be prepared to see -huge- icons since they are proportionally bigger than, say, even a huge Note 3 phone.  Still the ratio isn't one to one from a tiny tablet, there is room for a couple of more icons per row.Weight:  This is light and feels great... for a tablet its size.  That said, be prepared to always have to put it or your hands on something if you are using it more than a couple of minutes.  While it is solid & light enough to hold it in one hand by a corner and use, your hand will be cramping in no time.Look and feel:  Just awesome.  I don't get professional reviewers issue with \"faux leather\", it looks and feels awesome!  Even though it's bigger than all the rest, this is still a tablet, as I said above, you can brag and pick it up by a corner without feeling like you are putting too much force on a corner or anything of the nature.  But its dimensions do mean you have to lean your arm on something or put it down for using more than reading a single email, even then...The large dimensions also mean awkward reading in bed unless you are sitting up with your legs or a pillow under it.  If you are laying on the ground or on your bed faxing down with it flat and reading websites or an online book with the tablet in portrait format (as one would tend to read long things), then the top is too far away and an angle, as would a tall magazine be.This can easily be fixed with a little something to prop the end away from you up of course, but just making sure you realize that you will get what you are asking for, a gorgeous, great feeling tablet that is the largest on the market, but you are also getting something rather large, and all that comes with that, so expect it.

If you've ever tried pure Google Android via one of the Nexus devices or a rooted rom on some other device then you know what I'm talking about.  Right out of the box this tablet stutters, Web pages load poorly and it gets stuck/freezes up before opening programs.  I took a gamble on buying this especially since there are other tablets out there for significantly less that run Android so much better.THE GOOD: The screen is absolutely beautiful,  it's full HD and it's 12.2 inches, no other screen comes closer.  It's a lot thinner then I would have expected and very light for its size.  The internals are top notch, and it has potential to be a great tablet.Bottom line is if you could get rid of touch wiz I would say buy this tablet, there are enough apps on android to replace your windows laptop and go primarily to Android, but the Tab Pro misses the mark.  And for how much you have to pay for the Tab Pro, there are other, cheaper tablets out there that get the job done much better than this one.UPDATE 04/09/2014: I returned the tablet a week after purchasing it.
