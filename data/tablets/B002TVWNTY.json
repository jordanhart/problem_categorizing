The Raid 0 quit working and after replacing both drives it still reads very slowly.  Perhaps it is something wrong with the ArcticRoc itself, but the new drives are both in perfect working order.  After many phone calls to the support number, I have given up.  I only reached a human one time in over a dozen calls, and he tried to help but with his heavy accent and constant interruptions with other calls --I was put on hold numerous times--he failed to solve the problem.I will try now to return the product for some kind of refund.  All in all, not something I'd wish on my worst enemy.Several days after posting the above review, I got an unexpected phone call from technical support at Rocstor, and the fellow who helped me could not have been MORE helpful.  All problems got solved.  Let me briefly mention the issue here, because it is NOT covered in the user manual for Arcticroc 2T: When and if you need to replace and rebuild ONE bad drive in the RAID 1 mirrored setting, you must FIRST power up Arcticroc with the ONE good drive in it, THEN, WITH THE POWER ON, insert the new hard drive into whichever bay is open.  If you do all of this with the power OFF, the computer is NOT going to mount the Arctiroc correctly because it is confused about which drive to read.All that said, I am now a happy customer and wish to upgrade my rating to 4.5 stars (I know, either 4 or 5 please!)", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002TVWNTY"}}
