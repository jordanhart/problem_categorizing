{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent alternative to Kindle Fire", "Author": "Snavvy", "ReviewID": "R3L8GYDMOQFIO1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With the Next7 Premium, Nextbook has hit its stride in tablets. This model has Android 2.3, which sets it apart from earlier Android 2.1 models, and that is probably the biggest difference. In addition to on-screen navigation buttons, there are touch buttons externally (Search, Home, Settings, Return) which make navigation much easier in case the on-screen display doesn't show the navigation buttons.It has a (RK2918 chipset) A8 Cortex 1Ghz processor with 256Mb RAM, and Android is Linux, of course, and therefore runs quite quickly (almost twice as fast as the earlier Next6 model, which I also had).The 7\" inch color TFT capacitive touch screen (i.e. not pressure activated) is one of the nicest on any tablet, and it is surprising to find it on an inexpensive model like this. It has built-in WiFi (but no 3G/4G or Bluetooth) that works instantly with one touch (and works flawlessly), scanning and recognizing APs quickly. I have never had a problem connecting, even while traveling.There is built-in 4 Gb Flash memory, and an SD card slot that can accommodate a 32 Gb card. It has a micro-USB port, and when plugged into a computer is recognized as an external drive (allowing easy file exchange). I share the SD card between my MP3 player and my Nextbook, and I have no problem moving the SD card back and forth between the two (i.e. the format is the same for both).There are built-in speakers (and a standard-size earphone jack) but no camera and no mic. Although Skype runs well on this unit, without cam and mic it doesn't make any sense to do so. (I have not tried to set up an external webcam/mic through the USB port, but that probably requires advanced \"root\" level hacking to accomplish driver installation).A built-in G-Sensor (gyroscope) orients the screen depending on how the device is held; this behavior is adjustable/preventable in the settings.It has a very nice Browser included (and Flash 11.0 is pre-installed and works great), and an E-mail app (which I love) that is easy to set up with both POP and IMAP servers. The music player is great, as is the Photo/Slideshow viewer. The superb Video player automatically resizes videos (for both 16:9 and 4:3 viewing) and the videos are crystal-clear. It plays my .AVI videos (with DivX/Xvid video encoding and MP3/AC3 audio encoding), my .MP4 videos (with AVC video and AAC audio), my .M4V videos (with AVC video and MP4A audio), my .MKV videos (including with .srt subtitle files!), and my .FLV (Flash) videos. (The only format it won't play is .WMV video.) Volume buttons are always readily accessible, too (the lack of which irritated me on earlier tablets). The eBook reader reads both ePub (which looks the best on this tablet) and PDF files, as well as .txt files. The default font size is just right for my eyes and is slightly larger than an average paperback. The screen brightness is adjustable, and I read books routinely on this unit (which is one of the reasons I originally got it).The desktop is 5 screens wide (only the middle screen is shown by default -- gestures are used to slide to the other screens) so that I can add as many widgets and shortcut icons to the desktop as desired. There are several widgets pre-configured and available (such as the Weather/time widget, a Photo widget, the default Google Search widget, and the wallpaper background widget (for photo and \"Live\" (i.e. animated) wallpapers).This device is not recognized by the official Google Android Market, so I have gotten additional apps from the Amazon Android App market, the pre-installed SlideME/SAM market, and the open source F-Droid.org repository.What did I add to make my laptop obsolete?From Amazon Android App marketplace: the Netflix app (works very well on this device); the Sky.FM Internet Radio app, the Winamp/Shoutcast Internet Radio app, the Smart App Protector (allows passwords to be required when starting up selected apps), WebLiveWallpaper (allows random display of images from the Internet), and a few games (yeah, the usual, like AngryBirds and Words Free).From F-Droid.org: the OsmAnd+ app (Open Street Maps and navigation, which can be used offline in place of Google Maps or MapQuest); the aCal Calendar app (which plays well with my CalDAV and ics calendars on the web); the Contact Owner app (which allows me to put a \"If Found: Call me\" type of message on the lock screen); and other games like FrozenBubble and JewelLust.The browser also automatically allows access to my WebDAV folders on the web, so I can access files on my home WebDAV server. (Two browsers, Explorer, and Astro are also pre-installed, but neither work well with WebDAV folders. Of the two, Explorer has a nicer UI; I also don't like Astro because it has ads.)I therefore no longer travel with my laptop -- this tablet is now suitable for me and, unlike larger tablets, fits in my pocket (which for me is very important). This tablet is comparable in every way to the much more expensive Kindle Fire and I can't recommend it highly enough!11 month update: I still use this tablet daily 11 months after purchasing it and it is my main mobile device. I still love it. The battery life remains good and the screen excellent. It has become one of my main business devices (I travel for a living and do a lot of business through browser-based cloud systems, for which this device is just fine). I use OSM maps on it for my (offline) driving navigation, and that has been pretty satisfactory (though there is no GPS since there is no 3G/4G). I don't miss the camera, or Skype, or a microphone (I do have a regular phone, after all).  I use it (as do my kids) for Netflix every day, and watch movies and streaming Internet Radio on it constantly. I also use it as a portable storage device for files, and since I have AndFTP on it, can access files on my home FTP server and can then transfer the files to remote customers that way as well (using a mini USB/USB cord I carry with me).This unit has Android 2.3, which does not have \"USB host mode\", so that I cannot attach an external keyboard through the micro-USB port (which requires that mode). That is my biggest complaint with this unit. To be able to connect an external keyboard, Android 4.0 (which has \"USB host mode\") is required, as comes with later models (usually the S-series).", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nextbook Premium 7 7\" Tablet is a great tablet and a great buy!", "Author": "Sibusiso \"Sibu\"", "ReviewID": "R2GL54R97VOIU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been searching for a Tablet PC since I got my wife an Acer Iconia A100 during the Black Friday sales.

This tablet is not all bad but it has few good points besides the price, which isn't really that great depending on where you buy it.Anyway, to start, it's not google approved so no marketplace unless you root it. I'm no tech geek so no marketplace for me.Second it doesn't have much memory or storage so an sd card is a must, but still onboard storage is minimal so you can't have too many apps anyway.It plays angry birds and nextflix ok and it does have flash so that's a plus, but lack of the markplace is a hindrance for finding quality apps. Amazon appstore is a savior for this thing along with mobile 1.There is no mic and no camera so no chat via skype or anything like that. Wifi was iffy on mine, there was an update available but the problem I had was that if wifi turned itself off and you tried to turn it back on it crashed the tablet.And speaking of crashing, there were a lot of forced closed moments.But I could live with all that. I actually loved this little thing as an ereader and it was my first android device. I still like the idea of it even with all it's flaws but today after only having it for a little over 4 months it has died. This morning after using it normally the night before; it suddenly refused to turn on. It is fully charged according to the indicator light, but it won't start at all. DOA. Pressing the power button does nothing, it doesn't even try. It's a brick. So I have to send it back to efun, that is if they will honor their warranty which I'm doubtful about.So my advice is unless someone gives this piece of crap to you, just save your money and buy from a reputable company and get a tablet with all the bells and whistles. You may think you don't need it but once you start playing around with android you will discover apps where you want those missing features.It's not a bad cheap android tablet; but for a few bucks more you can have a good android tablet so why skimp? When it comes to electronics you get what you pay for.  Since I can't get a refund I will have to hope they send me a replacement but I am saving my money for something better.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots of fun, but a wee bit slow", "Author": "Joan G.", "ReviewID": "R3R1569B1YZ9IR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After my bro got a Velocity Micro Cruz 2.1 tablet for Christmas, I just knew I needed one too. :P  I was going to get a Velocity too, but I started hesitating when he found out that he couldn't install a lot of apps; Angry Birds and other games/apps wouldn't install because of the lack of a 3D GPU and the outdated 2.1 Android OS.  A few days later I got an ad from Big Lots, and saw this tablet for $130.  I went by the store and bought it the next day after reading a few favorable reviews.  I opened it, booted it up, got it on the charger...and promptly downloaded, installed, and played Angry Birds. :D  I was amazed at how smoothly the game ran; it never locked up, and barely slowed down at all on the big levels.  After having used it for 2 months, I can honestly say that I've thoroughly used this tablet enough to write a review on it.Pros:Quite fast. (NOTE: speed decreases if you install a lot of apps.)Can play graphic-oriented games; Angry Birds, Krazy Kart Racing, Cut the Rope, etc.App compatibility-I've never found an app I can't installBattery runs for hours when surfing the Web or reading books, but drains a lot faster with games.Easy to hold in one hand, the borders on the side of the screen are the perfect width.External buttons: Home, Settings, Search, and Back buttons below the screen help when an app isn't responding.Touchscreen isn't iPad-quality, but is very responsive.Great value for the money: an equivalent tablet would be $150+Cons:Sluggish when lots of apps are installed on the deviceInternet is slightly slowLocks up sometimes when opening graphic-oriented gamesNo camera/micFavorite Apps:GetJar marketSlideMe marketLast.FM (music downloader)Words FreeNote Everything (great notepad)Wiki Pro (Wikipedia app)Offline DictionariesMailDroid (email client)Expense (expense-tracking app)Algeo (graphing calculator, great for math students)Aldiko (ereader app)Smart Office (Document reader/editor)FDroid (another app marketplace)Amazon AppstoreFavorite Games:Angry Birds (of course!!! :D )Checkers/Chess FreeDS Tower DefenseKrazy Kart RacingMinesweeper ClassicReflexionsXeno Tactic II LiteOverall, the tablet is AWESOME.  As you can see, the pros far outweigh the cons.  My biggest recommendation if you are planning on buying one of these is to download the Astro File Manager app and put the shortcut to the Astro Processes Killer on the home screen.  When you are about to play Angry Birds or want the tablet to speed up, kill all the processes with the aforementioned app.  This speeds the tablet up to handle those big games.  Also, don't expect this thing to be an iPad.  It's not.  It is a low price, high quality, occasionally sluggish Android tablet that has NO access to the Android Market that plays Flash video, reads ebooks, surfs the Web, and plays games all in a compact, sleek package.

I have to say this is a pretty good alternative to the Kindle. I really just wanted it for the EBook/EReader option but I find it handy to just jump on the internet for a quick search. So far technially I haven't had any issues with it, other than not being able to delete the 25 books that come free with it. I'm not really interested in reading War and Peace. The widget for the clock doesn't seem to work correctly so I deleted that. I'm on the East coast and it kept defaulting to West coast/Pacific time. Other than those two things this is great. I noticed in some of the other reviews the iPad/Apple users didn't really like this, but that's probably because this has and Android operating system.

Today, I was informed by EFun customer service with some arrogance that I would not be able to expect updates or fixes by EFun directly (from their site), and that no updates via any site other than the Efun site would work with the Efun product (not, ironically, that there was any issue with app compatibility with the OS, but that the Efun Nextbook itself was set up as to not allow for any such update - the rep proudly assured me that he was an expert giving me his expertise on Nextbook programing)......further, that several new models have since been launched, and why would Efun continue to support/update their previous models when they want customers to come back and buy the newest......and further still, as the rep continued, why would customers come back for the latest if the old models were update-able, never broke down, and didn't need to be replaced. It was made clear that if I wished to be able to use such upgrades, Efun's latest model is available for purchase.Save your money and find a reputable company.

It's been returned once, and I'm having problems with it again!The first major problem was that the Wi-Fi wouldn't connect to my home router... every other device I have could.  Only the nextbook couldn't.  It wasn't able to connect to any other wi-fi network either either.  However, it would keep trying constantly, draining the power out of the battery at a fantastic rate.  I was unable to shut off wi-fi to conserve battery power... it would simply refuse to allow me to turn off wi-fi at all.  It took several weeks to convince customer support that there was a problem with it and then the problem of returning it started.  I don't live in North America, and they refused to ship it outside of North America.  Actually, they made a point of telling me that they don't provide support for their products outside of North America.  However, it was bought in Australia, and sent to me... but when I suggested they send it to Australia instead, they said that was not possible either... despite the fact that the tablet was BOUGHT there!  Long story short, another few weeks later, and I was finally allowed to have it shipped to an address in Canada.  I specifically told them that it was being shipped to another person's address, who would then forward it to me.  They sent it via FedEx, who insisted that I sign for it.  Even though I live outside North America.  And the fact that I had told Nextbook that it was being shipped to another person's address.Anyway.  Another month later, and I finally got it back.  I resigned myself to the fact that I can't install android apps (can't use Android Market because Nextbooks can't access that store).  Can't use any android app stores that are worth using, actually.)  I resigned myself to using it for e-books and videos only.  Kind of a waste having android installed at all, but what the heck.  It was free (Christmas gift), so I'll make the best of it.  And then I discover that I can't access the SD card either now.  I don't have the space to copy videos over to it... can't put books on it either.  Can't seem to do much with it generally.And then there's the little things like the Nextbook freezing while copying anything over (not always, but at least a quarter of the time).Don't waste your money.  There are better e-book readers, and I can't really even consider this to be a real tablet.  I will try to get some use out of it while it lasts, and when it dies (or I finally get fed up with it and throw it in the garbage), I'll save up and get something worth buying.  Never again will I buy anything from Nextbook.Poor product.  Poor support.  Poor quality control.  Poor excuse for a company.

I have downloaded Amazon App store, downloaded all kinds of books on it as well as FliqCalendar and Colornote.  I use it mostly for work, so I have a few company videos on it as well.  I also have downloaded photos with it without any hassle whatsoever.I have found the Customer Service folks at efun ready and willing to help me whenever I've called them.  I use AT&T; for email, which evidently is not compatible with the already downloaded email app, so they helped me download maildroid and I've enjoyed using it without any problems.I did purchase a screen protector and a wallet to help protect it and I carry it everywhere I go.  It's on most of the day and only takes a few hours to juice up.Use the usb connection provided and documents flow flawlessly from my computer to the device.

While Kobo had the contract with nextbook, setting up and downloading books, including free books, was quick and easy.  Now Kobo is telling me that the device is no longer compatible with their book service.  Huh?  This device accepts all forms of books, so that's a Kobo issue, not a nextbook issue.

Bought it on a whim, was wanting an e-reader and the only one I knew anything about was a Kindle Fire.  At first I was thrilled with my purchase, as it really is a bargain for the hardware specs.  Then I got into trying to use it fully.  Android is great, but this version is now pretty badly outdated.  The app stores are confusing and incomplete.  When I tried to download WordsFree, it said it was downloaded and installed, but I couldn't run, or even find it on this tablet.  Later I discovered it installed to my phone, even though I was using the tablet.  Go figure.  After numerous attempts at installing some version or another of Words with Friends, I have determined it simply isn't going to happen.  I also have yet to find any video in my collection that will play on this thing, even though the documentation indicates it should play.  I haven't had any trouble downloading or reading books, which is I suppose what I mainly bought it for.  My only complaint in that department is that I never know which library it's going to end up in.  There are 4 or 5 different libraries, and they don't seem to be combine-able.  The wi-fi works great, never had a problem there, and the browser is adequate.I have had one very big annoying problem with this thing that has knocked the score way down.  Near as I can tell, the dumb thing turns itself on and runs its battery down.  I have learned to be VERY careful about holding the power button down to select a sleep or shutdown mode rather than just tap the button to turn the screen off.  Nevertheless, more often than not, next time I pick it up to use it, it's dead.  And even when it's fully charged, battery life is pretty pathetic.In short, if all you want is an e-reader, there are better choices out there.  If you want a reader that can do basic web browsing, and you can live with it's quirks, it's a good deal for the price.

I realize its not an ipad but in my opinion, even for the price they're not very good. No google play which I bypassed by downloading the amazon App Store, that wasnt a big deal but after downloading 4 apps it was out of memory. Ok, not a huge problem because I bought a 16g sd card for it. Downloaded fruit ninja and tried to play it and it doesn't have a, old enough processor for such a simple game. First it times out and quits or it locks up after a few seconds if you're lucky enough o get that far. It does have a lot of free book downloads and you can use netflix and Hulu on it so if that's all you're after it's not bad. I was embarrassed when one of the people I bought it for showed me the tablet she got her nephews for 30 dollars less that had a camera, newer version of android, google play and ran twenty times better than this.

I wanted an eReader that wasn't proprietary and that would browse the web and email. This was my first Android device. I don't have a smart phone. I had it up and running quickly without much frustration.I intalled the Nook app and the Kindle App so I can buy from both. I installed the Overdrive app needed to read free books from my library.I installed Amazon's android marketplace and Get Jar as well. I don't care that I can't use the Google marketplace without rooting. Has not been a problem for me.I love that I can buy or borrow and read books from multiple sources and are not tied down to one site. I can browse the web and check my emails too. The email app is really easy to use.The screen is easy to see during the day and night.I have had the tablet almost a year now with no problems at all other than I had to uninstall and reinstall the Nook app a couple of times and I've had to reset my router a couple times when it would not pick up the wi fi.There is a known issue with wi fi on these tablets that there is an update/fix for on the Nextbook website but mine did not have the issue.I do wish the OS was upgradeable to Android 4.0 but for under a hundred books this is a functional wi fi tablet and eReader.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid entry-level tablet", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "RYL9I2D9JGXZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been wanting a tablet for a few months, but not looking to drop hundreds of dollars on one.  I knew in my heart of hearts it would end up being a learning toy for my 3 year old (which it DID end up being).  So when this went on sale for a hundred, I snagged it.My only complaint is it has some weird app market built in and no support for Google's market, nor Amazon's.  There's a website I found that walks you through working around this issue and putting the Google Marketplace on it manually, then you can get all the cool Amazon apps (Kindle, Cloud Player, etc...)As I said, my 3 year old started playing with this almost right away with a couple freebie learning apps and loved it.  He quickly figured out how to change the desktop background and other odd things and was able to bring me up to speed on it.As far as durability goes, we always supervised tablet play and my 3 year old is pretty mature for his age, but accidents happen and this has held up for almost a year with no major problems to speak of.Now that my kid is onto other things, I use this primarily as a Kindle and e-mail in bed, and my wife uses it for Facebook and light web surfing.The battery is pretty good, but you HAVE to turn it all the way off when you're not using it.  The problem there is that it takes a solid 2 minutes to boot up.  There's a sleep mode which comes back up instantly, but 12 hours in sleep mode, not plugged in will kill the battery.  I leave mine plugged in most of the time anyway and use sleep mode, so it's not a big deal.If you want to get a tablet to see if you'll like it or want to get a young child a tablet that won't be the end of the world if they drop it and break it, I highly recommend this.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "CHEAP tablet - cheap tablet", "Author": "Upstate New York Reader", "ReviewID": "RP54XIWIO3BD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 7\" Nextbook tablet is sold at an excellent price - given its features.  However a number of compromises were made in its design.  Though I will not compare this tablet to the Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi, it is the machine that will serve as my standard as I write.  The most obvious is the poor quality sound card - it has a very strong metallic sound as it plays mp3 or internet audio.  The clock seems to run a bit slow - as response times feel as if they are delayed.  The battery life is minimal - after not using the tablet for two days, the battery was drained.  The provided case is a cloth (felt?) bag that could easily be lost or misplaced.  A case that holds the tablet is really needed.The video is sharp, even with a 800x600 display, though I tend to not be too particular unless something is obviously off (like the sound quality, mentioned above).  However, because there is no simulated leather case, the tablet feels lighter than other 7\" tablets - once a case is attached to the tablet, this may change.  As an e-reader, it works well - I have installed both the Kindle and the Nook Apps onto the tablet and have enjoyed the reading experience.  It comes with an installed e-book program, though because I do use the Nook and Kindle devices, I have not explored this third party program.In summary - the cost is right for an inexpensive tablet; but remember, it is an expensive tablet.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed, but the kids love it", "Author": "Christy Linn", "ReviewID": "R7K9JSAQJ3RZ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My kids both got this from their grandfather.  I was so excited, because the whole reason we wanted a tablet was for my daughter.  She has Aspergers, and I have heard about the wonderful apps she could get if she had an IPad or Android tablet.  The IPad is way out of my price range, so we opted for this.  Unfortunately, the apps that would be great for her are found in the Android market only, and this Android based tablet does not support apps from teh Android market.  The kids still love them.  The picture qualities on the movies are amazing, the games they have gotten to play are great entertainment, and they just love knowing they have their own tablet.  Still, it is not serving the purpose I had intended, and if we had known that it wouldn't support the Android Market, we would have opted for another type of tablet.  If you don't need specific apps, this is a great product.  If you do, check and make sure the apps are available for this tablet.  It does support Amazon Apps for Android, but make sure they have what you need.  They don't have the ones that I am looking for, and so basically, we purched another $140.00 toy.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "dont like it", "Author": "luxanya", "ReviewID": "R126W53QGF7C3Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the Tablet is slow and it doesnt have c\u00e1mara and it doesnt run google play i didnt like itbut the shipping was great", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00501TRJO"}}
