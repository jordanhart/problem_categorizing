So, with a little research and looking, I found the Le Pan S. Same resolution, memory, and has Google play, so all the maps you want are easy to find. After a week of lots of screen time, I like it better than the iPad. Here's why:WAY cheaper...less than 1/4 the price.HD...screen has the same Res as the iPad, but it is HD, which our iPad is not.WAY cheaper :-)Android...personally, I prefer the ice cream sandwich, I have it on my phone, and I like being able to move back and forth between maps without having to go to a home screen first. Apple's one button deal is frustrating andcumbersome.Flash...it has it, our iPad doesn'tWay less expensive :DExpandable memory...takes up to 32 gig mini SD...not possible on the iPad.Same size screen but smaller body than the iPad.For what I want in a tablet, this thing rocks. Not a single issue yet, added 16 gigs, and the sucker just works every time!Buy it, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice and Easy", "Author": "UndefinedFish", "ReviewID": "RZUQ4AZ05H2B5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good tablet, owned the first one and this one is better because of the latest android.

On the original shipment 1 was DOA and returned for a replacement. All three have had a common problem with the charging port. The pins and connector on the tablet side are fairly fragile and are  provided with a lack of physical support where they are mounted. Tablet 1, charge port broke internally within 5 weeks. Could no longer be charged and was non functional. Went on LePan's website for repair assistance. They demanded that I send them a reciept before they would do anything. Scaned and emailed reciept, they said after 5 days that was not the copy that they needed.  Returned the tablet to seller.Have two remaining, both run out of memory when browsing with only one tab openAfter 12 weeks, Tablet 2 will no longer power up. Went on LePan's site and made email request  for help, was ignored by LePanTablet 3 after 16 weeks of use will  intermittently not power up and boot, has a problem with the touch screen not working properly,Have done  reset after reset.

And that's largely from people paying over two hundred bucks.  It looks like it's in the quality ballpark of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10-inch, which sells for about three fifty.TWO WEEKS LATER....Quality and performance hold up to my initial impression.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that Amazon figured out they were giving this away for $70 less than the other colors, and raised the price to match.  So it's no longer a steal, but still a very good value compared to 10\" \"name\" tablets at $50-$150 moreTHREE MONTHS LATER...Battery life is way down and wifi has gone berserk.  Would not buy this again, apparently the reviews about poor reliability are correct.AND AT THREE MONTHS AND ONE WEEK...Dead as a doornail.

It is not particularly fast, doesn't have a camera in the back and doesn't have a ton of memory.  Still, it runs well and I've taken it on 6 trips with me and it has been reliable.  One caution - the cord on it is very very skinny and breaks before you know it.  Be sure and buy a couple extra cords as it is not a standard size and not carried in stores so you are stuck with waiting for the charging cable to come if you break it!  The cables are only $5.99 on the le pan website so that's good.  There are more expensive cables on Amazon - if I knew that they were stronger cables I might buy one.
