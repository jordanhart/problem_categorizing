Its really a great device for these purposes.The system  never hangs and working fast. The device has a reasonable price compared to its specifications. In my mind, it beats the other famous brands like Samsung.Samsung tablets and mobiles hang a lot. But HP have made this device really perfect.The only thing in this device is that it has no 3G option. I use the internet too much, but I have solved this issue by buying a Huawei wifi 3G router which convert 3G to wifi. The HP wifi is really working nice and fast. I have no problems here.

I was surprised to find out that the micro USB port is only useful for charging the tablet.  My micro usb sd card adapter would not work (spoke with HP technical support this function is not supported in the slate).  My digital camera uses SD cards, so I purchased a micro SD card with the adapter.  After trying this out, I decided that it would not be practical to view my photographs using the micro sd card.  Reason - I would be constantly taking the micro sd card out of the adapter in the camera, then placing the micro sd card in the tablet. Micro sd cards are extremely fragile, in fact the one I bought was damaged the first time I put it in the adapter.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Go Samsung", "Author": "howdydoo", "ReviewID": "R2GJPHI5HVD6R2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this device for my 14 year old son and after 2 weeks the power input literally came apart.
