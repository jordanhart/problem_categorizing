{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow, well worth the money!", "Author": "Chris in Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R3HNT9UGAUK35T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have several Android devices - phones and other tablets. I wanted a tablet for my daughter for Christmas; she is 8, and very tablet savvy (they use them at school, and also she uses mine). The pink case sold me on it, and the price (< $80 delivered). However, I was skeptical of the cost, and how functional it would really be.First off, it shipped very fast by USPS. It arrived within a few days. It was pristine. Along with the tablet was a screen protector, USB cable, charger, USB type-A adapter (which I assume is to connect USB devices such as flash drives and *maybe* keyboard - I plan to test both of these later today), earbud headphones and a decent (although unnecessary) stylus. Initially, I thought the screen was scratched, and not very responsive, but there is a protective plastic cover over it. Take that off, and put the screen protector on instead and it looks and works great. The capacitive touch is very good, especially considering the price.It has decent performance. It came right up on my office network, and worked flawlessly. Netflix streamed very smoothly. Video playback from Netflix and MP4 files I copied from my PC worked great. Audio playback was reasonable for a tablet, and sounded very good with headphones. Sound through the speaker with video and audio playback was fine (plenty loud). Skype worked fine also, as did various games I tried (Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja come installed). The Android app store came right up, and I had no problem downloading apps and music.By default, the tablet comes in USB storage device mode, which did not work with Windows 7 x64. Not sure why. I switched the tablet to Media Device mode and was able to copy photos, music and video to it with no issues. The popup keyboard worked fine; no issues. Typing emails and texts works great; it synced right up to my Gmail account no problem.Overall, I am very impressed. This is well worth the money. The display is nice, and very readable. The battery seems comparable to my wife's Nook Color. With a bit of tweaking, this could be a fantastic tablet for anyone. Well worth the money. In fact, I am amazed at the price. I highly recommend.MORE INFO - NEXT DAYSome additional info for those considering this tablet. The USB port is a micro USB, same as what you find on most Android smart phones and tablets. It uses the same cable and charger as my Motorola RAZR MAXX and my wife's DROID X2. Also, it appears to support OTG (on-the-go) USB. It will connect to a PC to transfer files (photos, documents, videos, etc.) and will also connect to a USB flash drive. Inside the box is a Type-A USB adapter cable. You connect your USB flash drive to it, then connect to the Zeepad and open the Android file manager (see photos). Also, I connected a USB keyboard this morning in the same way (via the Type-A adapter) and that worked, too. I was able to type/edit a letter, and type an email. No app was required for the keyboard, it was immediately recognized.I have tested Netflix, Skype, video playback, music playback, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run, Pinball Deluxe, Hulu Plus, Lookout (anti-virus/malware app), Dolphin Web browser, Google Play, Gmail, and Kindle app (and store) and it all works great. No complaints. I've tested WiFi in three places, including home an office, and it was flawless and fast. The SD flash card slot is a MicroSD, not the standard SD card you find in most digital cameras. The MicroSD is very common on smart phones and tablets. The Zeepad 7 looks to support 16 GB cards with no issues.Android System App says the OS is 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Kernel build is 3.0.8+. Internal storage shows max 1008 MB for downloaded apps + 1636 MB for app data, and photos/videos/music transferred from your PC. Max RAM is 353 MB. Everything else is tied up by the OS. Adding an 8 GB or 16 GB MicroSD card would be best for storing music, photos and videos, and off-loading some apps and app data (that support off-loading to removable flash, not all do). The battery is reported as being a LiFe battery, which is lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4). If true, that's impressive. LiFe is a high performance and capacity technology with a long cycle life (up to 2000 cycles, or 3-4 times that of lithium-ion). Such batteries are extremely safe; they will not explode or catch fire if over-charged or short-circuited. They can also be charged very rapidly, and can last 5+ years. So, if I can trust what the Android System App is telling me, I'm impressed. The display is 800 x 432, 60 Hz refresh, with a 160 dpi display density. It is very readable, and bright. I am running mine at 40% brightness. The CPU shows as being an ARM v7 running at 1008 MHz. The clock rate is variable; it will range between 60 and 1008 MHz automatically to reduce power drain - the OS does this automatically.Some things it does not have: obviously, no mobile networking support, only WiFi. So, you need to be in a WiFi hotspot to access the Internet (which is getting easier and easier in so many public places). There is no GPS. There is no rear-facing camera for taking photos, just the front facing camera for making video calls (that seems like an oversight to me, because a 5MP phone camera would be cheap to add). There is no Bluetooth, and no way to add it. None of these things are show-stoppers in my opinion for a $70 tablet, but would be nice if tablet designers could make some of this stuff available as modular user upgrades.Bottom line - this tablet is worth the price. Best $70 I've spent in a while.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Tablet", "Author": "Lishai", "ReviewID": "R17OA01F0IUGOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased product for my kids and I love it.

I recommend this product to everyone looking for and affordable tablet.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Value. Glad I found it.", "Author": "lj", "ReviewID": "RC3E67V4P6KGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***UPDATED*** 11/18/13I promised I would update this review as time went on. This tablet has officially died. It will not turn on or charge no matter what I try.I still stand by my earlier statements that this is a good \"value\" purchase and/or entry tablet for young kids. Although you would expect things to last more than a year. I haven't looked into what the warranty is but I'm sure we're past it. It has served its purpose for us and I will be buying a better tablet later on to replace this one.If you know your expectations and you want a tablet that is cheap for young kids who may be rough on them, I recommend this tablet as long as you are not expecting more than a year and can deal with the issues I listed below.Otherwise, I would officially change my recommendation to a \"Do not buy,\" or Buyer beware. If you are looking for a Nexus/Galaxy/iPad type experience, keep looking.***UPDATED*** See below original review***I just bought this for my son for Christmas and it came in the mail today. It has an expandable micro sd card slot (TF)and most people will probably need it. (Keep reading) I bought this one: SanDisk microSDHC 8GB Class 2 Card with SD Adapter (SDSDQ-8192). I've always found Sandisk to be pretty reliable. The onboard memory states 4 gb but the available memory was about 1gb so keep that in mind if it's important to you. Memory cards are dirt cheap and can easily get you where you want cheaper than going the \"other\" route.I took the pad out to play with it some. It comes installed with Angry Birds, Netflix, Facebook, Fruit Ninja, Play Store, Adobe flash player and of course your regular items (wallpaper, camera, clock widget, browser, wifi, etc.)Some have said the packaging had a knockoff look. A better choice of words would be that it has \"generic\" packaging. It's not a ripoff or knockoff which connotes images of backstreet deals from some guys trunk. That's not a fair assessment of this product. The instruction booklet is admittedly small but who needs an instruction booklet to run a tablet?My only concerns are that it withstands the test of time and the 10 year old. It seems well built. (One minor design flaw is the screen and the outer frame aren't flush with each other so there is a gap. It will definitely collect dirt and be hard to get out.) Not a deciding factor but I can see it getting on my OCD nerves. The camera is also average at best but I never understood why people needed a great camera for a tablet. (Is a tablet really going to be your go to camera for things like vacation?)We bought this for our 10 yr old son. As such I think it's important for people to understand what this tablet competes with. It would be a mistake to compare this to the iPad for both good and bad reasons.It isn't in competition with the iPad but rather the iPod touch. We went with this instead of the iTouch and saved a lot of $. It was $69 for a 4gb Android tablet (expandable to 32) vs. $199 for a 16gb iTouch (not expandable.)I think we made the right choice and I think he will like it. Good luck everyone. Be smart.I will update this review after Christmas when the tablet sees regular daily use.****UPDATE***It's always good to come back and reevaluate a product after the newness has worn off and you can think more objectively. My overall feeling on the tablet hasn't changed much. I would still recommend it to the target audience that I mentioned above. Again, if you are looking for a backup to your laptop or an alternative to an iPad, this probably isn't for you. But for those who have read the description and know what you're getting, this will still be a great product.Here are my impressions over the past week of regular use:Screen: I start with the screen because at first I was turned off by the screen. It is more of a durable plastic. However when I go to my Galaxy tablet and come back to it I am glad for the build and glad that my kids have the Zeepad. It's perfect for them.As such you should know though that it will probably show marks. I'm fine with that. After all it comes with a stylus. The screen protector that comes with it is lacking and we have been looking (unsuccessfully for some that will fit it). Screen protectors for a 7\" tablet Do NOT fit the Zeepad. It is slightly smaller than 7\" so keep that in mind. Also finding a case has been a bit challenging. Universal cases that hold the corners cause it rub against the power button (which may be a design flaw). Nevertheless none of these things would cause me to fret.While I am glad that the screen is durable, others may be turned off of it if they are used to the high glossy, colorful screens. The Zeepad will look dull in comparison but again who are you buying it for?One other issue that has given me pause is the wifi. It works great but it can be quirky at times. One time it was turned off and after selecting on it would immediately turn off again. It would continue to do this until we finally shut it down. After a little while it worked fine. Maybe this was a one time thing. It happens. Also the clock constantly reverts itself to January 1, 1970. I don't know the significance of that date (LOL) but I finally solved this by checking the setting to sync the clock with the network when connected to wifi. Again, maybe this is an isolated event.The battery: I would take off a 1/2 star for the screen build and another 1/2 star for the battery. It definitely doesn't seem to last long but kids do forget to charge things. If you travel a lot this could be an issue for you. You might get a converter to get around this. (Finding a car charger might be difficult. The AC power cord is of the small, round variety.)One last thing: the memory. I said in my original review that the memory issue (comes stock with around 1GB available) could be worked around with a memory card. That is still technically true but in reality it has proven a little more difficult to run apps solely from the memory card. This could be an Android limitation as I am still new to the Android ecosystem. There is an app called App to SD which has made it a little more simpler but I am still not sure that it frees much space on the tablet. There are simply some games that you won't be able to play on this tablet. (So far it seems to be the racing games: Need for Speed, Asphalt, etc.) These use a lot of memory.While it may seem that I have changed my mind on this tablet because of these comments, in reality I haven't. I still consider it a good purchase and the proof of that is the recipient still enjoys it and loves it. However I wanted to be thorough for those who were still thinking of purchasing. All things considered I would still rate this a solid 4 star product and worth the risk if you understand who the target audience is and should be and also temper your expectations in regards to other similar products.PS - Just FYI. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews on this product because of shipping issues. Please read the reviews and find out if this product is for you. I am sad that others had shipping problems. Ours arrived in good time, from West coast to East coast during Christmas rush. Research the seller. There are probably some drop shippers used by Amazon that have nothing to do with the company that makes them. I have seen 2 or 3 different sellers to these.Hope this helps.**BATTERY UPDATE**Some users have experienced issues with the battery. I have monitored this with my son and we have come to the conclusion that the battery life is approximately 2-3 hours. It seems to be about 2.5 hours on average. This is basically Minecraft (which is all he plays) and nothing else. We have monitored it with low power usage apps and received about the same results. In short, you would be fortunate to get over 3 assuming all tablets are the same and this is the norm for these batteries.There was also an issue with the charger. It sometimes prefers certain outlets. Some outlets won't charge it correctly. I am assuming this is an adapter issue since we live in the USA. The adapter seems generic and I am currently trying to find a backup just in case.This still doesn't change much from my initial review but I wanted to keep the review updated. I always appreciated it when people would continue to be open minded toward their products and let others know how it was going.The battery issue may be disappointing to some but as I said above, it really all depends on who you're buying it for. My son has learned to work around it by keeping it charged and in all honesty kids need limits anyway. Long car trips could pose a problem but a converter would do the trick.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - This is a worse than bad SCAM", "Author": "Always Already \"Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2A9TL4NZY9ZAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can something be worse than bad you might ask. I ordered this product on Jan 24, 2013 from Amazon. I was told it would be shipped from China and I could expect a longer delivery time.  It finally arrived on Feb 26. The tablet did turn on but could NOT be charged.  I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact the seller.  The seller responded that I would have to ship the item back to China at my expense which I did ship it back and kept my proof of mailing and it cost another $30.96.  I shipped it back on March 1, 2013.  It is now May 1, 2013 and the seller via email keeps telling me they will refund my money (less $30.96) \"as soon as they receive the item\".  Well, guess what? After 60 days I do not believe they will ever receive the item.So this is how it can be worse than bad.  Amazon will do nothing and the seller will do nothing and I have lost my original purchase price plus another $30.96 so that I might be able to participate in this scheme.

But I'm certainly glad I took the risk. Considering I wanted this device mostly as an e-reader, the tablet would be worth the price even if all it i did was respond to touch and read PDF's. But it does a lot more. The right thing to do is to not have high expectations. I mean, after all, it's incredibly inexpensive. But I am honestly surprised as to how functional this tablet is.I'll start by listing the cons to get them out the way:-Ports and jacks quality: poor(Some of the physical ports, like the AC and micro USB may not align perfectly. You may need to push hard.)-UI virtual movement response: seldom slight lag.(The UI response lag is slightly noticeable at times, but not significant. Most of the time it responds very well, you have to be very picky to care for a few hundred milliseconds)-Bluetooth: None-Technical Support: Poor/Non-existentNow for the Pros:-Android 4.0 : Excellent OS & UI-Rooted!: Root access enabled(You'll be able to install apps that require root access)-Graphic processing: Impressive(I was able to play Raging Thunder 2, Angry birds Starwars, and some other demanding games without any lag)-G-Sensor: Yes-Display and touch response: Good(The display is much better than others have described it. The touch response is on point)-Micro USB OTG: Allows you to plugin many common USB devices (have tried Flash drives, Mice, Keyboards)-Included Bonus: Ear buds, Micro USB to OTG cable, Screen protector(perfect fit), USB to PC cable, Tablet Pen.Other observations & comments:-The device comes with a proprietary charger, which I thought was kinda lame, until I discovered you can also charge the device using any Micro-USB charger (Recommended use: 5v - 2A).-No micro HDMI (Oh well)-Google Voice recognition works great at a fair distance.-Running: ES File Explorer with LAN file management - Good, Android VNC client - Good, Fling - Good, Google Play - No limitations, SuperUser - Good, ConnectBot - Good, AutoKiller - Good, Terminal Emulator - Good, Tasker - Limited.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME affordable tablet", "Author": "A friendly helper", "ReviewID": "R2MQFNS4QOWYK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best buys i have gotten.

I was pleasantly surprised though. This little tablet is very responsive, the build quality is pretty good, and it even has expandable memory (which my more expensive tablet does not). I bought this as a xmas gift for my girlfriend and overall I'm really happy with it. My only real gripe with it is the screen, but for the price I can't complain. There's no dead pixels or anything, you can kinda just tell the screen is cheap based on viewing angles and quality of images. It's really not that bad though and again, for $80 what do you expect. I especially like the size of this device. It's nice and compact and fits easily in my sweatshirt pocket but yet it's still big enough to where you can set it down and watch something on it.

It is not fancy, not top of the line. It has a low quality feel to it, however, do not be fooled. This is a very good tablet to do your daily things, without having the fear to break your $200-$500 tablet.Let me mention some of the pros and cons of this machine, and this is my personal observation.Pros:For the price, it is pretty rugged and well made, you won't break it easily (but do not test it :-))It has Google Play apps, which is important.It is not large, can fit into a large pocket, or holder.Battery life is considerably long and that makes it great for travel.Easy to touch by finger and price is very affordable.Cons:The volume does not go to levels that you could hear some stations, prepare to use headphones in some cases.No GPS is installed in this machine, map directions cannot be used on road.App pages are limited, but it still isn't bad.Camera quality is very basic. Do not expect to have high quality pics.Overall, I am very happy with this tablet so far. It is an affordable machine, and you get what you pay for. I also have a Samsung S2 which is much higher in quality on all levels. But hey, this is a machine that if you break, it won't break your heart with it.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

Note: You should charge it as soon as you get it because it takes 6hrs to charge the first 2 times, this is stated in the manual. Also, be careful with the wall charger, mine needed to be adjusted before it could begin charging the tablet. If you charge by USB it might take longer, i found that the wall charger is quicker. YOU SHOULD BUY MEMORY EXPANSION, it's not optional if you plan on adding a lot of items on your tablet you get 1 GB of on-board storage. Make sure you are careful not to drop it, i would not recommend that at all because it doesn't seem like it is able to take much damage. Personally i bought a tablet case with a keyboard a good 1 to use is the 7\" Tablet Stand with USB Keyboard - Black Faux Leather Carrying Case, there is a converter that comes with this tablet that you can hook up to the cases keyboard USB cable. The browsing speed is quite nice and the apps are amazing since they come from the Google play-store. You can stream any type of online content like from YouTube or the web. One thing i found odd is that when your on the main screen and you click the search magnifying glass you see a brief image of previous YouTube videos that you've watched. In my opinion i suggest you uninstall the YouTube app that comes with the tablet and re-install a newer one which fixed my problem. Tip: If you put a SD card in and you want to get it out you push the SD card in and then release it and it will come out. If you decide you want to link a YouTube account with your tablet, and each time you try to login you get an error message. You might need to do the 2-step verification for the Google account you want to link with(additional help just ask). This is an overall good product.

My husband is thinking of the 9 in model. I would recommend getting a case/cover and an 8 or 16 GB micro SD for additional memory. ***Remember this tablet is not specific for any age of user.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

They both work fine. Download of Apps is easy and the apps it comes with are very cool and all work.Reviews mentioned batery issues, some things we noticed and settings we changed that helped extend the battery run time considerably are as follows: When you first get the Zeepad the instructions say to charge them for six hours before the first use. Make sure and do that but when you connect the charger the plug that goes into the tablet will not go all the way in until the plug dissapears into the charger input so don't try to force it all the way in. When it \"clicks\" it's in as far as it can go. There will be a little of the silver part of the plug still visible that does not go into the tablet charger port. If you force it you might damage the unit.  After the first charge the instructions say charge for only 4hours. Do not overcharge and it would be good to set a timer so that you don't over charge the battery. The battery it comes with can be charged and discharged over 2 thousand times but it does not like to be over charged. Also don't not store the unit with a 100% charge for long periods of time, these new batteries like to be stored with 50-40% power only. If they are left to sit for a long time with 100% charge it can damage the structure of the batteries.  Rune time: The main killer of the battery run time is,  the screen brightness. Lower it as the screen is super bright and at only 7 inches they cannot build it with a very large battery. Leaving the screen on the super bright setting eats the batteries pretty quickly. The next big juice hog is the wifi. If yu are not going to be downloading apps, surfing or sending e-mails turn on airplane mode which turns off wiifi. Leaving the wifi on all the time keeps the table searching for the wifi signal and commnicating back and forth with the source and that eats the battery. Once you set it up and are using game apps ( what most kids do ) you dont need the wifi for them while they play apps anyway. If you do these two things the battery should last a bit over 2-2-1/2 hours on a 4 hour charge. Not bad. I wont get into the tech aspects as others have covered that pretty well in other reviews but considering these cost a lot less than other brands the main thing I was concerned with was, if it actually did what they were supposed to do. They both have worked fine and side by side to a samsung galaxy they donwloaded apps at just about the same speed as any other andriod tablet or i phone. The build quality is pretty good considrng the price. If you are looking for some \"special ops\" military grade hardware this is not the unit for you but if you need something to use daily under normal conditions these are pretty nice. The tablets are impressive and are worth the money. They come from overseas so shipping is not super fast. If you need them for a birthday order with plenty of time to give them a chance to ship from the factory.  If something goes wrong I will update this review but so far, these little tablets has been a very good purchase and the kids love them. Hope this info helps, The battery is not an issue but I addressed that more as most of the negative reviews had to do with them and that was the main thing I worried about when I ordered them.

Its biggest advantage is that it comes rooted from the factory. With a fast SD card (Class 6 or better), it runs full screen, full motion, video without even straining and it's compatible with Kindle. Granted, the camera isn't the greatest but, hey, look at the price and move on. The WiFi connection is rock steady and this tablet can also be set up as a Wireless Hot Spot. Audio Quality is outstanding and it even has a rudimentary Graphic Equalizer, along with sound FX, included. Obviously, the video quality isn't what an iPad or one of the more expensive Android tablets would offer but, again, look at the price and move on.

You can set up one of three different kinds of start-up security but be warned: If you password protect this tablet you MUST use a USB keyboard to log on. Otherwise, you won't get in.There are a few small, (to me at least), problems with this tablet:1) I originally purchased this tablet from Sears and those, (I purchased two for my grands), had the Adobe Reader, Skype, Netflix, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flipit, and Solitaire preloaded but this one did not. Apparently, this is a slightly different, (read: Newer), version of this tablet and that accounts for the difference in available out-of-the-box apps. That's not a con for me personally, but for those of you who buy a tablet for any of the above, be aware that you'll have to download all those apps.2) The viewing angles are actually pretty good EXCEPT....If you tilt the top of the tablet too far back, you will get what amounts to a negative image. The other viewing angles are about what you would expect with a flat screen. If you, as I did, buy this tablet with one of the keyboard cases that have the \"kickstand\" on the back, you won't have to worry about this problem except when using the tablet in Portrait position.3) The specs say it has 4Gb of internal storage but unless there is something here that I'm not aware of, this tablet has only 2.5Gb of actual, usable, internal storage. For me, that's no big deal because I'll be using it mostly as a reader for Kindle books. For someone who wants to load a bunch of apps and games, be aware: There is not as much internal storage space as you think there is. On the upside, the tablet will accept up to a 32Gb Micro SDHC card and you can also plug in a USB Flash Drive so storage space, (except for apps which just don't play well unless installed to the primary \"hard drive\"), is not really an issue.4) I'm not sure if this is really a con but I need to mention it. The battery life seems to be a bit short. I've gone from 100% to about 20% in a couple of hours of intense surfing. That said, I've also watched a 2+ hour movie with no problem at all, so it could just be me. On a brighter note, Comodo has a free battery saver app that's worth its weight in gold. So far, I've seen a 2x increase in battery life after installing that app.5) This tablet is woefully short on documentation. The included manual is nothing more than a Quick Start guide and there is a shortage of any kind of technical information about this tablet on the Net. After a bit of searching I found the manufacturer's web page, [...], but there is very little useful info there. Again, this is not a con for me personally, I do computers for a living, but the average user needs to be aware that if you buy this tablet, you'll need to do your own problem solving because there is very little in the way of help from the manufacturer.I put this tablet through rigorous testing over a period of a month. I did everything I could to it, short of actually \"Bricking\" it, (or throwing it against a wall), to see how much it could take and how well it performed. I actually got it to freeze but a quick Google session, (Hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time until the tablet shuts off [About 5 seconds]. Press and hold the power button as instructed in the manual to turn the tablet on and you're back in business), produced a solution to that problem. I can truthfully say that this tablet is built like a Timex. The Boomers who read that last will understand exactly what I mean by that and why, as a result, I'm giving this tablet a 5 star rating.I bought two of these as birthday presents for my grands and I liked them so much that I got one for me and will buy at least two more for two more of my grands. They come with everything you need, (USB OTG adapter, USB Data Cable, Stylus, Earphones, Screen protector, and Charger), and they can be used with a USB Keyboard/Mouse. You could even attach a USB Mini-Hub if you'd like. This particular version also solved the problem of the shaky charger connection and even included better quality, noise cancelling, in canal earphones.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Great Performance to Price Ratio and you're looking to break into the world of tablets, without breaking the bank, you want this tablet.

Since that tablet is no longer on the market, we purchased another \"no-name\" device, figuring it'll all be the same. Boy, we were so wrong.To start with some positives, this tablet looks cool. It is small and lightweight, and it connected to our wifi fast. Now I will elaborate on why I gave it one star. We don't expect much of those cheap tablets, we only want it to load and play the internet videos and display pictures. That is what our daughter uses it for. However, this tablet would not load the videos. Youtube website will load, but the video will be loading and loading forever. It might have loaded eventually, but I never waited for longer than 5 minutes. I figured, it it takes 5+ minuted for a simple few minutes video to load, my daughter will have a problem with it. I was very disappointed, I so wanted to keep this little tablet.Another thing we noticed, is that the tablet would shut down periodically on its own. What the heck is that, so annoying. Plus the battery life is measle, it lost 50% of its charge in about 30mins being turned on and connected to wifi. And finally, I made sure I ordered a black device. However, the one delivered to us was red. The stylus was not included either, although advertised.All in all, this parody of a tablet went back the very next day. Amazon was great, made the return easy, fast and simple. Needless to say, I would strongly advise to stay away from this product.

The manual that comes is very very tiny and also in broken English, probably used a translating program so you tend to scratch your head a bit.. that is IF you can read it, the print is so small I had to get a magnifier to read it and then discovered it was of almost no use at all.  So without any instructions it was/is hard to sort of figure out how it works.  It took me a considerable amount of time just to figure out how to set up the internet WiFi.... but once I figured out the simplicity of it.. it was set up in seconds .  The downside is that sometimes the device just does not want to let you get onto the internet even when the signal is strong.. unsure what is causing that issue... but you can come back later and try it and it might go onto the internet easily.. so don't know what is hanging it up.The device itself feels a bit flimsy but is also very light weight. The screen colors are fine and the sound is \"just ok\" .  I haven't tried Netflix yet but if there are issues I will edit this review.The battery is not very good, and I am not wild about the charger that came with it, however you can use it and play games on it while it is plugged in and being charged.  The type of battery that is in it.. the instructions say it is better to let it run out completely before you recharge it.. and if you have issues because you have charged it to soon.. to let the battery run out completely then recharge it.On the Positive side... For the price ($77.00) it is a pretty decent little handheld.  It accesses tons of games, almost all of the  same games I have on my Kindle Fire.. many many free ones and most games are between 99 cents to 2.99. The game downloads go easy and the game play is fine. The touch screen is very responsive and it takes only a gentle touch to play the games or select items.  I do plan to expand the memory with a micro sd card but may find that I don't need to.  I have half a dozen games on it right now and in less than 24 hours I am getting to understand the device. It is not a Kindle or a Ipad.. it is what it is.. which is a ok value for what you pay for it.  I dont mind the quirks with the internet for I think I will be able to figure that out as time goes by.  I originally bought it for my husband to be able to look thinks up on the internet but think I will probably just load games on it and let it go at that.. my husband will use it a bit or the grand kids will surely play the games so it was worth the price just to have a small handheld game player around for them to play.Would I buy it again? probably  Would I give it as a gift?  probably  of course this opinion is based on only having the device up and running for 24 hours  and hard to predict if it will hold up.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Mrs. Kia", "ReviewID": "R1TCM0WSC220PQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is that I have yet o find out no to put on the parental control.

I ordered it thinking how good could a $70 dollar tablet be. and how much can it really do compared to the more expensive brands and models?  Well I was surprised.  It is a bit heavier than I expected, but that just gives it a more substantial feel.I have a 'better' tablet already.  I have the ASUS Eee Pad TF101 32Gb and love it.  But I was wanting something a bit smaller that wouldn't break the bank.  I read alot on my tablet so it goes almost everywhere with me, but the ASUS can be a little big for the handbag:)  I wanted something that would fit better in my purse for on-the-go reading, but I also wanted a bit more then just an ereader in case I wanted to look something up on the internet or play a game to pass time somewhere.  Yes I could have gone with the KindleFire or Nook Tablet but they are still well over $100+.  I also like having access to the wide variety of Apps that are available with Android.  I'm not totally sure what all is available with Kindle and Nook.I saw this and several people who purchased had said they were pleased so I decided to give it a try.It connected to my home wireless easily.  The touch screen is responsive, much better than I expected. I immediatly went to Google Play and began downloading and installing Apps I wanted.  No problems there.  I went to the browser and everything was working OK except for one of my favorite web pages.  When it loaded all I got was a blank screen.  Reloading didn't help.  I went back to the Apps store and downloaded Firefox and Opera web browsers to see if they would display the page.  Finally after paying with settings I got my page to come up in Opera.  I'm really not sure why this web page was having such a problem on this tablet but i got it to work so I'm happy:)With the display only being 800x480 everything is not as crisp as my ASUS but by increasing the font size on my ebooks they read OK.  I haven't tried any videos or the camera on it yet so can't address those at this time, but then that wasn't the primary reason I wanted it.  Also haven't tried to connect it to my laptop to see how syncing and transfering files over to it works.  The web browsering and reading capabilities, in a more portable size, was what I wanted and for those pursposes I am happy with it.We'll see how it goes after a few weeks with it:)", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "She's enjoying it", "Author": "Tarche", "ReviewID": "R28MQG0WB9JW7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from a company called Goodios and it came with a pen and car charger and this company was very accurate whenever i would email them..

I wanted something simple to use for ebooks, occasional videos, web and email use.  I downloaded the Kindle App and it works flawlessly.  The capacitive touch screen is much better than the cheap Archos tablet I had (which quit after a year).  I watched part of a netflix video on the zeepad and it ran well, but the dark scenes didn't show up well due to low contrast.  All other applications I've run were plenty colorful and vibrant.  The processing speed seems better than other cheap tablets.  One little quirk, but so far I haven't been able to keep the time consistently accurate.  It goes back to some factory programmed time zone (maybe China).  The battery doesn't seem to last more than 2-3 hours with constant average use.  Also, the actual screen size is a little smaller than most 7\" tablets but not so much it matters.  The unit does resemble a large GPS navigation system in looks (which doesn't matter to me).

The hyped 3 hour run time (which isn't all that great to begin with) is in reality more like 20 minutes or less.  Charging takes awhile and the charging power supply gets warm so it seems to be working, but the battery is weak.  (wifi on notifications off, screen brightness set to ~80 percent)The screen resolution looked pretty good until I loaded some pictures and test patterns into my Ainol Elf 2 (another bargain priced brand X tablet) and compared them side by side, the Elf wins hands down.  The Zeepad does have a somewhat better viewing angle, but the display looks \"flat\" compared to the Elf.I never could get Netflix to work.  (and hadn't gotten it working on the Elf either until just recently)  Unfortunately my wife has the Zeepad now so I can't try messing with Netflix, but I suspect the newest Netflix app will work on it.If you have problems with Netflix Google for \"com.netflix.mediaclient_3.0.0 build 1010.apk\" That is the latest Netflix app and seems to be working.  No need to register with an app store and it can be found on the net for free.I  haven't decided what to do about the battery problem.

I think we are seeing the difference between acrylic and polycarbonate judging by the scratches.Battery life is still bad, but she can get ~1 hour if she turns off the wifi, and app updater (which needs wifi to work). I also got her a new charger and that has been working faster than the one supplied.

If you plan to be super productive for business, this is not your tablet because it's not powerful, but it is ok for light recreational use like kindle reading.

I am dealing with setting them up and downloading the games and such for the kids, because I want to control what they see.  Here are the issues I have noticed so far with these tablets...1.) Response time is ridiculously slow.  You hit \"Install\" and it MIGHT flip screens 30 seconds later.  If it doesn't it will \"time out\" ... Timing out happens consistently.  I don't know how the games are with response time, I haven't had the patience to even try.  The kids haven't complained, but they are just happy they have a tablet.2.) The screens aren't very sensitive.  I realize that screens can be too sensitive but I shouldn't have to jam my finger on the screen to get it to respond.  Very annoying.3.) Low quality graphics -- honestly, I didn't expect much from a $70 tablet, but just thought I would let you know. It's no ipad or Kindle with the graphic quality.4.) Battery life. .... It. Dies. FAST.  I was just TRYING to download a game on one, it gave me the \"You're at 14% notification\" and literally less than 5 minutes later when I went to plug it in, it was already down to 9%. This is supposedly a brand new tablet.  We literally got it in the mail yesterday. (Please note that we've had the other one for several weeks, so I'm not writing this review without having used this.)5.) Very cheaply made.  The Power Off button feels like it's going to fall off it's so loose. The camera is crooked and my daughters pad is coming apart in the middle. When I say \"very,\" I do mean VERY cheaply made.6.)  The \"User Manual\" is supposedly written in \"English\" however, it doesn't even make sense.  Here is a sentence from the \"User Manual\"  \"#3 Check the music file wherther damaged. Try playing other music, if the file have damaged may lead to serious noise or hop sounds.\"  ---that is letter-for-letter.  Huh?If you're wanting a serious tablet.  Avoid this one.

When it arrived I rushed to get it set up and download a ton of apps so my son could play with it as soon as he opened it. It was very easy to use although the downloading did take a while. Took approximately 10-15 mins to down load each app and I had purchased about 60 apps (along with some children's kindle books). This was fine since the tablet is priced under $100 (what did I expect, really).My sole issue with this tablet is with the charger. It does not charge well or quickly with the USB cord and the wall charger is difficult to work with. The charger plug does not fit completely into the port so I'm constantly trying to stop myself from shoving it in further. Also, if the plug is not positioned in the port exactly right the unit will not charge. I end up twisting and turning, and wiggling the plug around while constantly checking to see if the tablet is indeed charging. It's a little annoying. If it at least had an LED light that would blink or light up when the unit was charging, I would like it a lot better.Overall, it is a nice tablet especially considering the price. If I could do it over, I would probably purchase the same one again. I may look into purchasing a different charger that might fit the unit better. I did have to purchase a separate MicroSD card since only 40 of the 60 apps I purchased fit onto the tablet. But that was only an extra $20 or so.

I didn't want to get them something that would make me hurt too bad if THEY broke it.As a techie I am aware that my personal standards may be a bit high but I tried to keep my expectations in check for the purposes of  the intended use.  a 5 and 6 year old.I ordered two of these thinking that less than 80.00 a piece for a \"tech toy\" can't be horrible.  Boy was I wrong.  The quality of the propduct build was about what I expected, plastic, and cheap plastic at that.  The screen, while I didn't expect it to be up to par with something like a Nexus 7, I didn't think it would be practically unviewable in portrait mode, and low visibility from certain angles even in landscape mode.I knew it would be slow, I fully expected (thus appreciated) the lag in functions.  The battery life however was a shocker.  One was dead in about 2.5 hours and the other made it about 3 hours.  Not acceptable no matter how inexpensive it was.The other thing that I noticed is that one of the tablets (though they were identical) did NOT have Zeepad branding, it was a generic of a generic, nothing to cry about since as I said before they were identical in every other way.The packaging and contents are also of a generic caliber.  One came with earphones and a cheap sylus, the other came with a cheap stylus/pen and a screen protector.Another thing that really bothered me was the jailbroken state they are in.  Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the company. I can't say that the software was \"stolen\" because Android is largely open source however it did seem to be a bit janky and illegitimate.One tablet was in an Asian language with little hope to change it to english, fortunately I'm used to android and it's icons so I was able to make it through.Overall it just wasn't worth it for me to keep them, Got them on Friday, sent them back today.  Decided to get my babies a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 instead.  They are worth the extra hundred bucks a piece :).If you order this your mileage may vary depending on your expectations of course.

My must-have feature was the ability to do Skype calls and it worked pretty well. It comes with the real Google Play Store, so it would be easy to install your favorite applications. Here some points to ponder:- Only front camera for video calling. The resolution is pretty decent, though the camera application was very basic. Fixed installing another app from the Play Store.- No GPS.- The items on the screen \"stretch\" when tablet is held vertical. No big deal, but I think that means it would be better to use it only in horizontal orientation.- Also, when transitioning (moving the tablet) between horizontal & vertical, the screen gets a little crazy swapping from vertical to horizontal. It calms down when stabilized.- Highly recommended to install the adhesive screen protector immediately after opening. Got some scratches for normal use.- Tested Skype and Youtube and both worked fine.- I couldn't test the ports or the USB cable. Adhesive screen protector and a stylus are included.EDIT: My brother told me they are having problems leaving Skype enabled all the time. I don't know what happens but it shows as if in disconnected status. Also, it seems the volume of the speakers and the sound quality is very low when in a call, compared to a Galaxy Tab 2. I assume it would be better to use headphones.EDIT2: Now that I have it back and using it everyday, I can say that is slow. I guess this is related to the small memory (512Mb). When browsing, switching between applications, or using an app constantly, it gets slower. Sometimes I get the msg saying that an app has stopped, but I just choose \"Wait\" and soon it gets back again. I've installed a memory management app so when the memory usage falls below 25% I run a \"quick boost\" to recover control. I'm using it mostly to watch Netflix in my bed (with headphones of course, as I said the speakers are awful), and it works pretty fine. Also, on the PROS side, is pretty tough; it has fallen a few times, and stands the beats as a champ. I tried to use a microSD card to free storage space, but it couldn't recognize it, don't know if the beats have something to do. The battery life is normal and the wifi reception is good.In summary, again, is pretty decent for the price but as it needs some maintenance, I would say is not recommended for a non-tech person.

Pay attention to the delivery date.  It still came 10 days earlier than promised.  I only mention this because I didn't pay attention and wondered when it would show up.  Anyway I have an HP iPaq PDA that holds a lot of my day to day info and it is not getting younger. I don't want the data on my smartphone as I don't want it hacked.  I need to replace the PDA before it dies.  Looking at replacement costs was eye opening to say the least, 500 smackers.  Forget about it.  Then I thought, hey get a 7\" tablet, bigger screen and lots of apps.  I didn't want anything too expensive as it would be an offline one or two use device.  I saw that the Zeepad had a lot of good reviews and got one.  I've had it for several weeks and have punched a lot of data into it.  It is slow and punching data in is time consuming as sometimes the character doesn't register.  But for my purposes, I don't care as I will be inputting once and reading hundreds of times.  As I said slow, you click and then wait 3 or 4 secs but I am a very patient person and it doesn't bother me that much, though I gave 4 stars because of it.  The charger's plug to the tablet is longer than the socket on mine so it doesn't fit all the way in but it charges.  Do not force the plug into socket or you may break it.  One review says the prongs to the wall socket broke, I checked to see if mine were loose and I recommend you do the same.  Bottom line, this is an $80 tablet not a $200 tablet and you have to expect it will not work the same.  If you are looking for an all around excellent, fast 7\" tablet get the Kindle Fire, if you need it for a one or two use device I recommend the ZeePad.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!!", "Author": "Ashton Brereton", "ReviewID": "R3DP8OKRDZPNEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a fully functional tablet that would allow me, wirelessly, to access the internet, check and write emails, and access files on computers on my home network - from anywhere in or around my home - at a price below $100. The Zeepad 7.0 cost me $81.95 - delivered,  It does everything I wanted - flawlessly. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have a backward facing camera - so I can't can't scan documents. The front-facing camera works perfectly. So, in sum, I recommend it unreservedly - at the price.UPDATE:I have been using the Zeepad more often now and found that the built-in browser was somewhat slow - taking seconds to access main pages for sites such as CNN, NBC and BBC - and occasionally the browser froze. So, I installed Opera Mini for tablets (free) and found the increase in speed of access to web pages was dramatic. Access is now in less than a second, the formatting of the pages was changed to suit the Zeepad screen, the font size was automatically increased, scrolling is a breeze and all the stories and information are available.

That it runs the standard Google Play Store and standard apps is wonderful.  But aside from the software, the hardware is about as minimal as possible to still run Android 4.2.  I got one of these for my parents and one for us, with the sole intent of making them both digital photo frames.  It's great for that purpose, but I wouldn't suggest it as a regular tablet.  We also have a Kindle Fire HDX that's about the same size but twice the price, and the Kindle is still the better bang for the buck tablet-wise.  This Zeepad tablet has a terrible viewing angle if you try to use it in portrait mode.  But if you want a pretty cool and inexpensive digital photo frame, this is a good option.  I run the Dayframe app and replaced the standard charger with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EJHH20/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15 and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9PO5AM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_27 and have it sitting horizontally (landscape) in an AmazonBasics stand http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZT4VA0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_29 at about eye level when sitting.

So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the \"manual\" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the \"seller\" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these.

I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase that I wanted to submit a review to save others the time, hassle and money. The first problem occurred when I attempted to read the user manual before doing anything with the tablet. It was horrific! The manual was written with english words but the grammatical errors, spelling errors and everything else about it was so poor that I couldn't make sense of it. It was like reading a different language with english words. Once I let it charge for the day I gave it a try, only to be completely disappointed! I realize I didn't purchase an iPad so I was willing to give it a chance. I tried to play a netflix from it only to find that I could hardly make out the image on the  screen. I also had to hold the tablet at one exact angle in order to even see anything. The sound was so poor I couldn't tell anything was even coming out of the speaker until I turned it over and held it right up to my ear. (That was after I had turned up all of the sound). The final complaint and what lead me to my decision to return it, (as if the above is not enough) is that there is such a delay when pressing an icon that I felt like I had to keep pushing it to make sure it was recognizing my touch. Actually, I can't say there is anything good about this tablet. Buyer beware, Do NOT but this! I don't even want to give it one star.

Two weeks later when he calls he talks to random people at the company. They tell him they have the tablet but did not have the money order. To make a long story short.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money in case she broke it or didn't take care of it, so after looking on here and reading all the reviews I bought her this one. I gotta say I was really surprised with this because I was expecting it to be on the lower quality side because of the price. But it's actually really nice. Have a lot of pros and some cons for this tablet:Pros:-Very heavy duty but still light weight which I like. Seems like it'll last longer and it doesn't seem like it'll break easy if dropped.-Came with a bunch of stuff including charger, stylus, headphones and 2 USB chords-Very easy to set up WiFi and all the time/location settings.-Going between screens, closing out programs and personalizing tablet is super easy to do.-WiFi connectivity is great and have had no problems connecting to the house router and actually picked up a ton of other routers in the area too when it was searching for connections.-Touch screen works great. Using the stylus works even better.-All apps seem to work well - liked how there were a lot already installed like YouTube and Angry Birds.-Big pro for me was that you can turn this tablet off and on to save battery life. And it doesn't just go into \"sleep mode\" like the ipad, it actually turns off which is very nice.-Like how there's a slot for the SD card to add more storage to device.-Camera seems to work great. Can take pictures or record video and switch between the dual cameras. (Resolution is meh though - see below in 'Cons')-Charging is actually really quick. Takes maybe an hour or so to get the battery up to 100% once it's down to nothing.-Gets all the same apps as the iPad using the Google Play store (pretty much it's just like an Android phone but bigger and you can't make phone calls)Cons:-Will lag if you have too many programs open at the same time (which makes sense as the memory isn't that high).-Speakers aren't all that great. I think that's why they included the headphones because the highest volume is still kind of hard to hear sometimes depending on what you're listening too.-Resolution is alright. Not as good as the ipad or Windows tablet though. But it's not horrible, just not HD or anything.I'd definitely recommend this for a kid that wants a tablet.

For that purpose, and considering the low price, it works great.  Mine came with Jelly Bean pre-installed.  The box even says \"Jelly Bean\" on it.  The About screen in the OS confirms this as well.  Unlike other ZeePads with Android ICS, this updated model was NOT rooted out of the box.The first thing I did to prep this for her was to root it using \"Root with Restore by Bin4ry\", from the XDA forums, and then installed Ad-Away and Root Cleaner.  I also uninstalled the apps and games she doesn't use to free up some memory - root not required.Battery life is so-so.  A couple hours of gaming will kill it, but it lasts a decent amount of time for other tasks.  The back of the tablet does get quite warm while gaming.  Performance is decent, however a task killing app is useful for freeing up some memory.  The screen is OK as well and responds to touch accurately.  The viewing angle is quite limited compared to a high end IPS display, though the update speed is plenty fast for her games and doesn't exhibit motion blur.I didn't find any Chinese spamware on this tablet as I did on the Star N9500 phone that I purchased and reviewed here on Amazon.UPDATE 02-20-2014: The tablet has degraded substantially with light use.

Love the multi-function USB port.  Love that it charges either from the charger port or USB.  For the price, this is an impressive little tablet.  Didn't like the 800x400 screen pixels... too few really.  But it works and aside from typical \"short freeze\" lag factors common in Android devices, this is a great little system at $70.  The device itself I give a solid 4+ stars.THE SHIPPING and ADVERTISING.  Not so spiffy.  The ad seems to change from time to time and what was originally listed as \"up to 1200 x 600 graphics resolution\" turned out to be significantly less.  In truth, 800x400 just doesn't quite cut it.  It limits the number of icons one can have on one screen.  Now if that had been advertised would be fine.  Noticed at times the screen says just that.  But at other times it advertises the 1200 x 600 and (while I don't know why), that's going to cause problem expectations.But the real problem I had (and what knocked this down to 3 stars), when purchased from \"WorryFree Gadgets\"... it came shipped in its own box loose-packed inside an Amazon box-- no padding to keep it from bumping around.  Meh, these packages take quite a bit of bumping anyway, so not too worried.  But... Amazon box was in fine shape while the Zeepad box was significantly crushed.  Since the outer box was fine, that means it was PACKED in that condition.  As a result while the Zeepad itself seemed okay, the screen protector packed as a \"bonus item\" in the top of the box was also crushed.  Not happy with that.The bonuses were nice.  The Zeepad stylus, the screen protector (if it hadn't been damaged *at the time of shipping*), the mini-usb adapter, everything was fine.  But I don't have much tolerance for a merchant taking a visibly and significantly damaged box and going ahead and shipping it without even inspecting the contents.  That's lazy and it's just not right.So... three stars.  Like other users I give the Zeepad itself a thumbs-up value-for-the-buck rating.  For the shipping and merchant care, not so much.  The question I have:  was it shipped directly from the merchant or from Amazon itself?  The screen said \"Sold by Goodios and Fulfilled by Amazon.\"  So which is it... Worry-Free Gadgets, Goodios or Amazon to blame for shoddy packing?  Who crushed the inner box and who sent it out in that condition?  Dunno.  It got it returned though, and Amazon was great about that as always... with a refund to my account in less than 24 hours and free UPS pickup (just cannot beat Amazon on customer service).This is a product that cannot be exchanged, only returned.  That's fine because in truth, I want a bit better resolution screen if available-- and the new Zeepads are just now hitting the market with DOUBLE THE MEMORY for about $10 more (nice coincidence there).Despite the problems I still <3 Amazon, and the Zeepad is everything everyone raves about.  For a starter Android tablet or one for kids... this is a good choice.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "PAY FOR QUALITY!!!!", "Author": "Deashia Henderson", "ReviewID": "R3RD0BSG5GYMF9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Tablet is at a very affordable price for a reason the quality sucks.

My only complaint is that it doesn't hold a charge for too long (about 2 hours). So as long as you remember to charge it, you are fine.

(Just wanted to say that before anyone jumps down my throat) Bought for my mom, who has cancer and lives with me. I handled it mostly to help her set it up and we noticed problems right off the bat. We weren't expecting anything fancy, but to work and be able to get some use out of it would have been appropriate for the price paid I think. We charged it to full first thing, set it up a little bit, turned it off with the charge at 74 percent and turned it back on 30 minutes later to discover the battery had completely drained. To our disappointment, it does that every time. The touch screen is unresponsive at times especially in certain areas, you have to press really hard and sometimes even then it does not respond. There are specks in the back of the lcd screen, enough to be bothersome when using. My mom is too polite to want to return it when I mentioned it she said no, she already threw out the box it came in anyways and said it'll be alright and she feels bad. At first it was extremely slow to charge, taking hours to just get even halfway, and sometimes after it has been charged all the way and she disconnects the charger the full charge goes right back down to only a barely charged within seconds without doing anything. I have been trying to contact amazon's customer service, I remember years ago they had the best customer service if ever there was a problem, now I can't even get ahold of them. I don't have a phone with minutes right now but have been trying to submit their online forms and have been getting a \"We're sorry. There was an error trying to send your e-mail. Please try again in a few minutes or contact us by phone.\" Message. I have been trying several times a day everyday, it doesn't look like they are fixing the form problem. I have scoured the internet for their customer service address but it seems like all of them have been disabled.

He is VERY rough with toys and anything that's electronic. I was hesitant to give him a tablet of any kind but he had shown great interest in using his mom's Kindle Fire (under her watchful eye!), including practicing reading skills, so I decided to go with a budget-priced tablet and get him one of his own. We are now at week 3 with his use of the Zeepad and so far, so good! He uses it daily for Netflix, Angry Birds and reading e-books. I estimate he's put at least 80 hours of use into the tablet and it still functions perfectly.I was VERY pleased with the quality of the video, given the price range. I was expecting Netflix movies to appear blocky and lo-res looking but that's not at all the case. I'm very pleased with the overall performance of this tablet. I've had no problems logging into Google Play and installing new apps. Keep in mind - this tablet is NOT going to set speed records. Yes, there are lag times in contrast to higher priced tablets but we're talking maybe 1 to possibly 5 seconds (Netflix in particular can take several seconds to boot up). But once an app is up and running, we've had no performance problems.One BIG caution. The battery life is very short before recharging is required. He usually just stays plugged in (you can charge and use the device at the same time) to avoid having the tablet shut down during a record-breaking Angry Birds game. I estimate the battery life is 2 to 2.5 hours tops.If you are able to cope with the short battery life, I highly recommend the Zeepad for kids and for anyone who is looking for a low-priced tablet.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!", "Author": "Stephanie Starling", "ReviewID": "RYXUHR4KV71IL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this for our 3 year old because she loves to play on our phones.

I was hopeful when it displayed a green battery - but instantly it turned red, and powered off.I tried to connect with the micro usb to usb cord.  It did turn on momentarily with a logo, then immediately shut down.The bottom edge border of the tablet seemed raised, and when I pressed on it, it clicked into place.  Hoping this helped with the alignment, I tried to attach the power source again.The green battery light appeared only for an instant, when I moved it on to a table to charge.  This made the powersource lose a solid connection and again this red battery light appeared.I'm very disappointed.

Had a terrible time connecting it to the computer by USB, but finally figured out that an option to \"debug the USB connection\" was checked off.  Sounds like a good thing to do whatever it is, but it stopped the USB connection.  Unchecked it, and bang, it was connected.Haven't found any apps it would not run, mostly games.  Battery life isn't great, but it uses the same micro USB as the cell phones we have, so finding a charger and cable is no problem around the house.  Added a 16 GB memory chip, so the Zeepad is loaded with videos, talking books, epub books, and handles all well.

risk I use avg pro its still$15 bucks but I have it installed on 4 devices so worth the money u can get it in the play store this tablet is awesome but an adult should go thru all the settings and run spywear b4 handing it over to kids as I said in my updates whoever rooted the device changed the settings if u run avg it will walk u thru the settings at the end of the scan to protect your deviceI bought this tablet for my 18 month old daughter because she is determined to keep up with her older brothers and loves all the learning apps available for young toddlers I must say this tablet is great for her im going to try to find a kid tuff case of course the tablet is on the cheaper side I only paid 76 bucks im not complaining all the apps work and this tab has options to delete installed apps and options to move apps to sd card I did not have those options on my galaxy so not bad at all shes gonna be so excited to play her word games when she wakes up from naptimeUpdateJust realized this tab comes rooted I know this is a high selling point for some it makes me a little nervous but so far so good I will update again if anything else pops upUpdateSo my daughter loves it the abc phonics games are a must for anyone with young toddlers the zeepad is definatly great so far of course the speakers suck and itscheap plastic its only $76 bucks I recommend going thru the settings whoever rooted it set those kind of weird still tweaking them my daughter doesnt want to let go of the thing its great for kids and budgets I cnt afford an ipad and if I could im not handing It to my child so this is a great way for u to let your youngster play without losing out on $500 or more if they drop itUpdateDay 2 with the zeepad the charger works its battery life definatly isnt great and it depletes even when your not using the tablet but I also believe those small annoyances to be the reason the zeepad is available for such a cheap price its a wonderful beginner tablet for young kids it comes already installed with kids games and is obviously intended for kids but as I said before if your on a budget an adult could find this useful also its not the fastest or the best thats why its so cheap but its still more than enough for my daughter to watch her shows and play her apps I would definatly recommend this tablet to others great purchaseUpdateThe tablet is still working despite the fact my 18 month old has been drooling and pushing on the screen a little harder than I like then again I bought her the zeepad so she wouldnt abuse my galaxy anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain reading the reviews are what helped me make my purchase and they are also how I determine what seller to purchase from that is ehy I keep updating I feel like this tablet is a good deal if u purchase from a reliable seller and supervise your kids charge it for them its not a tank they can still break it make them sit on the couch while they play it instead of running with it this tablet is cheap and has tons of features but its not durable or it would cost more if u want durable spend $100 more bucks and u will get higher quality this is a great beginner tablet its still quite fast for a single core processor and has tons of features runs netflix youtube and my comcast apps all fine on comcast I have to log out then back in somtimes for it to work but for it $76 delivered its not that big of a deal plus u can install apps that require root access my tablet doesnt do that and to buy higher end rooted tablets is at least $100 more on top of what the going price is so im assuming the negative reviews are the people who bought from the seller at the very bottom offering the dual camera on the probably fake zeepadsUpdateIts been a couple weeks now the zeepad is still charging and works great I only charge it about once a week but I also shut it off when my daughter isnt playing it I think this was a great deal my daughter loves it and it plays all her movies and games without any problemsUpdateThe zeepad is still working just got done loading a bunch of free mp3 songs for my daughter off of the free app I got off google play I really dnt understand all the bad ratings for my$76 bucks this is an amazing deal we have 3 samsung galaxy tab2 also and this tablet does just as much a little slower at times and not as good quality but for the price this is a great dealUpdateSkype works and all of the other apps we have loaded on here just got done reading elmo and dora ebooks we downloaded on the kindle app I still cnt figure out why people dnt like this tablet I'm writing my review on it rn the battery isn't that bad and why would u want your child playing 5hrs of games a day anyways either way zeepad still works and we still love it", "Date": "March

address was incorrect. I chatted with Amazon and they sent a request to Draco Tek. I also sent an email to Drack Tek and they responded within 48 hours...I was impress with the seller and Amazon for helping me correct the shipping address. I purchase this item on March 9,2013 I received this item on March 23, 2013 sooner than promised. I brought this product for my grand-daughter she is 4 years old and is very savvy with my iPad 4. I brought this product for the price and for what it can do. I was some what disappointed because when I received this product everything was their except the stylus pen, the box came with 3 different type of chargers. One was USB, AC adapter and one for using a flash drive. The USB and AC Adapter does not work I tried it and the charge stayed at 1%. So I tried a different USB and it started charging so I left it to charge overnight. I tried it the next day and it did not charge more than 2%. The product request that you charge it the first time 6 hours...so I was disappointed that I still could not use this item. So I tried another charger that I had and this charger was charging I started charging at 9:00am and it was fully charged be 2:00pm.  Finally I was able to see what this could do and so far it works okay. I know folks say this was inexpensive...however you should always receive what the seller is selling and the item should do what the product states it should do no exceptions.  I brought this base on what the product offered. Money should not be a factor...just because some items cost more does not make them a better product. I could send this product back after all if the product cannot work because you cannot charge it then it is no good to you...major flaw. I think Drakco Tec Store which is located in China should read their customers reviews. I did read the reviews and had mixed emotions. Being a buyer at Amazon and trusting Amazon I took a chance. I have purchased a lot on Amazon since March 9,2013 and I'm learning a lot about the sellers and shipping. I what have rated this product higher because it does work and it is a good buy...however not being able to charge this item is very huge for me. Please take the time to read all reviews...their was a lot to read. I read all of the reviews after ordering. So I did know there was a possibility that the charger would not work. So I did gather up all of the old chargers I had collected over the years from old cell phones which save the day...so in the end it did work out.

First off the good points i observed is it comes preloaded with a couple of games ie: Angry birds and a couple of kids games which is what this is really geared to . I bought this for my 9 yr old nephew knowing full well it was not going to be a top of the line tablet . It accesses the internet on WiFi only no Ethernet port that i observed . It is relatively fast but again we only talking 512 mb ram so your not talking lightening fast . It has a decent camera with it and also a built in microphone , both as i have said are decent for what your paying . Its only really bad downfall is it's battery life . Even fully charged its battery might last you an hour depending on what your doing with it . It seems to use more power using the internet than the games. Possibly because of it being on wireless .i am assuming you will not be able to use this in a wireless hot spot because you do have to set it up to detect your wireless configurations on your device at home . But if your looking for something for the kids to use and don't want to spend 500 bucks or more on an I Pad  then this might serve the need .

The plastic cover is quite solid but the edges do scuff up pretty quick. The battery lasts about 2 hours and that is acceptable for the price.

We have a 5 year old boy and a 10 year old girl. Upon reading other reviews that these might be somewhat fragile, we have drilled into the kids that they need to be gentle with them. In general, these work just like a Droid smart phone and last a couple of hours before they need to be recharged. As we don't really want the kids playing games longer than this, we are fine with the batter life. The Google Play Store works just like on a smartphone and we have had no issues with this or using the wifi. I added a couple of leftover mini SD cards I had from old smart phones to increase the storage space for the kids.The only issues we have had with these tablets have all been in with either the original seller (not Goodios) or the quality control of the product. We originally ordered these 15 days before christmas to be from Santa. These never arrived, Amazon refunded our money and that company is no longer in business. Beware of the folks with the cheapest price. We then re-ordered these from Goodios who have been perfect in solving our problems. Our first set of these arrived and one of them was dead on arrival. It was quickly replaced with another that had a bad charger. We had a new charger within a couple of days and then found out the little USB connector was also defective. They sent us one of those and now everything works fine.We got the little USB keyboards that double as covers which work fine with one exception. When the Zeepad is in the case and the case is turned vertically the Zeepad can slip out of the little claws that hold it in. As these cases are all made the same I will put either double sided tape or some velcro on ours to keep this from happening.We really like these tablets and they kids have been using them up everyday when they get home from school for over a month. If Zeepad improved their quality control we would have had no issues with them at all. The 4 stars are because of this.

It's not blue tooth, but even with blue tooth you have to be ale to see what your typing, so it's not like you can be typing in the other room, so it's the same thing basicaly unless you have to have something else plugged up at the same time. It comes with the usb to plug into the usb that the zeepad comes with so u have everything to do it plus cheeper with a durrable cover. I had no problems with the seller or the shipping.(shipping threw fedex)You might want to consider buying a car charger for the tablet, I bought mine on amazon.comLINK:Car DC 5V Adapter For Zeepad 7inch Android Tablet PC Power Supply Cord ChargerYou can also purchase an adapter from Wal-mart that plugs into the car to take house held items with house held chargers to plug into the adapter to make it charge in the car. I have one of these and it works with the zeepad house charger.I'm not sure why so many people leave the \"not so positive feedback\" for this product. Most of the negetive feedback came from those who ordered durring Christmass. Okay, I never order anything durring Christmass. WHY? Things get lost, misplaced, or damaged(may be the cause for those who had minor issues- package could have been dropped or slammed into another package or left in too hot or cold of environment). 9 times out of 10 it's not the company who is at fault(the postal service who is delivering the package could be) and durring Christmass their E-Mails are flooded. They may have accidently overlooked your e-mail or simply haven't gooten to it yet. Plus if your item doesn't arrive by the estimated delivery date don't panik, it's just an estimate, it may take a few more days to arrive. I orderd mine a week or 2 after Christmass and payed the extra money for \"2-3 day shipping\" and it arrived on the 1st estiamated delivery date. I didn't run into a single problem with shipping or ordering, I am sorry for those who did and I have confidence that the seller will indeed get back to you and fix any issues you may have expeirenced. I must say this couldn.t possibly be a scam because, I am a real, happily satisfied customer and I recieved a real Zeepad tablet w/ accessories, undamged and on time threw amazon.com(shipped by FED-EX).Copy of the nice e-mail conversation I experinced with the seller:Me:  Hey, I lost my pink zeepad stylist and messed up the zeepad screen protector can you send me a new screen protector and  another pink zeepad stylist? If this cost money how do i go about paying for these two items?Seller:  We only have the silver stylus pen in stock right now, is that ok?Me:  Yes, that',s fine thank you, and did you happen to have an extra screen protector as well?Seller:  The stylus pen and the screen protector will be mailed out for you today.Me:  Thank you so much! and ive tried to leave feedback but the computer wont let me every time i try but i just wanted to say thank you that I love my tablet and didnt find a thing wrong with it.Seller:  Thank you for the kind words, it is our pleasure to make our customers happy!Plus, they sent me a link so I could leave this product review.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Charmaine White \"CWhite\"", "ReviewID": "RL5J9PXYVB2R1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet for my grand daughters ages 6 & 4 - they love their tablet.

It freezes the unit trying to load then after a couple of minutes a pop up comes on asking you if you would like to stop or wait for it to load. I have waited for over 10 minutes for the i-reader to load with no luck.  The i-reader shows it loaded and is taking up memory it just doesn't work for what ever reason. Good thing it uses Android, I loaded the kindle (for free from Amazon) on it and now can load books through the kindle. I also use the local e-library so the kids can check out books online. The unit is not the fastest but for the kids it is good. It would be nice if there was a customer support or at least more information in the box for use of this unit, or they could load the information on a tutorial on the desktop.  But over all it seems to be an desent unit for the money. We don't let them use it for social media or e-mail so I can not comment on that. They do use it for games and internet research and it apprears to be doing fine for that, so I would assume that the e-mail and social media would be fine as well.  It streams the video's well from you tube. My kids watch the Looney Tunes video's when they finish thier reading (30 min. a day only).  The picture is clear so vidoe is good. The outter case or shell doesnt' seem to be to durable, so I am glad that they have not dropped it yet.  We also bought the case with an external keyboard so it is in that most of the time for extra protection.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

The first sign that this was not going to go well was the way it was packaged...or the lack of packaging.  LOL.  The tablet comes in the box that you would find it in any retail store, then it had only one layer of bubble wrap covered by a layer of packing tape. What kind of a company packs like this???  (it is not packed into a shipping box).It only gets worse, the screen is extremely scratched, and raised above the frame on one side, and it had a half worn sticker on it.  The WIFI must be within 2 feet in order to connect...but the browser doesn't work anyway.  Also the unit will not charge at all if the tablet is turned on.Despite all this we were able to download a couple of games that did work well and were a ton of fun at first, that is until they started to freeze up.I contacted the company on the 18th, and they responded back saying the item is new and \"show us a photo where is the scratches.thanks!\".  So I replied back with pictures.Next they agreed it was scratched and offered to send me \"the film\" to repair it and a new charger.There is so much wrong with this Zeepad that a screen and a charger wouldn't come close to fixing it.  I replied back that I did not pay full price for a used, disfunctional tablet that I would have to fix.Their last response was just one short sentence...\"pls ship back we refund you.thanks\"Evidently they also want me to pay to ship this useless, previously returned item.  It is so disappointing.  Hopefully they aren't planning to ship it off to the next unsuspecting person.Hmmm, I guess when I get back home I will need to dig out the layer of bubble wrap they used to box it???

For the person who wanted a instructional guide..I got one, it had no adjectives in it, and it didn't help with , why did the sound go out?? so you really dont need one, as everything else is pretty easy to understand, it was funny though!!SO Im giving the tablet 1 star, I rolled a dice, and the seller will get a 5 but for the purposes here, I'm giving it 1 star. So it is definitely buyer BEWARE!! ( I didn't make 2 separate reviews 1 for product 1 for the seller, so I only made this one and included everything!) I do wish I could give the product no stars!!", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "What the heck", "Author": "Eezyboy504", "ReviewID": "R1IB3HPU769RHK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Still haven't received my package from these people.

The manufacturer apparently knew this and included a screen protector.  However, the protector is of very low quality and peels off and/or develops air bubbles after a few days.One of the units had some problems with the internals and if you put your finger on back it in a specific spot it would create a distortion pattern on the screen in the front.One unit was DOA.  The touch screen had a dead spot (which happened to line up with the \"S\" key on the onscreen keyboard making it unusable.  In general, the touch screens are of low quality.  All of them have manufacturing defects like embedded dust particles in the plastic (that become evident after installing the screen protector)  indicating they were produced in a low quality facility.The power button on one of the units has already failed and no longer powers on or off the unit.The screen is a critical feature of a tablet and this one fails miserably on all counts.  It is cheap Chinese crap and should be avoided.I got frustrated and purchased a Nextbook in Walmart for the same price as one of these units and the difference in quality is astounding.
