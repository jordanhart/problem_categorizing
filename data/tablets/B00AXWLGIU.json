So I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The 7\" version of this tab got great reviews, so I assumed the lesser-reviewed 9\" version would be fine.  WRONG!  This tablet is laggy as all heck.  Think back to the days before Edge data networks came around for your cell phone, when it took 5 minutes to load a normal webpage.  That's what this tab is like, even when sitting RIGHT next to the wireless modem.  I also tried downloading Google Earth to see how it responded, and the app was too data intensive for this tab.  It just couldn't resolve the resolution, and forget zooming or moving to a different location.  I had my doubts that a quality tab could be manufactured at this price, and I was right.  As long as you have an infinite amount of time at your disposal to browse the web, and it doesn't annoy you to move from a cell phone that, connected to a data network, outperforms this device EXPONENTIALLY when it's connected directly to wifi, you'll be fine buying this tab at a fantastic price.  But expect the speed and technology of mid 2000s data networks and devices.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problem", "Author": "bmgarza74", "ReviewID": "R14LPHXRQ32VVI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The charger that came with the tablet does not work.

There are complaints about it not keeping charge, for the first day it won't; it wont get past 2 hours. Second day it graduated to three and by the fourth it kept a charge for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. I guess by cycle charging (letting it completely die then charging it) it builds up so upon getting it, it might be best to walk with your charger if you plan extended useage just as you would with your phone. It's laggy, very laggy at times. Pausing up to 3 minutes to open newly installed apps or while you are toggling between multiple applications. But I guess at $ 85 that's the cut back you get. It runs google play so that's a big plus and its also has adobe flash installed which is a mega plus as most tablets actually don't carry that feature even if they say they do.Other than the lagging I love it. Only other drawback is it doesn't have swype on the keyboard but thats a software problem.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "not the best or the worst", "Author": "Kirsten", "ReviewID": "R28BDJ0T8O26JL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not the fastest browser or the best, but not bad for a tablet.

Campbell", "ReviewID": "R3KNUCS6RAG0RK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You get what you pay for, and I didn't expect this to outperform my Nexus 10.I got it for my Father, to be used as a web-cam browser for a Sapido BR07 with Microsoft web-cam attached. (Amazon used to let you do product links, but they shouldn't be too hard to find.[a high-tech 'peep-hole' in his garage entry door.]) It needed to be easy and reliable.  It made the easy part, but would freeze the display after 3-6 hours.For some purposes, this would not be an issue, but if someone is banging on your solid wood door, you don't have time to power down, reboot, bring up the web browser, log into the Sapido and then bring up the web-cam.Anyway, I gave him my Toshiba Excite Pro (real garbage, but reliable... I was using it as a clock.) and plan to use this device to learn how to 'root' an android (not like it is a big loss if I brick it).Overall, who has ever heard of Alldaymall anyway?  I wasn't expecting top notch.The tablet face is actually pretty good, and it responds well to touch and gestures.  It is a little thicker than high-end tablets, and the backside is a white plastic.  The buttons work well, but are strangely placed.  Where you expect the power button, is a hardware back button, but the power button is on the side.  Has a micro-SD port for more memory.  Downside, the power is provided via a proprietary plug, not a micro-usb.  Less than 'stunning' resolution, but an adequate 800x480 display.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "No camera", "Author": "nonnie", "ReviewID": "R19RVD4RR8E2D5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet advertises a camera, has a camera app, but there is no focus lense.
