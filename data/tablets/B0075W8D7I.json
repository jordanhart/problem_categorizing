Looks great, love the size, and it is quick.I had 2 cons which I have reversed with work-arounds.1) No Google Play - Use amazon app store instead2) Skype did not work with the latest verson - use version skype_v2.5.4.162.apk  Works fineCurrently the working version of Flash is com.adobe.flashplayer_111115007.apkAll of these apps can be installed without Google Play.  Just google the versions I have listed here and you can find them.I was able to find everything else I wanted on Amazon App Store.  Netflix runs fine.  Device has not crashed once.I also use it for Wireless Site planning and RF interference detection which the small size works great for.  I was previously using my phone but the battery would run down in an hour.  I can use this for hours with constant use and it still has life left.This is a great device for the price.  Don't think you are going to pay $150 and get the craftsmanship you will with an Apple product.  However I have an IPAD 1 and this device is just as quick. It only lacks the scratch resistant glass and metal case.I currently have a screen protector and a leather case with builtin keyboard.

Picture viewing has improved by orders of magnitude, and all the basic apps packaged with the tablet have significant feature upgrades.  My biggest complaint is that many of the file management features seem to have been eliminated or replaced with more automated processes. (e.g. the media player automatically scans your SD memory card and finds all media files)  This seems at first to be an advancement, but it takes away the users ability to navigate to specific folders.  The collection of all media is lumped together, making the process of viewing specific files more tedious, especially when a significant number of files are present.My biggest complaint about the physical product is the plastic edge feels cheap, it is wide with a sharp edge that rests on your hand while holding the tablet.  It is so sharp that it will cut your skin if you stroke your hand along it.  Perhaps it was a quality control issue, since the hard edge can easily be filed down.Android 4.0 is a welcome upgrade.  Loads of new features and significant usability improvements.  Too bad the system crashes so often.  Media that played on the prior Kyros tablets just won't play on the MID7042.  Some will launch, but almost all inadvertently stall at some point.  Many formats will not play at all.  Plugging the same SD card in the previous versions of the Kyros didn't exhibit the same problems.  All launched and played flawlessly.  The same goes for Android applications purchased through the Amazon Appstore for Android.  Many apps will no longer launch or if they run they run poorly.  Undoubtedly most of these issues can be attributed to the the new Android operating system, but it isn't clear what problems could be attributed to the new Coby platform.  Thankfully the OS on this tablet is upgradable, so hopefully the performance issues will be solved in future upgrades.  Also, app developers are due to release new versions of their software that should solve compatibility issues with Android 4.0.  I look forward to seeing these software improvements.New Problems: (reduced rating to 2 stars)-----------------------------------------Tablet crashes constantly if too many apps are open, downloading large files or after installing several apps in a row.The size of the tablet is a bit odd and none of the 7' tablet cases work with this model.  I basically had to buy one and cut it in order to get my tablet to fit. I still doesn't look quite right.I found that in humid environments the touch screen does not work properly, it becomes less touch sensitive and just a chore to use since it is constantly interpreting a touch for a double tap and when I drag across the screen it stops the dragging motion in mid path, making some applications unusable.  I wish I purchased a different brand.  It just isn't worth the cost savings.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "great product for my kids", "Author": "your name here", "ReviewID": "R36D4PRGS03A82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a big fan of the droid OS.  At work I run all of our corp mobile phones on droid, am currently testing droid deskphones on a few desks, I have the ipad, a viewsonic and gtab that I use.Cost/benefit - I don't let the kids play on my tablets, but felt they could benefit from a tablet.  I bought 4 of the 7042-4's for less than I could get 1 new iPad.  So, for starters, each of my 4 kids gets their own tablet with their own email and apps on it.  As far as bang for the buck, the kyros takes the cake when I can get 4 kids their own tablets for less than I could get 1 tablet for all 4 to share.Screen - The screen is fantastic.  The 7 inch screen rivals the quality, accuracy and sensitivity of the ipad2, the multi-touch is just as advertised.Storage - It comes without an SD card and I have extra's laying around, if you intend to install a lot of apps or store a lot of music, get an extra SD card.Battery - The battery is decent, I've seen my kids work on the tablet (games/homework/surfing) for 4-5 hours at a time without a recharge, I watched a 2 hour movie on one of them and it still had 75% battery left.  We generally park devices on their charging stations at night, however I'm sure a few have missed a night, but nobody has gotten the batter shutdown yet.OS - It's ice cream, not everything has been updated to run on ice cream.  Specifically many of the kids games are not updated.  My kids range from 3-10 years old, the educational games are more prone to not work on ice cream than the non-educational games.  That's an unfortunate trend because we only allow educational games on weekdays.  I've been about to find about 5-8 educational games for each age group to install on their tablets after testing well over 50 games!  I could load 50 non-educational games and I bet 49 of them would work.  This has nothing to do with the Kyros, it's the apps that won't install or won't run because the software vendor that wrote that app must modify & test their app on the latest version of droid.  I would expect this to be slowly corrected as software vendors get around to updating their apps.  It is missing the google play store (Droid Market), Amazon Store, but those two can be installed easily.  It comes with corporate email sync protocols so it works for corporate use as well, right out of hte box.Overall - The 7 inch screen is small, but usable even for an adult to type.  It's perfectly sized for kids, and at this price point it doesn't hurt as much to loose/break 1.  They are highly responsive, as fast as my galaxy tablet which is 1.5 years old and cost 4 times what the Kyros cost.  For kids even through high school age I would highly recommend the Kyros.  I would probably purchase one for myself if I didn't already have too many tablets.  I don't think the Kyros competes well against the newest tablets head to head, but when you consider the price savings I feel it was a much better buy for this purpose.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "New to tablets. like this but it has its flaws", "Author": "Richard Holderby", "ReviewID": "R3CG9O0DWA9IUP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got to say, I'm really pleased with my purchase. The table comes on in about 35 seconds (yes, I timed it), is easily navigated, and connects to the internet rather quickly. It's a decent size too; not too small, not too big. I was worried that the screen was going to be tiny and I'd be unable to see it, but it's pretty nice. The screen takes up almost the entire front of the tablet, minus about a half inch along the side and about a millimeter along the remaining edges. It's also pretty responsive too. Some small objects in games might get a bit sketchy and take a few ties to click, but over all it's great. It opens Apps quickly, plays everything I downloaded including a 3D (as in Mario 64, not Titanic 3D) game I found in Amazon's App Store. I see many reviews complaining about Google's store not being able to run on this tablet, but I don't see the problem running with Amazon's thing; an app is an app is an app, right? who cares where it was bought from?I took this on a trip with me to Reno over the past few days and it was really worth the money. Renting movies through the hotel would've been expensive, and the place I stayed at didn't have any movie channels. So I put on some shows and movies I bought onto the SD card I got with this and they all, for the most part (more below), ran smoothly. I was able to watch two movies back to back without the need to recharge. I still have about 45% battery life even after watching about 2.5~3.5 hours of video straight. (EDIT - However, leaving it on during the writing of this review has dropped it down to 14% in the matter of 10-20 mins, so perhaps it doesn't give an accurate reading of the battery...)The tablet supports up to a 32 GB micro SD card, by the way. Amazon suggests buying a 16 GB card, which I did, only to find to my dismay that it can support double that.Also, I tend to speak little on the positive features because what more can be said about something that is done right? I mean, if it works, it works. Please understand that I only go into detail on the negative things to give possible buyers the full scope of the issues I had with it. Even with these issues, I'd still buy it again.The issues I have with it are kind of small but still annoying. My biggest problems are concerning the Gallery, which is where you view your pictures and videos. The video player included doesn't fast-forward some movies. I haven't the slightest clue why; the videos I put on it are all .avi so I doubt its formatting issues. Maybe there was a bad transfer, as the audio was off. Also frustrating with the video player is the fact that the menu is REALLY hard to access. You can touch the screen at any time to bring up the navigation menu (play, pause, next item, the position bar, etc) but touching the screen again closes the menu, which seems like an odd choice, being as you need to touch the screen again to push the button, obviously. So even if you are dead center on the button you want to push, it will close the menu nine times out of ten.Also regarding the Gallery is the way it manages pictures. You are not given the ability to reposition pictures. That may not be a big deal, but I had brought along a couple comics I bought that were all in picture form. When I uploaded them to the SD card, I did it chronologically. All the pictures were numbered and were in perfect order in the folder on my computer. When I turned it on, they were all messed up and, for the most part, backwards. So the first page was uploaded as the last, even though it was numbered one, and the pictures following it were skipping every 3rd or 4th picture and ascending. One of the comics was all backwards with no skipping, so I re-uploaded them starting with the last page, which seemed to fix that one. I spent a good hour or two trying to figure the ordering out, but even after renumbering them all three times (from 001-022 to a1-a22 to a1-9, b1-9,c1-4 to a-v) I gave up and put them in a Word document, created a PDF, and made them into an eBook.The trouble didn't stop there, however. Files uploaded to the SD card can be hard to find, or impossible, depending on the app. I kept trying to upload the PDF files to the SD card, going to the pre-installed book reader, and searching for them only to see nothing. I even tried putting them in the folder \"LOST.DIR\", which just so happens to be on both the SD card and the tablet for some reason, being as that was the only folder I saw that was accessible through the book reader (and was the file on the tablet, not the card after all). It was after a rather long time that I noticed the SD card and the tablet itself are seen as two separate drives. It drove me crazy for one or two hours trying to figure this issue out, as I stated before, and it was kind of a \"no duh\" moment once I figured it out. Still, any app should be able to access what is on the SD card; the gallery has no problem seeing that which is uploaded to it, why does the eReader only have access to what's on the internal memory? And after doing all that, the eReader doesn't zoom in all that well or turn pages as fast as the gallery does, so it was all for naught.You also can't plainly access the SD card. You can't plug it in and browse through the files as you could on a PC. It would have been so much easier all around to just be given the go ahead to open it and manage the files on it rather than forcing them to be opened only through the apps that run them. That would have made things so much easier. Just open the folder, select a file, and have the appropriate app run it! It's not like I have to open Word just to get to all my Word documents or open Windows Media Player to see the videos I have; I can just click on the file and the default program opens it. I mean, this should be a button on the first menu no doubt.The internal storage is also broken up into two separate drives. There's 1.48 on one drive and 1.38 on the other, totaling in at 2.86 GB of internal storage. I assume there WAS 4 GB of storage before the OS was installed, which seems misleading to me to advertise the entire space as if it were fully accessible. I think one drive is for staging apps as only about 180 MBs have been used for apps and nothing else while the other has almost 1 GB used in apps alone. So you really should buy a micro SD card when purchasing this product.So to summarize:PROS:Pretty quick for a 1 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAMExpandable memory up to 32 GB via a micro SD card (not included)It's a pretty good size tablet; not too big, not too smallThe screen is very responsive, in most operationsIt runs video very wellIt can display pictures easily without hiccups and zooms in and out smoothlySuper easy to connect to the internetPretty easy to manage what is actually on the deviceBattery life is great - can easily stream over 3, maybe even 4, hours of video without a recharge (I think the box states 5)Ran every app I threw at iteBook reader, internet browser, video/image/music player, app store, and a few other apps pre-installedHalf the price of name brand tablets with the same specsCONS:The video player won't fast-forward some videos, even when it does on others of the same formatDark video is kind of hard to see. You sometimes need to view it at an exact angle, but not all too drasticThe menu in the video player is really difficult and closes when you try to use it most often than notThe Gallery mixes up the order of your pictures, even when uploaded to it in the right orderYou can't rearrange picturesSome apps can't access the SD card, so some files must be uploaded to internal memoryYou cannot manually access the SD card. You can't just open it up via the tablet to see what's on it and when the device can't see what's on the card, it's like you don't even have those file with youThe amount of internal storage you can actually use is less than 3 GBs and no where near 4The camera is kind of grainyA stylus is not includedBut still, for $125 compared to other tablets twice the price with the exact same specs, I think it's a very good deal.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleasent surprise", "Author": "melcal \"melcal\"", "ReviewID": "RSRQVVQ744SSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not expecting anything great for the price.

I came across this tablet & on May 4th, it was listed at about $145. It had decent reviews & I expect him to use it for games & Youtube so I don't anticipate him running into the problems in the reviews.We ordered it along with an 8GB SD, a case & a 2 year drop & spill warranty from squaretrade. The smaller items came in the mail right away & the warranty is sent via email. The tablet shipped the 7th & we received it today, the 10th.This morning on Amazon's website, I noticed the tablet's price dropped to $117 and the warranty increased to $60. I don't know how the pricing works on amazon but I figured since the tablet ordered was directly through them that they would have a grace period to price match. I called & had no problem getting a $28 refund, I got a confirmation email for it right away (The rep said the policy for price match is about 2 weeks after purchase). GREAT Customer service. The price of the warranty wasn't an issue being that I ordered it at the lower price but wondering what caused the price to double? As far as the tablet goes, it works for what it was purchased for, games & Youtube. The web browsing worked fine. I don't like the GETJAR market (FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW, NO GOOGLE PLAY), so I downloaded Amazon Appstore.  The youtube videos are clear & don't drag.

WALTER", "ReviewID": "R11OFSUXY3FUDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review from the perspective that I did NOT purchase an iPad, and I didn't EXPECT to GET an iPad for under $200. I DID NOT, and DO NOT plan to root this device at this time.This tablet is a great little bargain tablet to play with, surf the web, check emails, etc. This is NOT a cellular data tablet, so you're stuck on WiFi, but you should already know that when you purchase this. I got this tablet to replace a garbage Dell laptop that I have. It's much smaller, therefore much easier to carry around, and does just about everything that the laptop does for me.This tablet runs Android 4.0, and it runs it well. I haven't had any lag issues, or problems with the OS, it does what it's supposed to, and does it well (for a $150 tablet). The screen resolution is a little pixely, but not bad, I mean We're not talking 1985 IBM/Commador. It's only really noticeable if you're concentrating on it. The camera is NOT meant for any type of useable image. It's a rear-facing camera (faces the user), so you can't take pictures of OTHER people, just yourself. Also, you won't want to use any of the pictures for anything, because they're NOT very good quality. I think the box says 0.3mp camera. The touch screen is very good. It's a capacitive touchscreen, with multitouch, and it works very well. It's not as responsive as an iPad/iPhone (see very top of review), but it's only slow by a very very small fraction of a second, really not even noticeable unless you use both devices alot, and switch back and forth. The gripe I have with the touchscreen (and this is because of the 7\" tablet) is that with it being a smaller tablet, the icons, and buttons on some screens (the internet browser, and some other navigation items) get kind of small, so I have to touch several times to get them to register what I want to do. I've downloaded the Amazon app store, so I've gotten pretty much everything I've needed from there, and had no issues with finding whatever I wanted. Honestly, I removed the GetJar from my main screen altogether. Some people talk about \"Rooting\" the device, and whatever else to open up the Google/Android market, and I guess that's up to you, but I haven't done that. I've not had any issues with the battery life. I am not CONSTANTLY on my tablet if I'm away from a charger, so I get plenty of battery life. When I first got it, and was playing with it, I would get around 3-4 continuous hours of play time. When I want to watch a movie with Netflix I've always plugged it in, so I do not know how long it would take to fully kill this thing, and not charge it. I've never had issues logging into random WiFi (My home, In-laws, McDonalds, etc.), It has always found, and connected to everything I've wanted it to without hiccup. I read on the Kindle app ALOT, this thing is the perfect size to simulate a paperback book you would buy in the store. The tablet also accepts microSD cards. I have my music library on a 32gb microSD, and I can put it into the tablet, and it recognizes all of my music and files. I switch the card back and forth from my tablet to my Phone without issue, to keep my music wherever I need it. I personally would completely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for the tablet experience, without spending $500-800 on a top of the line tablet. You can get a very good experience from something much less expensive.I had a few minor gripes, and issues in there, but the reason I give this thing 5 stars, is because I bought it for a fraction of the cost of an iPad, and I get exactly what I needed, and expected, out of it. If you are expecting to get iPad quality for around $150, then don't buy this tablet, and stop looking. You're not going to FIND a tablet like that.

Was quite pleased with the tablet overall until I discovered there was no Google Play installed. If you are savvy enough with rooting and flashing a new ROM, you will do fine with this device. If you are not, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Fixing the (what I expected to be) default google apps; GMail, Google+, Marketplace, books, music, etc, took some time as there is not a lot of (basically none) support for the device and I still have not received a response from the manufacturer.All of that in mind and once I got it fixed (to my liking) the little tablet runs great. It is quite responsive, accelerometer, rough location services, capacitive screen, camera were what I would expect. Another review reported sharp edges. This is definitely the case. Not enough to cut but semi-irritating.Device charged fast and I have been getting 4ish hours per charge with heavy use. Played YouTube just fine.There is a default custom market place app installed on the device with purchase.

Disclaimer- the first one arrived and the sound stopped working, but Amazon took care of me and 3 days later (over the weekend) I had a replacement in-hand that is going strong.The big drawback for tablet/Android noobies is the fact that it doesn't have the all-mighty Google Play app, and you cannot have it because Coby doesn't appear to send any devices to Google for certification and pay licensing fees... That's ok because I got all the apps I want from Amazon and 1Mobile app stores. I haven't paid a dime and can make spreadsheets, word docs, play Angry Birds, use Flash player, etc. I'd like Google Maps, but since that program is most effective on a mobile network and this doesn't have that (but I do get this tablet onto the net through my cell phone's hotspot) it's not missed. Besides, I DO have it on my cell phone :)Who this is for- People that can tunnel out to the net on the go through their phones or coffee shop/home WiFi, someone that doesn't want to break out a laptop or sit at a desktop at home to check email and play around on the net, or likes e-book readers (this has a handy built in reader app, I use it and I really never used to read books...). Even the free section of the e-books app has all the classics for free from The Art of War to Jack London books.

It's not a laptop computer. It's better than browsing the net on a tiny 4 inch cellphone screen when you don't have your laptop in front of you. It's a netbook without the keyboard (but you can hook up a keyboard via the adapter they provide and it works like a charm). I had my choice between 7, 8, 9, 10 inch screens, and after looking at my wife's Kindle I picked 7 inch. That way when I'm writing an email and I want to use the tablet in \"Portrait\" mode, my thumbs can easily reach all the keys. This also fits in my pocket (barely). Perhaps that's the up-side of having a big-butt, you get bigger pants pockets and can carry something like this in it.Battery- be sure to charge this after heavy use, or if you're going to be away from it for hours, go ahead and power-down the device. The \"standby\" battery life drains at about 20% per day, so it's best you just turn the device off if you're leaving it alone for hours at a time.

I ordered it after reading reviews. I was a little iffy, \"is it made of plastic? Will it creak when you grasp it?\". The answer is no. I grabbed it out of the box and was satisfied with the structure. Still iffy about performance, I turned it on, the second the tablet powered on, I unlocked it and swiped left to right. The processor makes this tablet run smooth. I went to the Amazon appstore, for those of you who don't know how to download it www.amazon.com/appstorelanding I believe. I went and downloaded Nitro Nation, Drag Racing.Now I've played this on the high end tablets in the Verizon store and was disappointed. Feeling that this would be the same seeing as how this tablet was barely 100 bucks. I was in awe, turning the visuals up it ran smoothly and was VERY VERY responsive. Angry birds also runs phenomenally smooth and VERY flawlessly on this tablet. So to answer the question. \"Is this a good gaming tablet?\" It sure is. That's is for gaming, on to battery life, screen, camera.I took this on the bus with a 75 percent charge. I played Angry birds, Drag Racing and Cut The Rope. I played each game for about 30 minutes each. I signed into McDonald's Wifi and filled out an application (about 45 to an hour and 15 minutes seeing as how I was a little lost in my angus swiss and mushroom burger) I played a few songs (30 minutes while the wifi was on, regardless of connectivity). My battery was down to 30 percent, note it has been about 4 to 5 hours from a full charge with screen brightness all the way up, and wifi on) with heave gaming and music listening the tablet lasted about 1 hour longer. So it's safe to say that this tablet has a pretty good battery life.The 0.3 MP camera lacks an LED flash and is a little low in resolution, but it works for the common Wi-Fi video chat with my folks 100 miles away. The screen is a low res also with 800x400 resolution but it's still very average.The browser can be a bit laggy at times which is sort of a down fall.1080P video playing is very awesome, I've found that the videos that I transferred from my cam-corder looks amazing on my tablet.This has been my first tablet.

I guess Amazon has positioned the Kindle Fire to maximize use of \"cloud\" storage.The Coby unit has only 4 GB of internal storage, of which 1.5 GB is available out of the box for the user.  This is more than sufficient to install apps, because they only take a few megabytes each.  However, two or three video files would use up the free storage immediately.

I would say the Kindle Fire is subtly clearer and brighter, but for a purchase price of $130, I have no complaints.The first app I installed was the Amazon Marketplace, and I was able to download and install all of the previously purchased apps for my Kindle Fire for no additional cost.  The new Android OS, \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" is a very well put together.  I was able to quickly become familiar with how to navigate the unit, without reading the manual.  BTW, the manual exceeded my expectations and had a very good introduction to the Coby's features, which I had circled back to it to look up some specific features of the unit.The unit switched between apps as expected, and video playback on the Micro SD card went smoothly.  Did not get a chance to evaluate the battery endurance, but after about two hours of use, the Kryos still indicated it was charged at 70%.Overall, I would give this version of the Coby Kryos a four star hardware rating, and five stars for overall value.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Coby MID7042-4 tablet - As expected... mostly Satisfied", "Author": "KeriT", "ReviewID": "R25EK6XQT9T9B9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet from Fry's Electronics a week ago. I charged it for about 5 minutes and started using it right away.It connected easily to the local Wi-Fi right away. There were only few pre-installed applications which is a huge plus as I like to find my own programs.This is my first tablet and touch-screen device in general so I am coming at this with no preconceived ideas.Pros:-comfortable size. I can hold it in one hand while I read and my hand/arm doesn't get tired.-USB and HDMI capability (which other comparable tablets don't have). although I haven't tried the HDMI yet.-easy email set up (I have gmail).-I connected a keyboard (via USB) and it worked immediately. other reviewers seemed to have trouble with this but I didn't.-speakers are nice and loud. I could set it on the bathroom counter (5 ft away) and hear it over the shower/fan noise.-plays Youtube content beautifully!-Amazon apps work perfectly! as well as ones from 1mobile and GetJar. between the three of them I have found everything I that I wanted.-Facebook app from amazon works beautifully!Neutral:-browser is slow when I have more than 3-4 apps running in the background or when opening a complex website.-finding files is tricky but not impossible. I installed an app called 'OI File Manager' which works better than thepre-installed 'ES File Explorer'.-can be a bit slow transitioning from horizontal to vertical positions. I just make the rotating motion severe and it responds.-The user manual is a joke. I have had to figure out most of the functions on my own. but i am used to that and enjoy figuring it out. neutral for me but maybe not for others.-camera is 0.3 mp; I am not a photographer at all nor do I care all that much. If you want to take 'nice' pictures this is not the tablet for you.-I have not tried video chatting, but I don't think it could work as this tablet does not have a built in mic. didn't get the tablet for video chatting so not a big deal for me.-I have not done any picture viewing or downloading so I cannot speak to that.-I have not watched any movies either.Cons:-no Android market.-no Google Play apps or music. I can look at what music I have in my browser but I cannot download the 'Music Manager' and so I cannot sync with my cloud content on Google. I can view books.-not able as of yet to sync my gmail calendar. I either cannot find the right domain info or it is just not compatible. This was almost a deal breaker for me but I wanted this for entertainment while riding the bus more than anything so I found a work-around. I use an app called 'ColorNote' which has a built in Calendar. It has a widget that displays each day's notes or checklists so I just manually enter everything. tedious but it works for me.I have decided to keep the tablet. Quality for price is unbeatable, which I suppose was Coby's intent. I bought this mainly for reading books and listening to music with the ability to do more if I want to and since it is cheaper than the Kindle Fire I am satisfied except for the part about the calendar, I am still going to try to get something to work. I downloaded 'Adobe flash' and 'Adobe Reader' from one of the three formerly mentioned sites as well as a free version of a doc/xls/pdf reader.I will eventually get a screen protector and a case. will update on what I find :)External memory is a MUST! and amazon has lots of those.I will update this in a month.

Or something ...", "ReviewID": "R26M5LDHS4LKHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this product two weeks ago. I opted for next-day delivery on Amazon Prime, and sure enough it came the next day! Now, for the review.I realized prior to ordering this tablet that it would not have Google Play on it, but for someone like me on a limited budget it was a great deal! I also took into account the reviews and took them with a grain of salt. I wanted to wait for a couple weeks before doing the review. I wanted to get a feel of the machine and see whether it would fail me or not. I only had to hit reset once while playing a game on it. It's a given: Some machines will get hung up from time to time. Not having Google Play was the main reason why I gave the device 4 stars. Even that, nothing is perfect. You can get around the GetJar Shop issue by downloading Amazon Store (no plug intended) and 1Mobile Store apps.PROS:For a low-priced tablet, it's fairly stable. No major lagging issues to speak of. With a 1 GB processor chip and 1 GB of RAM, some of the apps I had on my smartphone go faster and smoother on the tablet. I know, it's an overstatement.Very durable. I have dropped it a couple of times and it keeps working!Some reviewers have given the built-in speaker a poor rating. I beg to differ; I think the built-in speaker does fine and the headphones that are included with the package do very well. I give the speaker/sound 5 out of 5 stars.The graphics/screen is clean and very nice. I can see very clearly on the touchscreen. And watching videos on YouTube is clean and crisp.Besides earphones, it also has USB cord adapters for the USB mini port for both male and female ends. Of course, it has the DC power adapter cord as well. And, the cleaning cloth does a great job wiping the prints off.WiFi receiver can connect to a b/g/n networks is great, which is a good plus for me.For now I may not use the HDMI output, but may come in handy should I use it to watch movies from tablet to TV in the future.The settings are quite easy to use as you can easily turn on/off the WiFi and even check the apps and being able to move the apps. Having a micro SDHC card reader helps. Both a pro and con, as you will see in the CONS section.CONS:The WiFi receiver has a limited scope.It only has a front-facing camera. I realize maybe people use it for video chatting and/or take profile pictures with it and that's fine. I figure for a low-priced tablet, having a front-mounted camera is common. The picture quality is pretty good considering the model.I realize maybe there was some limitations when making this tablet, but the micro card when inserted is not recognized as a \"SD\" card, but as an EXNT or some other classification. I am sure it is a standard now on these things.Anyway, bottom line is if you want an affordable, well-made tablet for under $200, I recommend the Coby Kyros MID7042. However, like any other review, take it with a grain of salt. Talk to those you know personally who own this device or similar.

Unfortunately the problems started almost immediately and I talked myself out of sending it back and now it is too late. For internet browsing, it is almost a complete waste of time. From the very beginning the built in web browser would freeze and I'd sit there for a few minutes watching an unmoving screen until a \"Browser has stopped working. Wait or Force Close\" error would appear. This error presented itself constantly with almost every app I opened, and every incident of trying to browse the internet. I downloaded the dolphin browser to see if that would fare any better. It did not. I also thought that not having access to Google Play wouldn't be that big a deal, or would be something I could get around via the Amazon mobile marketplace. This is not the case. Because you cannot download from Play you cannot get Facebook and a number of other very popular apps. Getjar's selection is paltry at best, and even trying to download directly from website does not work (most of them reroute you to Google Play anyway).I also had issues with the preinstalled book reader, aldiko. As with all functions it would constantly freeze and I would get the wait or force close error. Often I had to try to open the same app multiple times and I would get the error multiple times until I would run out of free time or just be so frustrated I had to give up.I was hoping that an update to the software might help the problem, since that was the experience I had with my phone; it had suddenly starting having lots of problems which persisted for a few months, until an update came out and from then on it ran very smoothly without any of the old errors.However, THERE IS AND WILL NEVER BE an update for this tablet. It is in the tablets FAQ on the Coby website. This is despite the fact that there is an \"automatic update\" options in the settings but this is for the apps and not the tablets internal software. Though in the tablet explorer program, I do receive a notice stating an update is available but every single time I have ever tried to update it, I sit and wait for 5 minutes while it downloads, choose the option to install and then get an error every time saying there is conflicting programs so the update could not be installed.And again, Coby's own FAQ states there will not be any updates made for the Coby Kyros 4.0.So I used this tablet mostly as a book reader using the FBreader app and for a while that worked out quite well. Sometimes I could get through to browse the internet, at least enough to check basic things and maybe read an article or two, but I do also have a laptop so for more advanced pursuits I used that.But then about a few weeks ago, a strip of screen about an inch wide, running along the left side of the tablet stopped responding to my touches. This is giving me issues with turning the page while reading, and if I want to type in a search or write an email I am constantly having to turn the tablet in circles in order to get the keyboard keys out of the unresponsive section and this is quite an exercise in patience. Sometimes it is not even possible, because in certain apps and websites the keyboard disappears as soon as the screen is turned to a different angle, and if the space you need to type in cannot be selected without turning the tablet to get to the needed keys, then there simply is no option to type in that field.I am not sure if all the Coby Kyros's have these issues but as I was hoping for an update which never came, I waited too long and now I cannot return the tablet. I could go through Coby's warrantee system but according to its website I have to print some documents and mail a cashiers check with the tablet, where it will then take several months to receive my new one. I am not sure I want to do all that just to be without a tablet at all for months. So I am considering just throwing or giving this one away and buying a new one.

This is my first tablet and I didn't want to invest more than $ 150 because I wanted to have some experience and see how much I enjoy using  a tablet before investing more. In fact, I was looking for a portable tablet especially for internet browsing which I could use when I am outdoors by accessing to wifi hotspots instead of connecting to internet with a smaller screen through my smart phone. Of course, pop3 / imap e-mail, a decent capacitive screen and new Ice cream sandwhich os packed up in less than $ 120 made  Coby Kyros mid 7042-4 a charming choice.I received the tablet a few days ago. My first concern right out of the box was the sharp edges which I had read in one of the earlier reviews. The first feeling of the sharpness made me thought, \"I shouldn't have bought it\". However, playing a little bit with applications and trying to get used to the tablet, I almost forgot about the edges; using the tablet is comfortable and this issue is not at all a deal breaker. Access to Amazon android store and 1mobile are plusses. As I primarily bought the tablet for internet browsing, adobe flash player is indispensable. Although not originally installed, it took only a few minutes to download and install the 11.1.111.9 version of adobe flash player from 1mobile. Then there was the first disappointment! It was not possible to visualize flash videos embedded in web sites. Googling the problem didn't help much: It seemed that this was not a common issue. I visited adobe's test pages which stated that no adobe flash player was found on my device though the tablet settings clearly showed that the flash application was successfully installed. As one of the Amazon reviewers had earlier wrote that adobe flash 11.1.111.5 worked well, I found and installed this earlier version of flash player but this didn't help either. It is not possible to watch videos on websites while interestingly, it is possible to watch you tube videos through the youtube application. I reported this problem to Coby support by e-mail. So far, no reply.  If I won't be able to find a solution to watching videos on websites I am seriously considering to return the tablet as this is a must have for me.Update after two months:- Still no answer to e-mails from Coby support;- Still flash player does not work;- Wi fi capture very weak;- Download function stopped working; Cannot download further applications or media either from getjar or through internet;- Device cannot see the content of the external sd card; if media content is downloaded on the sd card externally, i.e. from pc,  only some of the related applications can see and read such content such as aldiko book reader (for e-books) and mx player (for videos);- Certain applications (other than adobe flash) do not work; cannot reinstall them because downloading does not function;- An option that may at least \"hopefully\" eliminate some of the above problems is to  proceed with factory reset but (a) this will result in losing all applications and media that I had a\u015fready downloaded and (b) given all the problems I've had with this tablet, I have serious doubts that the tablet will restart after the reset.The above problems call for down-grading to one or two stars.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal for the price", "Author": "Kirk Taylor", "ReviewID": "RGR5IM8ZMRH1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As has been reported many timee, the little Coby tablets don't do everything.

The MID7048-4 is definitely better value", "Author": "GeekDad", "ReviewID": "R2ER40DAC8WDXX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update edit after 8+ months of use/abuse by the kids: Dropped to 3 star rating. Still an ok tablet, but Amazon is now advertising the 7\" MID7048-4 for $90 - that's a pretty great price. Main complaint is that the power supplies for both of our MID7042s died. USB and replacement chargers work fine, but still - annoying. 2nd beef is that even after a reboot, youtube sites will take a good 5-10 seconds (sometimes as much as 30) to load or even respond to a tab close. We've sort of \"trained\" our 3 year old to be patient, but it is a nuisance. Once something starts, it's pretty decent - MP4 movies from the SD card, games, etc.  That initial lag can be painful when you're used to the (4x more expensive) iPad or iPad mini. If you're willing to drop $220 or so check out the Lenovo IdeaPad A2109 - it's got an 8 hr battery, quad core cpu and a 9\" screen.It wasn't obvious to me at first how to install the Amazon Android App store, but then I realized you can just download it directly from www.amazon.com/amazonappstoreapp - maybe obvious to others, but after futzing around unsuccessfully for 10 minutes with the annoying  GetJar interface, and some unhelpful Google searches, I eventually stumbled on the Amazon site.Also, to comment on many of the suggestions below, there are several web sites and YouTube videos that go into detail of how to \"root\" the Coby in order to access Google Play (the other major Android app store), but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle, especially if you have run at some screen resolution different than the native size (things look smooshed).  Also, downloading an operating system from random enthusiast web sites, for a device with account information and email credentials seems sketchy.Other thoughts: the screen is pretty responsive, and pinch/zoom/swipe work smoothly.  I was pretty impressed with the sound using headphones - it's really good, actually.  Videos played from the SDHC card (I bought a retail 32GB SanDisk, which works great) and from Netflix worked great.  Angry Birds, Kindle reader, Acrobat and both the Dolphin and Opera browsers all work great.  Beware the free apps (our are mostly the paid versions), because I did get a couple of unwelcome Spam-ish apps on the home screen that sort of just showed up one day (something for purchasing cars and I think Priceline).After a week of use, I think the tablet hung maybe once or twice, but only after having a dozen apps open or downloading lots of apps at the same time.  Wifi and general browsing speed is pretty zippy.  The battery is definitely the major ding, but we're getting a pretty solid 3 hours with heavy use, and probably on the order of 24+ on standby.Overall, very happy with this little guy, and our kids love it.  I highly recommend the Poetic Slimbook case if you don't need the keyboard - it's a good fit to the 7042, and made specifically for it.For the price, this is a fair deal, and at this price point, when one of the munchkins drops it, I won't lose any sleep.Lastly, my protip to any parents out there is to definitely enable the Amazon App Store 'parental controls\" - which is really just a PIN number that's required before any purchases (sort of an anti-one-click option to protect your credit card from overzealous youngsters).", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best price/performance", "Author": "Rodolfo Baquero \"Cowboy80\"", "ReviewID": "R3S9MTTAF6BQH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two more tablets last year more expensive that this one, but this is much faster than the other two with android 4.Pros:-Fast (comparable with more expensive tablet)-Play a largue number of formats and codecs (mp4, avi, mkv, etc)-Come with all the basic necesary apication including a good file and task manager-The system consume low memory so you have more than 90% freeCons:-Not android market.

Poor resolution and poor viewing angles. I don't know what kind of screens the reviewers are looking at that said this screen was great, but its not. Still for the price it's workable.The one I got was a freeze machine. The fun part for me with a new tablet is getting it set up and customized. Don't know if it was a slow processor taking forever to recognize my input or an unresponsive screen but after about a half hour I was ready to throw this thing. Once I did fight past the screen after tap, after tap, after tap, it didn't get any better. Made it to Getjar finally. Looked cheap and clunky, still I expected that for the price. Started browsing the top apps and the top app on page 2 was called Amateurs #@!$ing. It had a nice picture of a young lady riding topless on a gentleman. I'm not a prude and had this been my tablet I would have been tempted to check it out, but this was for my kids. Section that off into an adult area or something at least. Every page had 1 or 2 porn related apps on it. Not bad for a grown up, not cool for the kiddos.Tried to download Talking Tom and nothing. Restarted and tried again, made it to 45% downloaded this time and then frozen. No inputs would work, restarted again. Gave up and tried Temple run. Again, frozen. Let it set for 20 minutes. Screen didn't even turn off, it just sat there not working. Restarted again.Decided to download the amazon app store. It actually downloaded perfectly and installed perfectly. Opened right up, and I started to have hope. Tried to open the games category and frozen. No response of any kind from the tablet. Restarted again, tried again. After about 2 hours I had managed to download 1 app. At that point I gave up. Packed it up and it's coming back.Other than all that it overall felt cheap. Again, expected but you should probably know about it before you buy. I've bought cheap before and got really nice products. It has a weird plastic edge around it. It almost felt like they had a tablet body, and took an over-sized plastic case and put it over the front of the tablet. The back of the tablet seemed normal, the plastic edge felt weird and extremely flimsy. Also it kept telling me the sd card had been mounted, then it would tell me the sd card had been unexpectedly removed. There was no sd card anywhere near this thing at any time. Thought I got lucky and there was an sd card in the slot but it was empty.

The reason why I bought this one was mainly because of the price and because it has a USB port, different then the iPad for example.But what I have to say first, I rooted this tablet after I received it. What that means is, that you basically delete the existing operating system on the tablet and upload another system. I now still have Android 4, but the main difference is, that I can use the Google Play AppStore to download apps. That wasn't possible before. And if you search the Internet about how to root this tablet you will see that it is actually pretty easy.This said, it is great to have a tablet with USB, WiFi and all kinds of different apps that you can find for Android. Most Games are working pretty good, only sometimes when the tablet becomes hot from game playing it forces the game to close. But that was no major problem for me yet. Browsing the Internet with the dolphin web browser app works pretty good. Watching youtube or news works fine. I also have a bunch of PDFs with important information on my tablet. With my 16GB memory card that works out just fine. All apps are being installed on the internal tablet memory and I have quite a lot games installed right now and never had any issues with the memory space. If you want you can connect your mouse or keyboard to the USB port and use it. Never tried the HMI port yet, don't know why they put that on, but it's nice to have. The camera itself is on the screen side, not on the back. And I have to say, for using the cam in skype, it is not perfect. People that are chatting with you will just see you head, thats all. If you want them to see more you have to hold your tablet camera pretty far away.Also happy with the battery so far, but can't really say how long one charge lasts. Never tested it from a charge to the end.So it's a nice thing to have. If you don't know which Coby Kyros model to buy, I would recommend this.

I was new to the tablet world so I didn't know what to expect.  I wanted this tablet mainly for surfing the web, emails, reading books, watching DVD's, and word processing specifically for when I'm not at home.  I do travel and wanted to watch DVD's while on the airplane as well as reading books.  The problem as I see it with the tablet when considering what I wanted it for was the 4 GB.  That really isn't very much and, since the external SD card can't be used for a lot, the 4 GB gets used up fast.  I thought I would be able to put digital movies on the external SD so as not to use up the internal space but, at least with the ultraviolet (Flixster) ones, you can't do that.  The Flixster program won't allow it to be used on the external SD (I contacted them to verify this!).  True, you can delete movies and then download them again if you want but that isn't the most convenient.  Also, it has made me leery of trying to add too many more apps.  I did want to get the ThinkFree Office program to create documents, etc. but I don't know if I will have the room on the 4 GB internal SD for that as well as a movie.  Priorities...That really is my only complaint.  This tablet starts up fast, it changes websites fast, the battery lasts a long time, and I love the size.  Speaking of the battery, I was able to watch a 2 1/2 hour movie and only used up about half the battery charge.  The screen is shiny and lights glare on it so it wasn't that great at watching movies on a plane or reading (I had to keep moving the tablet to avoid the glare) at first.  Once I put on the anti glare film, all was good.  That solved that problem.7-31-13.  Well, sad to say but now the touch screen isn't responding.  I tried resetting it and everything. I think it might be a loose wire and, since it's still under warranty, I tried contacting Coby. Their website says you must call Customer Service before returning a product but when you call Customer Service, it tells you to go to the website and then hangs up on you.  I tried emailing the tech support as well as customer service but never heard anything back.  So I did some googling.  Apparently they are not doing so well. They lost a law suit and have laid off most of their staff.  I hope that's not correct but, based on the lack of response, etc. I kinda think they are going belly up.  Very sad.

I am sure it's simple but the operating manual is tiny with type that requires my old eyes to use a magnifying glass. It was the cheapest I found with HDMI output. It also has a limited app store compared to Google \"Play Store\".Curious to note, I have another 9\" tablet monitor (Pandigital Novel R90L200) running the same app. It crashes on schedule every five days. The resistive touch screen seems primitive. I would never use it for anything except the monitor function. Almost unusable. But it was cheap. You get what you pay for.

When you try to add apps you'll discover that without a custom ROM you can't use Google Play and you can't add any Google-specific apps, like those for Gmail or Google Reader, so you'll have to make do with what you can find on GetJar and Amazon, which is admittedly a lot to make do with, but if you have something you love on your Android phone you may have to do some digging to find it for your Kyros, if it's even available.  Some apps won't work with the Kyros or won't work well - I've spent weeks trying to get Astrid to work properly; it works, after a fashion, but I can't use the voice input or sync it with Google Tasks, so it's just short of pointless.Aside from that the Kyros is a very good tablet and a pleasure to use for watching movies or reading and for the price it's hard to beat.

Anything else it could do with multimedia was just kind of a bonus to me.  Priced in the same area as a kindle touch, this thing can do a lot more.It comes loaded with the latest Android OS, 4.0.  It has a capacitive screen like all the new tablets.  4gb of built in storage, which can be easily expanded to 36 with what SD Micros, now considered cheap tech.  Adobe support (as common as it is) is always a plus for me.  It's nice to see that youtube play is advertised on the back of the box, which makes me feel a little more confident in what I purchased.And most surprisingly, this thing can hold a charge.  After 1 hour of constant internet surfing I was surprised to see my battery was still hovering around 85 percent.  I didn't really expect much considering this is where cheap tablets suffer sometimes, but Coby manages something that I feel rivals the more popular Kindle fire.Negatives.  The camera is strictly for video chat (which I haven't tested).  It's not very good quality, but who really cares when your phone probably gets better clarity anyway?  The tablet also doesn't have google play out of the box, but you can root it (which is fairly easy to do) so it does.  Someone did that for me already, but doing so requires a bit more research.  The average user may not even care, but if you want access to a larger library of apps, having google play is almost essential.
