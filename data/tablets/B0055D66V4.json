LATEST NEWS 12-09: HP HAS RELEASED WEBOS TO OPEN SOURCE SO IT'S EXPECTED TO SEE MANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS FROM 3RD PARTIES ALONG WITH SUPPORT.  HP PLANS TO CONTINUE TO INVEST INTO WEBOS AND PLANS ANOTHER WEBOS TABLET TO BE RELEASED IN 2013.MY VIDEO ATTACHED. (Overclocked at 1.5Ghz)First of all,  whether you are a geek or not,the Touchpad along with the webOS Homebrew community touts big advantages over it's competitors and this has been often overlooked by reviewers.  I've attached my video that shows the performance of an enhanced Touchpad running at 1.5Ghz.  However don't be mistaken, the HP Touchpad still performs fast with the original speed of 1.2Ghz.  I'm just a very busy person and a little obsessed with technology plus I wanted to express what the Touchpad can become (within an hour of your time) if you really wanted to spice things up.I WAS AN IPAD2 USER.I've had my Touchpad since launch day July 1st and even before the upgrade I have seen significant improvements in my work productivity overall.  Previously, I was an iPad2 user and now that I have the Touchpad, I believe there is absolutely NO WAY I would go back to the iPad2.  The Touchpad really outshines the iPad2 when you want to be productive.  It's more than just a good business asset, I find it really enjoyable for entertainment purposes; great sound, watch movies, 3D gaming and YouTube videos directly from YouTube itself.MY NEW SKILL.After a over a month of vigorously using the device, I feel like I've graduated to \"Touchpad Power User.\" However,  I'm still discovering new good things to improve my daily use.  One example is to stack 5 applications together and bounce from one another with two button presses.  As a personal trainer that is always on the workout floor, this is a handy skill.  I often stack the Calendar, Email, Tracking App, Stop watch, and Notepad all together and it gives me the ability to monster-task during a client's session.TIPS FOR THE NEW BUYER1.  During set up be patient.  The device is always gathering information in the background and you may think that it's completed.  You may need to create a webOS account, but it's fairly easy.2. System Restart: Do it properly by going to Settings/Device Info/Reset Options/Restart Don't just hold the power button.3. Update!  Go to Settings/System Updates.  Prompt to reboot.4. Apps open up faster the second time and third time around, you will see a significant speed improvement. Sometimes blazing fast.5. Get the case.  No more complaining on finger prints.6. If you still want your Touchpad to perform even faster, consider installing Homebrew applications.  This is a strong community. I've attached a video with this review so you can see what an overclocked 1.5GHz Touchpad can do. But with Homebrew and open source there's more you can do than just this upgrade.THICKNESS, APPS AND  REAR CAMERA?I thought I'd miss the rear camera of not having the iPad2 anymore, but after some thought I realized that my cell phone camera takes better pictures and video anyway!  Apps?  I currently have 33 apps installed on my Touchpad and excited with the catalog growth so far.  Thickness?  With the thin Touchpad case there's not much significance compared to an iPad2 installed in a thick case (mine was plastic.) So the iPad2's thin factor is not much of a difference.NEGATIVE THINGS?Skype and messaging seems to be under polished. Can't figure out if I'm signed in to Skype and my old Pre will not work in SMS.  Perhaps later on?  ONE MORE THING!  The Touchpad is very addictive.  You want to do more because you can, but you drain the battery as well!", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good Option for Tablets", "Author": "Jonathan Pozo \"Jonny P\"", "ReviewID": "R2PJVOBLL5VGA7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this from Amazon, as always got it quick. My back ground is I've owned an IPAD and asus windows tablet. After trying them out I was still unsatisfied with the products. It wasn't providing me what I was looking for. I wanted a tablet with good battery life, good aps, experience the 'real' web, do some entertainment (videos, games, music), keep myself connected with social media, and finally do some note taking for work/ everyday things. Looking at the reviews and the advertisements I gave the HP Touchpad a go.The Breakdown based on a few days exp:OS: A +HP OS is probably the highest point in this tablet.Synergy makes the whole multitasking a breezy and keeps everything in synch. The whole process to get connected with your email, facebook, and calendar is simple.You can just do lots of things out of the box, no need to go hunting for apps.No Icons Everywhere in the home screen.You can browse the WHOLE internet without having black screens because of \"missing a plugin\".APPs: B-HP App market is lacking. You could take in to account that it just launched and will have more coming. If you patient you'll start seeing new ones every week. From whats available NOW you can manage. There are games and several productivity apps worth checking out.Hardware: B-This is the weakest thing for me for the Hp Touchpad. Every Tablet in the market right now has : front /back camera, expandable memory slot, hdmi output, and Real USB connections.HP TP has front camera, max 32 gb memory, and one micro usb connection. WTF...  Lacking big time.If your like me that likes options for inputs/outputs this is a low blow.Screen for HP TP is great, all the pictures and videos look nice and I think the resolution is fine. The touch response is good too.Battery is good too. 5-6 hours . If you leave it on all night it will get low on battery. Not much standby power.Price: B-The majority of tablets are 300-499 range. The 32 gb TP is ~560 bucks in amazon. Hardware wise its not worth that. A little too steep for the competition.Conclusion: HP Touch's operating system could just be the seller here for people that are in search for something friendly and do real multitasking. Or people that didn't like android or iOS.Price and Hardware are big negatives. Probably the best thing is get this when the price drops under 450 or wait for second Generation.You just got to see what is important to you and what specifically you \"need\" in a your tablet.For me I might keep this :)update 9-9-11after the prices tanked cause of the announcement of HP not supporting it anymore. I returned mine (full refund from amazon) and actually bought another for 135 from hp.com :-)why did I buy another ?Because it is just a easy and brilliant product.HP did announce continued support for the apps and updates .which is true they have done a recent update and just came out with a new edition of the HP magazine for the touchpad which is a neat ideA to discover new apps.here are some positives:+HP gave a 50 buck credit for apps+free box.net 50 gb  of space online+ found preware  homebrew community that releases apps and anything you can think of to add a whole different experience . They have a app to overclock the CPU :-)+new apps added weekly+noticed faster internet and processing with updateswith the touchpad being cheaper. Give this a try. Support will be there for a while because over 250k of units are out there and HP is making more. Developers love the touchpad.update 12/15/11+ I keep using my TP. The apps are still flowing and the web is just easy to use on this.+HP fired their previous CEO and the new one announced that palm os will be open source. Open source is like the android. Which is a positive thing because it guarantees is way or form updates and new apps from developers.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "From a dedicated apple fan... This IS a good device", "Author": "D. Higgins \"Code Farmer\"", "ReviewID": "RZ1O1XJX4HI54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an admitted mac guy, I have the iPhone 4, iPad, Macbook Pro, etc...I have to share my support now with the HP TouchPad. The webOS 3.0 is really pretty amazing. I didn't think it would make much of a difference in the use of a tablet, but it's outstanding, and here's why:1) The integration of so many mainstream services used today. (they probably have some fancy term for this concept)2) Flash plays well3) Services missing on the iPad like Grooveshark and Amazon's cloud music all work.First, the services:On my TouchPad, I setup myEmail (yahoo, google, and microsoft exchange)SkypeDropboxAIMLinkedInFacebook(there were others, but I don't use snapfish, and photobucket, etc...  even a \"find others\")I love this integration of all these mainstream services! It's really clever.While my iPad seems very app-centric, webOS 3.0 feels more like \"the matrix has you\". It takes your online world and puts it into the tablet. I love that. All of those websites I often interact with get glued together seamlessly so I feel like I'm \"jacked in\".A major strength of the TouchPad is the web functionality that won't work on the iPad. For example, I ran Amazon's cloud music player and Grooveshark just fine (awesome!).On the down side, the apps are slim, but trust me, they will be coming fast and furious over the next year, like a modern-age gold rush. As someone who has ported over my C++ game engine and product ( atPeace ) to TouchPad from IOS, I can tell you that it was pretty easy, and others will certainly follow. This version 1 of the product is the closest any tablet is to competing with Apple, developers will soon be pouring over.My only real gripe is not having NetFlix working with it yet. That's coming I'm sure, but something I use on my iPad a lot, and I miss. :(All in all, I'd say if you want something for business, or to have a tablet built around your online presence, or just a good tablet which can run flash, this might be for you. I still love my iPad, don't get me wrong, but for a long time I didn't see why anyone was realistically imagining they could compete with the iPad. I mean, Apple does it sooooo well. Well, now I understand why.  WebOS 3.0.Don't discount this device, it's got great potential.  We finally a good competitor for Apple in the tablet world, which should make both products improve.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touchpad vs the other tablets", "Author": "P. knight \"Speed expert\"", "ReviewID": "R1YHB9OV6IW580", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HP Touchpad's WebOS is vastly superior to Android and iOS.These would be but words, if there was no evidence to back it up, so here it is.The constant cons/complaints from alleged professional reviewers go as follows.It is thicker and heavier than an iPad. Although that is true, it is not so heavy or thicker as to be an inconvenience and more importantly, part of the reason it is bigger is because of the superior hardware inside, bigger processor, more ran  and the audio system/speakers.The Touchpad needs the more powerful CPU and greater amount of ram than an iPad for example, as it muititasks many apps at the same time, as opposed to a machine than can only do one, or sometimes two if one considers multitasking to be the ability to play music while surfing a single internet page.When a video stream is coming in too slow, I minimize the page and do something else whilst it loads the stream.Try that on an iPad.The stereo sound from a Touchpad is of greater quality than the single speaker in an iPad, not to mention the added ambiance by having stereo over mono.Good hifi speakers are bigger and heavier than cheap tin can models, so if you want better sound like the Touchpad has, then the size will not matter to you one bit.Next complaint from the \"pros\" is that WebOS does not have as many apps as Apple. Again that is true but is it truly a problem? No, it is not. There are ample already available, and now with the news of more to come, there are and will be more than any one person might ever want to use. It is a non issue.Lastly comes the big one. The \"pros\" said it was slow, that it might jam up, that it could take too long to switch from horizontal to portrait mode. Those comments are only a semi truth. The fact is that if you operate it one app at a time like an iPad, then it not only isn't slow, it is faster than an iPad, specially after you have applied all the tweaks that are freely available on the internet. As an iPad is incapable of multitasking, there are no slowdowns in general, as the internal hardware is more than capable of handling any one single task at a time, whereas the Touchpad is a completely different type of device that multitasks, and just like a home computer, will eventually slow down if there are too many apps open at the same time. The \"pros\" reviews about slowing down are so unfair when they compare it to an iPad that the question becomes, were they paid by Apple to say that or are they all that ignorant. Even a child knows that too many applications open at the same time, spells slowdowns and maybe even a crash. To spell it out by citing an example, it would be like saying that Joe Blow never has problems eating one hotdog at a time, but he slows down when he eats 8 at a time. The scenario is ridiculous and the comparison is unjust.If it is justifiable to bad mouth a computer type product that slows down from too many open windows, then it would apply to every single computer in the world, except an iPad, that can't do more than one thing at a time. Now that the three main complaints have been addressed and proven to be non-issues, it is time to talk about why a Touchpad is such a superior machine. Any knowledgeable techie knows that the WebOS interface is the best of the group of multitasking tablet operating systems. iOS has a very nice interface too and some might argue that it is as good as that of the Touchpad, but it is not included in these comparisons, as it is not a multitasking computer system, therefore doesn't have to deal with many open apps at the same time. How could anyone discuss the various ways that Android and WebOS deal with multiple apps being open and include the iPad in that conversation, when the iPad can't even have multiple apps open?I fully recognize the value of an iPad and I perceive it as it is, a wonderful machine, well built, with an ultra simple interface that can be easily operated by young children and even IQ challenged individuals.The more sophisticated tablets that operate like computers, have common advantages and even common problems, that simply don't apply to a machine that does only one thing at a time.In short, the iPad is a type of toy that is also capable of surfing the internet, although not completely like the Touchpad, and it can use chat services like MSN Messenger and Skype, although it does not fully integrate Skype like the Touchpad does.Apple products have become a status symbol to own and they are generally high quality products, and the iPad fits perfectly into that category. Where it does not belong is in comparisons to computer like tablets, as the iPad is a type of toy and not a utilitarian device like the Touchpad.I own both an iPad and a Touchpad and can tell you that my Touchpad is a bit faster than my iPad, and 10 times more useful..............................................................................................Added observations, Sept. 20, 2011.As per the review above, it isn't hard to guess that my Touchpad is much preferred over my iPad. (that my girlfriend has now appropriated and wouldn't let go of without a fight to the death.)Inspired by some long waits to open webpages (on the Touchpad), I thought it was time to do an internet browsing speed comparison between it and the iPad.We have Caribbean internet speed that is somewhat lacking when compared to even the slowest US plan, and a fast browser is critical for us, so as to not spend our lives waiting on webpages.To cut to the chase, this is what I discovered.When trying to compare the two, I was stunned to discover that the two units rarely landed on identical pages.The iPad would have a modified www address that might include the word \"ipad\" or \"tablet\" and it presented pages that have clearly been \"tuned\" for 25 million iPad users.If I went to Yahoo news, for instance, the iPad would give me different headlines than the Touchpad or a Windows PC.It's not as if I didn't already know that an Ipad couldn't open many webpages or youtube videos and that it simply won't let the user go to those pages that it can't deal with, but I never thought/knew that Apple was also controlling some of the www content.My initial reaction was to feel like I was in China, cut off from the rest of the world wide web.On the other hand, everyone is trying to control the internet, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc, so why shouldn't Apple be allowed to play in the same sandbox.....So......You would like the results of the test, as would I.I simply could not make any true clinical observations, when the two machines rarely even opened identical pages.My non clinical observation was that they are similar in speed and neither could be declared the victor, except in terms of the Touchpad being able to connect with the normal web as we know it, as opposed to Apple's modified version.So instead of coming out of this with a webpage speed comparison between the two units, all it showed was what I already knew, that an iPad is a toy that has a lot of internet connectivity and many good computer uses, whereas the Touchpad is a computer that has some toyishness about it.It can play games like the iPad but has a seriously limited library when compared to the iPad's.On the other hand, it functions much more like a real computer as we know it, with it's capacity to have several functions/processes running at the same time.When someone sends me a video link, it usually refuses to stream all the way through, because of our slow bandwidth, so it's normal for me to pause and minimize the page and do something else, whilst the video clip downloads.That's impossible to do on the iPad.You can pause it and let it download, but you CANNOT do something else in the meantime, other than twiddle your thumbs and wait.If you want to buy a fantastic gift for the kids, it would be hard to beat an iPad.If you would like a touch tablet to do the same things you normally do on a computer, then the Touchpad is the machine for you.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet, more tablet apps than Android", "Author": "Jeremy Akers", "ReviewID": "RM2B4NIIE61SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TouchPad is not exactly a full replacement for the iPad since it doesn't have as many apps, but there are a number of things you can do with the TouchPad that the iPad can not do:1.)  Run multiple apps.  The iPad simulates multi-tasking but it really just pauses each app and closes it when you switch to a different app.  The WebOS on the TouchPad lets each app continue working in the background so you can be more productive.1.b) Speaking of multi-tasking, notifications appear as icons at the top of the screen and do not take focus away from whatever you are working on, so you don't get interrupted every time some notification pops up.  On the iPad notifications pop up a dialog box that must be dismissed before you can continue using the tablet.2.)  Searching with \"Just Type\". With WebOS you don't need to think about what app you need to load to look for a piece of data.  Want to call a friend?  'Just type' their name, as soon as you've entered the first few letters you'll start to see matching contacts.  Want to search the web for a new toy?  Just start typing it's name, and then choose 'Search Google' or 'Search Amazon' and it will perform the search on those websites.  Just Type searches through all of the content stored on the TouchPad, as well as contacts, calendar events and documents in your accounts such as Google or Exchange, in addition to allowing you to search all of your favorite websites.  All by just typing in what you're looking for.3.)  Connect to your corporate VPN.  iPads can't do this nor can Android based tablets.4.)  Seamlessly combine all of your accounts with Synergy.  Only WebOS lets you access all of your calendars, email, simultaneously.  WebOS also fully supports exchange so you can easily access your work email and calendars.5.)  Homebrew.  Only WebOS allows you to download apps, patches and system level modifications from alternate sources.  You can literally customize just about any aspect of the system.  Apple sues people who try and make these modifications to Apple products.6.)  Flash videos.  With an iPad you can't watch flash videos.  With the TouchPad you can literally pull up hulu.com in the browser and watch movies.  And since you don't need a \"Mobile App\" to access the Hulu content, you don't have to pay $7.99 a month to watch your shows on the TouchPad like you do on the iPad.7.)  50 GB FREE space on Box.net for *life* ... Integration with Dropbox, box.net, Google docs...  You can access all of your files directly from the TouchPad.  There is also a Mighty meeting app that lets you do remote presentations (Powerpoints, documents) over the Internet directly from the TouchPad.8.)  Beats Audio.

Some thoughts:1. The battery life is awesome! 6.5 hours of continuous heavy use only used up 65% of my battery!2. You get the real web, flash actually plays remarkably well. You can just play videos straight on youtube, are able to click links in them etc. Not a huge fan of flash, but it is everywhere!3. If you are familiar with webOS, the operating system on the TouchPad, you know how awesome the mutli-tasking is, widely held to be best mobile interface in that regards, and it really shines on this beautiful large screen.4. As a retailer rep at a big electronic store commented after I showed \"it does so much for you\" and unlike his phone/pad on the TouchPad you dont have to figure out which app to use, go find it, launch it, & then start typing, on here you just start typing what you are thinking then choose the app to finish it with in an easy list (email, fb, twitter, memo, calendar, and the list goes on!).5. Although it does have a limited number of apps compared to the tablet market leader, it has many of the important ones, and most are outstanding quality with very few ads to be seen! The main thing to remember is you dont need an app for a whole lot of things, you have the real web just like on a computer! Imagine if you had to go find app for each website you wanted to visit on your computer, nuts right? This works like your computer, apps when you want them, the real web the rest of the time.6. Your accounts are tied right into the tablet, and you can access everything from one place... You can chat on google, skype, aim, yahoo, etc. (even sms with a new HP webOS phone) all from the same place built right into the messaging app. Email is the same way & is the best email interface I have ever seen, and I am excited to have it on my computer next year when HP starts putting webOS on every PC they sell (some time of window you can run webOS apps in most likely).7. Love video skyping on this!8. Could it have a rear camera, sure, doubt I would use it much (thats what my smartphone &/ camera is for) especially if it is a poor quality camera like the leading device.9.

Well I started to look for a tablet about 5 months ago, and thought for sure, after the big uproar about the iPad 2, that I would have one soon. Well after trying in store several times, I just wasnt blown away. It just took my iPhone bigger, it didnt introduce anything new, it didn't change anything, the UI, had some slight modifications, and apps did look better on a bigger screen, but it wasn't nothing that blew away. Then came the touchpad.First I saw the commercial, then I found out about the open source movement inside of WebOS, and how unlike Apple, there was no cat and mouse games, Palm didn't support it, but didn't block it. I saw the UI, it was much appealing than Android, which to me looks chaotic and not the clean simplicity that we all come to expect from a google product. Although it wasn't as \"nice\" looking as iOS, and it didn't run as smooth as it, WebOS made up for it with true multitasking, and a clean enough looking UI to make an iOS lover happy.Then came the specs, full web access, web developers no longer need to build a site just for the device, the device can handle anything you through at it. It has been an experience for me, who has had to manage which sites I could view on my portable device and which ones I *had* to view on my pc, now my touchpad takes care of all of it.But enough about the pros, because there is some cons. Apps are limited compared to iOS (Not a huge con for me, give me a working Twitter client, an email client, and a couple games, and I'm happy, but I'm not everyone). The OS, has some flaws, which may be more to me learning to using the device than anything else, but the flaws are there. It seems sluggish from time to time, but an OTA update coming out soon should fix that. And it does need some improvement when it comes to handling documents, this maybe more of a personal presence but I feel any tablet should be able to handle any microsoft doc you throw at it.All in all, I love my touchpad, and see me using it more than my iPhone for most things.

Wanting to rule out buyers remorse, I tried the Ipad 2 and the Acer Iconia (android honeycomb) tablets recently to be sure I would know what I was comparing.  The Ipad is very nice, no argument there, but I understood why people complain about the closed Apple system.  There was little cross platform functionality with the Ipad.  I was much less impressed with the android tablet.  Things just didn't seem to work right, some apps didn't work because I had the \"wrong\" android device, and there didn't really seem to be all that many apps for an adroid tablet, rather they were mostly for android phones.As far as the touchpad goes, the only complaint I could give is the lack of apps.  However, that can be expected right now, and I hope to see many apps coming soon.  The look and feel of the touchpad is very nice.  Other reviews made it sound like it would be a big brick, but I barely notice that it is a little thicker than the Ipad, and it feels very nice in my hands.  In a week or two I'll have the HP Case, and I won't have any worries about finger prints.  Fingerprints on the Ipad screen were just as much of an issue, and I find myself needed to wipe it clean occassionally.  As for the back, no concerns there.Here's to HP doing a great job with their first WebOS pad out of the gate, and looking forward to the apps that will be coming.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Originality and refinement", "Author": "Joshi", "ReviewID": "R2BK7B9UDCHXNM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is a single broad,overarching reason I really like this tablet after playing with it for a few hours.It is elegant. It is refined. It does some common, basic things beautifully, unlike the others - be they android or iPad. The rest - Facebook, Kindle, thousands of apps - they will happen, but its the core device that I truly like. If the core device is rough, no amount of apps can fix that fundamental goof.(Unlike the iPad, which, 18 months after launch, Still has: No replaceable batteries, no flash, no stereo speakers, no stereo microphones, no multitasking, no rubberised back side for a firm grip.Great pitching, though. Probably the same people who sold pet rocks).Anyway, coming back to the Touchpad, what is more elegant? What is more refined?1. The very first thing is the charging system. The Touchpad charges very simply; you just slide it it into its dock. You slip it in, it charges. Like Apple says, it just works. No futzing with wires, jacks and other crude methods that have not changed in the past fifty years. Even the big Kahuna, the ipad, has a wire that you turn this way and that, trying to ram it into the socket one way or the other. With the Touchpad, you simply slip it into the stand, and you are done. ipad, Android, what have you - find the connector, find the wire, line them up, twist the wire around to be sure its aligned, re-twist it, push it in, twist again if you got it wrong....Is it that big a deal? Totally. When you have to charge it every couple  of days, fumbling with wires and jacks gets boring really fast. (How do I know? From trying to charge my wife's ipad and failing half the time because the socket never really fitted right.)2. Notifications. If you get an email in the middle of reading a webpage, for example, The iPad interrupts whatever you are doing, and blares out the notification right in the middle of the screen, right in your face - as if I would miss it if was done quietly off to the side. The Touchpad is far more refined - the notifications come up on the top. If it is an email, it will update in the background, and if the tablet is sleeping, the home button gently glows. The iPad/Androids are crude in comparison.Is this a big deal?  Once again, to me, yes it is. When I am reading a book, the last thing I want is to be interrupted by a BIG notification blob in the middle of the page telling me I have got a text message. Say it quietly on the side - and I will get to it.3. Apps handling. How on earth can you even deal with the primitive way apps are handled in current tablets? To open one app, you have to close the other. Its like having to lock your bedroom before you go to the bathroom. Then lock the bathroom when you get back to the bedroom. I like leaving the rooms in my house open, so I can walk about them freely. I like leaving apps open, going from one to the other effortlessly. Does Apple seriously want anyone to believe that their way - one app at a time - is a good way to run multiple apps? And the more apps there are, the more you have to do the shut/open routine. Whats the use of a million apps if, to use one, you have to shut down the previous one?Not to say that the Touchpad has its shortcomings. The software needs some more work, the screen rotation could use a bit of tweaking (update July 2nd - screen rotation seems to have worked itself out today - works well now), it could lose a bit of weight. But the way I see it is that the engineers who worked on the Touchpad had real focus on refinement and attention to detail. If that attitude persists, they will get there in a bit. The Android crew are all about getting a boatload of stuff out the door. And Apple is about incredible marketing, and selling their kool-aid. I wish their attention to detail was as refined as their attention to marketing.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A little rough around the edges, but has lots of potential", "Author": "vlim", "ReviewID": "R2N4O5FZUSLA9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had reluctantly started using the iPhone 4 after many years with Windows Mobile.  I must say that I really enjoy the iPhone experience, and only have a few minor gripes with it.  Recently got an iPad 2, and while it's enjoyable, and great for kids to watch videos on, I found it a little awkward to use as a laptop replacement.So I was very interested in the Touchpad.  Overall, I really like the Touchpad, and it took a little bit of time to get used to it, after using iOS for about one year.  Here's what I like:1) Card-based multitasking is great.  I can close windows and apps very easily, and bring back open ones nicely.  It's a more elegant way to switch between apps than iOS, especially going back and forth between e-mails or web pages.2) Resizable keyboard with number keys on the main keyboard.  Although the iOS keyboard is fine for a phone, it worked poorly for me on an iPad.  I like the Touchpad's much better, opting to reduce it to the small size keyboard.3) Flash works fairly well, although there are some stutters when resizing the browser.  But Amazon cloud player worked, as did Hulu and ABC web sites.4) Synergy - incorporating multiple on-line services such as Facebook, Dropbox, Exchange, and others, makes it very easy to work in the cloud.5) Erasing the device was painless (and maybe too easy?).  But recovery without a PC, such as the iPad was a snap.  The device automatically synced my previously downloaded apps.  Re-enter your passwords for the online services, and you're set.6) Audio sounds really good.  I don't know if the Beats help much, but the speakers sound decent, and with the cheap iPhone headphones, sound better than the iPhone.7) Wireless printing was effortless.  It found my printer, and I was able to print web pages and PDF files easily.  Way easier than with iOS.I do have a few complaints and hopefully many will get corrected very soon:1) I managed to crash the Touchpad a few times doing things like resizing images or starting apps.  There are bugs to be worked out for sure.2) The display rotation is too sensitive.  There were times when it would rotate too easily, but also times where the device wouldn't rotate without a few tries.  Rotation lock, while not a physical switch, proved very useful.3) The screen is a fingerprint magnet.  Fortunately it comes with a cloth.4) Battery life is perhaps a little bit less than an iPad 2, but decent.5) Web browser dragging is annoying when trying to use Flash-based sites.  Instead of clicking on a button, you end up dragging and moving the window.6) At a few points, the screen seems a little unresponsive, or at least not immediately responsive.7) Text selection is not as nice as iOS.  With iOS, you can press and hold, and then move the cursor to where you want it with the magnification.  This type of functionality would help immensely, especially when doing lots of typing.Some people complain that lacking a rear-facing camera and the heavier weight are huge detractors, but I barely notice it.  Sure, it's thicker than and iPad 2 and weighs more, but it's not that big of a deal.  I really don't mind it.  I don't have much need for taking pictures with the Touchpad either.  The phone can do that, and I can copy pictures via Dropbox.A small selection of apps is not too big of a deal at this point, since you can easily go online and use the full desktop version of many services.  Lots of iOS apps are just repackaged web sites.  No big deal.  But a note taking app with which you can hand write or draw would make this a great office tool.  The Evernote app needs to be updated for the larger screen for sure.Overall, the HP Touchpad is a viable contender, especially if HP can get the updates out very soon.

That, plus its ability to play Flash video, means that it has two things going for it that the iPad hasn't.First impressions:Solid but not too heavy, the TouchPad has a 4:3 screen, which personally I think makes a better screen for work, rather than the 16:9 variant preferred in the Android ecosystem, which is ideal for gazing at widescreen trailers of the next Transformers movie.There is a front-facing camera and an oval \"home\" button; the home button serves the same purpose as on the iPad, waking up the screen or returning you to the \"home\" page (which may be a view of your current running processes).

She is a student and didn't have a laptop so I thought this would be a great gift for her to log in to her student portal, check her email, do online banking, etc.  However, after she started using it, come to find out she can't do ANY of these things.  Why?  Because the HP Touchpad does NOT support ANY sites that use Java.  Basically, any site with \"https\" secure encryption cannot be accessed because of the lack of Java support.After calling the HP Touchpad Butler support service to troubleshoot this, the representative point-blank told us that Java isn't supported and there were no plans in the future to support it.  After that the rep had the nerve to say that the Butler service would only be free for another 30 days and there would be a fee afterward.Because of the lack of Java support, this basically makes the tablet a large paper weight as far as my girlfriend's uses are concerned.  The worst part is I actually did my research before purchasing this device and read other reviews on here and no one seemed to mention the complete lack of Java support (nor did the Amazon ad itself), which is why I am writing this review, which I normally don't do.If you use Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, online banking, or virtually any other website that is secure and requires a login and password, then DO NOT buy this device because you won't be able to access those accounts.

Within 10 minutes I had a complete synchronization of my 3500 contacts, calendars, and email/folder system for both my business gmail and personal aol accounts.The hardware and build are excellent, as expected with the new HP ownership of the Palm/webOS platform.  I have loved my Palm Pre Plus, but the build quality is not the best, though it has stood up very well against two years of heavy use--HP has lifted a great operating system to the tablet space with a style that the latter days Palm could never have dreamed.At 1.6 lbs, the tablet is not too heavy.  The screen has a gorgeous 1024x768 resolution, making such games as Angry Birds HD and HD Video a joy to play and watch.  The battery life has been very strong, and I have yet to run it down below 40% after more than six hours of heavy use.  The speed is excellent, though not quite as fast as the iPads I have tested, although the difference is small and when you factor in the gains from true multitasking and a very sophisticated notification system it is clear the iPad is only faster due to suspending background apps and simply not computing as much!The primary benefit of the webOS operating system is to heavy business users like me who require an integrated approach to email, calendars, tasks, notifications and information.  The seamless gathering of all this information and presenting in Calendar and Contacts while integrating Facebook and Twitter makes this my new mobile solution--move over ASUS netbook.  Everything from contacts and calendar is backed up in the cloud each night by HP.  The calendar tells me via color coding the source of info, whether Google, aol, Facebook, Outline Tracker, etc.Full access to the web with Flash support and Adobe eReader is a huge advantage too.  I get the same access as on my trusty netbook.The audio is simply astounding--the sound coming out of this tablet really defies belief.  With headphones it is actually less impressive, not sure why.Skype is built into the phone app and works marvelously.  The tablet pairs simply with my PrePlusVerizon via Bluetooth and can make calls via Skype or the phone.  I can receive and answer calls to my cell phone on the tablet--a very cool feature that I have utilized quite a bit past week.  SMS is supposed to sync too, but I have not cracked that one yet.The wireless keyboard, charging doc, and case are must-have accessories.  All better than the equivalent Apple products.The micro-USB gives me good access to file transfer as needed.  A download of HP Play to my primary desktop made transferring music files relatively easy, though the functionality needs some work.  HD Videos transferred easily and play beautifully on the unit.You hear a lot about APPS in the tablet world.  Frankly, I dont care much about them, usually finding my handful of essential apps in the first few weeks and then wont buy any after that.  My favorite PrePlus apps all ported over in that first 10 minute sync--though none of them have yet been optimized for the tablet, so I am looking forward to that.  OpenTable, Weather Channel, Commuter Computer, FlightView, NYTimes are among my most-used but not yet optimized.  The Touchpad optimized apps for Facebook and the unfortunately named SpazHD twitter client are very well thought out and executed.Gigantic disappointments?  Kindle app got pulled and is a non-functional placeholder.  No Netflix app and the webOS browser is not recognized on the site.  There are no edit functions built into the documents program.

This device syncs with a palm pre 3 over the air.I bought this device because I am a developer and I am interested in writing apps for the device. If it was not for that I don't think i would have purchase it but only because I have plenty of other toys to play with. I don't care how many apps this or other tablets can run as I can not use it to do my daily work as a programmer.So prosWebOS - great OS the only thing its missing is apps but wow is it goodGreat experience out of box - its all there Facebook, twitter, flash, email, etcNice dockOption to have a wireless keyboardConslack of appsscreen not so good in the sunsome features will only work if you also purchase a pre 3Would I recommend this? Yes to someone that needs a device to read email, go on the internet, type (with keyboard), watch movies, play games, etc. Not for someone that needs a working machine. I also have an ipad2 and I like this better than that, well the OS.Its a hard decision on what to buy, what ever you buy you will be stuck with it for a while. If I had to choose personalty I would wait until windows 8 comes out. That way I can get something similar but have full windows running also. But if I could not wait because I had nothing to use and needed a tablet I would buy this over ios/android/blackberry.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touchpad vs the other tablets.", "Author": "P. knight \"Speed expert\"", "ReviewID": "R20NBJOFVJKBI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is great news for those who bought the discounted Touchpad and either knew nothing about it or had heard that it was an inferior product.Nothing could be further from the truth. The HP Touchpad's WebOS is vastly superior to Android and iOS.These would be but words, if there was no evidence to back it up, so here it is.The constant cons/complaints from alleged professional reviewers go as follows.It is thicker and heavier than an iPad. Although that is true, it is not so heavy or thicker as to be an inconvenience and more importantly, part of the reason it is bigger is because of the superior hardware inside, notably the audio system/speakers. The stereo sound from a Touchpad is at least twice the volume and quality of the single speaker in an iPad, not to mention the added ambiance by having stereo over mono.Good hifi speakers are bigger and heavier than cheap tin can models, so if you want better sound like the Touchpad has, then the size will not matter to you one bit.Next complaint from the \"pros\" is that WebOS does not have as many apps as Apple. Again that is true but is it truly a problem? No, it is not. There are ample already available, and now with the news of more to come, there are and will be more than any one person might ever want to use. It is a non issue.Lastly comes the big one. The \"pros\" said it was slow, that it might jam up, that it could take too long to switch from horizontal to portrait mode. Those comments are only a semi truth. The fact is that if you operate it one app at a time like an iPad, then it not only isn't slow, it is faster than an iPad, specially after you have applied all the tweaks that are freely available on the internet. As an iPad is incapable of multitasking, there are no slowdowns in general, as the internal hardware is more than capable of handling any one single task at a time, whereas the Touchpad is a completely different type of device that multitasks, and just like a home computer, will eventually slow down if there are too many apps open at the same time. The \"pros\" reviews about slowing down are so unfair when they compare it to an iPad that the question becomes, were they paid by Apple to say that or are they all that ignorant. Even a child knows that too many applications open at the same time, spells slowdowns and maybe even a crash. To spell it out by citing an example, it would be like saying that Joe Blow never has problems eating one hotdog at a time, but he slows down when he eats 8 at a time. The scenario is ridiculous and the comparison is unjust.If it is justifiable to bad mouth a computer type product that slows down from too many open windows, then it would apply to every single computer in the world, except an iPad, that can't do more than one thing at a time. Now that the three main complaints have been addressed and proven to be non-issues, it is time to talk about why a Touchpad is such a superior machine. Any knowledgeable techie knows that the WebOS interface is the best of the group of multitasking tablet operating systems. iOS has a very nice interface too and some might argue that it is as good as that of the Touchpad, but it is not included in these comparisons, as it is not a multitasking system, therefore doesn't have to deal with many open apps at the same time. How could anyone discuss the various ways that Android and WebOS deal with multiple apps being open and include the iPad in that conversation, when the iPad can't even have multiple apps open?I fully recognize the value of an iPad and I perceive it as it is, a wonderful machine, well built, with an ultra simple interface that can be easily operated by young children and even IQ challenged individuals.The more sophisticated tablets that operate like computers, have common advantages and even common problems, that simply don't apply to a machine that does only one thing at a time.In short, the iPad is a type of toy that is also capable of surfing the internet, although not completely like the Touchpad, and it can use chat services like MSN Messenger and Skype, although it does not fully integrate Skype like the Touchpad does.Apple products have become a status symbol to own and they are generally high quality products, and the ipad fits perfectly into that category. Where it does not belong is in comparisons to computer like tablets, as the iPad is a type of toy and not a utilitarian device like the Touchpad.I own both an iPad and a Touchpad and can tell you that my Touchpad is a bit faster than my iPad, and 10 times more useful..............................................................Added observations, Sept. 20, 2011.As per the review above, it isn't hard to guess that my Touchpad is much preferred over my iPad. (that my girlfriend has now appropriated and wouldn't let go of without a fight to the death.)Inspired by some long waits to open webpages (on the Touchpad), I thought it was time to do an internet browsing speed comparison between it and the iPad.We have Caribbean internet speed that is somewhat lacking when compared to even the slowest US plan, and a fast browser is critical for us, so as to not spend our lives waiting on webpages.To cut to the chase, this is what I discovered.When trying to compare the two, I was stunned to discover that the two units rarely landed on identical pages.The iPad would have a modified www address that might include the word \"ipad\" or \"tablet\" and it presented pages that have clearly been \"tuned\" for 25 million iPad users.If I went to Yahoo news, for instance, the iPad would give me different headlines than the Touchpad or a Windows PC.It's not as if I didn't already know that an Ipad couldn't open many webpages or youtube videos and that it simply won't let the user go to those pages that it can't deal with, but I never thought/knew that Apple was also controlling some of the www content.My initial reaction was to feel like I was in China, cut off from the rest of the world wide web.On the other hand, everyone is trying to control the internet, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc, so why shouldn't Apple be allowed to play in the same sandbox.....So......You would like the results of the test, as would I.I simply could not make any true clinical observations, when the two machines rarely even opened identical pages.My non clinical observation was that they are similar in speed and neither could be declared the victor, except in terms of the Touchpad being able to connect with the normal web as we know it, as opposed to Apple's modified version.So instead of coming out of this with a webpage speed comparison between the two units, all it showed was what I already knew, that an iPad is a toy that has a lot of internet connectivity and many good computer uses, whereas the Touchpad is a computer that has some toyishness about it.It can play games like the iPad but has a seriously limited library when compared to the iPad's.On the other hand, it functions much more like a real computer as we know it, with it's capacity to have several functions/processes running at the same time.When someone sends me a video link, it usually refuses to stream all the way through, because of our slow bandwidth, so it's normal for me to pause and minimize the page and do something else, whilst the video clip downloads.That's impossible to do on the iPad.You can pause it and let it download, but you CANNOT do something else in the meantime, other than twiddle your thumbs and wait.If you want to buy a fantastic gift for the kids, it would be hard to beat an iPad.If you would like a touch tablet to do the same things you normally do on a computer, then the Touchpad is the machine for you.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Most underrated tablet", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R38HQTHCWIFYMW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Build quality (4/5): The shell is made of plastic. It does feel very cheap, but I don't notice any creaking like my Nook Color. It's still solid in my book.WebOS (5/5): Out of the box, it's slow. After tweaking and OCing, it's very fast. Love the card view. Multitasking is easy. I'm able to navigate around faster than my android nook color. The WebOS browser is just as good as ios. Very smooth and even supports Flash.AppStore (3/5): Not alot of apps. Navigating the app store is slow at times especially during heavy traffic. My favorite apps are Audiophile HD, Angry Birds, Angry Birds Rio, and Kalemsoft media playerSound (5/5): Probably the best sounding tablet yet. That's because of Beats Audio technology. I don't notice any hissing. I'm no audiophile, but music has nice clarity. It doesn't have booming bass. I used Sennheiser HD 555s for testing. Default music app does not have treble/bass settings unfortunately. You would need to use a third-party app.Battery life (4/5): About 6 hours under heavy use. I have my touchpad overclocked to 1.7GHz also.File Type support (4/5):  Video support is lacking. Supports mpeg-4, h.264, and h.263 out of the box. If you install third-party apps like TouchPlayer and Kalemsoft media player, you can play alot more file types like avi and mkv. Music support is great. Supports the common mp3, wav formats. I have a lot of Apple lossless files in my library. The Touchpad plays them and plays them well. FLAC is also supported if you install Audiophile HD.Portability (3/5): It's a bit heavy and slippery. I'm actually afraid to bring it outside. I feel I would easily drop it.  I recommend getting a decent case if you must take it around in public.BOX.net (5/5): Amazing. Touchpad owners get 50GB for free. I have my PDFs and video files uploaded. Very fast uploading. Saves internal storage space.For a $129 32GB Touchpad(Thanks Amazon!), it's a steal even without a decent app store.

I like it", "Author": "Eroc \"Eroc\"", "ReviewID": "R3CZODCGCISS8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First my background.  I am an IT consultant responsible for deploying servers, workstations, and mobile devices.  I have/had personally owned a tablet device that has 1 of the 3 major Mobile OSs.  I had a ASUS Transformer for 30 days and liked it, I add the dock and like it...but didnt love it.  I have a number of iOS device Touch, Pad, Phone.  And now the Webos powered TouchPad (TP).  I like them all in different ways but the touchpad seems to be what I use most.  maybe because it is the newest...but there is something about it that I like.  It seems as if Apple and Google had a child this would be it.  It has many of their strengths but not many of there weaknesses...it has its own weaknesses but much because it is new.  So lets start and look at these devices to see what makes them different and which one stands on in its respective category.  This is also a post that is going on my blog for it has taken me a long time to test and review these product before I could write this.First...keyboard...a way to interface with a device is critical.  Touchscreens have all became pretty similar in regards to pinch to zoom, scrolling, selecting, etc.  But the keyboard is something that has been why I think so many are scared to get into tablets.  Sure they lack that tactile feel but some do a better job then others.  So with that said the onscreen keyboard on the touchpad is my favoirte of all 3.  For many reason, first is onscreen keyboard more so the users make far more mistakes.  So have a spell checker is a must...android/honeycomb...they skipped out on this...big mistake.  Not to mention visually the keyboard is unappealing.  It makes tons of mistakes and seem the least forgiving.  Apple...very good the original, inline spell checker, responsive, polished but after using the TP it is in second place.  The Touchpad keyboard has the number keys above...something the iOS does not.  The TP keyboard is comfortable the sounds it make are not intrusive and just plan works...the 3D key look is nice not to mention the transitional.  So in the interface department the TP seems to be well thought out and engineered.Multi-tasking on the webOS tablet...touchpad...is light years ahead, iOS is plain horrible and is not a true multitasking system it uses a handful of \"services\" mostly notification to make it feel as if it isnt multi-tasking.  Double pumping the middle button make the multi-tasking menu of running apps appear.  To close them is terrible and not well thought out.  Apple needs to go back to the drawing board!!!  Android/Honeycomb is good and much better than iOS but it is still unorganized and completely unpolished!  Android gets sooo choppy when memory usage approaches its limits.  Honeycomb is much better then froyo but still not that great in comparison to the webos TP.  The card system is just better...its intuitive, simple, functional, smarter just plain easier to switch between and flat out know what is running!  It is as I have already said light years ahead!Account integration is far better on the TP.  The others seem to require more apps to get more accounts up on the device.  Out of the box the TP has tons of account integration.  I dont need \"An app for that\" I use one app for email and grab 6 of my accounts...android/honeycomb...ah no.  I check, Hotmail, two Gmail accounts, and a Yahoo account on it.  I use one email app on the TP...its native.  And set it up on in a combined inbox.  iPad...yes it work very similar like the TP but the function is a little nicer in my opinion on the TP.  Android is just a mess..I need the gmail app for my gmail, the yahoo app for my yahoo (Froyo...honeycomb now does a little better job on this) and the built in email app for hotmail.  Sloppy!  But the email app on honey is quite nice looking and replying back I like a little better on it...but once again the lack of spell checking is just stupid on behalf of google!  But before I stray off.  Account integration also steams throughout the entire webos...they call it synergy.  What ever they call it I like it!  When I setup my 2 gmail account it automatically added them to my Message app on the TP.  Not to mention I added a skype account to the messaging app as well.  Oh and did I mention calendar...it does those as well.  It also integrate throughout webos, Facebook, LinkedIn, Photobucket, Box.net, Dropbox, yahoo, aol, the list goes on and on!  Android and apple dont even come close!  But that still isnt to say the TP is missing.  Dropbox is limited and not every aspect of these account is fully put into the TP...but it is still more then the others!IMing...TP kills all!!  I need multiply 3rd party apps on iOS and Android.  And 3rd party free apps have ads!!  Oh and most 3rd party free apps I hate to say it lack polish!  My one messaging app on TP does, skype, yahoo, google, and AIM!!!  And it does them well!!  The interface works isnt garbage up and runs as it should.  eBuddy...not even close!  I have tried every IMing app for both iOS and Android and they just arent close!Web-browsing.  TP once again kills it.  My transformer even after the update force closes!!  I do like the tabs in Android...really nice but they get choppy and hard to navigate if you have too many open...becomes a pig!  And Apple...dont get me started...slow and plugin missing black screens...Apple really dropped the ball here.  But then again you can ususally get an app for many of the sites that dont work...but at what cost and for the love of god how many apps do I really want and need!!!  it gets a little stupid after a while.  The apps are nice for they are engineered and optimized for a tablet experience.  Some more of many lack.  But they help bring the web experience missing back to the iPad...but it doesnt bring everything back!  Many of the major sites are re-written to work with the iPad.  My company and many other cant afford to re-write our sites to HTML 5 to support the iPad...it is expensive and apple should have done a better job.  Sure there is Skyfire but it is nowhere near that good!  The Touchpad is as close to a desktop browser as a tablet can come!  Flash isnt everything but it still makes up over 50% of the website on the internet!!  My company site included!  Bookmarks are nice on the TP but I do wish it had tabs.  Everytime you want a new site to open you need a new tab, unless you are just working from the original...not really a problem but I tend to have several tabs open on my desktop, usually 15-25 at a time.  The tablet I dont typically do this.Notification system.  In this order TP, Android, Apple.  Apple is just plan terrible...intrusive, annoying and just old...iOS5 is changing this...but that is yet to be released.  As of now TP notification system is organized, intuitive, elegent, visual and most important doesnt get in the way.  It works at the lock screen as well!  Android is decent but still sloppy when compared to webos.  I like how clean the TP system works.  My iProducts drive me nuts with the current notification system...email...pops up right over what you are doing...click \"view\" or click \"close\"...view takes you away from what you are doing.  \"Close\" gone into thin air!  it plain sucks!  Android as I said is better then apple but cluttered again and disorganized!  I still would take it over apple but it needs some work.Apps...TP is dead last...much because it is 6 weeks old compared to the others.  But more of a concern is since HP is giving the device side a dirt nap what happens to the software side.  webos was never given enough time to interest developers now this is even worse considering the current state of webos.  A big black eye.  However since the web browsing isnt so crippled I can do a ton without the need for many apps...just like I do on my Mac or My Win7 box...I dont need a ton of apps on it.  90% of what I do is via a browser!  Apple is an absolute app dream...there are over 3000 weather apps...many garbage but definitely a few more then impressive ones!  There apps are typically more polished feature rich and tablet or phone optimized.  I love pulse!!  There are sooo many but sometimes navigating and remember which ones I have is a pain!  Honeycomb...well not much better then the TP.  Although I do have pulse, new360, teamviewer.  Apple is light years ahead...the quality is excellent and these apps do more and increase the capability of the iProducts so beyond that any have imagined!  But then again I give the iPad a 4 1/2 overall as well...the app part is a 5 all day long!!!  But remember this...apple apps usually cost money...newspaper, magazines...etc.  Some stuff you can usually get online free.  But as I said it is stll more then that.Hardware...HP is dead last.  But not horrible.  Rear camera is missing...never used mine and my transfomer, not sure if because it sucks or I just dont carry my tablet around to take pictures.  I do use the front for skype and googletalk.  No expansion...once again I never found a need for it, not on apple of tp.  But the android tabs have it.  The android tablets I believe run away with this because there are so many different version of it.  For example the ASUS has a dock...that also has a battery in it.  Keyboard is nice and it even has a mouse.  So it feel like e netbook.  The docks keyboard is stellar!  Not to mention optimized for honeycomb with hotkeys.  Battery life was excellent on the Ipad and the Asus.  As for TP, good but not as good.  The more cycles the better it got.  It is about an hour to 90 mins less then the other.  The asus with the dock is ridiculous...tons of time.  Processor on the TP is slower and feels a little slower but not horrible and doesnt seem to feel like it is getting slower like the asus did when too many apps where loaded.  The Apple screen is amazing but then again so is the asus...in fact the asus screen I like more!  TP last in screen, it isnt as bright but cant say I have ran into anytimes that I thought it wasnt bright enough.  Speakers..the TP kicks the crap out of both...no match!  It does lack expansion ports but so does apple and they seem to be fine without it.  I am yet to use the ports on the asus.  But I do like the touchstone dock...quick easy and works great!  And I also like the fact that the charging cable is not exclusive to the device...couch couch apple and asus.  I can use any microUSB cable to charge or plug in the TP.  I have used my samsung charger to charge my TP...yes it works fine!  I do not like the glossy finger print magnet shell on the TP.  But I put the HP rubberized case with easel on it and never looked back.  Yes it is heavy and thicker but it is nominal at best.  These tablets are so light and I am not 90 years old.  This not even worth a talking point.Now a few areas of pluses and minus for the touchpad in comparison.  For starters the backup function is awesome!!!  Right to the cloud for your apps, settings, contact, cal, etc.  No movies, music, or phones...which would have been cool but replacement or coming off a reset is very quick to restore.  Android...pass...it is start over city, yeah there are a few apps to back it up the the SD card but it is technical and I have seen android eat SD Card...especially rooted devices!  Apple...with itunes (Which is a love hate handcuffing situation) is nice from a restore standpoint.  Easy to restore to a new device or restore from a reset device.  And it resets everything!  But you need to do it all via itunes.  This is changing.  The copy, paste, highlight absolutely sucks on the TP!!!!  I hate it...the others are killing it here.  I wish it had widgets..I am not missing them that much on the TP but some I did like on android.  Apple...none.  The calendar is sluggish on the TP and I really like the android and apple ones better.  I only use one calendar so I dont see the benefits as well as other might with the TP.  For the TP handles multi-cals pretty good.  No push for Hotmail kinda sucks but I can wait 5 minutes.  Just type is pretty nice.  It scours the entire device and can also scour sites if you like.  I cannot do this on the others.  It is a nice way to weed thru the crap faster.All in all for a now defunct product that can be had for 99 or 149 this is a fantastic tablet.  I ripped some movies via handbrake, copied my music, check my email, surf, and IM this is a stellar device.  If you need certain apps this is not for you.  I dont miss them and I find myself using this more then the other, could be because it is new but I like the web on it better.  I like email on it better.  I actually like music and movies on it better as well.  Oh and the facebook app is soo much nicer then the others,  No ads and it is polished!  For the core functions it has in common with the others.  It is a better device in many ways.  The interface doesnt feel fisher price like my ipad does and iphone.  It is clean, organized, intuitive and smooth.  Too bad it is leaving the party early for I think it had a future.

I'm through lugging my laptop around on and off of planes and hoping my case fits under the seat in front of me.  Forget trying to get your laptop out of its case when your mid-flight and crammed, if you hope to be productive.  For the day or two day trips that typically result in presentation or meetings throughout the day and only allow for getting caught up with emails, hitting a local restaurant and going to bed to catch the early flight out, a tablet made total sense for me.Upon investigating tablets, the HP touchpad offered features standard that I couldn't find on the other products on the market.I can see the full web with flash and html5.I can organize my email accounts into one inbox.I can add multiple attachments easily to an email.The calendar is similar to the email inbox in that I can have all of my accounts linked to show all my events on one calendar with the option to see the individual accounts with the touch of a icon.Unified messaging allows me to see my Skype, Aim, and text messages all in one messaging application.Skype video calling is a breeze.I was able to get 50 GB of free storage with Box.net applicationI received the free Angry Birds HD game.I can view MS Documents and Adobe PDF documents.  I've also read that MS Office documents will be able to be edited with a free update coming to the Touchpad's QuickOffice in the coming weeks.I can currently use Google docs to create and edit MS Office documents.I can present images on the brilliant screen to my customers.If I have free time to spare I can watch YouTube, hulu, and Vudu.I received an update to the operating system without having to plug it in with a USB to my computer.It has some really cool docking options and a Bluetooth keyboard for operating the device while docked.I really love the Just Type feature that allows me to search my device or the web for ANYTHING(files,apps,contacts,messages,web search terms,etc.)I've  had the HP touchpad 32gb for roughly a week. I think its a great value for the traveling business person. The performance is great and the operating system is the most intuitive I've seen or used (I have an iphone and an HTC Incredible).  Evidently the Pre 3 can actually sync via Bluetooth to allow for phone calls as well as phone messages being streamed directly to the touchpad notifications.I gave this a 4 star because I think the other platforms (iOS and Android) have many more apps which may be appealing to more casual users.  As a productive user email, web, images and document viewing/editing are my major focus.  Also detracting from the experience is the lack of built in Task management that was previously available in earlier palm/HP WebOS phones.  If these two items are remedied, I would easily rate this a 5 star device.The hardware feels solid and the screen is great. So far the battery life as been amazing.  I've been casually using the device on a complete charge for approximately 4 days straight.  On a complete charge with heavy use I've been getting about 8-11 hours of use.  I wish the hardware had a rubberized back for better grip and less finger prints.I would definitely recommend the HP touchpad for people looking for a great value and high quality hardware.I've written this review on my touchpad and the spell check has done a great job correcting my errors.I hope this helps those interested.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tablet Comparisons", "Author": "rocktown80", "ReviewID": "R1C0JT2JQ239UG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's simple, actually.If you have $500-600 to spend and you need a mobile entertainment system, the Samsung, Moto, Acer, or Asus tablets with wide-screen HD and HDMI are for you.

No comparison.If you have only $250-300 to spend and you need mobile productivity, then the HP Touchpad is for you, no comparison. Actually, at $500-600, this statement would still be true, making it a super-bargain if mobile productivity is your objective.1) Multi-tasking: without this, your tablet is just a toy. WebOS on the Touchpad is the only operating system for adults on the go. The others are for kids or people with lots of time on their hands.2) Skype, email, twitter, MS-Office doc editing, file management, etc. These are the mobile tools you need, and nobody does them better than the Touchpad. Don't see anything to compare with Synergy. The iPad has no ability to sync files at all - that's ridiculously unproductive.3) Web: WebOS gives you the accurate and complete web, not the pseudo web of iOS and Android. For me in particular, I have Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal sites, so when I'm on the road, I need to go into control panels to modify site content. On the Touchpad, what I'm seeing is the real deal. On the iPad and Android, it's usually some specially-modified version of a site. Not good. Not good at all.4) Power: with over-clocking to 1.7Ghz, it's 30-40% faster than the tablets costing double. Takes an easy 15 minutes to do, and this together with multi-tasking and the addition of dual-boot Android means I'm close to a laptop replacement.5) Entertainment: All I want is to play music, or sometimes a Youtube video or TV show, while I'm doing my work. Touchpad is the only tablet that can do this, and the music reproduction is superior to the iPad or the Androids. Who actually sits around and watches an HD movie on their tablet without any interruption for email, texting, or whatever? Seriously? That's what my HD/Blu-ray screen in the living room is for.6) Downsides: in the productivity sphere, mostly it's about the PDF file viewing and editing, which is the TP's Achilles heel. So I do these on my home machine and will wait a bit for improvements, which are said to be coming. I can live with this for a bit.With the iPad, I could only do 10-20% of what I needed to do on my home computer. On the Androids, I could only do 30% of what I could at home.

I had wanted it for a long time and had missed the $149 sale.  In a quick decision, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  I did some more research, including reading all the negative reviews posted here.  I am pretty tech savvy and have experience with many tablet computers.  I own an iPad at home.  I have also tested tablets at my job including the samsung galaxy, the cl900, and the HP slate.  I was going to wait a month to write my review, but after playing with it all morning, I just could not wait.  I was quite annoyed by the lack of brain cells that some of the other reviewers have.  We have both the ipad and the touchpad and we love them both.  Let me say that I have not even optimized my touchpad yet.  This review is right of the box without even updating the thing.It was stated that the touchpad takes a long time to boot and that there is no progress indicator.  The truth I that it does not take all that long to boot at all, might even be less than my iPad.  Most tablets that I have tested do not have an indicator bar.It was stated that the touchpad freezes a lot.  I have had mine all morning... Been playing with it off and on for 9 hours.  No freezing at all and battery life is great.  Maybe this person got a bad apple out of the bunch.it was stated that there is a lack of apps.  Well, that is to be expected.  Their are not a lot of apps out for any new OS.  If you are a person who is looking for a wealth of apps, then you should know better than to buy this.  Just wait until there are more available.It was stated that tech support for HP is terrible.  Well, I don't think there are many companies who actually do have good support.It was stated that you can see too many fingerprints.  Well, you can only see the fingerprints if you turn it just the right way.  Don't most people buy covers, screen protectors, and cases?  Why is this even an issue?It was stated from different reviewers that the browser is slow and basically terrible, that screen lacks brightness, that the machine is sluggish, and that the buttons are difficult, and that it was difficult to figure out.All of these simply untrue.  I actually like this browser much better than the iPad's.  The screen, in reality is crisp and clear.  By the way, the touch screen responsiveness is among the best.  This is coming from someone who literally has over 15 touchscreen devices in their home right now).  The machine is quick and was very easy to figure out.  I did not even read the directions.  You can check out the review of the touchpad from techno buffalo.  They are professional reviewers and talk about the browser.One of the people that gave this one star did not even buy a touchpad.  He just hates HP.  The review section is for people who actually bought and have used the product, not for people who have a personal vendetta.There where quite a few reviews that admitted to it being a great tablet, but only gave it one star because HP discontinued it or because one small thing did not work.  No tablet is perfect, not even the iPad.If you still have doubt in your mind that this is a good product, look at the positive reviews compared to the negative.  There are much more positive, and many of the negative reviews contradict one another. Use your head and think before you buy.  If you are looking for a wide variety of apps, then this is not for you at this time.  But if you are looking for something to browse the web, play videos and music, check email, chat, play a few a games, and even get some work done, then is is an excellent choice. :-  Good luck and happy tablet hunting.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Tablet is Worth More Than $100", "Author": "Lan P. \"Ol man\"", "ReviewID": "R3O0H03ZH1PU6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The fact is that this device has been discontinued by HP due to slow sales and the slow sales is also due to factors such as bad timing.

I had an iPad 2 and returned it because the WiFi reception wasn't good enough where I mainly use them. I don't have that problem with my TouchPad; It receives the signal well. I think the physical design is handsome and done well. Yes, it is heavier and thicker than the iPad 2 but I don't mind as I prefer this OS to the iPad's OS. My battery life has been great. I enjoy Kindle, Pandora, TuneIn, email, Skype calls and chat, voice recordings, maps, music, and the 50GB of Box.net for free. I always wanted a digital photo frame but never got one, yet with Exhibition on this, well my TouchPad does that too. I bought Scarface on the HP MovieStore and watched it. I watched a movie for free on Crackle.com today too that worked great. I watched a movie on Amazon on-demand on my TouchPad too. I like the OS's looks and the way it operates. I personally find iOS to be too candy-like and somewhat childish looking; I truly don't like looking at it for too long. webOS feels and looks mature and it's pretty much intuitive how to use it. I bought an RSS reader that works fine for it. I never played Angry Birds previously but got addicted finally until I finished it too. Looks and plays great on my TouchPad. That was several hours of fun. The wireless charging of the dock is just cool as can be. Also, I had it streaming music wirelessly through Bluetooth to my Creative speakers. And keep in mind my computer for the past 10+ years has been a Mac. I like Apple products a lot, but webOS and the design of the TouchPad and accessories appeal to me so much more. Android holds almost no appeal to me; I just can't stand the looks of it for extended periods of time. Now, to be fair, there are some slow pauses here and there whilst browsing and occasionally with a tap in an app, especially compared to the iPad, but hopefully those will only get mitigated with updates. I have tweaked it some by installing Preware,some patches, and processor \"overclocking.\" As of now the Quickoffice is read-only which I hope changes soon too. But overall I love my TouchPad. It's a wonderful communication and entertainment machine. Thanks HP and the webOS people. Oh, yeah, and notifications are excellent too. Something of interest comes in, it doesn't get in your way, and you can access it from right on top with a tap. It's really done well. The whole OS radiates thoughtfulness and professional design.

It is a great device. One of a kind.  But it is new, and growing into its own.  The difference is it has a user community to help it.--The device is a little heavier than an iPad 2, and thicker too.  It reminds me of the first iPad, just a little shorter and the corners are rounded more.  It has a front facing 1.3mp camera, but no rear facing camera.  I don't think this will be too much of a problem for the Palm fans.  The Pre 3 will share its photos by placing the phone on your tablet.The power button is at the top right, and around the corner is the volume rocker.  The top left has the headphone jack, and the bottom center has the power plug, which would be obsolete if you plan to use the touchstone.  The left side of the tablet has two speakers, which have great sound.  Many people have commented that the HP cover has been creating small cracks around the speaker areas due to the thin plastic and the grip of the cover when you fold the cover over and stand the Touchpad up.  Some not all have said this.  It may be prudent to wait for the 3rd party protector and covers.The back of the Touchpad is black glossy plastic.  A brushed aluminum or a matted finish would probably have been better. It is a fingerprint magnet.  It has a little bit of slip to it, but if you are conscious of this and holding it well it shouldn't fall out of your hands.  Then again there are protectors, covers, and folios.The front screen is a similar touch glass as the iPad. It is shiny and a great place to put fingerprints for later viewing.  A stylus is definitely something to look into to avoid this.With a dual-core 1.2Ghz Qualcomm processor, which seems to be underclocked for battery life, and a Gig of RAM.  It is on par with the performance of the iPad 2 regarding performance, but the OS is new and still in the works, and the user interface is not completely accelerated, yet.  I did not realize, until I had it for a couple of days, that it has an ambient light sensor.  The accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, and bluetooth are all there too.Now on battery life.  I bought my Touchpad the morning of July 1st when Best Buy opened for business.  I have been heavily using the Touchpad for everything, and it lasts through the day.  When I plug it in at the end of the day it still has a little charge left in it.  The only time I have seen a big drain is when I played RoboTek for hours on end.-------Now, starting the device up and configuring take a little while, and you should not judge the performance of the Touchpad by the way it performs during your setup and its syncing period. Call it the first hour or so.Most reviewers have done this, and it is not fair to the product.  There is a lot of background activity once you sign in to all your accounts.Also, the startup time is a bit much, and once there are more patches and UI software on it, I am sure it will take longer to load up from a complete off status.  However, I have not turned it off since I have had it.  The TP is used at least once every 2 hours (except when I sleep) so it doesn't need to be shut off.  If you are stowing it for a trip, flight etc. - turning it on is one of the first things I do before I settle in.  It takes 10 secounds of pressing to turn on, and at the moment takes 30 seconds to load at the longest.------After you get all of your accounts setup (including that 50GB Box Account that is FREE until July 31st), this thing flies.Having all of our photos from Snapfish, Facebook, etc all in one place is great.  My wife and I spent a long time going through old pictures and being nostalgic.The Card system is great. Who wouldn't want to have things that are common grouped together when they are multitasking.  Which is the main component that puts the Touchpad ahead of its competition.--------So why did I buy it, and why didn't I return it within 14 days?I do not want to be told what I can and can not do on my device.  If there is something I do not like about the interface or the way something opens I would like the option to change it.  If you visit PreCentral.com you will see a Homebrew community that offers patches, apps, etc. to make your device work, look, and do what you want it to.  If you let the users in, they will make it better for users.I want to multitask. Be it within one app, or with several open at one time.I don't like pressing buttons to go back to home, or close an app, etc.  The gesture function has always won me over on the Pre.  It just feels more natural to swipe up, left or right.Adjust the size of the Keyboard. It also does not change the keys between apps, only between orientation.The audio is great.  I have tested many many tablets and devices.  None have sounded this good.Touchstone.  Do you hate plugging in your device to charge it.  I do.  But I love placing it on my touchstone to charge.  And it is great that it will remember which touchstone it is on and give you a different display with each one if you want.Ability to print documents, pics, etc to my printer from my tablet.---------Apps (The Hot Topic):This is a topic that makes people happy or frustrated, and creates a lot of controversy with everyone.The big Differentiator is the App Catalogue magazine Pivot.  This has articles and app related intrigue and advice.The big Apps:Kindle App (just in),Quickoffice (which allows you to view documents.  I use Google Docs to create and edit documents then Download them to my TP), but we have been told that offline editing and creation are on the horizon.Facebook (the best version out there),Spaz (for Twitter),Pandora (opens in an emulator for Pre),HP MovieStore,Moodagent for playing music via your mood.Phone and Video Calls (via your phone or Skype).Calendar:  It syncs with all your accounts; Google, Palm, Facebook, etc.  If you want an event private and you share your calendar on Google, set the event to Palm profile.Web: An actual web surfing experience, just like on your home computer.Email: This also syncs all your accounts, and the sliding tabs and preview pane is something I will never come back from.  It is painful to go on my phone or my computer now to view email.Pictures:  Everything in one place, and once synced, available offline.There is not a Streaming Netflix, yet, but if you are an Amazon prime member you can stream from Amazon.  There is also the MovieStore now where you can rent or buy movies.  VideoFlood HD also streams or lets you download news segments and some shows, or you can be directed to a network website to watch a show online.  There is also YouTube.GLIMPSE....the future of multitasking.  This app lets you have apps running within an app.  So I can look at my task list, rss feeds, while twittering or typing notes, etc.  There are more widgets on the way as well.Khan Academy, for those that want to learn via videos.Mosaic, all your news in one place.Box.net, Evernote, Tapnote for access to your online storage.Etc., etc., etc.In a nutshell, the Touchpad launched with more apps than Android devices.  The touchpad has flash.  All those games and a fair amount of the apps on the iPad are there because there is no access to flash.  There are five websites I visit to play free online games.  There are some favorite games I have on my Touchpad (TP).Is HP serious about expanding their app catalogue?  Yes!!They are having a Developer Challenge with $35,000, Touchpads, and other prizes.If you are seriously considering this Tablet, I would look further at updated news.  The Precentral website will give you everything that you need to know.  It is a great product, and I would not trade it for anything else.

It's not perfect. There's no video out, and no web proxy capability, which I think greatly reduces its usefulness in the business world.On the other hand, I think the design is clean and elegant. Yes, it's a tad thickER and heaviER than an iPad2, but I would NOT call it thick/heavy as have some reviews. I have both an iPad2 and now a TouchPad, and they compare very favorably. On the plus side, the TouchPad has FAR better virtual keyboard (I'm using it right now), with adjustible height and a number row atop the main keyboard (MUCH more convenient than the iPad's).Touchstone charging is super convenient. You never have to plug in...just set it on the touchstone and it charges! And exhibition mode allows you to see notifications and things like time/weather/images etc. while it's charging -- so I dare say its actually a rather elegant display piece!Lastly, webOS is light years ahead of iOS. It is TRULY multitasking (not the just play-music-in-the-background kind of multitasking of iOS). You can close programs just by flicking them off the screen (unlike iOS's truly convoluted method). And it has Flash -- so the web browser is not crippled like iOS's. They do need more apps (Netflix -- PLEASE!), but all the major bases are covered. There are some truly elegant ones like Glimpse (which shows off the multitasking capabilities with up to 5 window panes on-screen with individual 'mini-apps' -- take notes while web surfing) and the News Republic news reader. It has a Kindle Reader app and one of the best Facebook apps out there. And of course it's got Angry Birds.It's a shame HP punted on this so quickly, but I'm glad to hear that webOS will survive. Maybe someone else can pick up where HP left off and focus on improved hardware.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Alternative to iPad and Honeycomb", "Author": "Analytic", "ReviewID": "R3J88TEI9BGUHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I missed out on the $99 fire sale, but after studying a lot of reviews, both in print and on YouTube, I came to the conclusion that even at $200+, the HP Touchpad was well worth getting. I've had mine for two weeks now, and I like it a lot. My wife has a Motorola Xoom (Wi-Fi), and I also have a Coby Kyros, so I have some means of comparison. The Touchpad is a very high-quality tablet. It would have been a worthy competitor for the iPad and the Honeycomb-based tablets if HP hadn't given up without a fight. Here is what I like about it:~EXCELLENT BUILD QUALITY The Touchpad feels very solid and well-made. It's very comfortable to hold. Yes, it's heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, but the greater thickness of the Touchpad (and the Xoom, for that matter) make them more comfortable to hold than the Galaxy Tab (I checked one out in the store). The outer shell is a glossy piano-black. It really looks beautiful--until you cover it with fingerprints. I solved that problem by buying the official HP case. More on that later. The screen is truly outstanding. I compared the same photo I had downloaded to both the Touchpad and the Xoom. Though I have long been a fan of Motorola, I have to admit that colors on the Touchpad looked richer and more vivid. I fiddled and fiddled with the brightness settings to make sure it was a fair comparison, but no matter what the settings, the Touchpad looked better. I also am quite pleased with the touch sensitivity of the screen. It seems just right, not too sensitive (which can be frustrating), and very precise, too. I typed this review on my Touchpad using two fingers, and it was actually less frustrating than touch typing on a real keyboard (though not as fast). Accurately positioning the cursor with my fingertip is easy.~WEBOS webOS is the Touchpad's greatest strength and the best reason to buy one. I don't have enough experience with either webOS or Honeycomb on the Xoom to do a fair comparison, but webOS seems easier to understand and use to me. The user interface is friendlier and more intuitive, yet still very powerful. I have been able to figure out how to do most things on my own, whereas on my wife's Xoom I have had to refer to the User Guide occasionally. Whether webOS or Honeycomb is the better operating system, I can't say, but, at the very least, webOS is certainly a worthy alternative. There is a lot of talk on the Web about putting Android on the Touchpad; I don't see any reason to do that.~HIGH-QUALITY APPS There were only around 300 apps optimized for the Touchpad at launch, but there are reportedly over 1000 now. The ones I have installed have all (except for one) been very impressive. Some are definitely better than the Android equivalents. I will take quality over quantity any day.~TOUCHSTONE DOCK The combination of the Touchstone Charging Dock and Exhibition Mode on the Touchpad is really neat. While charging, the Touchpad is transformed into a beautiful clock, or a slide show of your favorite photos, or continually changing quotes by famous people, or a number of other things. Your choice. (Exhibition Mode can be used without the dock, especially if you have the case which allows the Touchpad to sit at an angle.) As much as I like my Touchpad, it does have many of the same shortcomings as the iPad:-No SDcard slot. With the trend toward keeping one's data in \"the cloud,\" this may not be a problem for some people. HP provides buyers of the Touchpad with 50GB of free storage for life (we'll see, huh!) at box.net (but you have to sign up for it). That's nice, but personally I would also like to be able to store my music, photos, etc. locally. The problem with \"the cloud\" is that if you don't have an Internet connection, out in the boonies, say, you won't be able to access your data. Also, the November 2011 issue of The Atlantic has a must-read article about how it's possible to lose one's data stored \"in the cloud\" to hackers. HP shouldn't have blindly followed Apple's lead in this area. Tablets should have SDcard slots. Thanks to its SDcard slot, my inexpensive Kyros has more storage capacity than the $500 iPad (and, sadly, also my Touchpad).-No HDMI output. Even my little Coby Kyros has an HDMI port. If you download a movie, it would be nice to have the option of watching it on the big screen. Again, HP shouldn't have followed Apple's example.-No true GPS. Though the quasi-GPS (using Wi-Fi connections) is remarkably accurate.-No rear camera. Lack of a rear camera is not really a shortcoming, but other tablets have one, so....-It takes a long time to charge. There is a reason why Motorola chose to go with a proprietary power jack on the Xoom -- it can handle higher current than a USB port and thus recharges in about 2 hours, compared with over 4 hours for the Touchpad. So get the Touchstone dock so you'll have something to look at for all that time. One good thing is that the USB/charging port is on the right side in landscape mode, which is probably what you'll use for typing and watching videos, so you could just plug in the included charger and continue using the Touchpad. Two more issues I'd like to touch upon. When my wife got her Xoom, I thought the wide-screen format was superior to the iPad's 4:3 format. Now that I've got this Touchpad, which has the same 4:3 format (did HP kidnap some Apple engineers?!), I'm not so sure. The wide screen is better for movies, but you're going to do a lot more with a tablet than watch movies. I think the 4:3 format is probably better for Web browsing and everything else. I have to agree with Apple on this. Also, I think way too much is made of the light weight and thin profile of the iPad and the Galaxy Tab. The reason is that, no matter what tablet you buy, you're going to have to get a case for it, and the case changes the weight and thickness of the device. I wouldn't take a tablet out of the house without a good case. Would you throw a piece of glass into a backpack or purse? That's what a tablet computer is, a piece of glass. The Motorola case for the Xoom is perfect, in my opinion. It protects the Xoom very well without adding weight or thickness. The HP case for the Touchpad fits the back and sides like a second skin and has a pleasant, velvety feel. But the flap that covers the screen is not padded and, worse, does NOT snap closed, so that, in a backpack, it could flap open, exposing the screen to scratching. Other than this, the HP case is great for normal use. I would definitely get one; $20.SO that's my take on this beautiful, but flawed and apparently defunct, tablet. The Touchpad and webOS could have offered a genuine alternative to the iPad and Honeycomb. I wish HP would reconsider. It's not too late. Updates to webOS have corrected minor complaints (it's faster and now there's a camera app included, among others), and there are now plenty of great apps, so I think it could be competitive.

I did not want to be limited by flash player and iTunes. I own an iPhone and although I like it, I did not want to purchase the iPad, which I consider to be a large iPhone with longer battery and bigger screen.For the record, I am not a business professional, but an active student and traveler. I am someone who likes technology but I am not \"clocking\" computer speeds or features. Ultimately, I was looking for an all inclusive alternative (not replacement) to having to carry my video iPod, my kindle, and my laptop. After doing some research and testing the touch pad at the store, I made my decision. Despite a few negative professional reviews, I felt confident enough to purchase the touch pad. Of course, knowing I have 14 days to bring it back if I didn't like it was also a factor.Nonetheless, I am very happy with my purchase. So far it handles well, does everything \"I\" need it to do and want it to do. Although I am still learning something new every day, it has not taken very long time to figure it out. This is my first tablet so I cannot compare it to others, but on its own it has done everything I want it to do. Speed is tolerable, multi-tasking is amazing, emails are easy to view and kindle app is great. I have watched one movie and it was great. Pandora music is really cool and I have purchased the \"tethering\" from my iPhone carrier and now my iPhone is a wireless router. This allows me to have internet on my touchpad on the go. If you are someone like me who is looking for a simpler device to do a few things and not be limited to the internet, then I suggest the touchpad. Realize the complaints you do hear about are there, ie. Fingerprints, a little bulky, not the fastest but it has been adequate. I should also mention I am not a huge application user so I cannot comment on those, I only use kindle etc. I do want the Netflix application, the sooner the better. For those of you who may be like me, hopefully this review helps.

I love being able to open more than 1 application, the quiet little notification in the corner that someone is trying to reach me, and \"just type\" and it literally takes you to exactly where you need to go.  My children all have macbooks and wanted me to get the IPad 2 and I researched the IPad and the Xoom & read all the reviews but i wanted something so much simplier and the ability to do what i just shared AND the Touchpad is all that and then some.  The docking station is awesome and the little case is great too.  Many say the weight is a little too much but it did not bother me at all; it is compact and is much lighter than most laptops and that was all i really cared about.

I was unable to afford it since I wanted two, one for myself and a second one for my wife. Then the \"firesale\" started and these machines were hard to come by. Luckily, I was able to buy two from a seller on Amazon at a still very decent price.One of my principal worries were many of the negative reviews which I had been reading on the Internet. Most notably, reviews comparing it to the Apple iPad. I do not own an iPad nor have I ever even seen one but now that I have the touchpads, I don't care.This unit is a gem! It is very easy to use and the integration of Facebook and my e-mail account makes my heart go pitter-patter. Granted, there are not many apps for the TouchPad...yet. But for what it does have, it's fantastic. Here's the roundup of good and bad.1) Screen. Gorgeous!. Although my TP got a dead pixel just three day's after I took it out of the box. Luckily, it's to the bottom left corner (landscape mode)so I can live with it. Images are extremely clear and text is very easy to read.2) Speed. Works for me. Bringing up apps or going on the Internet is quick and easy. I much prefer this to my other three computers.4) O/S. Sooo easy and it works like a charm. I have had experience with Windows and Apple operating systems and Web OS blows them both out of the water. No comparison.5) Build. Right out of the gate, I can't stand the back of the unit. It is super glossy and slick which means that fingerprints get on it and seem to stay on it. A matte finish or even a brushed aluminum would have been a much better choice. The rest of the unit is built like a brick out-house. Very nice, seamless construction, nice layout, just a joy to look at and hold.6) Accessories. The can only go so far with the virtual keyboard before I want to throw the unit against the wall. For typing small stuff, it's fine. but for long diatribes, you will definetly want the keyboard. I do like that the virtual keyboard has the numbers row at the top. It also has a buttom for \".com\". Four less characters I have to type in the URL.7) Charging. This is the easiest I have ever charged anything. I purchased the Touchstone charging base and it is one of the best ancilliary purchases I have ever made. It is much smaller that I thought it was going to be and the actual/original price is way to high. But if you can get it for around $35 or less, then get it. The unit has a range of motion so that you can place the Touchbad basically sraight up and down or practically laying down. Very nice. I also purchased a leather cover for the TP and it charges thru that as well.8) Covers. Stay away from the HP made protective cover. It's bad and I do mean really bad. I purchased that as a \"just in case\" and two leather covers from another company. By personal experience, stay away from the HP branded cover. Not good. It's cheap and flimsy.9) Touch controls. The touchpad is very responsive to touch commands. No problem there.10) Sound. *wow* Comparatively speaking against other portable devices which I have heard, the speakers on this unit are superb. Very nice. Other manufacturers could learn a few things from HP when it comes down to sound.11) Video. Streaming video from the Internet such as from YouTube and news sites is a breeze.12) Three big cons. No support for Hulu. No support for Netlix although I had no problem accessing the site via normal Internet. Startup time for the unit is quite long, around 40-50 seconds. But once it is on, it's on!13) Battery life: I have been able to go from 7pm on up to 3am the next morning non-stop before I got the \"20% battery remeining\" notification. That is awesome!Best thing of all, my wife loves her Touchpad as well. I'm her hero! She has seen me with several laptops, two PDA's and she never knew what I found so appealing about those devices. Now that she has her own portable device with the Touchpad, she can barely put it down. I jammed her Touchpad with recipe apps (she loves cooking) and games and she can literally be on that tablet for 10 hours each day. And she can now watch her Korean Soap Operas in bed at around 4am (no, I am not kidding).If you can get your hands on a Touchpad, do so.

I received it a little over a week ago and have hardly left it alone since. I was a little disappointed when I first got it as the Kindle app was not ready, but as of last night the kindle app was updated, so the disappointment is gone.The tablet is FAST. I can breeze right thru any task I need. Having said that, apps do lag a bit to start up( A couple seconds). That really doesn't matter too much since once I open an app I can just leave it open. I love having everything on and running. I can start a video and minimize the webpage and let it load while I go read an email, then hop back to the video when its downloaded. Video playback is smooth and consistent, even on youtube.The internet, and email apps are great. Full, rich web pages displayed just as they would be on a computer. And the email sorting and blending makes it so easy to see what is going on in all my accounts.Battery life is also excellent and I am constantly using it. At work as my calender, at home on the couch surfing the web or checking email, or (now) reading a book with the kindle app, I am never disappointed by the battery running low.There is of course room for improvement.

I bought it, but with the understanding that I would return it if the TouchPad did not meet my needs better than the competing device. I'll keep this brief, but let me just say that I would have given this 4.5 stars, if I could. 4 stars for hardware, 5 stars for the user interface.  So here you go:Pros:- The user interface is phenomenal. I can pop open several web pages, reference a PDF, check email, play music (Pandora, etc.), all at once, browse pictures, all at once.- Flash websites work well (the one's I visit), including one that I know is very resource intensive.- Multimedia all video and music plays well.- The sound from the speakers (Beats audio) blows me away.  Rock, classical, electronica...it all sounds great. No other mobile device even comes close.- The photo application is suprisingly fast, even with large photos (large album with 5MB pictures).  There was no lag in 'swiping' through our pictures.- It is a productivity engine; I have been able to get so much done, even with the limited number of apps.  It is ready to use out of the box.Cons:- It is a bit on the chunky/chubby side, compared to some other tablets on the market (I know this is due, in part, to the Touchstone charger)- The glossy back is annoying; this should be a matte finish, like the cover of a ThinkPad laptop- Some applications are slow (QuickOffice)- No ability to access our local network resources, at least as far I can tell.- Large and graphic intensive PDF's are handled very slowly (Adobe Reader application). Also, no search or bookmarking in PDF's.- There is performance lag in some applications, which HP has indicated will be addressed in an upcoming update.I don't use Facebook, so I can't comment on the app, but other users have been raving about it.  Compared to the other tablet we've been testing, the TouchPad is the favored choice in our office, over the other 'leading' tablets. This will work equally well as a consumer or business tablet.  With more applications and some optimizations, this is a top tier product.We are probably going to keep it, even though this is a first generation device and has some problems to work out.

I had the money and I was ready to justify it as the only thing close to meeting my work needs. Then it happened...I received the email saying that the touchpad had arrived! I ran out the next day (yesterday), walked over to the ipad briefly, picked it up, put it down, then walked over to the HP touchpad. WONDERFUL!!!I like the weight- doesn't feel like a toy.

I have a unit \"rooted\" with Android 4.0 and can get almost all the functionalities of an android tablet except that the camera, mic, and syncing doesn't work under Android so I have to boot in WebOS if I need those functions.  Why the \"rooting\"? - because the WebOS is dead and there's minimal apps available for it and it can be clunky to use so the functionality is extremely limited without the Android rooting - I would say it not worth it for almost any price without the android.The unit has respectable specs and runs all apps fairly well - where the unit falls behind is in 1)shorter battery life compared to others, 2)ergonomics - thick and shiny plastic with a propensity to developing cracks right around the speaker ports at the bottom of the unit - mine cracked at the left side speaker port (purely cosmetic)and you can read about many others that experienced the same thing, 3)lack of external ports (no HDMI out) - only a micro usb for charging and syncing - there's been many reports about the port screwing up or being damaged, in which case you're pretty much left with an unuseable plastic brick - almost all others has a dedicated power plug which enables fast charging, 4) no built in GPS functionality - although after rooting it you can get a bluetooth GPS receiver to work, 5)lack of memory slot, and finally 6) lack of apps without the android rooting. Given these shortcomings, I cannot recommend this unit UNLESS you can get a \"rooted\" unit at a greatly reduced price.  I was able to pick a \"like new\" used one for under $130 (which is basically the HP firesale price when they discontinued these units), including a nice leather case - at that price I can carry this thing around for every day use and not worry about damaging it.There is no doubt in my mind that HP rushed these out before fully evaluating the design and functionality of the units - and is prime example of business missteps that plague HP these days.

The specifications of the hardware inside are well worth almost $400. Making this tablet costs money and each tablet sold for $99 is almost a $300 loss for HP.It was the slow sales of the TouchPad that caused HP to abandoned making it. However the UI, WebOS is not abandoned as many may think. WebOS works great and smoothly, although HP did tweak it a bit to say it may improvements in the future. This can be changed by going into developer mode and unleashing this tablet's true power. And trust me you will be blown away after playing with the TouchPad for a few days.It's crazy how fast and easy the Operating System is. Apple's iOS is easy and contains millions of apps, but HP's WebOS is cooler, sleeker, and smarter. However it is lacking in the app category, but that will improve now that millions of people have WebOS and more developers will work on apps.For $99 it is a crazy deal for a gaming device, internet surfer, e-reader, and task manager.Update:It has a full browser with flash! Neither Android nor iOS come with that as stock browser software.Skype video calls works amazingly too, never a dropped call. This TouchPad also has a vibrate feature like phones and has dedicated phone app unlike the iPad or real android honeycomb tablets.Screen is also very durable, dropped it a few times already by accident.

It acts more like your desktop than a \"phone OS\" that runs one screen at a time.  Use what you need, when you need it, HOW you need it without having to close apps.  Reading on Kindle and need to answer an email?  Swipe up and open the email app, read respond and go back to Kindle without returning to a home screen.Like to stream music from the web while you work?  Start playing the media through the full flash supported browser and then open a new web card to keep browsing or do anything else while your media streams seamlessly in the other browser card.  This is true multitasking and productivity.Cons:It currently does not have a video out option, and there are less apps than competitors but more are being added every day.  Many of the major apps are present such as major news outlets, magazines, games like Angry Birds HD, and Need for Speed, and Kindle books.Also because of the recent release, there aren't as many accessories on the market yet, this too will come the longer it is on the market.Other Thoughts:if your home internet provider blocked 40% of the web from your pc, would you stay with them or switch to another provider that doesn't?  With the TouchPad, you get 100% of the internet, not just the 60% that doesn't use Adobe Flash.Other platforms have \"an app for every site\" but with the TouchPad's full Flash browser, you have everyweb site \"as an app\" (using the built in \"save site to launcher\" function).  If you like music, the TouchPad has stereo speakers and Beats Audio technology for amazing sound.

It's a shame that it isn't supported more because it really is a nice tablet. I have been trying out a lot of tablet devices lately, trying to find one I really like & this one has been pretty great.First thing I noticed, which was huge for me, is that this never gets hot no matter how many hours I play with it. It doesn't even get real warm. I've had so many tablets and/or laptops get so hot they shut themselves down or I just have to stop using them for awhile to cool down but not my Touchpad! I have it on for hours & hours and it stays nice & cool.The system is really smooth. WebOS is new to me but I think its great & if it was supported more, it could be huge. All the apps & such, integrate so beautifully with this system. The Facebook app is amazing & simple. The email, messaging, web browsing all work great too.I don't like the way the browser handles bookmarks because it has no way to organize them at all. The camera is awful but there is an app that improves the camera significantly and its free. I don't use camera so its not an issue for me but don't expect anything great from it.I use the free WordPress app to blog & its a very pleasant experience. There are a few really good apps made for this and if you choose to install Preware like I did, then you can install some patches that speed this up quite a bit. I can't imagine not having patches installed anymore. Preware also lets you personalize your machine more but may void any warranty you may have. I think its worth it though.Anyway, I.m very happy with my Touchpad & I'm glad I bought it. I tried the iPad2 first & was not impressed. It just felt like a really big version of my iPhone 4 and I didn't need or want another iphone plus I wanted the Flash ability. I love how WebOS is open to everyone & you can install apps NOT checked by HP. The community is full of developers willing to create apps & patches to address or fix any issues with the device AND ITS ALLOWED! Apple is too restrictive & wants to sue all its users for anything they may do to their own property.I hope the huge demand for the touchpad will make it more popular now & attract more developers. I'm thankful for the generous refund for my device from Newegg & the really great $50 promo code from HP to buy apps.

My 9yr old daughter loves to read, she reads about 10 books a day during this summer, i think our local library ran out of books already :) I really liked the ipad2 (we have ipod touch 4G and really love it) but for the price i find it too expensive, i'd rather get a full blown laptop and do a lot more for the money.  I told myself maybe wait for ipad3 hopefully maybe they will put in SD card reader (so i can just pop in my photos taken with my dSLR-Nikon D7000), USB tethered capture (i wish!), retina display etc. then maybe it'll be worth it. I've actually looked at other Android tablets and even considered Acer Iconia tab as there were some deals here and there. I was actually about to look for and get a color Nook or kindle for my daughter anything under $200. When the firesale on HP touchpads began, i immediately ordered one (slickdeals!) I mean websurfing with flash, ebook reader built-in Kindle and adobe reader for $149 32GB model, i'm sold! It was a no brainer, it was one of those moments you act now and think later scenarios, ha ha.. Actually had they sold it half the price say, $250 i would have still considered and bought it.Now that i have a 32GB for the last 3 days (Best Buy free express shipping, no need to kill myself running around  lining outside or camping out at B&M; stores), i'm really really happy! Still can't believe we got one after all the frenzy and craze that firesale weekend (8/20-21). Overall feel and quality by just holding it, definitely this thing is worth more than $149. The screen is nice and overall feel is solid. We got our in-laws an ipad2 and i know first hand what an ipad2 feels (i had to set it up and teach them how to use it), ipad2 definitely is better quality build but touchpad is not far behind (not 1/4 the price behind! ha ha). I like the WebOS interface a lot better. I guess this is subjective but i like the overall flow to it. Web browsing, on screen keyboard typing (love that i can change the keyboard sizes from XS,S,M,L, i use XS!), e-mail and facebook! definitely a lot better than ipad2. The synching of accounts into one is great too! So say chat and calls contacts from yahoo,skype etc are in one app! The photo/video app is amazing as well, i synched up our facebook account and all our albums/photos are displayed on it, as if the photos are saved on the Touchpad! Kindle is a nice touch too got tons of free books already first time i've signed up and tried it and PDF viewer is good, not great but good enough! Web browsing with flash is awesome! Feels like i'm surfing on my laptop without any limitations or worry a website may work or not. The first few days were good experience, updating software, downloading/testing apps enough to keep me busy. But i did feel some sluggishness, there's a slight delay on everything, it's kind of weird especially if you're used to ipad2 speed. So after a few day, since i now have a good baseline of the stock performance out of the box, i went ahead and applied the PreWare patches, performance improved but still not enough, the next night i overclock the thing, default is 1.2GHz, overclocked to 1.7GHz, at first i was weary of doing this but after doing some research and reading, feeling confident and with back-up plans i went ahead and did it! Overclocking took me about 15 to 30 mins overwhelming at first but really easy afterwards, this thing now flies!! I would say faster or on par with ipad2 speeds! I'm really happy and i think had the touchpad been released in default like this and $100 cheaper, it would have gotten better reviews and response. But, no complaints, if not they wouldn't have dropped the price either and not gotten this awesome deal.  I'm in the process of uploading some videos for the kids and it was a pain at first (my bluray m2ts 4GB compressed 1080p 5.1 files had to be converted to mp4) but just last night found a preware (kalemsoft for touchpad) that can play divx,mkv, avi etc. wow! Will be experimenting on this more but looking very optimistic! The speaker on this thing is really nice as well, again way better than ipad2. Only downside for me right now is Netflix playback, this would be really nice so hoping netflix will get it in soon. Also not too concerned with Apps, HP app store i think has enough usefull apps.Overall, for the price (cheaper than Kindle, Netbooks, heck even my daughters Nintendo DSi, also digital photoframes at this size is about $80-$100, 1/4 the price of ipad2 and can do most or even more) and amount of stuff you can do with it, it's a 5 star!! I don't really care if WebOS is dead or no apps come in but judging from the community around PreWare and homebrew, a lot of new stuff are coming, it's still worth it. This thing is a true gem! diamond in the rough to say the least if you got one! I've got 2 more coming in from Amazon (tracking number on hand) so me, my wife and my daughter could each have one for less than a price of an ipad2 32GB! Oh my in-laws who got the ipad2 32 are thinking of selling it and save the money left over as they see the Touchpad is good enough for the level of stuff they use it for (web browsing, news and facebook updates and see their grand kids photos videos online).", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "webos is the heart of this tablet", "Author": "James W.

It's notification system is far more superior and mature than that of what is coming up for iOS 5, it is less intrusive and as a designer, visually more appealing than the implementation on iOS 5. It's home screen shares very tight similarities between Android devices, which in my opinion, is also more visually stunning than the buck-tooth, not-designed for a tablet os that runs on the iPad. Have I mentioned how gorgeous Pivot is? Its their monthly featured application system that is just stunning and fully featured (see store). The preware (homebrew) support apparently speeds up the sluggish performance of the OS, this I have yet to try.I've been praising the OS so far, how does the hardware go? It's actually pretty solid.

A lot of the criticisms you'll read here may or may not be important to you - you'll have to make that decision yourself. In my family's case, the TouchPad has been a good replacement for my wife's Macbook, which she primarily used as a repository for pictures and music. She has started to use the TouchPad much more frequently for more than just pics and music, however. She's now watching Hulu, using HP's slick Facebook app (really, it's nice... once chat is added it would be complete), and checking email (the main reason we passed on the iPad... iOS email is terrible).Without question, webOS 3.0 is the star of the show, here. You really have to live with it and learn how to take advantage of it before you see the beauty in how it works. While I wait for webpages to load, I can go off and check my email, play Angry Birds HD - whatever, and come right back to what I was doing without missing a beat. There is no other operating system like this, even though some manufacturers like RIM and now Microsoft are trying to copy it.Regarding lag, it's definitely there, but thus far has only been a minor issue and we've had no lock-ups or crashes. At all. In addition, I have plans to install some patches (very easy to do) which will greatly speed up the UI of the TouchPad. HP also has acknowledged the issue and claims aggressive updates are coming very soon to fix this. Even without this, it hasn't been a dealbreaker for us.App load times are slower than my friend's iPad2, but the beauty of webOS is that you can LEAVE THESE APPS OPEN and then they open up instantaneously.Battery life has been great, with heavy use and screen brightness at 50% pretty much the whole time. I strongly recommend the Touchstone charging dock as I have experience with these for charging my webOS phones...  our TouchPad charging dock comes in the mail in a few days and I'll update my review accordingly when it does. There is also a Bluetooth keyboard available for this device, which I may also get.The two negatives I'd really throw at the TouchPad are its slick back and heft. The back is slippery sitting on the lap because it's shiny plastic. This is remedied with an Invisible Shield cover or HP's TouchPad case. Finally, the TouchPad is definitely weightier than other entrants into the field but it's not a big issue if your usage case will mostly be having it on your lap or on a stand.Overall we came into this pretty cautiously but are pretty darn happy with it and plan to keep it. We can't wait to see what HP does with this device.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "2 Weeks in- Great Device and webOS is Fantastic", "Author": "wonkywizard3", "ReviewID": "R1D779AF4RL4BI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my 32 GB TouchPad for 2 weeks. I'm writing this review to share with other users what I like about the device and what HP can improve on to do better. Overall, I'm delighted with the device.Things I really Like:1. Microsoft Exchange - I can run multiple Microsoft Exchange accounts in full profile (calendar, contacts, address book) without any issue.2. webOS Synergy -integrates multiple accounts into intelligent consolidated profiles based on overlap. For example, when any of my LinkedIn contacts updates his/her job title, my contacts change automagically.3. Multi-Dropbox - I can run 2+ Dropbox accounts simultaneously on the device. This isn't easy to do even on a desktop, but webOS was architected from the ground up to work with the cloud seamlessly.4. Free storage - TouchPad owners get 50GB of free Box.net secure cloud storage for life, a great deal worth at least $10 per month or $240 over 2 years.5. Background video - not everything playing on video needs to be watched with undivided attention, sometimes you just want to listen. It's nice that I can run a Flash video in a card in the background while doing email. True multitasking by choice.6. Drafts - I can have several draft emails open at the same time, this is a more natural way to work, and you don't need to press buttons to move in-between them; I can also open emails embedded in other emails.7. Signatures - in webOS email, all your individual mailboxes have their own settings and signatures. So you can have a casual signature for personal and professional signature for work email.8. Printing - works like magic out of the box with wireless HP printers or HP printers on a network. No setup needed, just auto-discover and go. It's the fastest I've ever test printed on a print-connected device.9. Skype - is built into the OS, no app needed, plus you can load all your messaging contacts, calendars from Google, Exchange, Yahoo, AIM, Skype and LinkedIn leveraging webOS Synergy to create a unified view.10. USB mounting - I can mount my HP TouchPad as a USB drive on any computer using a standard USB/microUSB cable. Sometimes, you need to move a whole folder of stuff and this is the easiest and quickest way to do it. You can access your saved files and folders on the device quite easily.11. Email Attachments - You can attach multiple items to emails you're composing the same way you would on a desktop. Just find the right folder, or Dropbox, and simply select the file. I particularly appreciate that you can add an attachment to a reply email without doing all sorts of gymnastics.12. Sound - the speakers are amazing, actually better than some laptop speakers and the front facing camera, mike and speakerphone for video conferencing is very good.13. Gestures - there are parts of the screen that are used to create special commands for navigation, very fluid.14. Openness - Even though the device has a relatively secure OS, instructions on how to \"jailbreak\" the device (to enhance its features unofficially) are available in the official HP App Catalog -anyone can put the device in developer mode and tinker with it. It cannot be \"bricked.\" I have already added patches that make the device much faster than shipped.15. Everything updates over the air and is backed up in the cloud.What Could Have/Can Be Better:1. Camera -It would have been great to have a rear camera too. Currently the front facing camera only works for Skype, hopefully the API will be opened up to other services too.2. Size and shiny finish -the device is thicker, this is a tradeoff to allow for inclusion of a wireless charging induction coil. Shiny finish bothered me until I put it in the standard case. Problem solved. Make sure you buy a case when you buy a TouchPad.3. Lag and hardware acceleration -webOS uses Javascript apps and operations that compile in realtime when the app is open, this gives the strong appearance of lag. It will improve with optimization, but this is an OS philosophy choice. Developers can make snappy fully compiled C++ native webOS apps4. Browser and other optimization issues -the OS that shipped with the hardware was frozen 10 weeks ago, several things are clearly still being improved as we speak, we'll see after the OTA update ships around end of July.5. Applications - webOS has few applications right now (but more tablet apps than Android Honeycomb)  and HP is doing a lot of the right technical things to develop a long term following. Synergy APIs eliminate the need for many basic apps, but more progress is needed.6. Country App Catalog lock - I understand that once you set your country for the App Catalog, it can never be changed and you can never shop in a different country store. This sounds terrible and needs addressing.  There is a patch that can help with this, but still...In case you're wondering, yes, I believe every major multi-platform app we take for granted will eventually be available on webOS, but it will take some time. Developers love the openness and potential of webOS, the efficiency of its emulator, flexibility of its canvas and frameworks, the fact that the tablet is has built in node.js server is a bonus.  The TouchPad could have been better, but it's not as bad as some of the superficial reviews made it out to be.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a Mac user, but a plethora of useless apps doesn't make the interface any easier nor the one-at-a-time-software OS any better.  I've been spoiled having multiple apps open on my Palm Pre Plus, so I can't settle for less.  I've also seen how annoying a text message is when it takes over your whole screen while you are in the middle of doing something else.  WebOS does NOT do this.  You can easily ignore text messages.My purpose is to use the device as a music storehouse.  I'll be downloading Kindle music or moving documents (lyrics and chords) from Word over to QuickOffice to play.  I'm already in love with that aspect of it.

It may look a bit fuzzy at first, but I think the quality is good. If you don't like the quality then buy a camera since that's their job...I can't think of any complaints for it except that the cord to plug into the tablet for charging is a little loose so I have to be careful to make sure its charging and not touch it which can be a little annoying.do your own research on it, but I am very happy with this tablet.

I just got a 32GB model, and the tablet is way better than many reviewers had me believing. First, the device is not clunky or plastic-y - it's just not made of aluminium on the back. It's a perfect size, and, I find it sits in my hand more comfortably than an apple ipad, because over the rounded plastic bevels on the edges of the touchpad. The touchpad works just as fast as any rival tablet, and so this is comparatively satisfactory.In my opinion, there are two features that make this tablet truly stand out.Everyone says it, and I'll repeat it: the webOS is simply amazing. It's a really intuitive tablet operating system. The features I am currently most in love with are the multi-tasking card layout, the notifications in the top \"task bar\" (they don't disturb me while I'm working), and, my personal favourite, the KEYBOARD! It's like a regular computer keyboard - the numbers and letters both appear on the screen at the same time! Also you can choose between 4 sizes of keyboard keys. Truly ingenious.The second great feature is the true web experience. You can go to any website and it's as if you're visiting it from a laptop. Sure, Steve Jobs might explain that your battery life will drop and that adobe flash is bad, but what's the point in buying a device if you can't use it properly. I like to see flash on websites, instead of \"plugin missing\" that I so often see on the apple mobile products.Overall, this device is great. I bought it now, during the fire sale, because it was too great a deal to pass up whether I needed a tablet or not (I don't need one :p). This product is both the best HP product in recent years and the worst HP marketing disaster of all time. The touchpad should have been way cheaper to start (like Microsoft and the original XBox, if HP wanted to gain traction in the market, they should have been prepared to lose money on each unit). Also, the device has some great but useless features that made the iPad look far better. Stereo speakers should have been mono. There should have been a rear camera. and the wireless charging is useless and takes up room in the device. Had they made these changes, the touchpad would have been thinner, cheaper and more competitive.

Are they outrageous and tamper the experience? No. It freezes up the same amount that my iPhone 4 does.Flash in browser? I always thought that was a stupid selling point. Until now. Websites just work. There are no stupid blank boxes--you get to experience any website. No stupid company war issue holding you back.Notifications? Perfect. Multi-tasking? PERFECT.

Why is tabbed browsing the norm now? We like to multi-task. Products from Apple and others force you to focus on one item, but we are humans and it's just not our preference.

No, I think the size and shape are perfect? Too heavy? Yes. They need to bring that down.I also have a TouchStone charger. It's awesome.

The day that it was released I headed to Best Buy to get the HP Touchpad.  My first impression was that the demo models were laggy and not as responsive as I thought it would be.  I ended up purchasing a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 instead.  After 2 weeks of playing with the Tab 10.1 I decided to returned it to Best Buy.  I have an android phone (EVO 3D) and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 just felt like an over sized phone.  I guess the new Honeycomb OS didn't really interest me.  A month would go by and while reading some blogs on Engadget I saw that HP was doing a liquidation of its precious new tablet.  At $99.99 for the 16GB and $149.99 for the 32GB who could resist?  I ended up snagging a 32GB model.  Man oh man, was I glad I gave this tablet a second chance.  I think HP heard the critics and tweaked the OS in their latest update.  The tablet now feels so much better.  It's as responsive or more responsive than the Ipad 2 I got for my wife.  I'm very happy with this tablet and I'm hoping that WebOS doesn't get scrapped.  WebOS is such a great operating system to have on a tablet.

He wants to sell it and get a better tablet...go figure. I also tried out an iPad, and I felt just like I do when I play in Steve Job's walled garden with my iPod Touch....just a bigger toy.Having eliminated these two main players left me to turn my attention to the HP Touchpad and the webOS operating system. Some people wrote that webOS was too difficult to use....all I can say is there statistically is a certain percentage of the population who exist at the bottom of or below the average IQ range, and that is why there is the iPad. Seriously, webOS is about as difficult to use as toaster. Some folks wrote that there are just not enough apps available for the HP Touchpad. There is a certain amount of truth to that, but there is a basic lineup available now for productivity and communication, and a bunch of new apps will come out this year as the Touchpad becomes more mainstream.Needless to say I went out and purchased this Touchpad when it went on sale for $399, and I am very happy that I did. I think HP was smart to wait to release the Touchpad when it was ready and didn't rush a half-baked product to market.

The good news is that advice doesn't really apply in a technology product like the Touchpad, since the \"flaws\" are generally ones that will get addressed with software updates and new apps.  While I have to admit not owning an iPad, we do own a couple iTouches and an iPhone, and the Touchpad is overall as good a product.  I know many reviewers will say it isn't as good as an iPad, but that also depends on what you find important in the device.  I love the web surfing with Flash support, the true multi-tasking, overall performance of apps and video, and the easy of use.  I can say with certainty that most buyers will really enjoy their Touchpad, and it will only get better as the app catalog gets more robust.And speaking of app catalogs, much of the comparison of catalog size is overblown.  iTunes (as wonderful as it is) might have 500 clock apps...that all do what any phone or pad does already - tell time!  Do you care that the Library of Congress has a gazillion books, or that it has the 10-15 that you really want?  Fifteen years ago, people said Apple was dead because Macs had 5% of the programs as Windows.

I went to Bestbuy and played around with it, and still wasn't sure, even after months of anticipation.  I finally decided to get it, even though I had a sinking feeling I may regret it afterwards.I have had the product for about a day now, but I love it already.  Here are my impressions (good and bad):Good:- I was worried about synching all my music with this from iTunes (had a large library), and it was a snap.  You download hpplay [...]to your PC, and it installs some software that looks a bit like iTunes.  It looks at your iTunes library, and when you plug your Touchpad to the PC, it all syncs easily.  Everytime you plug your Touchpad in, it will sync.- I also have a Palm Pre (some of you may not) and it actually pushed the songs to my phone as well (I didn't even do anything, it just synched my Touchpad account data with my phone - how great is that)- Music sounds great- Pivot magazine - this is a very nice feature.  I have owned an Android device, and an iPod/iPhone and always found it hard to find useful applications.  Android was especially tough with this, as I would look for apps and unless you used the right search criteria, it was impossible to find the good ones.  Well, HP came out with a magazine type approach when you open the App Catalog.  In the magazine, they write up featured apps, and what those apps offer.  You can also download apps directly from the magazine.  You can also just search the old fashioned way in their catalog, but this offers an easy approach for those of us that don't have time to always search the web for top rated applications.- Skype integrates really well - the video calling is a breeze to use-crisp, vivid images and photos- Good visibility in direct sunlight - I have looked at people reading a magazine with their Ipads in the sunlight, and it is really hard to read anything because visibility is poor, but HP has done a great job making their screen legible in sunlight-Good applications.  Everyone keeps saying HP is behind on apps, and while I agree, the apps I have downloaded so far are high quality applications.  The facebook apps is the best I have seen, and I downloaded many others -including apps for my kids (toddlers).-Email/Calendar/Contacts -best email application, in my opinion.  I can see my work email, Yahoo, and Gmail all in one place- along with one calendar and contacts list.  I also love the calendaring system, and how clean the interface is, with all the needed data for my meetings.Areas to improve:- was disappointed that although I could download Kindle, it wasn't available for actual use yet.  It gives you a message saying it will be available for usesoon..I got the same thing with HP's Movie Store- at times, the screen freezes up just a tad..I am sure this can be cleaned up with a bit of tuning- Having a rear camera for me, is not that important.  However, I would highly recommend them putting a rear camera on that can take HD video as well.  I can see myself taking video in the futureOverall, I am impressed by this tablet and am a real fan.  I intend to show it off to others to make them realize what a great product this is.

They couldn't understand why I would pick this over an ipad.I had to show them, and then they understood. It's just really easy to use. it has everything connected through synergy, so all my contacts, calendars, email accounts, facebook and snap fish all come together throughout all the programs that use those features.you can flick things closed.The web browser is nice and fast. you forget how much web is in flash when you use an ipad until you use one of these and it all shows back up. and if you pop things up, they auto stack for you and so you have a big pile of sites if you are used to using many browser windows. (I had been using an ipad for almost a year before I figured out you where the extra windows went.)you can stack up your open windows. so you spend less time navigating and more time using.you can move around by pushing up windows - so you don't always have to be going back to the home button or remembering where it is orientated.my alerts show up at the top quickly, and stay organized until I am ready to view them. then the best part is that I can read or not read them right from there.My last favorite feature is called Just Type. You have heard of it, but that is a great feature because you literally just type what you want and it finds it for you, or starts up a post or note you need.

You can install android on them which solves that problem, and eventually I'll have to do that, but they were my first experience with webOS, and I had the misfortune to really fall in love with a dead OS. It's intuitive, smooth, and I can have all sorts of things open at once and easily tab between them. I can leave a YouTube clip running, and jump over to check my email while still listening to it as it plays on. Our primary activity on them is web browsing and YouTube.  They can handle the flash in some web based games the kids play too. I'd buy one again, even having to pay more, so it's a good thing they seem durable. Mine get dropped - daily. And sat on, and shoved in backpacks, and otherwise kicked around. I use the folio cases they came with and we don't have so much as a scratched screen, let alone a broken one. The weak point seems to be the charging port. The original chargers quickly failed to work with first one, then the other, as did an HP replacement. Somehow the connection is just slightly too short. A standard micro USB charges it fine, only slower. But both of them, and my sister's too. Sometimes a charging error will occur where you need to reset the device, or the connections in the wall side of the charger aren't connecting, but I've seen 3 where the USB cables HP sends just stop working with the device.

Lo", "ReviewID": "R23TSSJUEKHQ87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet knowing it was discontinued. When first using the touchpad it was good but a little sluggish. I used \"Webos doctor\" to update the software to 3.0.4. The difference was amazing. I have used Android devices for a while and Webos is amazingly simple to use and multitasking is a breeze. Out of the box you receive webos 3.0.0 but just google \"webos doctor\" and update it to 3.0.4, it made the touchpad much quicker and took away bugs. Also look into installing Preware, this will give you access to many free apps and customizations to use on your touchpad. As for hardware it is good but does have it's flaws. The only thing that bugged me was that it was a little heavier than i expected but it's ok. Get a case and screen protector to prevent scratches and fingerprints. Out of the box you will receive a free 90 day warranty from HP that will be honored. You will also receive 50 free gigs of cloud storage from Box.com just for owning the touchpad. Many people complained about the lack of apps, personally i don't need thousands of apps to be happy and I was pleasantly surprised to find the app selection was better than I expected and not that bad, though it is far less than that of Android or Apple's. You should be able to find most of your favorites. The only app I do miss is Netflix but I do have a laptop for that. Overall this tablet is amazing. The Webos really makes the touchpad shine. As a penny pinching college student I can recommend this as a cheap alternative to the ipad. Just make sure if you do buy it to update the software to 3.0.4, this will make your experience much more enjoyable and it is free and easy to do. Games look great and they are all around 99cents (even for the good stuff). HD videos are very clear and the built in speakers sound pretty good. Don't forget that the touchpad supports BEATS audio. Also, look up the Angry Birds easter egg on youtube, it will make closing apps very fun ;)Good: WEBOS, great screen,free 50gigs of cloud service through box.com,90 day warranty, easy to use and multitask,BEATS audio, great for student on a budget.Bad: Fingerprint magnet, a little chunky for today's standards, app catalog is not as big as Apple's and Android ( but not that bad, you'll find many favorites), Must use webos doctor to update to 3.0.4, though it is fairly easy.Overall: The HP touchpad is an amazing tablet.

My iPad2 is great, but I paid a fortune for it and I have to use iTunes for everything.  There are 3 key apps I use for my business that are only developed for the ipad by independent companies so my iPad is very necessary, but outside of that, the Touchpad spanks it in almost every respect.  There is no \"lack of apps\" on the HP app catalogue.  How many apps do you want?  There are tons in there and all the Pre apps run on it too.So far I'm overall using more overall apps on the Touchpad than the iPad.  Most of what I (and I think the average user)use in a real works scenario and on a daily basis, is available on both platforms.  This is mainly due to the multitasking and the ability to switch between apps so easily and not have to close them out.Amazing device.

The browser is not compatible with many sites and there are few sites.  It is thicker than newer tablets and has less power.  There is a version of Android Ice Cream Sandwich being developed for the Touchpad.  The Android version is still in Alpha.  I think you would better buying ASUS TF or TFT or Nexus 7.December 2012I have really enjoyed the Touchpad over the last six months and I am still happy I bought it.  But, there a lack of Apps are begining to detract from its appeal.  I cannot tether it.  Also, I cannot use Yahoo messenger.  In GMAIL I can only access a limited portion of history-I have had the HP Touchpad for a few months now and I still love it.  I wanted to update that WebOS (the great operating system on the Touchpad and much better than Android) is now open source software.  Hopefully, that means more Apps and a long life of an improving operating system.  Too bad Android is so popular.  Web OS is much better.  I highly recommend Picsel Smart Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel) as an app.  It has drawbacks but it is really much better than Quickoffice (comes with the Touchpad.) I bought an HP keyboard.  It is light and makes typing very easy.The following review was written after having the Touchpad for a couple of weeks.  The bottom line is that for $270 this 32 GB HP Touchpad is a joy. Ideally one would compare tablets to each other but I have only played with the IPAD 2 for a few hours.  Like the HP TouchPad tablets are wonderful because they are: lightweight (1.6 pounds), great screen, and boot fast.  I think the TouchPad is as good as anything out there and it is less than half the price.I will start with the negatives:First CNET criticizes the HP TouchPad because it feel like plastic, finger smudges get all over the black case and it is thick.  It does get smudges but they are on the screen too and all tablets are going to get that because of the technology of touch screen.  I wouldn't have noticed the smudges on the back had not some CNET reviewer complained (there are smudges).  I don't look at the back of the TouchPad often and they are easy to wipe just like the smudges on the screen.  Finallyi, the TouchPad isn't that much thicker then the IPAD.Second negative: Limited Apps: This is probably a valid concern but I have all of the Apps I want.  Kindle, weather, tape recorder, file manager, word processor, power point, spreadsheet, Facebook, note organizer, etc  would like to have a good dictionary for a more reasonable price.  Also, there is a community developing an Android system for Touchpad and my son is going to show me how to set it up so I can dual boot and use Linux Apps if I ever need them.  Bottom line, the limited Apps is probably only a problem if you want lots of games.  There is an App that allows you to access your computer over the internet and run software on your computer.  You can even watch Netflix.  It cost $10.  I have not tried it but the reviews are great.Third negative:  This is somewhat related to the second - concern about long term support for WebOS. It isn't clear what HP will do with Web OS but there are a lot of programmers who love the operating system so I am optimistic and there probably will be the option to run Android at sometime in the future.  By the time the operating system is outdated, if ever, technology improvements will have made all of the existing tablets obsolete and you will save $330 buying the TouchPad.The positives:The price.  I paid $270 for a 32 GB version and I think it is a good, maybe better as IPAD or Android versions.  It isn't as beautiful as the IPAD and may have less Apps but for $330 savings I will take the HP. If I am going to spend $600 I will look at Ultra light portables.User Interface:  Is wonderful, uses \"cards\" for Apps, you can have lots of Apps open at the same time and move easily between them.  It is fun to use.Is supported by a user community that loves the fact that you can easily change it, run other operating systems etc.You get 50 GB of storage in the cloud for free.  You can share certain folders to let others access files and/or edit them.  I have used it to provide samples of work to prospective clients.  It has been really useful.The email is great. I access all of my accounts under one email.I enjoy the easy access to apps, web, reading, email, word processing.  It is light, easy to carry around, the battery life is great.A few comments about Tablets.  I do a lot of work on spreadsheets and I think all tablets are limited because they do not have enough memory to handle large spreadsheets.  Also, typing is awkward.  It was awkward on the IPA as well.  I am going to buy a keyboard.  I bought a cheap leather case for less then $10.  I wished I had spent more money.

Netflix and hulu are not essential for me, but you can use \"logmein\" from your browser to use those sites on your home computer or purchase the \"splashtop\" app to do the same. Personally, the Video Flood app more than makes up for it, it scours the net for all available videos and lists them in a user friendly screen. I paired my Touchpad with a GrandTec USA bluetooth keyboard case and also use bluetooth headphones. I use the following apps and love them:1. Kindle App - essential, and works great2. Music Remix - awesome music app3. Box - free 50 gb of storage4. Picsel Smart Office - amazing office app, create and modify any office documents5. Tweetpad - intuitive and simple interface for twitter6. Zinio - love reading magazines on my touchpad!Its an APP crazy world - if you bookmark some of your favorite sites, I don't see what the big deal is. Google Music streams my 20,000 songs just fine through the browser. Skype has worked perfectly for me.

I think it has everything like the Apple iPad, but it is more freeing for the user. Even though there are not tons of games, it is still worth the price because of the freedom you gain with the internet. Also, how they have the cards set up is great, I find it much easier to have several pages open and not get confused on what I have open, etc. Why they stopped making these Touchpads is beyond me, and I do not understand it at all since it was so popular, and cheaper than the competitors. I would really like to see them bring this item back, or make it better by giving it a 3G advantage.To put it simply, I felt while using an iPad it was like talking to someone who has an extremely closed mind. But while using the Touchpad, its like talking to someone who has an open mind. Much easier to get along with, no barriers, no limitations.Even though they have stopped production, they still offer updates, and the HP Touchpad game catalog is pretty good. I have lots of great Touchpad Apps that are great, have great graphics, some are for work, some are for writing, production, calendars, etc. Everything you can think of, they have.I would recommend this to those who do not like Apple, or for those who are looking for an alternative that allows flash for the freedom on the net.5 stars.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A review from an experienced tablet user.

Flash and HTML5 is standard, so you don't get any annoying blank boxes when surfing - like the iPad. (The iPad is a wonderful machine. But the lack of Flash support kills it for everyday web use. J.M.H.O.)I considered a Kindle Fire and a new Nook at my spending limit, before buying my 16GB touchpad. After careful research, I picked the Touchpad. If you are looking to spend under $250, there really is nothing to compare this with. I had originally planned in rooting this to an Android ROM, but after using the WebOS, I decided to leave it alone. The latest update of WebOS is slicker than snail snot, and quite fast. Apps are a little light but adding daily. And if you have Angry Birds, what more do you really need? :O) Keep in mind that there is a big difference in component and build quality between something that was designed to sell for $500 - $600 and something that was designed to sell for $199-$250.Getting this at the \"Fire Sale\" $99 price would have been nice.

So when HP decided to have it's firesale on the touchpad, I had to buy it!At first I would argue it was sluggish, but 1 week later a big update came out on the system and really improved just about everything. On top of that, HP has sent out multiple promos to give away applications & ofcourse most importantly the touchpad acts like a computer.(so what do I mean when I say it acts like a computer)1. Runs flash - meaning I don't have to worry about going to websites and them not working. (except hulu has been blocked sadly)2. true multi-tasking - I love how I don't have to close applications just because I'm doing something else. I can literally, play a video game, listen to a song I enjoy, Download, Message. Pretty much just continue everything with out missing a beat.3. Remote desktop - the processor in the touchpad works well enough that a remote desktop application was made and runs very well.  Well enough to watch my Hulu through my remote desktop after all.4. if you don't like webos, or if you need all the applications. There is even an application to run Android on it. So if you miss your fart applications. Just launch your Android app.5. the battery life is AMAZING. I remember people talkign about how it is less then the IPAD and that maybe so, but I have had the computer for months now, and barely ever charge it...Well, I could really go on about the ups on this forever, but in the end there is really 1 thing to pay attention to. *Most people that own a IPAD will tell you, they stopped using it ever it lost it's \"Cool Factor\"* well, the touchpad doesn't. I watch a lot of tv on my Macbook Pro and occasionally I leave the laptop at work or downstairs, I simply go get my touchpad and watch any show on that.

I've been able to spend a good amount of time with the iPad 2, the XOOM, and the Iconia A500, but the TouchPad is the only tablet that I own for myself. I have to say that it definitely lives up to my expectations of what webOS would be capable of on a tablet.Multi-tasking is by far what separates webOS from Honeycomb and iOS. Google and Apple still have not been able to catch up to the level of multi-tasking that webOS was capable of back in 2009. The cards and stack interfaces on the TouchPad are not only extremely intuitive, but allow you to achieve a level of productivity similar to what you are used to on a desktop or laptop with a full OS like Windows or OS X.Then there is Synergy (not sure if HP is still calling it that but I'm pretty sure they are). webOS handles multiple account log-ins like Google, Yahoo, Exchange, Dropbox, Facebook, etc., extremely well across the entire system. Contacts are matched from different services (e.g., e-mail address book and Facebook profile) to a single profile. Aside from just linking contacts, Synergy works with the rest of the TouchPad's native apps as well as some third-party apps if the developers support it. Two examples are that the native Calendar app syncs flawlessly with my Yahoo and Facebook calendars, and the native Photos app includes my Facebook albums as folders accessible on the device.Admittedly, the HP App Catalog is not up to pace with what is offered for iOS or Honeycomb (yet). However, the tablet-optimized 3.0 apps that do exist are of great quality. You are of course also able to access the entire webOS catalog (including apps for webOS phones). These apps run on what looks like an emulated Pre and take up a little more than half the entire screen. They run just as flawlessly as the tablet-optimized apps, only they use a little less screen real estate.There already exists a great Homebrew community for webOS which HP has admitted it will not get in the way of (though it does not officially support homebrew). No jailbreaking or rooting required, getting custom patches and apps on the TouchPad is by far the easiest between webOS, iOS, and Honeycomb with simple instructions from a group like webOS Internals. Aside from that, the App Catalog will get better with time.The TouchPad also has full Flash support.

I'm not concerned about this because the software can easily be updated and HP has already announced that an over-the-air (OTA) update that should be out shortly to address known issues.  Just remember that most software issues can be addressed in updates, either by HP or the very active webOS homebrew community at PreCentral.net (link below):[...]Regarding the limited number of apps at introduction, I believe this will change very quickly.  Since HP announced it will be adding webOS to future products, most developers will understand that their potential market for apps extends beyond Touchpads (i.e. HP is the largest laptop and printer manufacturer in the world).  HP has apparently made the job of app development very easy and friendly for developers.  Food for thought...how many apps do you need on a laptop?  Not so many in my case because I have a full-featured browser and the Internet as a resource.  For a smartphone, apps are necessary because the human interface is more limited...tablets fall somewhere in between but are probably more skewed toward laptops than smartphones because of their larger and more friendly human interface.If you don't like some hardware features, then you may have a legitimate concern because these cannot be changed (e.g. size, weight, display, etc) although even some hardware issues can be addressed via software (e.g. to increase battery life).  Fundamental differences in operating systems are more difficult to change if they are not already present in the native OS (e.g. true multitasking).

It is actually better suited for a tablet than a phone.  The way you can multitask on this is far superior to what you can do on an ipad.The search functionality is very cool - at any time you can just start typing something and it will search everything on the pad as well as the web.  It's one of those things that once you see it you understand how useful it is.The email integration is great.  Easy to read and delete emails.  The keyboard seems decent although if I'm typing more than a few sentences I would likely do it from a PC.  One thing I realized is managing email on the tablet during a meeting is much less obnoxious than on a laptop since it's smaller and there's no noise from typing on a physical keyboard.I synched my itunes library.  It took a while for the data transfer but it seems to be working fine and it sounds surprisingly decent with the build in speakers and a lot better with headphones.Battery life is much better than a laptop although I haven't owned another pad to compare it to.  The fact that you press a button and it's on as opposed to waiting for it to boot up is very useful if you just want to quickly check email.The charging stand is cool - I like the fact that it charges through the case without needing to plug anything in.The only downside in my mind is a lack of app variety.  There are a bunch of decent apps to download but there are many notable one's missing - e.g. Netflix.

I once flicked through it for over an hour and gave up not finding a single app worth using.specialshiuser 2:Once upon a time I was an Apple fan. I had my ipod, and my Macbook, and the only thing that really kept me from buying an iPhone was my need for a more business orientated phone, which led me to Blackberry.My boyfriend, on the other hand, has been in love with WebOS for as long as I've known him. I never really 'got it'. Until he bought me a Touchpad. Now I'm hooked.WebOS is by far the best operating system I have ever laid hands on. And the Touchpad is just amazing.I've heard complaints that it's heavy, but to be honest I haven't found that (and I'm pretty scrawny). It feels solid. I actually like the weight better than some of the smaller tablets out there.Gestures are incredibly fun. I love that I can just swipe away an application. I know the Playbook had the same idea (which I believe they swiped from Palm/HP) but it's just not the same. I know that gestures aren't new to the OS, but with it being my first WebOS device it's still a novelty for me :P I already find myself trying to swipe things away on my non-WebOS smartphone touchscreen lol.I've seen some complaints on here about the app catalogue. That there aren't enough apps. To be honest, I would rather see quality over quantity any day. And I don't personally expect a full app catalogue upon release of a device. I've found apps for everything I need, and I've been very impressed with how well the apps I've downloaded so far have worked on the Touchpad. So far I have zero complaints, but I am counting on the app catalogue to grow over the next few months. If I didn't, well maybe then I'll have some complaintsI also saw some complaints about lag but to be honest I can't complain. There's been once or twice where there has been a split second of lag for me, but I haven't found it very noticeable. Is the iPad a little smoother? Perhaps, but they've also had a lot longer to perfect things like that. I'm confident that some updates will help fix any of the small lags I've seen when I've used certain apps (it could also be a problem with the apps) and even if it doesn't-it's not a deal breaker for me. My Blackberry is even worse for it and I don't even notice it anymore. In fact, if I hadn't of seen reviews complaining about lag I doubt I would have even noticed it.I love that that the keyboard is an adjustable size, and from what I've seen this is fairly unique. It's already been super handy for me-I like the larger keyboards when I'm using it to do a lot of writing.The email on this thing is great-way more user friendly than most email apps I've seen out there so far. And I'm pretty convinced that their FB app is actually the best one out there-especially after living through the sad excuse of the FB app for Blackberry.The sound quality also impresses me. I like to stream radio while I work, and was expecting to have to buy external speakers or use headphones, but the sound quality is actually really solid on this tablet.And another novelty for me that I'm sure most of you are already used to is the touchstone. I'm super impressed that I can just drop my touchpad on the charging dock, and no wires are required. It's definitely the way the tech world is moving-wires are so inconvenient.Oh and \"Just Type\" is such a simple feature that makes life so much easier-again, nothing new for WebOS veterans but a novelty for me nonetheless.Overall I'm super impressed with this tablet, and with WebOS in general.

I just need to cut away the film which cover the speakers [blocking the sound output], microphone [blocking voice input].After charging, startup is easy and straightforward, even though this is my 1st encounter with WebOS, and my 1st tablet as well.The touch screen response is good. Closing the active app by \"flicking off\" the screen need a bit of practise, and it become natural. Certain apps need to be closed by pressing the \"center button\". Not an issue at all.The graphic quality is good, except during \"fast flicking/scrolling\" the end of the page become \"pixelated\". But the graphic stablized once the page stop scrolling.

The 3 is a little lighter & thinner, but after 5 minutes holding each, you really don't notice it.  Both tablets are well-made and feel solid. The performance specs are essentially the same. The iPad 3's processor may be faster, but that speed it taken up making the screen run smoothly.  So too is the battery, especially when you watch a video.The Touchpad's battery lasts a good bit longer while playing a movie, and there's no discernible difference when watching HD.  I'm also a fan of WebOS, and wish more main-stream app developers including Netflix & Adobe, would provide apps for it.  Running multiple apps on WebOS is a breeze and makes iOS & Android look clunky.

I have had a few cheap tablets and i find the build quality of the touchpad to be very good.  i love the screen, the speakers are great, and the battery life has been very good.  I do like WebOS, especially the card system.  But I did find it very lacking in apps.  The ability to just use the browser for many sites, instead of relying on apps for each site, is a plus though.  The ereader app was really pretty terrible, and its a bit big to be used as an ereader anyway.  Video and audio are great.  I found myself using my laptop for browsing and my smaller tablets as an ereader, so I wasn't using the touchpad too often.  My daughter played Angry Birds on it, which does play great, and I played solitaire on it.  that was about it.  Yesterday I broke down and installed Android CM9 alpha 0.5 on it and I love it!  Still needs to get hardware acceleration fixed and then I'll be thrilled (need Netflix and Plex to work).  There is actually a Plex for WebOS version out there which I have installed and it works just fine.  So when i need Plex, I just boot into WebOS instead of Android.  So I strongly suggest the dual boot option of WebOS and CM9.  The tablet seems very zippy and I just wish I had bought a couple more during the firesale.  It's a little heavy compared to the brand new tablets, but otherwise it holds its own with the much more expensive new tablets.  All in all, even at the current price, I think this is a great tablet, especially if you want the 9.7 inch size.Edit 2/25/12:CM9 alpha 2.0 is now out and it has fixed video hardware acceleration so the Netflix app now works perfectly, as does Plex (though for some reason the media player initializes for a couple minutes before the movies start, which doesn't happen in WebOS).  Anyway, I no longer boot into WebOS and the kids and I are constantly using the Touchpad.  I highly recommend the CM9 alpha 2 installation.

I have 2 15 inch MacBook Pros and I think they are the best laptops I've ever used productivity wise. And I've used and owned many, many laptops. I used the original IPad for a while and then switched to IPad 2 when it came out. I love how fast and responsive the IPad 2 is and the amount of time I could waste on the seemingly endless amount of apps. The touchpad is not as fast as the IPad 2, not every app opens immediately on it, sometimes you have to wait for a second or two, and you don't have that many apps in the app market. But the Touchpad does everything I WANT it to do. I never have to turn on my laptop to visit thedailyshow.com because Touchpad supports flash without a problem, it doesn't block you from viewing the episodes and tell you to go buy them on iTunes. All my documents in the cloud are integrated seamlessly into the system, be it Dropbox, be it Google Doc. If I plug in the Touchpad to the computer and drag some files over, they will show up under Quick Office or Acrobat Reader on the Touchpad automatically. I make a lot of calls with Skype, Touchpad serves as a phone to me. I can pick up calls on it as easily as making them because Skype is integrated into the system flawlessly. Last but not least, I don't know if other people have noticed but the entertainment experience on the Touchpad is fantastic! I've always hated how dark and dim a lot of the movies look on the IPad, especially the ones shot in a dark background. You can hardly see anything in the darker parts of the video no matter how bright your screen is. That never happened to my Touchpad. I played the same iPad quality mp4 videos on the TouchPad and they all came out sharp and crystal clear. Everybody who's seen me play videos on the Touchpad would comment on how beautiful the pad looked. It beats the iPad hands down. I was also surprised to see Beats Audio on the Touchpad and as a proud owner of almost a dozen iPods, I have to say HP did a great job when it comes to sound quality. All my songs played beautifully both through my Bose ie2 earphones and the speakers on the Touchpad. I would purchase it again in a heartbeat!Updated review:HP is said to start working on an Android version of the tablet, I cannot imagine myself ditching WebOS for Android though. It is so much slower on the same hardware and it does not have the many well-thought out features of WebOS. Although Android seems endlessly customizable, it doesn't have the simplicity, task-oriented elegance, and utility like WebOS. I had to spend hours and hours in the Android market to tweak my phone into a usable state performance wise, and then there's the many more days of searching for apps that will not slow down my phone too much and get the job done. And then there's the random restarts and glitchy app performance, I can go on and on. Google also has a habit of not updating their system on phones that came out more than a year ago, so you would buy a new phone instead of getting updated software and performance. Apple and WebOS both update all their devices to their maximum hardware capacity. They don't try to rip you off by forcing you to buy a new phone.If you ever wonder why Android phones have much better specs with half the fluidity of Apple devices, that's because Google made it a game for phone manufactures to raise their specs like crazy, while the true problem is the Android system.For years I've always kept a WebOS device, an Apple device, and an Android device with me. You can easily tell which companies truly care about their customers, which company just wants you to think your phone is a piece of crap and buy a new one as soon as possible.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's from the future!

Maybe they should have lowered the price some, instead of bailing out, but I'm so glad I got this for what I did.  My wife got a Xoom and I got the Touchpad.  I would cry if I had to trade with her.

I know Android can be installed but I just don't want to.Edit: 1/29/2012 Still loving my Touchpad!  HP still does updates to WebOs and this makes it better.  The App catalog keeps growing and I have no problems with the ones I purchase or get for free.  This device should have not been discontinued.  I have had to clean the screen some but nothing like the Xoom.  I tried Android but deleted it because of some problems and I really love WebOs and now clean and slick is is.

This thing has been something I have never regreted getting.  I have a dual boot configuration but I still seldom boot to Android.  My phone is a Samsung Vibrant Galaxy S1 and I still love using it after two years.  I'm getting a Kindle for Christmas but the Touchpad is hands down the best thing to read on.  I purchase apps from the Webos store regularly to do my part to keep the operating system app world alive.  All the Apps I have downloaded free or paid for have been nothing short of amazing.  Watching movies on the Touchpad is awesome too.  There is an app for that and I bought it to be able to watch just about any video format available.  I have the Touchstone charger and the Custom Case both of which have just added to my enjoyment of this device.  The Touchstone makes it sooooo easy to keep my Touchpad charged and is a great place to set the Touchpad when I'm not using it as it does not charge in every position.  I love this as it is not good to continue to charge your battery due to the heat.  A top off is best to make these batteries last longer.  The Custom Case looks cool, protects the screen, and keeps finger prints off the back.  I'm sure I will be writing an update after two years.

The 3.04 updates and Prewares made it even better. It's fast, handle multiple tasks effortlessly, gorgeous resolution screen, solidly constructed, and almost the feel and weight of ipad 1. What really sold me on the tablet is the excellent integration of various services I use on daily basis like Facebook, emails, Skype, news etc. I can pick up my Touchpad and notified of all these services in just one place without logging into each of them separately. It also comes with built in app that provide read capability of Microsoft documents and pdf. The card interface is fun and easy to use. It's something one has to experience to appreciate. The integration also brings all my FB photos and Skype contact in one place. Almost forgot of 50gb of free cloud space that came with the Touchpad through Box.net.

I was looking for something affordable, but high quality. My original plan was to get the Kindle Fire and I even had added it to my shopping cart here on Amazon. However, I hesitated because of some of the limitations on the Fire that I wasn't thrilled about.I had heard of the Touchpad, but I hadn't really even considered it because I knew that it had been discontinued. However, I started reading up on it on here and on other sites around the web. I found out that WebOS did have a few of the apps that I had to have and that I could easily install Android and boot back and forth between WebOS and android. So I decided to go with the Touchpad, despite some negative reviews.I got it in the mail about two weeks ago, and I am extremely impressed! WebOS is an incredible OS and it is so intuitive. It is very user friendly and if it had more apps, I would probably rarely switch over to Android. It is very fast and the apps that it does have are very high quality and easy to use.WebOS has a pretty strong developing community and there are a lot of patches and apps that you can install through \"preware\" and it will have the Touchpad flying within a few minutes.I did install Android, and I boot into it a couple of times per day. It works great and gives me access to nearly all of the apps in the Appstore and that is a huge plus. Its great too because you can switch back and forth between Android and WebOS anytime you want with just a couple of taps on the screen and a reboot.Honestly, the only negatives I have had so far is the lack of apps, but even that is mitigated by having Android. I spend most of my time on WebOS though anyway because I like the web browser more than the one in Android and because it just feels more polished and  high quality.Since I have bought the Touchpad, I think I have only fully charged my Laptop once or twice, and that was too take a couple of my Law School final exams.Anyone who is on the fence about this, get off and buy it. You probably won't regret it, unless you don't want to install android and need a ton of apps. I don't regret this choice at all, and for the price, you won't find a better tablet!

Glad I did. I wanted it because over the years I have had nothing but positive experiences with HP, I wanted a flash enabled tablet, and I was ok with the amount of apps out, and was (and am) hopefuly more would still be produced.First the tablet performance is remarkably good, and WebOS is a simply a wonderful tablet operating system easily rivaling Apple. WebOS uses 'cards'. An application starts up. You can then minimize it and it looks like an index card on the screen. You can keep a lot of cards open and go back to them whenever wanted. Or you can close the app by swiping up and it whoooses off the screen.I have played with Ipads 1 and 2 and the Touchpad is speedy. I also like the integrated search function. You type someone's name for instance and it will look through email, facebook, skype, and everything else on the touchpad. When I added facebook accounts, I liked that all my pictures and videos were available not only through the facebook app but with the picture and video app.I have had good luck with Amazon video on demand and Amazon cloud player works fine. Amazing screen, better than the Ipad 2. HD videos from Amazon look fantastic. Also an improvement over Ipad are the speakers. Clearly MUCH better. Brings a new dimension to video watching and game playing. The trade off though is a heavier and slightly bulkier machine. After enjoying the Touchpad, it is a trade off I am happy with.As for games. I have Gamelofts Ashphalt 6 HD. Awesome. Works great, looks fantastic, and sounds booming. Obviously the big downside to the Touchpad are apps. No question an Ipad blows the Touchpad away with apps. Now a much fuller and enjoyable browsing experience makes up for this quite a lot. But I will not lie that my Iphone has apps I can only wish for now on the Touchpad. But I am happy I bought it. Quick Office allows you now to create and edit word and excel documents. You can also easily display PDF. It actually makes the Touchpad a workable solution for an almost work machine on vaction for at least my needs.I also like the Box app. 50 free GB of virtual storage. The virtual keyboard is usable and nice. Overall the Touchpad is a simply excellent piece of technology caught up in the bizzaro world of IPad domiance. The IPad is also a great machine. If the Touchpad had a quarter of the Apps of the Ipad I would take the Touchpad without hesitation striaght up same price.

While it has plenty of room for improvement it is a pretty incredible device in its own rite. I have had my Touchpad for a week now and all I can say is wow. The thing absolutley blows away my old iPad in terms of ease of use and functionality (as far as webOS vs iOS there is no comparison). The only place where the reviewers accurately report is the lack of apps. I was very dissapointed that the Kindle app is just a placeholder (not cool). But considering that the iPad only had 300 tablet optimized apps at its launch I'm willing to be a little patient. Here are the things I love about the Touchpad: Intuitive and natural feeling UI,  Notification system, REAL multi-tasking, REAL internet browser, Synergy, Touchstone wireless charging dock, a USB interface (not some proprietary connection no one else uses), Exhibition mode, awesome Facebook app (better than Facebooks site), Beautiful screen, Video conferencing out-of-the-box. I really wish that reviewers would just stop with the 'iPad Killer' comparisons. Honestly, the tablet market is so new and despite their geeky Highlander view of 'There can be only one', there really is room for competition.

Sure, the app selection was always more limited, and all app development certainly fell off quickly when the tablet was discontinued, but part of what made this device so good (in addition to its unique and intuitive operating system--WebOS) was its Flash support. You didn't need (and still don't need) app workarounds for the Web content you wanted to access. The device accessed the Web--not scaled-down app or mobile versions of the Web.Despite what others have said, this tablet could serve as a decent laptop replacement; I used the case stand and Bluetooth keyboard to that effect.In terms of a normal mobile device lifecycle, today, this tablet's specs show their age, sure. And there are plenty of newer, fully supported, and cheaper places to put your tech dollar. This was a steal at the $150 firesale price; I got two--the second one is also still in use. Unless you're interested in WebOS specifically, there doesn't seem to be a reason to buy these tablets today at reseller prices that are more than 100% higher than those firesale prices, and then being disappointed when they don't have the speed and app variety expected of a new device running a current OS, like iOS or Android.

My first ever tablet, and although I had to do a LOT of work to get it at the fire sale price it is worth much more than the $110 I paid for it - Bought demo model from Wal-Mart.2. Screen is gorgeous - and plays HD video beautifully - Vibrant colors and smooth textures - really nice!3. Wonderful email integration - I have 2 yahoo and 1 Hotmail accounts set up on it, and contrary to what someone said, it does show all of my folders for each of my Yahoo accounts - all of the MAIN folders in Hotmail4. I like how instead of relying on apps, you can bookmark any website and/or drag an icon of it to the launcher - tap on it, and you are taken to the FULL website, not a limited mobile site.5. I dig the cards, but certainly wish I could make them smaller and dock several of them (non-overlapping) on the screen at the same time, and then tap on the one I want to open.6. Gorgeous piano black color - feels sturdy - looks a little bulky, but does not feel too heavy7. Sound quality is the best I have heard on a tablet - really - the speakers on this thing are of great quality - better than the speakers on both my HP and Apple laptops.8. Full keyboard - that comes in three sizes - best keyboard I have seen on a tablet - although that auto correct can be a beast sometimes.9. A very proud and active WebOS community, the members of which are generally eager to help new users get acclimated to their beloved Touchpad.  Just do not go there praising the Android install in the TP.  \u00ba10. Notifications - comes across in a small banner in the upper right-hand corner. You just swipe them one at a time to reveal the next one - or one large swipe to just remove them at the same time.11. Long battery life!12. Text is very clear on this thing.13. It loads pages pretty quickly, but that depends a great deal on your Internet connection speed ~ lots of information out there about increasing processor speed. There are some who have said that the TP is deliberately shipped under-clocked.14. Very responsive touch screen.15. Closing a task / window - yip, you just swipe it away - and there is nothing still running in the background taking up resources that you have to force quit or anything like that.  Sometimes you can get the launch and weeeeeeeeee Angry Birds sound when you do that.  Just a head\u00a1\u00a6s up, so it does not creep you out the first time you hear it.16. WebOS loyalist will not like this, but dual boot in Android - The reality is that as smooth -easy - and enjoyable as WebOS is, it really cannot meet the needs of a lot of people. But I think it is not a retraction, rather another strong point that the TP actually gives you the option to choose which operating system you want to use! That is great flexibility17. You know, before last week, I had not powered on my tablet in months. I turned my technology fascination towards Onkyo receivers and Bic America speakers - Anyway, I powered up the TP, still trying to decide if I should sell it - simply because I do not use it very much - played around with it in Android for a couple of days - and then powered up in WebOS, where it has been ever since. When I see my WebOS screen, I just smile - Using this always just makes me smile. And what the HP TP lacks does not matter, until I want to read a BN book, and then I just boot into Android and read my Nook books - or grab my Nook Simple Touch or the HTC. I swear that pages look so much clearer to me in WebOS - than they do in Android on the TP. I have never mentioned it before, because folks will say that there is no way - Well, it has always appeared that way to me - and I am sticking to that!18. And yes, there is the true multitasking that a lot of WebOS fans like to tout as being a tablet innovation not yet implemented on the iPad.  Some others will say that since several software developers left HP to work on ICS, you can see some similarities between the two.  Well, you can see what WebOS on the Tablet was going to be.19. I am sure that I am forgetting a lot - but overall a great option for what I do - very basic web browsing basic web browsing, e-reading, checking emails, sometimes listening to music.Cons1. It is made by HP, which set it up for failure pre-release - (a) no intention of supporting it (b) priced way too high. I think this was originally $5992. Build quality issue - If you have not heard - the TP is VERY prone to developing stress fractures around the speakers - and USB port. It does not make a difference if you use it in a case or not. And before someone says it does make a difference - NO IT DOES NOT! I have had mine in a case from day one - I have never dropped it - and as months passed and that \"Cracked by the Speaker\" thread at WebOSnation grew longer and longer and I did not develop a crack by the speakers, I thought it was because others did not have a case or the right case. Well, one day, I decided to take mine out of the case and cross my fingers while I looked for cracks near the speaker.  I did not find any there, but I certainly had two; one on either side of the USB port. Many people have chosen to ignore it, saying it has not interfered with the performance of their TP - they generally have the crack by the speakers. Some have used glue.  Because of the location of mine, I am not so sure I want to risk using glue on it.  I might send mine in, but I have not decided if it is worth it. I did have a charging problem for 24 hours this past weekend. I cannot say for certain if it was due to these cracks.3. I tell ya, that browser can be tricky at times - Yes, there have been times when I just could not log into certain accounts - My webOSnation account being one of them. I decided to check after I typed that sentence, and I did get in fine. I also have never had any trouble logging into my credit card or credit union accounts. I am sure I downloaded some Preware patch many months ago that fixed some of the browsing annoyances. I have to say that some of those annoyances, I experience on my HTC as well. Ummm, try to adjust the volume on a YouTube video on the TP - and you will not have a pleasant time! It does not scroll well within windows. For example, if you write a review here, and then you try to edit it, a text box with your review will pop up. It may be difficult to scroll to a certain point to edit your review. It becomes easier to scroll once you bring up the keyboard.4. Speaking of which, as I am here editing this using my TP, I am reminded that the keyboard I love so much has no arrow keys. So, you have to get to the exact point where you want to make corrections, and then tap - hoping you got that right space - then make your correction. Often, I miss, and find myself deleting at least parts of other words and retyping.  PAIN IN THE \u00a1K.5. Love the card view format, but wish there were viewing options. Someone created a patch that allows the cards to be larger, but stacked closer together so that you can have more of them on the same screen. I liked the closer, but not the larger part.6. Never thought I would say this, but lack of interesting apps - and for me - by interesting I mean Barnes and Nobel Nook app! For other people, things may be more serious -7. If I am not mistaken, HP is not even going to support the TP through the open source project8. Text is clear, but looks more gray than black - I wish I had a way to correct this.9. I cannot play yahoo games on it - but I cannot on my HTC either. One person in the forums insisted it was possible, but then no matter how many times I asked him for instructions on how to do it, he never provided any - FRAUD! I know I need Java and I have tried to download it, but it has never worked for me. Anyone who has any ideas, please share.10. That accelerometer is very very sensitive, sneeze and the thing reorients itself. Good think you can lock she screen.11. Colors of built-in programs - the music player / chat/ Facebook/ mail are all in these institution light blue and gray - Ehh! PLEASE if someone knows how to change the colors, say something. Hideous!12. WARNING - wear shades if you want to operate this outside on a sunny day - or you will hurt yourself!  PAINWhat I have not really tried/ So So1. Bluetooth - only once -can't remember what for - but it worked fine. I have not tried it with my HP printer.2. Document editing3. Graphics intensive gaming - Tried some game that I did not understand and then left it alone4. Ummm - the camera - really? It has no view finder -.... well, I know some people still take pics with it anyway - Have not tried Skype either -5. Facebook App - not too bad - but add in an overzealous auto correct function and a finicky browser, which has trouble managing windows within windows, and you get pure frustration sometimes.6. Messaging7. Memos8. Maps - Ok, decided to just try it - very very nice - I had no idea!9. Quick Office \u00a1V just decided to try this the day after I originally posted this review.  I emailed a Word, Excel, and PowerPoint document to myself.  It opened all three and I was able to edit the Word and Excel document.  I do not know if I am supposed to be able to edit a PowerPoint doc or not.  I just created it to see what would happen \u00a1Vand I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could open and edit any of these.  I have never had a reason to try this out before.I am not really feeling HP right now, but I have to say that if they were to make a more complete WebOS tablet, which they completely supported - in a smaller body - (I am now looking at the Samsung 8.9 for no other reason than size) I would buy it. I do like the TP and WebOS that much! Trust - it can be both fun and frustrating - but that will depend on your tech knowledge - what you want to do with it - and how willing/interested you are to turn to the home-brew community to get the things that are \"missing,\" and or to Android. I do know some people by this simply to install Android - and have one hell of a 10 inch table with specs that would cost much more on an actual Android tablet.Interestingly, I came here to edit this review, and when I opened the edit window using my new MacBook Pro \u00a1V I could not navigate properly within that window.  Every time I scrolled to a particular place and began typing, the cursor jumped to nearly the bottom of the page.  I tried multiple times, and so I turned to \u00a1V of all things \u00a1V my TP to edit this review.  And that, costing 1/12 of the Mac \u00a1V worked pretty well, although it was not easy.  Then I got toward the end of the \u00a1\u00a7What I have not\u00a1K.,\u00a1\u00a8 section, and the TP \u00a1V quite predictably \u00a1V stopped allowing me to scroll.  This is the problem that I mentioned earlier. I had to finalize this review on my desktop.Now, that the TP has a problem scrolling properly in windows is something I can understand, but the MAC?  This leads me to believe what I thought all along, that it is some sort of settings issue.  Once again, if there are informed folks out there who can help me out with either, give a shout out.Enjoy your new TP!", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Who Knew?

(5 Stars for that)In all the years I have used windows, since old dos, has windows done anything to improve our experience, other than making what was once familiar a new found challenge?  This devise needs only a couple of buttons to use and is a lot like working with the one upgrade we like about windows, when they added tabs to our web browsers, only Hp refers to it as cards.New mail and facebook notifications show up whether using the devise or not and when a laptop is too much or simply not practical, my touchpad is perfect!!!I bought a case for it that spins and becomes a stand.  I don't use the stand very often, but for example; one of the first things I used it for, was to hand it to my wife in the kitchen to look up a recipe.  After she found what she wanted, she just sat it down like a poster-board cookbook.I leave the cards open I use the most & there's no power waste sitting next to my easy chair and with one touch it's instantly running..I'm a bit of a watchman so I keep the USGS global earthquake page up ([...]), Weather.com, My redbox.com account, my Multiply site,([...]) E-Bay etc and I use it to read the Bible for me when I don't feel like reading.  At Biblegateway.com, if you choose the King James version and hit the speaker below the book and chapter you choose, another interface will open which reads aloud.  You can do this on your computer as well, but with the Touchpad it's right there all of the time.  (I use Max McLean as the reader)  He's amazing!  He reads with a lot of feeling, fast enough that my reading experience has greatly improved.  I highly recommend giving him a listen..I use it a lot for Youtube as well.  It's the perfect size and even though HP offers a nearly unlimited supply of free downloads after this long I still haven't had any trouble with filling up the memory.  When you do find something that costs to own that you want, the software is so inexpensive, you won't mind buying a thing or two now and again.Pictures?  I'm not sure how it does it, but again with a single click of a button, everything you take a picture of or downlaod or have on facebook is right there all organized, perfectly.  It is truly an amazing devise, well worth the $$$ they are asking for them.My whole family uses mine.  I don't play video games but my son can't seem to put it down.  It gives you four tabs to store executable icons, so you can easily find, move and organize the functions and programs you choose to load on your machine.This is important as my son has downlaoded hundreds and hundreds of games and applications and I don't want to have to look through his cards to find my own.The web browser works like any other, with favorites, save-image etc with a single touch so there's really nothing much to learn to be up and running.I do not work for HP or any other associated entity.  I hate that and often wonder when I read a really good or really bad review, who it's really coming from.Ya know what I mean?Now the bad news...NO NETFLIX?????What's up with that???  I still haven't been able t find out why, when or anything that leads to thsi devise working with Netflix and no one seems to be doing anything about it.  Factually however. the truth is I don't need it to, as everywhere I am that I woudl watch Netflix already has a working netflix functioning devise with a larger screen there already.  So it's not the end-all disappointment.He is also still making software for this devise and sends out regular updates and letters.The available software is no different than anything android and it's a one button built-in click and your searching through the endless lists of free perfectly compatable software and games.  I haven't ever found an end or not found anything I was looking for.I should also mention I can access my netflix account and do all the things I may want to from there without encumbrance. As a matter of fact by searching with my touchpad at netflix I get unlimited pages of results instead of just 2 pages of results.

You cannot open PDF files from the web. It says \"MIME TYPE NOT SUPPORTED.\" Not sure what that means. If you want to transfer PDFs into your touchpad, then you have to save them onto your computer, then upload them to your BOX.net account, or enter USB mode then drag them into the device. There's no user interface like itunes. It's just like opening up a USB drive. You can make folders, but they only show up within their respective programs if you create them inside the program on the touchpad. I think that the touchpad just scans the entire device for file types, then puts them into music, adobe pdf reader, etc.The PDF reader does not let you skip to a page by number, but does have a drop down list from 1-last page. It takes a while to get to the page you want, but manageable. Also, there is no bookmarking or highlighting. Switching between pages is smooth like an Ipad. Zooming is more laggy, but heck, I don't really care about that much.Multitasking:This is essentially what makes the touchpad something worth buying. The button at the bottom of the device is essentially designed for multitasking. You can switch between cards, which is a brilliant system for a tablet computer. I don't know how multitasking works on the Android or Ipad, but this system is extremely easy to use, and convenient. Sometimes I'm checking my email on the browser, and want to google what a \"gene family\" is. Just switch cards, google the term, then switch back to my email card. Very easy.Speed:Applications are a bit slow to start. The card pops up from below the screen, then it shows a flashing icon for about 3-8 seconds. It doesn't bother me, but I can see it bothering other people who are used to click and go Ipad apps. Once you're in the app though, things run smoothly.The photo app also lags if you have more than 100 photos. You can't click anything on the screen, and have to wait for everything to load.Speakers:Very, very good speakers, with one drawback. There is a problem with the software in which the speakers sound like they're broken. I don't know what causes it, but a system restart (accessed through device settings) fixes it. Unfortunately, a system restart has sometimes results in a permanent USB mode screen, but that can be escaped through a forced shutoff (hold power and bottom key for 10 seconds).App Store:There seem to be a few hundred apps in the store, which is a small selection. Keep in mind that there's plenty of junk apps that contribute to the total number. I never understood why companies brag about the number of apps, not the quality of each one.Most of the apps that I even considered buying were in the $10 range. None of the free apps are useful, with a few exceptions. You can get angry birds HD for free as a game, but other than that there are few useful apps. The Box.net app is useful for PDF transfer, and so is the Khan academy app, but most of the apps I wouldn't buy or download.Other problems:The rotation is a bit slow, and unresponsive at times. Not a huge problem though, since there is a rotation lock option at the top right.There is a sticky, unsticking noise whenever I press on the back of my touchpad. Scares me a little bit, but so far hasn't caused any trouble.When typing stuff into the web, there isn't a delete all button. That means that after you finish googling something, you can't just hit that little \"x\" on an Ipad or ipod. You have to hold the backspace button on the virual keyboard. A little annoying, but they might fix it in a WebOS update. Unless that feature is patented, in which case they won't.There are some software bugs where the sound from a card(application) continues even after you swipe it off the screen. The only solution is to wait for the audio to end, or restart the touchpad.Webcam is all right. Some people say it's crap, but I think it's fine.No expandable memory. Not a huge problem for me, since I just want to read PDFs and view a few pictures for artistic reference. I don't intend on putting any movies or video on it.The email application doesn't recognize my university email. Not huge though, since I can just use the web browser. Good thing flash is supported.The Adobe PDF app doesn't have folders or anything. So you just have all your PDF files in one mess. I like to organize my stuff into \"Art, programming, chemistry,\" etc.The two speakers lie on the left side of the device. It's kinda awkward this way when listening to music  with the device upright, but I guess it's a better design for watching movies.Good things:Battery life is around 8 hours. Very nice.Web browsing is pretty smooth.

Handy, compact - what's not to like?  I started off with various netbooks, tablets and convertible tablet/notebooks.  I think I went through about 10 of them.  I couldn't afford the iPad (my son recommended HIGHLY the iPad), so I tried the lower priced alternatives.The generic Android tablets generally available are not worth wasting your money on - and you would be WASTING your money.  They are very slow, limited and the Wi-Fi sensitivity is pitiful.  Not only that, but who do you call if you have technical problems??  I had one that worked great (if SSLLLOOOOOWWWWWW) up until it was plugged in to be recharged (not the first charge, either) and it simply died.  Who to call?  I don't know.  Who made it?  I don't know.  I COULD have purchased an iPad with the money I spent on all of the 'lower priced' tablets I bought!At Best Buy, I saw a tablet (don't remember which brand) that was sleek, fast and (fairly) affordable.  I figured I would get that one when I had the $400.I had heard about the TouchPad, and I am a long-time HP customer (I will ONLY use HP printers) so I started looking into getting one of those.One day, I saw a 'brand new, sealed, 32GB TouchPad' advertised on Craig's List for an unbelievably cheap price.  I called immediately.  It was legit!  I didn't realize I was getting snookered - I hadn't heard about HP practically giving them away.  Anyway, I met the young man, and it was as he said - genuine, brand new, still sealed.  I bought it!  I wasn't even particularly upset when I found I could have purchased it directly from HP for half of what I spent.  It was still a good deal.The only drawbacks (in my opinion) are the applications available.  You can't just download some off of the 'net, you have to get them through HP marketplace.  OK, there are a LOT of free apps, and I wanted the tablet mainly to check email, auctions and mostly, to show off my pictures.  The screen size is marvelous for showing pictures.  You can use the 'stretch and pinch' to enlarge or shrink photos/web pages. The battery life is good - only problem with the battery and charging is that it takes 2.1A to charge, and 'generic' chargers WON'T work.  It HAS to be a charger that has output of 2.1A (2100mA) at the MINIMUM.  You can use one that has a higher output, but not lower.I immediately purchased the accidental damage coverage offered by HP - for $49, it was a bargain, in my opinion.  It has already paid for itself.  I apparently cracked the housing somehow, and HP arranged for me to send the tablet to them, they replaced the housing (and corrected another minor problem I was having with charging the tablet) and had it back to me within a week.I dearly LOVE my HP TouchPad, and highly recommend it!  If you are enamored of the Android OS, there is an Android OS that can be used on the TouchPad, either stand alone or dual boot.  OH, make SURE to get a case for it (NOT the HP one - that one is horrid) and a screen protector.

It's painless and easy moving files around from PC to cloud to Touchpad or vice versa.Cons:-Skype call video quality: I'm not sure if there will be some sort of patch that will improve this. There is a bit of lagging, although the audio doesn't really cut off, you do have choppy video.-Apps: Few apps in WebOS, but this was to be expected. Assuming developers remain hard at work on getting Android onto this, the tablet will be more than a steal at the firesale prices.-Only one Camera- The camera is okay considering it's not really meant for much more than simple video calling, but it's still pretty weak, and only one is installed.Overall, the touchpad is a steal and everyone knows it.

It is refined. It does some common, basic things beautifully, unlike the others - be they android or iPad. The rest - Facebook, Kindle, thousands of apps - they will happen, but its the core device that I truly like. If the core device is rough, no amount of apps can fix that fundamental goof.(Unlike the iPad, which, 18 months after launch, Still has: No replaceable batteries, no flash, no stereo speakers, no stereo microphones, no multitasking, no rubberised back side for a firm grip.Great pitching, though. Probably the same people who sold pet rocks).Anyway, coming back to the Touchpad, what is more elegant? What is more refined?1. The very first thing is the charging system. The Touchpad charges very simply; you just slide it it into its dock. You slip it in, it charges. Like Apple says, it just works. No futzing with wires, jacks and other crude methods that have not changed in the past fifty years. Even the big Kahuna, the ipad, has a wire that you turn this way and that, trying to ram it into the socket one way or the other. With the Touchpad, you simply slip it into the stand, and you are done. ipad, Android, what have you - find the connector, find the wire, line them up, twist the wire around to be sure its aligned, re-twist it, push it in, twist again if you got it wrong....Is it that big a deal? Totally. When you have to charge it every couple of days, fumbling with wires and jacks gets boring really fast. (How do I know? From trying to charge my wife's ipad and failing half the time because the socket never really fitted right.)2. Notifications. If you get an email in the middle of reading a webpage, for example, The iPad interrupts whatever you are doing, and blares out the notification right in the middle of the screen, right in your face - as if I would miss it if was done quietly off to the side. The Touchpad is far more refined - the notifications come up on the top. If it is an email, it will update in the background, and if the tablet is sleeping, the home button gently glows. The iPad/Androids are crude in comparison.Is this a big deal? Once again, to me, yes it is. When I am reading a book, the last thing I want is to be interrupted by a BIG notification blob in the middle of the page telling me I have got a text message. Say it quietly on the side - and I will get to it.3. Apps handling. How on earth can you even deal with the primitive way apps are handled in current tablets? To open one app, you have to close the other. Its like having to lock your bedroom before you go to the bathroom. Then lock the bathroom when you get back to the bedroom. I like leaving the rooms in my house open, so I can walk about them freely. I like leaving apps open, going from one to the other effortlessly. Does Apple seriously want anyone to believe that their way - one app at a time - is a good way to run multiple apps? And the more apps there are, the more you have to do the shut/open routine. Whats the use of a million apps if, to use one, you have to shut down the previous one?Not to say that the Touchpad has its shortcomings. The software needs some more work, the screen rotation could use a bit of tweaking (update July 2nd - screen rotation seems to have worked itself out today - works well now), it could lose a bit of weight. But the way I see it is that the engineers who worked on the Touchpad had real focus on refinement and attention to detail. If that attitude persists, they will get there in a bit. The Android crew are all about getting a boatload of stuff out the door. And Apple is about incredible marketing, and selling their kool-aid. I wish their attention to detail was as refined as their attention to marketing.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 stars product, beat ipad in web browsing", "Author": "Shih Wang \"Charles\"", "ReviewID": "R3H31IBYTW7IKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HP tablet is better than people think.

The WebOS is an amazing system with some very innovative controls, making multitasking much easier with the card display style and the 'swipe to exit' command. The OS itself also supports flash to the fullest extent, even better than Android.The really sad thing is that WebOS is no longer being developed or supported, so you probably won't be able to see any recent apps becoming available on the platform. But the good things is that you can dual boot! With a little bit of computer knowledge you can easily install Android on this table, so when you turn your device on you can choose to boot into either WebOS or Android. Lack of apps? Problem Solved!Physically this device feels a bit heavier and not as solid as other competitors, especially with the plastic cover. The speakers on this device is just spectacular, delivering natural sound at a booming volume, even better than my laptop. In terms of battery life, this thing is just as advertised, I've done watching many anime and movies on this thing and for every half an hour of video playback only around 5% of the battery is consumed, meaning an estimate of 10 full hours of video back to back in a full charge. I've also done dropping this thing multiple times on the ground before (swung it out of my hand, flew into midair, did a few flips, lands face down onto the cement floor), thought it was a goner for sure, but with the cheap case protector that I applied this thing came out only with a small scratch, no internal damage what so ever, was really suprised.This review is written with my full year of actual experience with this product, if you want an affordable tablet without compromising the performance, this is it!", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots of fun for modders", "Author": "Rayman81", "ReviewID": "R2F8CKCM24OJM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own or have owned a Ipad 2 and Asus Transformer just for a little background.I received my 32gb a couple days ago and have been hooked to it ever since.I don't really recommend it to people who aren't willing to install preware and do a little modification to it..

The point being, it was all there just waiting to get out and realize it's potential. The Preware community just released the latest kernel that lets you overclock to 1.7 ghz. That's pretty nice and with the Govnah app gives you a level of control over your processor that I haven't seen with Android and iOS. Many thanks for the hard work.The only two things that I would have liked is an expandable memory slot and mini HDMI output.I did get mine in the fire sale and as has been stated this would be a great value at $250.

Now, I'm a current WebOS user with the Palm Pixi+ for Verizon and so this was a a natural upgrade for me - WebOS simply is a fresh take on mobile OS that works. With the recent WebOS 3.0.4 updates, the touchpad is running even better. At the price I paid for the touchpad, no other tablets beat it in terms of performance and capabilities.

The install for cyanogenmod was also quite easy, and I love being able to dual boot into webos if I need to (which I haven't).Overall, I got this tablet for the discount price of 150.00. I would not recommend paying more than 250.00 for this, but for either of those prices, you get a whole lot of value for the cost.

The first thing I noticed, as I have known and expected, is that it is a bit more bulky and heavy than the lightest of the bunch -- i.e., Ipad2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. I got the HP cover and it fits the Touchpad very well and this bypasses the problem of the \"finger print magnet\" - which it is if you don't have a cover. I'm a middle aged guy and I'm really not all that into these \"apps\" and therefore, owning the Touchpad is perfect. 99% of what I do is to surf the Net, listen to music, see photos, and check my email. Everything else is not all that critical to me. In this sense, it does pretty much everything I want quite well. I did overclock it to 1.5 and it works fast enough for me.A couple of \"it might have been better if..\" comments: Purely from an aesthetic point of view, when you \"pinch\" to resize -- increase of decrease -- the page, there is simply nothing that compares to the perfection the Ipad or Ipod in terms of the smoothness of transition. The Touchpad is a still a step better than the Andriod tablets. The other thing is the way the contact is made between your finger and the screen. On the Touchpad, you are touching a very specific single point and it shows by a ripple-like image at the moment of touch. Personally, this is a bit distracting for me as if I have to work harder to hit just the right place. On the Ipad, you simple touch an \"area\" like a hyperlink and it feels you have to just hit a general area. It feels more \"lazy\" and simpler.Other than that, I like my user experience of the Touchpad quite a bit. I like the WebOS more than the Android from purely an experiential and aesthetic point of view.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "M.

We've been trying everything on it in everyway we can think of.  If all you want is a great web browsing tablet, great email reader, and a good picture/video viewer, the the Touchpad is good.  But if you want anything else at all out of a tablet, then pay the extra money for a tablet with an app selection and a future.A few specifics:Pros:1. Great web browsing, with ability to have multiple windows open and running at same time.  Although only viewing one at time - switching back and forth in a tab-like fashion is great.  Actually, the multi-taskability this tablet is very nice compared to iProducts.2. Synchronized email reading is superb.  You have all access to all your email accounts in one screen!3. Very nice screen quality for picture viewing and video watching.  Although it adds in \"dead\" photos sometimes which you have delete to stop it from constantly trying to load them as thumbnails.4. A digital picture frame this size and quality would cost you have $100, so for a bit more than twice the price you do get more than twice the fun and function.5. I like the interface layout better than both Android products and iProducts.Cons:1. The obvious - no downloadable app selection at all.  It's even worse than either of us thought it would be.  And the vast majority of them are really for Palm anyway - and so show up as a small Palm size image in the middle of the Touchpad screen.  If apps are at all part of your consideration, remove them completely from your mind when deciding to buy this or not.  They are NOT a factor. You'll just do all your \"app stuff\" on-line.2. As for pre-installed apps:  the pdf reader can not read pdfs converted from URLs (although iProducts and all computers can), and the QuickOffice - although it does have edit functionality for Word and Excel files, is a bit buggy when it comes to opening files from different sources (esp. Dropbox).2. Calendar would be okay if it had a to-do list or no-time option so one can fake a to do list.  The Palm calendars are far superior.  Why HP would have skimped on this I have no idea!3. Only has low quality front side camera.4. Others have said how fast it is, but I find it frustratingly slow.  Maybe I have a lemon, but it takes way longer for this Tablet to get files from btoh Box and Dropbox, and to open up attachment from an email than it does the exact same files on an iProduct, PC desktop, or PC laptop.  I mean way way way longer!4. No future.  For only $200 more you can have a Galaxy, and $300 more an iPad - both of which have superb app selections, a future of improvements and updates, and serious camera and video capabilities.This is a discontinued product, and for a reason.

How odd to kill off a product line less than two months after launching it.  How odd to lower the price and have ALL of them sell out in just a couple of days (worldwide).  How odd to then announce that they will restart the factory for just one more very limited run even though every unit is supposed to be a money loser.  How odd to be an HP stockholder or Board member at this time.Perhaps they should have followed the model of the razor companies who for years have used a strategy of giving away the handles, but making big profits on the blades.  Some say that HP's printer division could give away the printers and still make big profits on the ink cartridges.  Well, perhaps they should have priced Touchpads way below the competition, sold millions of them, and made larger profits on the applications.  If someone really wants a particular application, I wonder how price-sensitive they would be at $0.99 vs. $1.99 vs. $3.99.When HP announced their end-of-August price reductions, I ordered one (through OnSale in the Amazon marketplace) and my order was eventually filled.Well, I just noticed that I have been billed twice - once by Amazon Marketplace and once by Erie Computers.This is mentioned just in case anyone else had the same thing happen, one really should scan their credit card statement carefully.  I certainly expect that one of the charges will be reversed.Meanwhile, the actual machine is quite delightful to use.  I don't think that I ever would have paid the original list price, but at the latest prices they were able to sell out the entire worldwide inventory.  That says something about the usability and popularity of the device, as well as the value.BTW, the preloaded version of WebOS had to be updated via WiFi, and the current version works much, much better.  So do not fail to update if you have a new Touchpad.There are various websites that may suggest additional modifications to the software, for those who are inclined to play around with the hardware.However, if you find only a few good uses for this tablet in your life, you really should not care much about future updates since you can just stick with what works for you.  There is a Kindle e-reader app pre-loaded, and a web browser, and of course organizer tools such as a calendar.  Who needs thousands of apps?

All in one app.Support for Skype video chat is built right into the phone app. It still needs some optimization to improve the audio and video quality, even after the 3.0.2 update, but it works.Without an app I can run Hulu, Amazon Video on Demand, Wallmart Streaming Videos, iXL (math training site for kids), and any site that uses Flash (although complex Flash-based Facebook games from Zynga like Farmville and CafeWorld have not worked for me). I can configure it to automatically run the Flash or make it on-demand only. webOS gives me the CHOICE.Homebrew has overclocking kernals that boost the dual 1.2 Ghz snapdragon processors up to 1.5 Ghz and even 2.0 Ghz!Apps I miss:- Netflix- MS Office Editing (Picsel Office has a video on YouTube showing their product running on TouchPad, so we can't be too far away: [...]; and QuickOffice has recently tweeted \"Please stay tuned for editing in Quickoffice on the TouchPad :-)\"- SlingPlayer Mobile- Photo Retouching (there are some basic ones, but they are not powerful enough)Not a bad start for a tablet that has only been out for one month.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's all about WebOS", "Author": "A.

Then the iPad 2 came, but I did not buy it because I didnt see any reason to spend another $500.  I waited and waited, and then came the HP TouchPad, at a local brick and mortar store- which specializes in stationary items, for $200 off the MSRP coupled with manufacturer's coupon.  The offer appeared too good to pass.  I was surprised that even with such a discount, they had the product in stock.  I bought one and played with it for 3 days.  First and foremost, WebOS has a wonderful interface, but it is not supported by a worthy hardware.  The TouchPad looks and feels flimsy compared to the iPad.  It has an all plastic body, and is a finger magnet.  It can not even come close to the iPad when it comes to build quality and fit and finish.  Even though the OS is a welcome change from familiar Android (i have a galaxy phone)and iOS it is not polished.  The display panel, similar to iPad, lacks its brightness and crispness.  The webOS fonts looks washed out, unless zoomed in.  Something similar to windows fonts when you disable the 'clear-type' feature.  It also has a bluish- cool cast to the images compared to the warm tone of iPad.  I placed them side by side, and loaded similar web-sites and to my dismay, iPad seems to load pages faster at times- but the most striking fact was that similar sites when loaed on the TouchPad, showed pages loaded incorrectly, with bits and pieces missing, I even noticed some tabs on web pages missing on the TouchPad...!!!! Now that's unacceptable.  Things were not much different in landscape mode, but the fonts appeared better.  Youtube videos were hit or miss.  Sometimes it will play fine, sometimes it will take forever to load and then it would miss audio completely.  Frustrating....!!!  The speakers were loud, and sounded better, but were inconsistent throughout.  It was hardly audible on some videos(On Youtube) and just enough on others.  i tried headphones too..with not much better result.  Compare that to iPad, where I can't crank the volume up all the way with my headphones- it gets too loud!!!!Then there was the deal breaker, the battery life.  The TouchPad battery life is not good enough.  I had the brightness set half way but the battery would drop 15-20% IN JUST ABOUT AN HOUR OF USE...!!!!!!  iPad seems to run forever..I mean this thing if you are using it for couple of hours a day for normal browsing and stuff, would only need charging once a week...!!!! Apple definitely has a huge edge here, nothing can match it.Finally multi-tasking, HP is better.  You can simply stack up the tasks and move from one to another with ease.  The dual core processor is simply outstanding.  On iPad, you double click on the home button and can switch between tasks, but it slows it down.  But my question is, whats the use of multitasking- if you are only doing half baked tasks..!!!!!?????I really wanted to like it, but it's not ready for prime time.  Not for the price.  I was surprised to see positive glowing reviews from Amazon customers, when I bought it.  As I logged back in today to leave a review, I see Amazon message that the product is under review, coupled with the news that another brick and mortar store dealing with electronics has an unsold shipment of 90% of the inventory- I'm convinced HP has a loser here.  If this review can save couple of hundred dollars of my fellow Amazon shoppers, I would be glad to do my part.  I got my money back, make sure you don't lose yours.  Those of us who are happy with the product, I hope stay happier, because HP is about to pull the plug on this one.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touchpad holds my world!", "Author": "KSev 83", "ReviewID": "R14CJ2QLID2HZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where do I begin?

With the numerals and symbols you need to log into almost anything! No crazy shifting to add a numeral. And, glory, there is a tab key as well. On the keyboard icon, hold a finger on there and the four keyboard size options are presented!And this is definitely the best Facebook app ever.The possibilities are limitless, too!

This was my primary reason for purchasing a Touchpad and I have not been disappointed.  webOS is the best OS available on any portable device.  However, the absence of a calculator or camera app is very disappointing - both of these apps are on the Pre and it doesn't make sense that they are not on the TP.  Also, the inability to print to a non-HP printer is crazy.  I hope this limitation is removed in the future.  I'm not into having hundreds of useless apps so the limited number available is no big deal.  I've paired my Pre and TP via Bluetooth and have the ability to receive phone calls and text on the TP - it works great.  Although the TP is not perfect, I am happy with its overall performance.  Unfortunately, the TP lacks broad appeal and HP got a late start on getting into the arena; and I don't believe it will come close to competing with other tablets.

I've been using it for the past 3 days and it's so cool I don't want to put it down.The webOS is so smooth. I was holding off a while to get a tablet, but I finally dove in since I really liked webOS on my phone and I didn't want to miss an opportunity to have a webOS tablet.I must say that being an owner of both HP/Palm and Apple devices, they both have good attributes.  Apple makes very high quality hardware and it shows with their products.  I will agree that the materials of an iPad are 2nd to none, but HP has come a long way and the quality of their hardware and its on par with their business laptops.  As far as Oss', webOS is a far superior OS than IOS.  It's smoother, it allows true multitasking.  It's truly an elegant experience.Apps Apps Apps.  That's all anyone talks about these days.  I've heard all the complaints about how webOS doesn't have any apps. How Android and IOS own the app ecosystem.  While webOS doesn't have anywhere near the apps as those two, but they have a good amount and more importantly, they have almost all of the apps I want.  How many difference apps do most of you actually use on adaily basis?  I can only think a few they don't have that I want, and if people would stick with webOS, it would only a matter of time before they were released.For those of you who have ever owned a webOS phone, you will be shocked at how much nicer webOS is on this touchpad.  They made some great refinements and added new features on 3.0Pros:Very fastGreat browser with Flash!Multitasking Cards (one of the best parts of webOS)Beautiful screenBeats audio with full stereo speakersTouchstone (inductive charging is one of the best innovations that HP has - once you use it, you can't go back to the wires)HP says it is committed to keeping and improving webOS and the app catalog.Cons:Smallest app catalog of the threeHP claims to not be making any more devicesGood luck finding oneI am bummed that HP only gave the touchpad less than 2 months.  It was starting to gain traction with  marketing campaign as well as user reviews starting to see the true power of webOS.  They could have priced it a bit lower than the iPAD to build up its user base and get people to see how good it really is.  They also could have kept up with the hardware a little better, but in any event, hopefully a company that can bring hardware quicker to market will get on board.Now that HP has fire saled the rest of the touchpads, I hope enough people give their honest opinion about this OS.

I added the CyanogenMod/Android OS a few months after I purchased it. Primarily that is the system I use. However WEBOS does have advantages for certain applications, so I do boot it up that way occasionally.  When my TouchPad was about 11 months old, it \"bricked\" i.e. went to sleep and would not wake up.  This was common problem at the time; the Internet was full of complaints about this. None of the suggestions offered by other users worked for me.  I called the HP help line. The unit was still under warrantee. They arranged to pick it up and returned it less than a week later; no charge.  It has worked marvelously ever since.  I think it was a software issue, as the unit did not appear to have been opened up.  I also had an Ipad;  a good product too, but I found that I preferred the HP. It has a great screen, tons of memory, syncs perfectly with my HTC phone, and I can hook it up to my desktop to transfer all types of files.  It is unfortunate that HP could not make this product a success. IMPORTANT- HP has just notified owners that there is a necessary software update for the TouchPad.

Switching between different apps is easy.I've had no problems opening Word documents and .PDF files from email and on Web pages thus far.I like the built-in mail app, and the browser is good enough for the type of browsing that I tend to do (nothing fancy, a lot of Wikipedia articles, IMDB, etc.)The display is lovely - clear and sharp, and the colors are really rich.Great size.  It's not as thin or as light as other tablets, but to me it's got a nice, solid feel to it.  I don't worry about tossing it in my backpack and having it break.  Plus, when the thing dies completely, it will make a nice, solid paperweight.  :)The BadThe camera is sort of sucky, especially if you're looking to take a picture of something besides yourself thanks to the front facing camera.  The few pictures I did take with it were not very high quality - but since I primarily use my iPhone to take pictures, it's not a big issue for me.It's fairly slow to boot up, and if you let the battery run all the way down, just plug it in and forget about it for a while, because it will have to charge up for at least 15 minutes before I can use it again.  Even my laptop doesn't take that long if the battery discharges completely.Lack of applications - I guess I'm spoiled with my iPhone, where there are applications for everything, and more coming out all the time.  Since HP dumped the Touchpads from their lineup this isn't a surprise, but it's still a disappointment.  I would probably use it more with more apps.Last year when I got it, the battery would last for close to a week; granted, a lot of that was standby time, but still, really impressive.  Now it's down to 3 days.  That's still pretty good, but it makes me wonder about the longer term.  I haven't really used it much  the last few months, so it's spent a lot of time not being charged up - that may have something to do with it.My boyfriend had to get one of those charging stations where you just set the device on the station to charge it because the port in his became unusable.  He has used his Touchpad a lot more than I've used mine so has plugged/unplugged it a lot, so I wasn't surprised... but I've noticed the last couple of times that I've charged mine that I had to wiggle the charger around in the port a bit to get it to start charging.  This does not bode well.The UglyThe biggest issue I've faced with the Touchpad was frequent unresponsiveness.  This only seemed to affect two things - the keyboard and tapping on links in the browser - closing or launching an application never seemed to experience the same problem.  Of course, these are the two things I do most on the tablet, so it was a huge issue for me.  It would sometimes take several taps of a key or a link to get a response; if there was a physical keyboard, I'd be mashing down the keys!  This was extremely frustrating, and the main reason that the device has seen light use for most of the year since I got it.  I was seriously starting to think about jumping on the iPad bandwagon because of this (and the apps issue, too, but that was secondary).The ResolutionI resolved my two biggest complaints - the lack of apps and especially the lack of responsiveness in one fell swoop by installing Android on the device.  I have now installed on the Touchpad most of the apps I use most on my iPhone - well, the free apps at least, because I don't want to have to pay for them twice - and they all run fairly well, although some of them were clearly made for smaller smartphone displays, but this is something I can live with.And oh.... browsing the Web and using the keyboard are so much better now; the browser I'm using right now has crashed on me a couple of times - but there are several different browsers out there than I can try.  I can even type pretty well using two hands - not something I'd ever thought I could do on a glass screen, but the keyboard is now so responsive that I can type almost as quickly and as accurately as I can on a normal keyboard.I'll be honest... I didn't actually install Android on the Touchpad - my boyfriend did.  It did take him a couple of tries to initiate it, but once it got going, the installation went a lot faster than I thought it would.  I had no problems figuring out how to use the thing and download apps, and if I'm really nostalgic for HP OS, it is dual boot so I can take a visit back to Non-responseland whenever I want.I'm using the Touchpad a lot more now and am much happier with it.  The iPad jealousy that had reared it's ugly little head has subsided.  I'm still thinking about getting either an external keyboard or maybe even a netbook for taking notes in class, but that has to do more with wanting to type on a regular keyboard than the responsiveness of the Touchpad.Anyway, if any unsatisified Touchpad owners read this, please consider putting Android on it; it might save your relationship with it :)", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet when upgraded to Android", "Author": "Gerald Goupil", "ReviewID": "R16Y6YJC9EBAEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little bit heavy (equivalent to the first ipad), but works very good.

I bought it for several reasons:  I like WebOS (very disappointed that it has essentially been discontinued because it was a great operating system), I didn't want to deal with iTunes and I wanted a device that I could take with me to remote areas such as Africa.  My goal was to not have to take my laptop or worry that my laptop would be damaged or stolen.  The TP works extremely well for reading and responding to email, for surfing the web, for viewing downloaded photos (the camera is lousy), for Skype and for reading books.  It was especially great in Africa where the lighting was poor or non-existent at night.  A year later it still works well, battery life is still fine and I again brought it on a remote trip.  Some issues:  when the Internet is slow, the email download can be very slow and large files sometimes don't come through.  Some apps (for Word, Excel, pdf's) don't work as well as I would like - my guess is they are being updated on other platforms but not for the TP.  I have to reboot the device on occasion, to get the Internet to work better.  Depending on how heavily I use the TP, the reboot might be required every couple of days or once every week or two.  Given the good experience I've had with two TPs bought at two different times, I can't understand why some people seem to have so much trouble with it.  I should mention that the day I was to leave for Africa, my charger broke (it basically fell apart).  I rushed to Best Buy, which still had a TP display in the morning (it was the day the TP was discontinued), and they gave (!!) me a new one, which has worked fine ever since.  When I came home, I purchased an extra charger and a TP recharging stand (which I love).  I regularly use the TP to show people my photos, and love the fact that it's so easy to download anything from my computer using the USB cord.  I am giving the TP five stars because it has completely met my expectations.  HP, on the other hand, has not.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal.

Plug some speakers into it and your jammin!CONS:- Sometimes the touchscreen frezzes up while typing.- Sometimes when flipping the screen its slow to respond.- There is no 3/4g options for this, you need to buy a seperate mobile hotspot if you want to connect on the go and no wireless networks are available.- You can't view netflix on here (thats the worst part).OVERALL:I really like this tablet. The pricing is far better than most of the other tablets out there. I did quite a bit of research on tablets before I decided to buy this one and it is by far the best bang for your buck.

It is heavy, the camera is a joke, limited Apps, IE6-like browser, and WebOS is dead.Otherwise, the Touchpad is great. I got it when the sale price was hot. Upon receiving it, I was as happy as I was when I got the first iPad (which I no longer have). After the first week with it, I notice how useless, unpolished, and limited it was compared to even my iPhone. All the hardware inside is great, but nothing to take advantage of it. After a month, I barely used it anymore.The OS was slow. The browser stutters and lags. Playing video on the browser was limited to standard Youtube quality with jitters. The PDF reader had no resume or bookmarking feature, so reading books and manuals was impractical. The video player lacks good codec support, playlist, and could only resume one video at a time. The only thing it can do well is view picture, play MP3 loudly, and browse simple webpages.Few months went by and things started to get better. WebOS had an update, whaa =0 The OS overall runs smoother now and browsing webpages was more tolerable. I still cannot play 720p video, but regular SD quality was smooth. Flipping through webpage didn't stutter anymore. So fine, I can use it as an OK web browser.Now that WebOS is open source, people are trying to fix what should be there. The PDF reader now has auto resume and bookmark, and this was a big deal. Now I can carry loads of PDF books and textbook on the Touchpad, and it's a breeze to bring them out for reading. I have also set the overclocking to 1.7, which is about 130% of its normal speed. I do notice the speed difference, and the battery still holds up well for 1-2 days of moderate use. I can load up quite a few large PDF files 1000+ pages, 800MB+, and shuffle them in card view, with other stuff open. No problem!The two must have Apps are Advanced Browser and Kalemsoft player. Advanced Browser will help you browse better on the touchpad, and have better feature like tabs and quick access gestures. Kalemsoft player is for playing other codecs (.avi, .mkv, .mp4, etc.) and can resume on all videos, it is still in beta and VERY buggy, hold off on the purchase.The device also comes with 50GB of cloud storage using box.net, which became more useful than I thought. The speakers on this thing is better than most laptops I have used, and perhaps the best speakers you'll find in a tablet made in 2011. This is the best tablet OS you can get for comparing documents or books. The card interface comes in handy when you have to compare information side by side. Email, .doc, PDF, webpages, etc. can be swipe side by side in card view. iPad needs an App for that! However, WebOS is going to fall far behind as iOS and Android is getting polished substantially.The overall design, shape, texture, and hardware is better than the iPad 1. It is actually like having a giant iphone 3GS, which has a great shape. Holding the Touchpad is much easier than holding the iPad 1. Glass and plastic feels better than glass and aluminum, especially in cold weather. Since it is not as tall as the iPad, the Touchpad feels less likely to \"fall backward\", thus easier to hold. Imagine holding a square board and a rectangle board, the square board (Touchpad) is easier to hold. Overall, better grip. However, all the upcoming tablets will be far lighter. Example, the iPad 2 obviously beats the Touchpad design in all aspects.Final thoughts: few weeks ago, I was considering getting a small notebook, but after finding out how much the Touchpad has improved, I diverted my decision. The Touchpad maybe heavy, but it is still far lighter than many notebooks out there. With the Touchpad, I don't need to boot up, I can still multitask, use the internet, chat, and do all the little things. All with great battery life, even after maximum overclocking. For me, it easily replaces any ultra portable laptops out there in terms of value and convenience.Thanks to this Touchpad I will be holding off any purchases until Windows 8 Tablet comes out! If you got the Touchpad for 99/150 then it will help you realize if you need a better tablet later on or not. As of today, I believe the Touchpad should be worth about $250, but that will quickly change when the ICS tablet starts going mainstream and even less when Windows 8 Tablet appears. The Touchpad works okay for what it can do. I will continue to use it everyday until something revolutionary comes out.UPDATE (1/16/12): Patch 3.0.5 was released. Good to know HP is still supporting the Touchpad. It supposed to have small speed improvements. The Adobe Reader patches are not broken. I lost the ability to overclock, but that should be fixed soon. The Touchpad is still very usable without overclocking, I might not even needed actually.UPDATE (2/26/12): I was able to install Android ICS as a second OS on my touchpad. It is still in alpha, but the only thing that seems missing is browser flash, the camera, and USB file transfer. Otherwise this thing runs Android super smooth, WAY faster than WebOS, with overclocking features too. For example, my textbook would load page by page on WebOS, while on Android ICS it loads continuous pages! Also, I have already downloaded a ton of stuff on the Android Market. The battery life still holds very well.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "The TouchPad that could!", "Author": "hapycnsmr", "ReviewID": "ROWZ3HQ4S1V06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying I was a little nervous at first after seeing this product,cause there was hardley any real info on them other than what was on the sales info.

With good and active community behind it providing very detailed instructions, I've set up, optimized, patched and overclocked it to 1.5 Ghz in two-three hours of fiddling. At work, I use it extensively for email/reading/discussion/notes and everything in between - I mean, when my work colleagues are not snatching it from my hands \"to have one more look at it\":)PROS:- At first encounter, you are treated to some very classy packaging;- Feels very solid (so far) and not as heavy as I expected;- Beautiful IPS screen, just the right size for both reading and video, good colors and awesome viewing angles;- A personally \"killer\" feature for me - superb audio that puts many bigger and more premium laptops to shame! With some homebrew tweaks it's even louder and clearer now, but even stock is extremely good;- Stable alpha 2 of CM7 android is there so I'm trying it out this weekend. Generally, I like playing with hardware/software and optimizing - never gets old;- WebOS was a pleasant surprise. I've expected something much cruder and bug-ridden, but so far 3.0.4 seems speedy and smooth. I really like multitasking interface and email integration, clearly geared towards business users (I consider myself one).- HP drops in some nice extras, such as free 50GB online storage, and an array of actually useful accessories tailored to this device (ordering Touchstone charger soon).- Price!! For 240, this device is seriously a steal. Not as much as fire sale prices, but still worth every penny.CONS:- Home button could have been made more visible/distinct. Sometimes it's hard to figure out if you change tablet orientation a lot;- Could not pair my Android phone with the Touchpad via A2DP (bluetooth audio). Took hours to figure out that HP supports only a limited set of devices (thanks to precentral forums), however recent Android port reportedly takes care of that;- Fonts in my native language are not available for WebOS, but again Android takes care of that;- A new batch of quad-core super-powered tablets is upon us in November, so this will be outclassed quickly.Minor nitpicking aside (see \"cons\"), I find it puzzling that HP's decided to bow out and drop the support for the Touchpad. With rather simple Android port and current prices, it could have been a bombing run over the competition. I am both a technology enthusiast and a business user, and I find this device very satisfactory in both areas.

I purchased the item for $150 during the massive price drop when this item was flying off the shelves and sold out everywhere.First the good. The device is very smooth and functions very similar to the ipad. It is very convenient with a long lasting battery which goes for at least 8 hours of moderate use. The item is sleek looking and of course about the same size as the ipad. It's a fun device easy to take with you wherever you go. I like that there is a camera on the device making it easy to make skype phone calls etc. The app store continues to have new apps even now although HP stated they were no longer supporting the device although the apps don't compare to the the ones for the ipad (neither does the price $150 vs $600). The quality and craftsmanship of the device is great. I love the quality of the screen.now the bad. My biggest gripe with the device is that something about the current web operating system doesn't allow log in to Hotmail. Gmail works ok but Hotmail does not log in having something to do with silverlight and it's lack of support for the software on the touchpad. There is a work around which is annoying, but using HTTPS: (note the \"S\") has worked. The other thing is downloading stuff including PDF's gives an error which states MIME files can not be opened. Apparently there is a work around with this too but this proves very annoying. You can transfer files from your computer to the touchpad using a USB cord to connect and transfer files. The machine is a bit slow but apparently there is a way to speed it up by overclocking the CPU (i have not tried it). The other thing is the product is prone to smudges and fingerprints which can get a bit annoying. It takes a while for the tablet to boot up (approximately 15-20 seconds).Overall it is a cool machine. I would have been mad if i had paid the original retail price. For the price i got it for though it it is still a powerful machine which is a joy to use. For about the cost of a kindle you get much more usability and power with color.

Kessenick", "ReviewID": "R39MU7BHKP020W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a geek or even able to compare my HP Touchpad to its competitors; I was ready to buy a tablet and frankly attracted to the price. I paid about $230 for the 16 GB model.  It does what I wanted a tablet to do and does it marvelously. I wanted first a means of reading books easily on my BART commute every morning. Since it links into Kindle, it's perfect for that. I wanted to be able to check email in larger fonts than I can access on my I-phone (since my eyes are getting a bit on the advanced side at this point) and it's fine for that. I was able to connect it both to my office email (microsoft exchange) and my personal email (Google); I like the email interface. it also auto sync's with my office Outlook contracts and calendar (just like my I-phone), and I like that. I can play Pandora and I even added an app, Splashtop, which permits me to remote into my home home computer, but unfortunately not directly into my office computer for some reason. I  just added the Roxio movie app and rented a movie to see how that would work and it works beautifully. There is a charge for rentals and for purchases, but if you consider that you can download the movie for about $3 for a rental for 24 hours, jump on a plane and have a new movie to watch in great definition, I think even that will work fine for me (The sound needs more amplification for movies and works much better if you have a small amp between the earphones.) Netflix would be nice but actually I wouldn't be able to download a movie from Netflix even if it had an app for it, so Roxio is probably good for what I want from a tablet.  I can't see paying the price for buying a movie and then having it just reside permanently on the harddrive, but for movie rentals, it's affordable.  I can use it to edit my office Word docs although I'm not going to do that regularly. What I really like is using the operating system. I love the fact that it automatically adjusts up to the direction that I point the tablet, so that it's always in the proper position to use. It seems plenty fast for what I am asking it to do. I also bought the dock charger, the keyboard and the HP cover. All are important to have in my opinion to increase its useability. I love the instant on/off. For those who remember the HP omnibooks in the 90s you will recall that they were great for the time in large part because of the instant off/on feature. Here we've got that again but in marvelous color and with so much more useability. The shinny screen does probably get more smudges than a dull one would, but I don't find that a big deal, and the smooth back, critized by some of the reviewers, disappears as soon as you use it with the tablet cover that HP markets which has a very nice feel to it. Overall, I think its a great deal- particularly when you consider you can still pick one up for under $250 from a lot of sources.

This was good for the value at the fire sale. It doesn't compare to the iPad in terms of apps and stuff, but it's decent enough for on the go web browsing when you don't want to lug around a laptop but don't want to deal with phone screen size stuff. It's a good in-between. I use this Touchpad a lot, so it was well worth the price. I take it to school often where I can do some surfing, play some games in between class, and check my homework assignments without breaking my back with a laptop in addition to the textbooks I carry.Overall, good enough until overall Tablet prices go down.UPDATE as of March 20, 2013:So, I still happen to use this tablet with over a year after buying it at the fire sale. WAY worth it's value. Yes, the Palm system was DOA, but that was to be expected considering why this item went on the fire sale in the first place. I managed to buy 2 at the time, the one I use regularly with 32gb of internal storage and the other one with 16 gb of storage that I gave as a gift to my mother.Why do I still use it? Because I loaded the Android system on the tablet over the PALM/WebOS system. So I have a pretty decent tablet, hardware wise, with the power and vastness of the Android world.What I use it for:- Web browsing- Writing emails- Listening to music- Watching movies that I load into it. BluRay rips work. Was able to watch my Hunger Games BluRay by loading it onto the tablet. Then, was able to watch the whole movie during a 3-4 hr road trip (last trip in Feb 2013)- Playing all the various games offered by Google Play on Android- Read ebooks using the Kindle app (or other apps that are offered)Basically, it does a lot and continues truckin' on.The only issue that I saw with it is chipping on the case by the speakers, but with how much wear I have on this tablet, it's only expected.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hp Touch pad", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R30MMAGBTF9SMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I enjoy working with my touch pad.

Although there are a few apps that it absolutely needs that it doesn't.... Netflix for example.  Hulu works through the browser but Hulu blocked it.  With a small tweak you can get it to work again.  The touchpad's webOS is very modifiable.  You can install Ubuntu on this thing too.  Not to mention as of 15Sep2011, teams are working on porting Android OS over to it so you can dual boot.

Not by much but it is noticeable. 1.5Ghz is a /safe/ bump because the processor is rated for that but your battery life will get a hit.

And I must say, I am loving this product.Now, I have played around with the Ipad 2 and I'm not gonna lie, it's top notch, but this is a great alternative for anyone who wants a tablet but isn't willing to spend that much.The Software:The Software if pretty good. It uses HP Web OS, not Droid. You can install a Droid OS on to the system, but be warned, doing so will void your warranty. The HP Web Os works great with a fast browser that runs almost any website and has really cool apps. It also runs Flash, so that isn't a problem. you can have multiple apps running at once and the user interface is extremely easy to understand.The Hardware:Also very good. 10 inch screen. Not very heavy and easy to carry around. Beautiful Screen. Responds to your touch very easily. The sound is amazing. You may get static at times, but that might be a problem with the software, not hardware. Restarting fixes it.The one drawback may be the camera. Most tablets have a front and back camera installed. This one only has a front camera. The camera also isn't very high quality. If having a high quality camera is an absolute must for you, then maybe this isn't the tablet for you. But I already have a Camera and phone that takes good pics, so I don't care. I find the back camera unnecessary anyway, lol.Things to note:When you first start using it, it may seem as though some of the programs don't work properly. Don't get frustrated, just update the system. Once you do that, everything will work just fine.I am an HP lover through and through and I'm sad to see that this product is discontinued.

I got a full refund and with a little extra cash, Ante'ed up for the iPad 2.Nothing against the product, but because Web OS is discontinued, you are very limited in what you can do on that machine. If you just want to do the usual, such as internet and email, then go ahead and get it. But the apps are limited and if you want a fully functional tablet, you are bound to get bored with it after a while.The product itself is wonderful.

In the past I used a Palm Treo for more than 4 years and have yet to find a suitable replacement.  When the HP Touch Pad was announced, I read up on Web OS and was impressed with the functionality.  I was especially looking forward to the compatibility with the next Palm phone.07/01/2011 - I preordered the HP Touch Pad, Touchstone Charging Dock, Case, and HP Wireless keyboard.  For the first five or six weeks, I was very happy with the product and still think it has a lot of potential.  Then, HP announced they would discontinue the device and everyone started selling the Touch Pad for $100.  I attempted to return the devise but had trouble getting through on the phone lines.  When I finally got through on the phone, I was told there was a 21 day return limit but was assured that support would continue.  I was unhappy but based on past history with other products, I was confident that HP would follow through on their promises made during the sale and subsequent calls.Several weeks ago, my Touchstone charging stand stopped working.  I would put it on the device overnight and would only get a partial charge.  Checked and double checked it because it gives a clear warning message if it's not aligned correctly.  While it worked it was great and truly idiot proof.10/15/2011 - After several weeks of the dock not working, I called HP using the \"Support and Drivers\" number on my receipt.  After 45+ minutes, I was told they couldn't help me and I need to call Customer Support.  After another 45+ minutes on the phone with Customer Support attempting to get a refund.  I was told that HP does not give refunds for defective devices after 21 days of purchase and I need to call technical support.  After explaining that I had been referred to Customer Support and that I was getting the run-a-round, I asked to speak with both Customer Support and Technical Support at the same time.  They said that wasn't possible and then gave me a new phone number for Palm Technical Support because the number on my receipt was not correct for the Touchstone.Now, I have a glorified stand that doesn't work and HP will not refund my money.

I am loving the WebOS so far.Although the app store for the Touchpad is lacking compared to Android, there are still some quality apps and games. The multitasking on the Touchpad with Webos is second to none, even Android.After having to do some tweaks and clocking the CPU back to the original 1.5Ghz( Under-clocked to 1.2Ghz stock) the tablet is blazing fast compared to my Asus Transformer. Apps opens much faster and scrolling is much smoother than when it was at 1.2Ghz. The smoothness is also due to other tweaks that disable HP logging your every move. Search Google on how to install \"Preware\" and overclocking on this device.On the Asus Transformer, I could never play a Youtube video in 720P smoothly using an internet browser.On this touchpad at 1.5Ghz, a Youtube video in 720P plays like butter in full-screen. It even plays 108OP Youtube videos well with a bit of choppiness. 1080P videos play like a picture slideshow on the Asus transformer.This shows that Adobe Flash works really well with the Touchpad's hardware.On a more negative note: The tablet is a king of fingerprint magnets. It is also a bit on the heavy side compared to other tablets. The exterior design is similar to an iPad 1 except it has a front facing camera.For $100, this tablet is a steal.

People need to realize that this is an outlet for product reviews and not seller reviews...there is a separate place for that. This is a perfect example of how it damages the product image. On to the actual product review.  Update: I was referring to the 400+ 1 star reviews regarding OnSale and the 16 gb \"discounted\" version (which is the same thing, but a different model number). You can leave seller feedback after you've placed an order (under your account orders).I've been an avid Android OS user for two years now and before purchasing a Touchpad I had never used WebOS, but I'd heard good things about it.  I was able to grab one of these for the discounted price and I don't think I would have bought one otherwise.  Not because I don't think the Touchpad is a poor product, but because I think touchpads in general are overpriced.  From my experience in the past few days I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised. I thought I was going to be getting a mediocre experience but thus far it has been wonderful.  The WebOS system is very cool and I like how all of my opened \"apps\" or windows are right there in front of me so I can see what is going on.  Very cool how you can be loading up in one web browser and then switch over to another app. I know you can do this in Android, but you can't see what is going on in both windows like in WebOS.  There aren't very many apps in the appstore, but I knew that going in. And, besides, how many apps do you really need?  Checking email, browsing the web, watching movies, listening to music, facebook, checking news, video chatting, etc. is all I really need to do. If I am going to do anything more involved than that I will just use my laptop. And you do get 50GB Box.net cloud storage for life...equivalent to around $15/month.The device itself is pretty fast and I didn't experience any severe lag when I was working with 4+ apps open at the same time. The screen is bright and vibrant.  The speakers don't go extremely loud but are appropriate for listening to pandora or watching a movie.  GPS would have been cool, but it's not really necessary, that's what my phone is for.  I had some trouble streaming TV shows off of FOX, ABC, etc., but that may have just been my wifi connection.  I gave it four stars because of the price.  Yes I did get it for under $150, but I am rating it on the MSRP.  For what you get I would say it is probably worth $400 rather than $500.Update: Updating the OS from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2 is kind of a pain.  On one of mine, I couldn't even update using the Touchpad update app and I had to use the WebOS doctor (which factory resets the device, although everything is backed up with your webos account). On my other Touchpad I was able to get the device to update using the app after several tries but now the camera doesn't work! So, I will now have to use WebOS doctor on that one too. A bit of a hassle so I'd recommend updating and making sure everything works before you start adding email, facebook, etc. accounts.Update: WebOS Doctor did fix the camera issue so I guess updating over the air didn't give me a complete update.

More Apps please!", "Author": "Andera Chan", "ReviewID": "R21AVXGCG5H7TD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have a trial yourself in your local shop(make sure it is 3.0.2).  Salesman likes to sell the easiest.  Compare yourself and do not just rely on the reviews on web.  I am the owner of iPhone 2G and iPhone 4.  I own the iMac G4 and other newer Macs.  I am not a fashion or gadget enthusiast.  Strangely and honestly, I have not tried out or even touched an iPad/iPad 2 since their launches.  I always think iPad is just an enlarged iPhone.  At home I have iMacs and PCs.  On the walk, I have an iPhone.  I had been a Palm PDA user and always loved their products.  I bought a Pre Plus with touchstone in May and was impressed by WEBOS.  Recently, I searched for an instant-on device with a small foot-print, which is used meanly for web-surfing (with flash) and emailing.  It will be mainly to my kids who will frequently check the IXL, Brainpop and e-classes at home.  Due to my experience and my requirements.  I gave HP Touchpad a chance.  I bought a 32GB TP with an touchstone charging dock.  The design of the tablet and the dock are very good.  Good stereo audio. I do not feel cheap on the hardwares.  The OS is responsive most of the time.  The launching of application may not be quite as fast as that in iPhone.  But all the basic apps(programs) including flash playing are good. You can display emails/IMS/contacts from different providers in one place.  When you buy the TP, HP/Palm let you set up a free WEBOS account in its servers/Cloud. Syncing and backup are done automatically.  Update will also be done automatically.  All the apps/contacts/settings will appears on other webos devices under a same Palm/Webos account.  Switching between apps is much easier and more pleasant in WEBOS than in iOS.  The Webos has great potential.  Here are some of my thoughts:1. Word/Excel/PP are very crucial to users.  I will buy the keyboard immediately if the apps are out.  I will buy one more HP for presentation if next iteration include solution for video output!2. Need parental controls!3. Better desktop side apps for syncing music/contacts/photos and backup(users like to have backups of the device in their hands).4. Pivot is very good.  In a news-explosive era, we need very good editors.  In an apps-flooding era, we even need apps reviewers since we will use the apps repeatedly.  Time saver!5. Need more killer apps!  Google does not write for WEBOS in the meantime, nor do Microsoft and other big internet/software corporations.  Give more supports and incentives and documentations to the Webos developers!We have only Kindle, Facebook, Wordpress and Linkedin.  50GB BOX.com Cloud storage is a nice gift!6. WEBOS devices are the only devices in market which allow homebrew apps.  No need to jailbreak to use patches to add functions to the devices.7. Accessories are expensive.  I discover a bundle in somewhere is the best bargain! Within $490(excl. tax), you can have a 16gb with all the accessories!8. HP: update the software more frequently with more functions and smoothness.  Invest more in the GPU or even SOC custom designed CPU (collaborates with other chip makers) for tablets to improve the performance.  Graphics matters.  Resolutions matters.  If resolution is high enough(more pixels per inch),  the object in the screen will seems to be 3D itself. There is no need for such stupid 3D technology.  Gives more pleasure to users within such a small fixed screen.9. Need better WEBOS website, better online supports and documentations.  Separate the old palm devices from those of WEBOS. It is just confusing.HP has to introduce and explain WEBOS Account/Cloud, WEBOS(the OS) and devices well and clearly to people.  Actually, Palm has been doing what iCloud will do in 9/2011 since fall of 2009!  HP does not know how to materialize its acquisition of Palm.  Obviously, the management and marketing team of HP have severe problems.  A single strong leader and more resources for the WEBOS team are needed.Happy padding!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Experience with the HP Touchpad was Disappointing", "Author": "W.

I also have an iPad 2 and an Android Tablet (Asus EEE Transformer). Unfortunately, my experience with the HP Touchpad was disappointing.  WebOS does have a lot of positives, but two big negatives, in my opinion, are slightly longer load times of applications and web pages, combined with freeze ups and having to keep resetting the device.  My device kept freezing up with just email and a web browser open. I think this is just a software issue that will be fixed with an update, but why spend good money on a first generation tablet with issues when there are excellent alternatives without these issues.I would recommend an Android tablet over an iPad 2. It's cheaper, you can expand the memory on certain models with an SD Card and it handles web pages that use Adobe Flash.The main reason I wrote this review is because it seemed inconsistent that it would be rated so highly by so many users when a lot of the posts talked about software issues and restarting.

Elliott \"LatchJohnson\"", "ReviewID": "R2NZXY91REKR7R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had my Touchpad for nearly two months now. I decided to get it when HP had its fire-sale. I knew HP had stopped supporting it, but the hardware alone makes this a great deal. Many good digital picture frames of relative size cost close to this tablets price so it's hard to pass up when you consider its a computer. I would not recommend this tablet though for reasons i discuss in a bit if you can't get it less than $250. I've had an Ipad for about a year now and it's my only solid experience with a tablet to compare it to.The hardware is pretty good. Physically, it a clone of the first gen Ipad. It was made to compete with it, but the second gen came out hurting the Touchpad's release. It is the same size, except for depth(and slightly heavier); all the inputs/outputs are in the same place, other than the speakers. It even has a home button with identical functionality. You can literally swap out folio cases and(to an extent) screen covers with little problem. This is great because it broadens your choice for non-oem cases. This also allows for a user to easily step into the TP. The tablet, like many HP flagship models, has a nice glossy finish case to it. It, like other HP products, it looks great but attracts too many finger prints. Because this is hand held, it is risky to handle it without a case because it may break or get marked up easily because it is plastic.The Beats audio is actually really good. I'm not someone to buy into fad's but I can really hear a difference with these stereo speakers. I play music and videos mainly on my TP so sound is important. It's clear and a lot louder than my Ipad. I haven't tried any android tablets but these are probably better than most out there for audio. If it had Netflix, it would love it.The tablet has a front facing 1.3 MP camera for web chats and such. I haven't used it for web chats, but i have used it to take a number of pictures of me and my son making goofy faces and such. I am really disappointed in the quality of the camera. It's almost 2012 and I'm shocked that a tablet that sells for $500 has such a low quality camera for it's only camera. The pictures i take are gritty and low quality. I feel HP dropped the ball with it. I would like to at least see an app that adds visuals to a photo. It doesn't have a rear facing camera but that is something i can live without. I don't use my tablets for normal picture taking, only goofing around with my kids.The external buttons on it work well. It doesn't take a hard push to get any of the physical buttons to respond. With age, there is a chance they will become less responsive when dust sneaks in so i will update later.The major flaw to this tablet is the failed OS. I know there are many TP fan-boys who will argue with me, but there is nothing special to the OS at all, though it doesn't make it bad. Most OS's tough are pretty much the same. The features are all there, touch screen app icons, internet, mail, IM'ing and web chatting. The real difference in any tablet is the app's. Let's face it, tablets are all about app's. If you only want mail and web browsing, a net-book is cheaper(though maybe not as cool). HP has decided to no longer support WebOS and i don't feel there will be any more updates to come even with all the sales they had. I could live without OS updates, but the app catalog they have is pretty bare. With the huge sale HP had, putting half a million TP's in users hands, it still seems not many developers have rushed to make apps for them. There is a good number of app's in their catalog, but not many big names like Gameloft and Glu. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of app's, but just not many good ones that you're friends would be wow'ed by.The processor in the TP is a 1.2 dual core. It does a good job on most things i ask of it. I have not overclocked mine and don't plan on it, but it could be a bit more powerful. It was seriously hyped, but i don't think it's as smooth as my Ipad. I have transferred most my pictures to it, using it as a digital picture frame, and the pictures don't change smoothly. They slide pretty choppy across the screen. It shows how it is lacking in the graphical department. It has the Qualcomm Adreno 220 GPU in it and I don't have much experience with gaming on it. The free games in their catalog are pretty bad and the few good games they have, i already have on my Ipad. I did download Angry Birds(heaven help me) and it played smoothly.Speaking of the screen, the screen is the best part of this tablet. It's screen size, (9.7 inches) and resolution, (1024 by 768 pixels) match the iPad's specs and look just as good.In the end, unless there are more updates and app's, this is not worth the cost of a higher end android or IOS device. But if you can get it for a low cost, its a great device to use for lesser uses.There is an application called Preware you can install on to it. Some people have compared it to jail-breaking, but its really not like jail-breaking. It adds an app that you can change some settings and install app's like cydia does, but doesn't give you pirated app's or anything like this. It also doesn't look for exploits in your OS. HP seems to support people putting it on their tablets, but since they canceled the tablet, I think it's more like they don't care anymore. Anything they can do to get people to buy, they will support. The main reason i bought this was to put Android on when a stable version of cyanogenmod is available.

My household has Android devices, Ipod touches, an IPad, and 2 Touchpads now.  My experience with the Touchpad has been very positive.Pros:-It is better at web browsing than the iPad or itouch by far. Flash support is a big plus.- Multitasking is easier, and very intuitive with WebOS, and it shines over my Android 3.2 and IOs  devices, which get the job done, but not with the ease of WebOS. I think anyone who spends a bit of time with all the devices will feel the same.  Open many apps at the same time and there is no slowdown.- Homebrew allows overclocking the CPUs, which run well at 1.5 or 1.7 GHz, and give you the response you expect.- Despite being \"dead\" new apps show up every week.- 50 gb  free storage at box.net give you cloud storage- Amazon's cloud mp3 player works, even though it tells you it is not compatible when you first log in.  I listen to music on all my devices from this service.- Long battery life.  I get probably 10 hours before I am around 10%.  Touchstone charging is quick, too.- A $7 app that makes many video files work fixes some of the netflix irritation, but you have to store the files onboard.Cons:-  No external storage.  I can't plug in an sd,USB or other device to bump up my storage.  Apple may get away with this, but all the competition has gone non-communist now.- Not that many Apps.  While more are still arriving, Apple still has many more.- No Netflix. Netflix doesn't have an app.  You can't watch from the browser, either. Netflix's app doesn't work on my Android 3.2 device, so I either have to use a real computer or one of the IOs devices to watch.- Uncertainty with HP.  They just fired the moron that was the CEO, who decided that 6 weeks of slow sales was too much.  HP sent it to market with an underdeveloped OS on it. 3.02 has fixed much of the issues, and good marketing would have saved the Touchpad imo.  Since HP has said they will only develop WebOS from now on, buying a Touchpad means you get some support, and should get future updates, but who can be sure?Despite the negatives, $99-$149 makes this too good to pass up.  Even at $500, it is a very good tablet.  I surf the net a lot, and the Touchpad is better than a netbook, better than an iPad, and better than my Android for that.  Combined with upgrades from the app store and Preware, I feel I have a great tablet.  I only really want the ability to add storage capacity.  That is why I give it 4 stars.-", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm glad I've got it.", "Author": "SW", "ReviewID": "R2C9QKXIFDG0NU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As soon as I've got it, I did all the recommended patches described on Precentral site.+Touchpad is a very nice tablet to read emails, browse websites, use online radio etc.+Screen and audio quality is pretty good.

Only if HP would have given the Touchpad the necessary support and time to mature into the market place of the tablet world, it would, really would have evolved into the kind of tablet that stands superlative to everyone else. I own an IPad 2, Ipod Touch and the HP Touchpad.  Recently got rid off a Samsung Galaxy tab, mainly because it was too slow.After using the Touchpad for over a month and comparing to all the others (except for the lack of apps) it is a much better device, mainly because Web OS is more intuitive, it is like using widows and love the ease of accessing Microsoft email or any others.  And a lot faster too!  If I was a member in the Board of Directors for HP, I would fire the person responsible for such demise.  It is a crime spend 1.2 Billion dollars for the purchase of Palm, develop a nice product $$$ then scrap it, is he an idiot?.  Like I said before, is a product all its own and don't see any competition.  Can you imagine if this product had evolutionized over a few years, just like any good old product would (not to mention any names), well you get my drift.

I know it's a good product, but it's always appeared more gimmicky and ad-driven, and that has always turned me off.Still I was ready to buy it last week. I had the money and I was ready to justify it as the only thing close to meeting my work needs. Then it happened...I received the email saying that the touchpad had arrived! I ran out the next day (yesterday), walked over to the ipad briefly, picked it up, put it down, then walked over to the HP touchpad. WONDERFUL!!!I like the weight- doesn't feel like a toy. I hate that all the apps aren't in yet- but I can wait. The screen is easier to touch and move-which has always been a problem for me with apple...the screen doesn't stay touch friendly. Finally, i'm typing on the pad right now, and the feel is incredible. I have a good grasp of it, and I really like it.i'm also unhappy that best buy did not have accessories on hand (dock,case), and the idea of having to wait five weeks pisses me off. Now would be great time to see if my HP relatives could speed Ot up, right? Wrong. We have to wait too.still, it's great product, and i'm happy to avoid paying into apples sharp ad campaign.Oh, one more thing...there people here who give excellent reviews based on a level of computer literacy that I don't even pretend to have. If you're like me, and jus want something that is nice and it does what you need it to do, then this is it.

It has my Google Docs, Gmail, Skype, Facebook, Movies, Music, Games, etc. This really is a do-everything device, and I'm so glad I bought it. While it's not as powerful or capable(yet) as a laptop, it's darn near the same experience. I have the bluetooth keyboard that HP made for this tablet, and it's fantastic, with zero lag and instantaneous action on the Touchpad. I may never go back to a laptop again.

I was unable to catch one via Amazon however (thus the no Verified Purchase logo)I was not ready to buy into the tablet market quite yet as I think it is still not quite where I want to buy in yet, however for this low price, even if I could only used it for a photo viewer and a web browser for the kids, it would be worth it.It is working well as a photo viewer, however there are many things that can cause it to stop (unlike a dedicated photo viewer).  However, unlike a photo viewer, you can have music playing in the background during the slide show and it does has decent speakers.It works well as a web browser, however it is often impossible to drag and drop items in certain flash based pages (e.g. starfall com).It works well for games, however it is slow enough that music instrument games are annoying because there is a long delay between touching the screen and the sound coming out (Overclocking helps alot).It is a bit of a pain for web browsing for me as I rely on Roboform for my passwords and bookmarks (which does not have a WebOS version) and LastPass for WebOS just does not seem to work for me at all.With the better than average sound, it works well for movies, however Hulu requires a very specialized hack and Netflix is not available at all and HD files are unwatchable and the built in video viewer was never able to find my video files.I do love the wireless charging stand concept. All tablets should have this option.Currently, the kids cannot get enough of the countdown to Christmas app that I have up and running on it 24/7.To truely make it useful, you need to use Preware to find the really cool apps that make it useful, such as the free media player and an app to overclock to 1.5Ghz.  My original review had this as 3 stars because I felt the review should be based on as-sold condition, not post-installing stuff that explicitly states \"will void your warranty\" or may potentially brick your device (tho they say this is quite unlikely).  However within 24 hours I would get several not helpful dings, 3 separate times, so I caved and made it 4 stars.  That 4th star is solely due to the side-app market Preware, which does not come with it and is designed with techno-geeks like me in mind.

Howes", "ReviewID": "R37Q95YK6S5GQV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was one of the lucky people who snapped up this tablet when it was dumped by HP. I've been using it mainly as a portable web browser, and it is quite good at that. It's not as smooth or as responsive to gestures as an iPad 2, but it has a superior browsing layout. I'm particularly taken by what a difference it makes that the history/bookmarks pulldown is under my right thumb while holding it with two hands. It is a fine standards compliant browsing machine. The e-mail client is also surprisingly good.The multitasking and task switching capacity of the OS is another strength. It's quite liberating being able to swipe between running apps and flick clutter off the screen. I hope iOS can someday behave this way.However, it is painfully obvious that HP was delusional if they truly thought they could sell hundreds of thousands of these at the same price as an iPad 2. The hardware wasn't there, the software wasn't ready and the app catalog is sadly lacking.The hardware is cheaper than the iPad, cheaper but not junk. Heavy with mediocre battery life. The case is cheap plastic, imprecisely machined with rough cut port holes. The screen is a bit blurry and has back light bleeding even worse than the first run of iPads. The front facing camera is as junky as the camera in an iPad 2 (I really wish my tablets had decent cameras but they don't.) The oblong home button is hard to press and scrapes one's thumbs when pressed. It is really annoying that almost no third party USB chargers--such as car chargers--work with the Touchpad. My house is filled with chargers but only the Touchstone dock and the original HP wall charger work.[Update: After two months, my Touchpad stopped working and I sent it in for an exchange which took a couple of weeks. The refurbished unit they sold me is fine, and doesn't have the crack near the speaker my original sported. At least, HP is still providing service, including the promised 90 day from purchase WebOS butler service, but I can't help to see the contrast with a hypothetical failure of my iPad while under warranty, the guy at the local Genius bar would have handed me a refurbished unit within minutes of my appointment. As it is, I've had to go through a round of HP first sending me a replacement power supply, before their accepting it will have to be repaired. The tech support call was reasonably satisfactory, with short phone waits and competent English speakers.]The included software other than the browser and e-mail are substandard; for example it won't play most of my MP4 video files I loaded on it, no errors, just refuses to play them. The photo browser is more than basic and jerky. Everything else seems just not ready.As for the app catalog, there are a few standouts like Angry Birds Rio which plays as well or better than the iPad version, but is mostly amateurish first passes at real apps. No Netflix or potential for Netflix; which is a big bummer for me, it would be great if I could hand this cheaply bought tablet to my children without worrying about them destroying an expensive piece of hardware. And of course, after such a nice first impression, Angry Birds is crashing after a few rounds. And I'll never be sure if they bother to submit an update. The problem with a platform on life support.It is a tragedy that HP didn't have the fortitude to follow through on this platform. Anybody using this tablet for 10 minutes could see that this is a diamond in the rough, something with huge potential with better hardware and time to get the software done right could have made it a real competitor; something that you could charge iPad prices for.But this is what we have, and if you can get it at anything near the clearance sale price, you will get at a minimum a very nice web browser and e-mail machine.

And it has Flash -- so the web browser is not crippled like iOS's. They do need more apps (Netflix -- PLEASE!), but all the major bases are covered.

It is safe to assume that this device will be poorly supported by first and third party developers going forward after the extremely short life span.  Hate to base a low rating on that but it is a serious detriment.EDIT:Since I have received negative feedback based on this review I feel I should clarify...I've used the device a bit, though not owned one, and was not impressed with the polish of the OS or the level of app support that was existent even when it was being sold.  I felt the responsiveness of the device was not even up to par with its competitors that were already on the market prior to release.The \"rumor\" that the touchpad is discontinued is not a rumor, it's fact that had been announced by the company.  I find long life cycle and long term support as VERY relevant to the usefulness of the product.  I tried to be more than fair by giving it more than one star.  As a developer, I also have an understanding that if the device is not being sold, then there will probably be no market support, which means it just doesn't make any sense to continue developing for it.  I understand the TouchPad has had somewhat of a resurgence as an cheap \"undead\" device (since my review mind you) but continued support is critical to continued usefulness.  With the state of the OS at launch almost immediately warranting a software update that will never come, and the lack of apps that will never be there, this product doesn't make sense.Unless you want something interesting you can pick up on the cheap and maybe load with a different OS when ROMs are available (which, since this is not the intended use of the device, shouldn't be considered as part of a review anyways) consider this review as a warning to consumers not to pick up this device.

When I first received the product I couldn't turn it on so I thought it was because it was in the box for the shipping period that it needs to be charged up. After two days of charging it finally came on. So I wrapped it up and and put it away for Christmas. During early morning of Christmas I tried to set up the tablet with wifi and personal settings and again it won't turned on. So I charged it back up for 4hrs and it finally came back on. I input wifi info and personal settings and gave it a rest. Few hours later I went back to play with the tablet and it's giving me an error of no internet connection. Went back in to settings and input my wifi info for the second time. I turned the tablet off and turned it back on and it won't turn on. I left it alone to get it charged and came back and couple hours later and tried to turn it on and this time it came on. I e-mailed the seller the next day letting him know that I need to return the product for no longer needed/wanted because my daughter got a mini ipad from her uncle for christmas and no longer need/want this product. Seller returned e-mail stating that returns is outside of the 30 days window and Amazon holiday return policy don't cover the product because amazon didn't ship it and he gave me two options: 1) Keep the item 2) Return the item at my own expense for 50% refund (unreasonable offer). So I thought what the heck we'll just keep it. I tried to go on the internet and again and error message appears with no internet connection. I then input my wifi info in again and this time it didn't take it. I waited a couple hours try again but still no internet but our ipad and netflix was on running off of the same wifi. Contacted the seller again but this time I told him about the product being defective/damaged. He reply back stating that his first offer still stands and the product worked fine prior to shipping and the problems I'm having with the product is how the product works. He aslo suggested that I should contact HP for help and infomation about the product. After contacting HP, they told me that the product shouldn't be acting the way it is and I should only input my wifi info once and the product should automatic store for future usage. Contacted the seller again and told him about the product and what HP told me and asked if I can return the product for 85%-80% refund. Seller closed my return request with the reason, Expiration of returns period. Now I am stuck with a product that is not function right and have no use for it. Will not recommed this to anyone and I hope no one gets treated like I did.

I have now had it for a few days, and I'd like to put my thoughts out on it.  First, the operating system is fantastic.  It really feels like it's designed for the tablet.  However, the big thing for tablets, as well as smart phones, are the apps, and the apps are very much lacking.  What's really disappointing, in addition to the lack of apps, is that some of the apps that are available are designed for the web os phone rather than the touchpad, which normally wouldn't bother me, however they don't expand to be the full screen (or at least some don't), so I'm playing some games on a screen the size of a smartphone.  For music and video, it's very good.  Screen is great, the speakers in it are decent for what they are (but obviously nowhere near as good as headphones or an external speaker source would be).One more item... the chat is supposed to support gchat, but as of the writing of this, it's not working.  I spoke with HP about it and they \"elevated the issue.\"  I don't know why gchat is not supported, but there's no other free gchat app that I know of, and gchat is an important item for me.Overall, for the firesale price, it's great, but for much more (even at $225), I'd have to say it might be too much because of the dearth of apps.  Hopefully some developers will make apps for it in the future, but obviously I'm not hopeful.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good option for a tablet.", "Author": "thao", "ReviewID": "R29NXG5ANYTKJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the IPad 1 since it first came out, and I was frustrated with it's inability to play flash then I tumbled upon this Touchpad at Amazon for $399 for the 16g model.

Size and weight comparition: similar to IPad 1, especially with the cover.2.  Speed:  same as Ipad1 even though Touchpad has dual core, but somehow loading a page doesn't seem faster than my Ipad1.3.  Touch and scrolling :  it works but not as well as iPad.4.

Multitasking:  touchpad allows me to load 1 page and read a different page at the same time.I have 2 small kids, they can't decide their favorite between IPad and Touchpad.

I bought the HP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer for my daughter July 2012 for her birthday. As soon as she charged it and turned it on, there was no sound!We shipped it to HP. I don't know if she got hers or a reconditioned one back, but it looked brand new. Sound problem was fixed. I don't about other touch pads, but she had to download a camera app to get the camera.Fast forward to January 2013 and out of warranty. She hadn't charged it for a few weeks, but you'd think it would just charge up as soon as she plugged it in. Dead as a door nail. It would no longer turn on, no matter how long it was charged on it's own cord.Somewhere online my husband found this weird suggestion, and it worked. Start plugging the HP into other mini USB chargers. I used my phone charger, my spare charger, everyone else's chargers etc. It worked. We charged it for 5 hours and it's been fine. NEVER let this thing uncharge completely.The colors are great, she loves the thing. Most of the ratings here were positive and that's why I bought it, but it's been trouble from the start. I would normally say you get what you pay for, but this is not a cheap toy and it is from a good company. I would not by another HP product. They seem to be too buggy.It's now a year later, July 2013 and her birthday again. I decided to quit our Comcast cable account to save money. As a consolation prize, I signed up for online Neflix. I have since found out that it does not work on this Touch Pad. Works on everything else, but there is no Touch Pad Netflix app. My daughter has to use my Kindle Fire to watch movies. This is ridiculous.I have also heard that HP is changing their OS. My husband is going to try out how to switch this thing to Android. If it trashes the thing, I'm getting her a Kindle.I love my Kindle Fire. I didn't get one for her in the first place is because she's not a reader, and I thought the HP Pad would meet her needs. It got great reviews, and it didn't cost as much as an IPad.Luckily they no longer make this.

I've just boxed my 32gb touchpad up to treturn it. Here's why:1) No video out. This is huge, and a deal breaker for me (current, $200 Android based tablets have HDMI out). You can't do presentations with the touchpad unless you use some convoluted scheme of transmitting via the web to another computer that's hooked up to the projector. This may be surmountable by installing Cyanogen's version of Android,and buying McTivia, but that's a big maybe...(BTW: no video out support for the existing micro usb port).2) No memory expansion slot (Sd or micro SD). 32 gb is all you'll ever have if you're not connected to the web.3) Very slow boot times, especially for a solid state machine. Mine took just under a minute, and that's after holding down the on button for 5 seconds.On the plus side:1) It is beautifully built and the touch screen worked great. In addition, the screen is bright and sharp and makes for very comfortable reading.2) WebOS apps are plentiful, inexpensive, and the few I downloaded installed themselves in seconds and ran perfectly right out of the gate.3) Huge community of users, Webosnation, CyanogenMod, devoted to developing new apps and solving problems.

What i mean by this is that i wanted something for school that was portable but not to heavy, and yet powerful enough to do work while at school. So i ended up trading the ipod touch for a brand new hp touchpad.The goodThe hp touchpad is light enough to carry with my engineering books, fits well in my backpack.Portable enough to take out in lectures and use it to take notes. The screen size is great, watching videos like youtube and movies is perfect on the hp touchpad screen. I disable the automatic dim so the screen is very bright. The sound is great and i was actually surprise how good the sound is without headphones. The browser is ok does the job but needs to be improved. The few games that i played in webos look amazing specially the racing games, I played EA need for speed and asphalt, one word would be amazing. Also angry birds is fun and looks good on the hp touchpad. There was no lag while playing the games, they run well and look good. Also i use the hp touchpad a lot for reading pdf articles and pdf books, no problems here i load the PDFs and just start reading, and like i said before the screen is bright enough so that reading does not hurt my eyes. hp touchpad has a true Multitasking, open youtube listen to music then open another webpage and start reading something else and youtube is still there playing on the background.i was able to put android on the hp touchpad and you would not believe how smooth and how much better of a device it becomes. Even though its an alpha stage the device runs great. i can use almost all apps from the android market. in near future ice cream sandwich probably will be ported to hp touchpad, so i am waiting patiently. i am not kidding when i say that the true power of hp touchpad comes out with android you have to see for yourself to believe it.Overclocking the hp touchpad makes it more fluid when using webos, i have mine currently at 1.5 Ghz on both cores.The email client for webos is good.The Bad The ugly1.I am not sure why they released webos if was not finished, i used webos version 3.0.2 and seem very slow compared to 3.0.4. Yet 3.0.4 without overclocking is laggy.So it seems that every update the device is getting better.2. The browser does the job but it sucks at rendering some web pages, for some web pages it loads pretty good and for some it takes ages to load and for some they dont even load. cnn looks good and also some other news web sites. You can tell that the browser needs a lot of work. Also i have notice that in webos pinch to zoom in could be more fluid like android, sometimes the there is laggy pinch to zoom in. Sometimes when scrolling the classical checkboard show up. for me the experience of web-browsing on the hp touchpad under webos has been a hit or a miss. I wish i had the ability of using an alternative web browser for webos like firefox or opera but no such options exist but for now users are stuck on the default browser, hopefully with newer updates they improve the web browser. For now i boot into android and use the web-browser which is very responsive and very fluid.3.Very few support for webos in terms of apps and now that hp kill webos well forget it, but on the good side android ice cream sandwich will get ported later so who cares.4.I would have liked to have seen an sd card expansion instead of the camera,this is more a personal choice than a con.5. Overall the tendency of webos to be laggy.I honestly don't know how hp expected to compete with ios or android. In my opinion webos seems very incomplete, and the lack of any development from the very beginning meant that webos was doomed. Don't get me wrong i like webos is just that i wish it was more responsive. Overall the hp touchpad serves as a media device or productivity. Can tablets replace laptops absolutely not at least not in my case.i would rate the hp touchpad 5 stars because android can run on hp touchpad (i do recommend this to my friends if they want a tablet that can run android and run it at full speed ) please note the hardware is very capable.if only webos then i would rate 4 stars because webos and browser need work ( if you are not going to mess around with the os and just use webos just be aware that webos is buggy and laggy)by the way i bought a stylus Targus Stylus for Apple iPad and use that stylus to write handwriting notes on the hp touchpad using freenote app(more apps available also) from android it works like a champ", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet I've seen!", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R1VTNIJHEJXN12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An easy to use, interactive tablet that connects with everything I already use.

There are only 2 decent apps (Facebook and USA Today).Moblie flash is a joke, most video stutter or take to long to load. The browser is worthless but for some reason the folks at the touchpad forums seem to love it. When I asked anyones opinion of the iPad 2 they got very defensive and one of them told me to jump in a hole(very mature).Anyway I've since bought an iPad 2 and after a week of using/testing I have to say it is one hell of a machine. Everything just works right. I will write a seperate review on the iPad 2 later.

On the TP, it slowly raises/lowers the volume - there is no \"accelerator\" sensing;+ On the iPad, when I click on a link/image/etc. on a webpage, the text/image I clicked on highlights briefly (providing visual confirmation of what I selected) before the link is followed; whereas on the TP there is a \"water drop wavelet\" animation - with no indication of what I clicked on ==> HP should do what the iPad does;+ The iPad \"shortcuts\" to web pages have a nice shrunken preview of the target web page *and* they have more pixels than on the TP; TP should copy iPad;+ In general, the webOS UI is still too complicated...I'll agree that the Apple iOS UI is just a bit too simple/constrained, but I think hp would do well to consider a bit of nipping and tucking on the webOS UI;+ Battery Life: I left my TouchPad off the charger for ~2 days, and now it complains that the batter is dead (icon of red battery and US electrical plug)...you've got some serious power management issues!  I assume you let apps run in the background and suck battery life.  Apple was very hardcore about this - some said too hardcore - but they surely have great battery life.  You must improve.+ The keyboard layout: the grey/white color scheme gets in the way; and the keyboard layout is non-standard; not a place to innovate - people expect the \"dominant design\"; you should \"copy wildly\" the most standard keyboard layouts;+ Apps - this is a no-brainer - you need to get the top iPhone/iPad apps on your platform asap (pay for that of course) and you have to set a high quality bar (RIM struggles because they ignored the app market and Apple cleaned their clock); by \"top\" I don't mean high-volume apps (though that is good) but rather the apps used by (what Microsoft used to call) Influential End Users (esp. the media folks at WSJ, etc.); so get WSJ, Economist, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Shazzam, etc. ported to TouchPad;+ More on Apps - it's all about developer productivity: make it as easy as possible to build TP apps;+ Back to the TP web browser - recently I've visited a few websites on my iPad that behave as if they were iPad apps (swipe left and right for navigation, etc.) - you need to jump on that and support that behavior;+ And emphasizing again: your web browser has to handle [...] with perfection -- which you don't;+ Apple is the tablet leader; Google has the \"open\" advantage that Microsoft had with MS-DOS/Windows (though Google quality and fit-and-finish are subpar), so if HP wants to survive and thrive in this space you need to do a kick ass job.  Right now you're at - say - 85% of iPad.  With Apple's lead, you need to be at 130% of iPad if you want to compete and surpass.  The three components are hardware (CPU speed, industrial design, display quality, robustness, etc.), software (easy/fast/reliable OS, apps, etc.), and service (the website).  Apple has built a great ecosystem combining all three, but has weaknesses.  iTunes is a bit too focused on music, doesn't really do the \"all my data is seamlessly protected in the cloud\", and they are trying to rip off apps vendors with their various policies (including taking a large percentage of in-app sales, see Amazon Kindle, etc.).  On hardware Apple is rocking (thought I don't like the slick aluminum case, and yours is even more slippery) - I've had my iPad since 4/2010 and it has survived a few drops on the floor unscathed (a few minor dents).  On the software front, I think the iOS UI is just a tad too simplistic - and as I wrote webOS is just a bit too complicated.  You need to find a happy medium.+ One big weakness iOS on iPad has is that applications are not really persistent.  If I have several Safari sessions on my iPad and try to copy from one and paste into another (like Outlook Web Access), at some point the iPad \"forgets\" the session and has to reload - and all my work is gone.  There is no predictability to that behavior.  So webOS should do better than that (it's a pretty trivial matter of using virtual memory I assume).+ Flash could be a big advantage for you.  I know Flash has its issues, but why aren't native TouchPad apps Flash apps?  Apple has forbidden Flash - despite all the BS from Steve Jobs - because they want developers locked in to the iOS APIs.  The fact that the Apple license agreement prohibited the approach where you wrote a Flash app and then used a tool to turn that into a \"native\" iOS app made that abundantly clear.+  Everyone saw how Intel and Microsoft won the \"PC Wars\" - so every (large) company is working first and foremost to prevent any single vendor for becoming a de facto standard in the mobile space.  Apple doesn't have to worry about that because they are doing hardware, software, and services.  Perhaps hp is trying to clone that strategy?  If so, you have to get way more serious - as I wrote before, the TouchPad is a \"me too\" product, released 16 months after iPad 1.0 with many glaring deficiencies vs. that 16 month old product.As for industrial design, copying the iPad physical control locations was a good idea, but:a) The \"home\" button is physical smaller and less visually distinct than on the iPad, and since the front-facing camera is in the same location, sometimes I confused the camera for the \"home\" button;b) Hard to believe, but the black plastic back is even more slippery than the alumni on the iPad - which makes it more difficult to hold in your hand for an extended period of time;c) Hard to believe, but the TouchPad is *heavier* than my iPad 1 (both are 16Gb): 1 lb 9.5 oz compared to 1 lb 7.9 oz.Two cool things so far about TP over the iPad:a) TP plays Flash videos on [...]b) TP photo app synchronizes with Facebook (though the order in which photos are fetched is very non-obvious);The good news is that all the software problems above are easy to fix - and you should fix them quickly.With Apple having sold, what, 20M+ iPads, and with the app advantage Apple has, the TP has to be noticeably better than the iPad if hp hopes to garner significant market share.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money!", "Author": "brn2run", "ReviewID": "R3S6ZZ0M1ISRS3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the HP Touch Pad 32g from Amazon. I was really looking forward to get this. It arrived quite fast and I couldn't wait to try it out. Took it home and unpacked it.

Here is when the disappointment began to set in. I play fantasy football on Yahoo Sports. Yahoo has what is called Stat tracker which is an Adobe Flash program. I tried to load the page, and it wouldn't load up all the way. It locked up. After loading to about 50% each time it would reload and never complete the page. I eventually gave up and decided to try something else, Netflix. I have an account with Netflix and thought it would be cool to watch a movie on my new tablet. I went to Netflix and tried to log in and I recieved an error message saying that Netflix was not supported on this device. Next I went to Hulu. Same thing, not supported. O.K. I will settle on playing a online game with my girlfriend, Words with Friends. Nope, that didn't work either. Hanging with Friends. Not that one either. Well I decided to go to the Hp Apps page on the tablet. Very limited selection. I paid $270.00 for this and I am so very disappointed in my purchase and I noticed there are no returns on this tablet.

Overall, I have to say that the discounted Touchpad is a great value for the money; however, I have noticed a couple issues that you may want to take into consideration when you purchase this item, even at a discounted price.  There seems to be a widespread problem with the sound system: it randomly becomes very distorted and the only way to correct this is to do a full restart.  From my own online research, this seems to be a widespread problem and nobody seems to be able to associate it with with a particular action or pattern.  But again, the good news is that a full restart will correct this until the distortion happens again, which seems to be once a week in my case.  The other issue, also corrected with a full restart, is that randomly some sites will give you an error when you try to connect, as if there is no network connection when other sites work just fine.  Weird.  Bottom line:  if your TouchPad seems to act weird or something is not working well, always try a full-restart first as it seems to correct the problem.  Hopefully, there will be an OS update soon that will correct these issues, which seem software, not hardware related.  Overall, the Touchpad is a great tablet at the discounted price. I'm not sure what HP was thinking when it tried to price the TouchPad the same as the iPad without fixing the bugs first.  By the way, get the advance browser as it seems to work better and it enables tabbing.  Also, so far you can't play Netflix streaming videos yet, and I know this is important to a lot of people.  A point of interest: when I try to watch vids on Comcast.net they won't play, but if you go to individual networks say PBS, ABC, History Channel, etc the vids seem to play just fine, FYI.  Enjoy your tablet!Update:  1/13/12- There was a system update this past week; I have not noticed issues with the sound, maybe problem has been fixed.

I have so much technology in my life that I want my 10 critical apps and maybe a dozen utilities.Who wants to live in apps all the time? For many things, we want services. I want integration. Web, email, etc. The majors.I got my Evernote, Voicerecorder, Facebookz, pandora, etc... basics.And it's worked the same while Palm was in charge, or Sprint, or HP...this change of hands hasn't had any impact on my phone that I know of.So I can't \"upgrade\" it to some future version of WebOS that will now never exist.Who cares. THANK GOD. I don't upgrade things just because there's a little alert that says \"upgrade me.\" I upgrade things when they will improve my actual experience or fix a broken thing. And if it ain't broke (read: it's working well) don't upgrade.But if I could get my hands on a Touchpad for cheap, I'd do it in a heartbeat. It'll give me a much faster processor, WebOS 3.0, if I can port over my basics ... as long as there are servers for the apps that do exist, mainstream and homebrew alike.... then the things I need I can get.Having an integrated tablet like that with a great processor and room to tinker with if you like technology, yes please!I guess I'm saying that as an iOS, I've really enjoyed WebOS on my phone so I'm still very excited to have the system on a larger format... I have long-wished that Apple and WebOS would team up because there are ergonomic choices in the Pre that are just spectacular and Apple would do well to incorporate. I think the operating system will work for a long time... I mean, I guess if Adobe updates Flash in some crazy way, maybe then it will stop working for Flash... hopefully that's 2 years out ;)And for the person who \"didn't know how to close windows,\" get an iPad 2 (although that won't solve your closing window problem because it just hides them in the background). If you are desperate, you can read the manual, or try this: on my Pre I press the home button and it will show me the different \"cards\" (apps) I have open... put your finger on the offending card and slide it up as though you are \"throwing it off the top of your pre\" ... it will close it.Good luck kids and how about ONE person say it's discontinued and then plus up that person's review so it ranks higher.... n00b pile-up up in here.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap hardware,  weak  app selection and an ugly design doomed the Touchpad.", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1XFXKG10S0BX0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Touchpad was Hewlett Packards attempt at breaking into the tablet market,  and it bombed terribly.  It's sales were so poor that HP was forced to have a fire sale to clear out the tons of unsold inventory that retailers such as  Best Buy had sitting in their store rooms.  But aside from Apple basically owning the tablet market with an overwhelming market share,  there were other reasons for this tablets demise.It isn't the most attractive of tablets,  with a thick plastic back shell that's not very durable,  as I sadly found out after dropping the tablet off my bed and seeing the  bezel crack  when it (lightly) hit my wall.  Its a shiny black plastic also;  a fingerprint and smudge magnet.  Don't be surprised if you have to clean it several times a day.Weight wise,  it's no feather,  tipping the scales at 1.6 pounds,  a third heavier than the iPad 2.  Definitely not something you'll be holding in one hand very long.The screen resolution is 1024x768,  which is the same as the iPad 2,  but the contrast is considerably weaker,  and the maximum brightness level on this tablet flat out sucks.  Even viewing this screen in pitch darkness,  you'll wish it were much brighter.The Touchpad boasts a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm dual core Snapdragon processor with 1 GB of RAM,  double the iPad 2's Ram,  but performance is still far worse than Apples offering.  The tablet uses Web OS,  an operating system found on the now defunct Palm Pre phones.  It uses a card system for opening multiple apps or additional web pages that arranges the apps or pages in \"stacks\".  It's  easy to use for tablet newbies,  but the card system can get cluttered quick.  Even just general web surfing caused  the tablet to lock up on me often,  several times a day in fact.  It occurred most of the time when new apps or web pages were opened.  Sometimes,  it was only 3 or four open apps or open web pages causing the tablet to crash.  Disappointing for a dual core device.Yes,  Web OS supports Flash,  but viewing any Flash based content on this tablet is such a painful experience, you'll wish it didn't.  It's incredibly laggy.  Even when viewing Flash vids  in lower resolution with a rock solid Wi-Fi connection,  video would often skip and hang up.  And you can forget anything in HD.  Oh,  and it also causes the Touchpad to crash...a lot.Are you an app junkie?  Have you had the pleasure of viewing  the many offerings on Apples App Store or Google Play?  If so,  don't even bother picking this thing up.  The Touchpad's app selection is atrocious.  They couldn't even make a good Facebook app for it.  It's clunky,  slow and freezes often.  If you like to play games on your tablet,  you're pretty much out of luck,  save for a few such as Angry Birds,  but that games on every tablet and phone available.It does have a 1.3 megapixel front facing camera for making Skype calls.  It works -- that's about all I can say about it.  Battery life on the tablet is decent,  and with the screen brightness at max,  expect to get around 6 hours or so general web browsing.  Viewing video shortens it considerably.The Touchpad was an unmitigated disaster.  I'm convinced the 4 star average rating for this flop were people who wanted to justify their $100-150 purchase,  trying to convince themselves that this tablet was good value,  considering its original Apple-like price.  I got suckered,  just like the rest.

I got it for $300 brand new.  I was excited, because I have a first-gen iPad, and wanted to start developing software on a different platform.  I have had high hopes for webOS since Palm first announced it, and I think that the original Palm team really had something.I got it home, and started setting it up that night.  I went from excitement with the excellent notification and multitasking design, to an almost depressed feeling as I realized that this tablet just didn't live up to basic expectation.Some examples:* The mail, contacts, and calendar programs supported Exchange, so I was excited to get everything set up quickly.  However, the mail program is terrible (by default, it only syncs/pushes to the inbox, and if you mark everything as a favorite, it loses the folder structure!).  It cannot display plain text messages - the messages lose all formatting.  This appears to be an \"exchange\" bug, but it doesn't matter for the end user.  It's basically unusable.* The web browser is decent, but even with Flash disabled, it didn't feel like it performed very well.  It's hard to explain, without side-by-side comparisons, but the iPad just feels smoother.  And it's running much older hardware.* The screen isn't great; mine had a fine pattern of visible dots which appeared to be part of the touch-sensitive component.* The apps store is (unsurprisingly) empty.  There's just nothing worth downloading yet.* I switched it into Dev mode, and installed preware so I could try out some lower level hacks.  That was nice and easy.  But, much like the app store, there was very little designed for the TouchPad.Just yesterday, I returned it.  Amazingly, even at $200 below most of the competition, it was still not worth keeping.  (Boy did I luck out on timing that!)  A used iPad is a significantly better deal.Now, in theory, a lot of those issues could have been fixed over time.  The software could have been improved, performance upgraded, the app store fleshed out.  But with HP discontinuing support (in theory) for this product, it's hard to justify.  Even if the price dropped to $200, I'm not sure it would be worth it.  You can't use the device without an HP webOS account, and if they kill the servers, I think it might just stop working.  (This is speculation, I might be wrong.)So, I can't recommend the TouchPad.  I wouldn't have even recommended it before the discontinuation, but more as a hold out to see if they can get the issues resolved.

What we got instead, was a less than average performing tablet, with very limited apps (more coming soon, I hope), limited connectivity, no front facing camera, and an operating system that have yet to prove itself.  Although I have already embraced the new WebOS operating system, there are a few things that I'm hoping HP will update in the future. First is the home screen.  Just about every other tablet on the market has a list of commonly used apps overlaid on the home screen, so there is no needs to go hunting for them as soon as the tablet is waken up.  Mysteriously, WebOS has an empty home screen with a search box saying \"Just type\" on the top and six familiar icons on the bottom, such as web, email, calendar etc.  You must tap on the app shortcut to reveal the rest of the apps then go to a series of tabs that list all the home, downloaded and favorite apps. I think these extra steps are unnecessary and can become annoying after a while. There are some apps that can hinder the table's performance. I had a hard time configuring the Time Magazine's free app. It caused the tablet to freeze and I had to reboot the machine twice.  There are also a few other apps that can give the 1.2 GHz processor a real challenge.  One of the most appealing features of WebOS is the email and calendar interface. It has the ability to combine all your web calendars and email accounts in to one. Although the TouchPad may not dethrone the iPad, or any other established table already on the market, it has the potential to be a top competitor once a new WebOS version is available or simply wait for the second generation.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "not that good", "Author": "TheDutchess", "ReviewID": "R22YVQV3RKGHK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had to return this item because it was defective and very slow.

Since purchasing it, the charging cord has broken and needed replacing and now the device will not charge despite trying several HP cords. HP's customer service/warranty is horrible. I have been told that, despite my device being under warranty, that it will take at least 3 weeks to get authorization for a replacement (\"just to get the authorization for the replacement\") and 6-8 weeks to actually get a replacement device. This is not very efficient for a computer company IMO. The device is also slow to load on sites with any decent graphics. If an email comes in while I am on the web, it locks up until the email comes through, sometimes for several minutes (but emails always come in on my phone well before this device, so I generally check the phone to see if a new email has arrived when the touchpad locks up and then wait). The \"touch-pad\" screen sometimes does not recognize \"touch\" and won't work, the speakers are horrible - so nearly everything with sound requires earphones. It locks up or is very slow on youtube videos, and is generally a POS. I wish we had spent more and bought a quality product vs this expensive paperweight (I basically could have simply used a rock to perform the same uses that it now does).

There are a lot of people with the tablets and they were dirt cheap when they went on fire sale.Today, even the CyanogenMod support is not that great.  There has never been an snapshot, RC or full release for CyanogenMod supporting HP Touchpad.  You can find alpha builds for the latest Android through other channels but not Cyanogen.

I don't like the fact that the ipad is locked down so much, and have been waiting for a suitable Android or other tablet, so far to no avail (Samsung 10.1 seems to be the closest yet). I sort of like the webOS, but it is sluggish on the Touchpad, even on basic things like changing orientation. It seems HP was just too quick to jump onto the tablet bandwagon. And so I returned it. But, note to HP: I might reconsider if the low-end model price goes down to the $250 range. Anything above that, forget it.Update 8/20/2011At $99 I'm going to give it another try.Also, to anyone who purchased at Best Buy - BB is extending their return period for Touchpads & accessories to 60 days.

It is much quicker and have had ZERO freeze-ups or other problems. Too bad HP didn't have those problems fixed at release.Also, the more I use webOS, the more I like it.

Personally, I don't find the Apple iOS single-app-focus very appealing for real-world usage. That's why I wanted to love HP's webOS. And I did ... for an hour or two.Going into this product wanting to love it made me blind to some really obvious flaws ... at first. When I got over my initial feelings, it was unbelievable how buggy, slow, and hard to use this tablet became.Buggy - Almost every app seems to have bugs built in. Emails can't scroll without pausing and jerking around? Really? I have to reload basic html websites 2x on average to actually view them in full? The system preferences apps get stuck on their splash screen? Really?Slow - Wow. I had my Touchpad on a great Wifi signal. My laptop is on the same signal, and it was adjacent to the Touchpad. What took my 4 year old laptop's browser seconds to pull up took the Touchpad's browser (on average) 10-20 seconds. Any convenience gained by having a tablet on your lap sitting on the couch or laying in bed is completely lost with the slowness of browsing the web ... or even moving within the operating system. Fortunately, I could easily bounce around among applications (thanks to the sweet webOS multi-tasking).Hard to use - It's great that the os has a built-in finger trail target to communicate where you touched. But it's a bummer that the touch point is only 10px large. I guess Apple iOS builds a much more generous touch space around each button ... because I rarely mis-touch on my iPhone. I would honestly try to touch icons 3-5 times before it actually registered. This is where the slowness and bugginess hurt the worst. You try hitting a button 4 times and then realize you hit it 2x without knowing it and the action occurs 5 seconds too late ... and it does it twice. It makes you want to frisbee the tablet into a wall.After initial setup I played with the Touchpad for an hour or two ... and then cleaned it off, erased it, packed it up, and went and got my money back.Bummer.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP TouchPad is in the Freezer", "Author": "Rose Kasper", "ReviewID": "RG7NJFG2M79FM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have an Apple IPAD2 but wanted a tablet with flash.

The next frozen screen(after limited use and about 10 days time) had me call HP support--an hour later it was still frozen.  The tech was telling me that I had to erase everything and start anew--luckily I hadn't purchased any apps or taken any pictures because they would be gone.  That fix didn't work.  I waited an hour and called the set-up folks who told me to call HP support--no way I told them.  They then told me a new way to unfreeze the screen.  After 2 1/2 weeks I am an expert on unfreezing the screens but I don't want to put any data on this tablet that I don't plan to lose.  Today I decided to return it to Amazon.

I love the card style multitasking, the keyboard works well and after applying the software update and turning off logging, the UI runs fluidly. The developer support has never been great and will probably be nonexistent going forward, but that doesn't bother me. Just being able to visit Flash enabled websites is really nice to have and eliminates a lot of those concerns. There are enough other apps to satisfy my needs and it can do quite a lot. The feel of the hardware is nothing special but it feels much more solid than, say, a Palm Pre! It definitely doesn't feel cheap, even though it was cheap to buy.Although a lack of official support from HP is disappointing, I'm still glad I made the purchase.

Though I don't think having a rear camera is a big deal but the weight of this tablet is extremely heavy, even more heavier and thicker than the ipad 1.There are a few pluses, the fact that you can upgrade your box.net account to a lifetime of 50gb.  Other than the shortcomings I havementioned, it has a 1.2 ghz snapdragon cpu plus 1gb of ram.  Considering the fact that webos' future is in doubt, we will see an android in a few months or it would probably run windows 8 arm when it comes out next year.Considering that this tablet went on this firesale for $99 is not surprising, though HP should have sold it for $200 instead.  By the time this tablet gets an android port, we should be seeing other better equipped tablets at $300.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Darkside", "ReviewID": "R3LX3X2LRK9NT0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Received the Touchpad today.  Been playing around with it, doesn't even come close to my Ipad 2.  It does lag, barely any useful apps, cannot edit docs, no camera to take pics or video.  Surfing with WebOS has been pretty solid and that's all my wife and I will probably use it for while it will be just laying around the house.  For $99 I can't really complain but would never EVER pay more than that.

I purchased the HP Touch at the fire sale price of $99. I did so because I love all types of technology and wanted to see what iPad's competition were doing. I would have never paid list price. I figured for $99 I could see what others may be doing better than Apple and figured worse case it would become a great alarm clock, remote control, and/or radio. Now for the review; the HP Touchpad is really sluggish compared to the iPad. The touch technology isn't nearly as accurate as what Apple has developed. Its mail program feels unpolished and not very intuitive. It was an easy setup and no issues connecting to my Wi-Fi. The battery life is about a quarter of what you would expect from an iPad. The app store is just awful! The selection is pathetic. I did find a good solitaire game and the USA Today app shines. It is a bit heavy and I dislike the plastic feel.The bottom line, it has become my alarm clock and great web radio (iHeartRadio app is great!). The best thing about the HP TouchPad is a HP accessory; HP Touchstone Charging Dock Web tablet charging stand. It is amazing & I wish Apple would come up with something like it. It charges the Touchpad without any docking connection or wires. Love it! So if you want a good alarm clock radio & you can pick one up for $99, it is worth it. Otherwise, save up for the iPad 3!UPDATE 09/28/11: I thought maybe I was too harsh with my review and didn't give the HP Touch a fair shake. After all, there are way more positive reviews than negative (why I purchased one). I decided to force myself to use the HP for one week for everything I use my iPads for like email, reading the news, chatting with friends, reading my books, surfing the web, and my \"to dos\".Day 1, life without my iPad was a bit frustrating. The touch screen simply isn't sensitive like Apple's products. It constantly doesn't react to my touches. Many times using the \"just type\" box I would be hitting the screen repeatedly waiting for the keyboard to pop up. Some apps it just doesn't work all the time. Even using HP's own clock app, it just doesn't registered all of my touches. Maybe I have a defective product.I hate the email program (sorry). I just couldn't get use to it nor did I want to. Holding it is uncomfortable but maybe that could be fixed with a case of some sort. As a chat device it worked okay and there are a few apps out there to help. I find the screen not as sharp for reading (the words don't pop out) and the Kindle app sucks compared to the one for the iPad. The pages don't flip as smooth & it would constantly lock up where I had to get out of the app and restart it. I even tried deleting the app and reinstalling it to no avail. Using it for the web is terribly slow! I just don't like the web interface and it is so sluggish there is no comparison. As far as \"To Dos\" I couldn't use Wunderlist that syncs with all of my PCs and Apple iOS devices. So I didn't even try another program. Oh, the App Store selection is PATHETIC! There are simply no applications out there like what you find in the Apple store.By Day #2, I broke my promise and raced back to my iPad!! Look, maybe my touch screen is a bit defective (although I think not). Bottom line - I just don't like the hardware or the iOS. I really don't understand all these positive reviews. For $99, it makes a great alarm clock and weather station & that is what I am using it for.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP Touchpad", "Author": "David C Wallis", "ReviewID": "R2ASRXQHA6U1YX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought an Ipad and was disappointed because it cannot use Flash for videos or it does not support Java.

Sometimes I have to touch a button several times to get it to work.  May be this is because I am new to this - but still an observation.3.  Navigation is not very intuitive - again this may be because I am used to iOS and new to webOS - still this is what it is.4.  Audio not good enough - a little too feeble.5.

Note that when you log on to Facebook it downloads your entire Facebook picture library to the device.Battery is excellent lasting all day.Experienced periodic freezing when browsing the web. Finding my way around the device took some getting used to and some guess work and dumb luck. I really didn't enjoy using it that much and neither did my family when I took it home as they kept going back to their Android Phones or laptops.Just in case your wondering, Make no mistake this is a Consumer device, maybe a small buisness owner, but there is nothing Enterprise ready about this yet. This isn't to say HP won't head that direction in the future.For me it comes down to price. Its to high for a 1st generation in my opinion $555 If I am going to buy a Tablet at that price I would think the availbity of Apps on Android or IPAD would be the deciding factor.

The HP Touchpad would not reliably connect to my home wireless network.  This morning it connected long enough to do a google search, but not long enough to click on any of the results!  It then connected long enough to take me to the HP applications page, but not long enough to download anything.  I researched the issue on line and learned that this is a common problem with the Touchpad -- and one for which there is no clear \"FIX\".  The answers to the problem ranged from \"Got a new one and it works\" to \"Got a new wireless router\".  I'm not willing to change out a wireless router that works for every other device in my home as well as for wireless devices that friends and family bring over including all manner of pc's and Ipads.

My kids love the Sesame Street.Org website (which cannot be seen properlyon our iPad's iOS) but on the Touchpad its awesome. Anything with Flash is awesome.Now the Cons- HP's Management dropped the ball big time by trying to reinvent the tire.DON\"T reinvent the tire. iTunes, Amazon App Store, & Google Play's are the tires. Don't reinvent it, they should've just made their own Store with their own style.This is why the iPad & Droid Tablets are so popular. I can buy an App, Song, Movie, TV show, Game, etc... add it to my mobile device,and remove it, replace it, and re-add it again.  HP has NOOOOOOOOOOthing that is so easy as an App Store with those features.Plus, I wanted to use the Touchpad for my Graduate program, but for some reason I can't download any of my assignments and view them.I would've loved to use BLACKBOARD on my Touchpad but I don't have a SPRINT account.In conclusion, this is a great 'SURFING only' device.The HP app store looks more like the DOLLAR store (not enough quality items) and iTunes, Amazon App, Google Play stores are the Walmart/Target stores.Where are you gonna shop?Anyways the kids love the SesameStreet.org website on it plus the Kindle app works terrific (when home).If only HP Market had the TocaBoca apps and PreSchoolPrep Company apps, I would've gotten 5 stars.Sorry HP.

Ding", "ReviewID": "R1KEQH1SC2D992", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before I go on with my hateful review, let me declare myself tech. savvy and able to search online and follow guides. I have done so, updated my Touchpad to 3.0.2, installed Preware, installed all the packages that disables backlogging, frees up memory, and speeds up performance. I have also over clocked my Touchpad to 1.5GHz.After all that work, my Touchpad still performs like trash. After iPad 2, some Chinese KIRF android tablet, Playbook, and Windows 8 DP, I can honestly say that WebOS is the worst, broken, unpolished, underperforming, feature-lacking, limited, frustrating, piece of junk there is. It's worse than Windows 8 Developer Preview, which is not a Beta or even a Release Candidate. It's absolutely insulting that HP will just release this half baked garbage into the public. All you WebOS fanboys can take this and shove it somewhere.On a fresh boot, with zero app open, zero background process, the Touchpad takes over 5 seconds to turn from portrait to landscape, or vice versa. It's not like the accelerometer is slow. You can tell the whole thing is trying to turn, but it just freezes and no command works during that 5+ seconds. That's how slow and sluggish it is. It experiences what I call \"micro-freeze\" all the time. For no apparent reason.Also don't' get me started on the touch experience. It's called the Touchpad, yet my MSRP $200 Chinese KIRF tablet from Malata has a more responsive, accurate, and fluid touch interface than this.The sluggish performance and horrible touch experience help build a rock solid foundation for the torturous user experience on this Trashpad. Email, multimedia, web browsing, they all work, but oh so unpleasant. WebOS just makes me sick.One argument for the $99 Touchpad has been that, the IPS screen alone, at manufacturer's bulk pricing, costs $67 per screen. That, plus the processor, memory, wifi modules and stuff, surely make up for the price. I don't see it that way. You can have very delicious and expensive ingredients, and still make a very bad dish.For $99, you are paying for more than good hardware. You are paying the price of admission to experience Tablet Hell. The Touchpad is your first-class ticket there, where Hell is run by WebOS and HP.Seriously guys, the iPad 2 is totally worth it at 5 times the price of this Trashpad. The performance, UI, features, available apps, more than compensate for the $400 price difference. Point is, buy this, for $99, if you are so poor there is no possible way you can get an iPad, but you absolutely must have a tablet now. If either of the two is not true, don't' get it.

When you scroll, you would think the page would auto-refresh...which was not the case...just a bunch of empty \"boxes\" where images should appear at.The weight of the Touchpad is not to sing to...it was heavy and cumbersome.The packaging was pretty good--with some thought of how to make it look modular like an apple product....albeit not even close but nice try vs. the Asus EEE Pad Transformer TF101/TF101-B.If you have the budget, I would consider the Samsung Galaxy II, Asus EEE Pad Transformer or the Apple iPad--the Motorola XOOM is a distant distant distant third. Definitely avoid the ACER ICONIA Tablet (crappy graphic reproduction for games and videos), the Toshiba Thrive (Who cares about interchangeable backplates when the storage capacity and pricing is way too high) and the HP Touchpad.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yeah, it's a rip-off", "Author": "deprogrammed \"deprogrammed\"", "ReviewID": "R1K96BJO2KR5TJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HP website is selling it for $99-$149, depending on whether you want 16 or 32 MB, so yep, when the mfg drops the price but you don't, it's a rip-off.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "SUCKERED - HP KILLS TOUCHPAD - if you bought this, you now own a brick", "Author": "Kuma", "ReviewID": "R2L42EQQN0L0MT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you bought one of these tablets, don't tell your friends, because you just got suckered in a legendary fashion by HP.

The app they do have is not functional, so it is NOT as I had hoped a very mobile tool to do work on documentsand I definitely discourage anyone reading this to NOT spend over 200 dollars to get one.Honestly I see why they discontinued it!!! The visual design is beautiful > it really is but IT IS A NON FUNCTIONAL PIECE OF GARBAGE.  IF you think this review is harsh its really not. I think its criminal for this multibilion dollar corporation to sell junk to the public.Dont be penny wise and pound foolish....I'm writing this review to save ppl their hard earned cash.. I can tell you , although I think the ipad is overpriced ~ its a very functional multifaceted device..you can use it to watch tv, you can use it to watch Netfljx, you can use it to take photos, email, surf the web and I'm sure although I have yet to research this imsure you can find some app from apple to get some work done without all the aggravation of a touchpad.  Honestly RUN RUN the other way.  Should be free cuz it aint worth 99 dollars or above ..the only other tablet which might be comparable to the ipad in my opinion would be the Toshiba Thrive but even that one should be further investigated before purchasing..I used to criticize the ipad as nothing more than a large ipod BUT you know what the Ipod is an excellent product and the Ipad has an amazing picture ..whatever anyone who reads this thinks I advise you to test drive whatever you buy ~~ dont buy it bc its on saleYou get what you pay for ..and in the case of the hp touchpad ~~ You will get less than what you paid for and waste precious time from you valuable time on a useless junk toy", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality", "Author": "sandhil", "ReviewID": "R3G6I24RJCFBCZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1) Wi-Fi  would not work correctly, connect, disconnect.

It is hard to reconcile that HP has owned Palm for a year, and the result is a piece of garbage like this. I wish I could say I'm being harsh, but really, this device is just that bad. Why?- The device regularly hangs for no apparent reason.- Application support is very, very poor. I don't think I've seen any tablet device not even have a calculator as a part of the built-in software. (And the selections in the HP store are limited as well.) Didn't HP once have a strong market in calculators?!- The device will stop connecting for no reasons; only a reboot gets it back on track.- The beta software that is used to synchronize music is terrible. It relies on iTunes, takes hours to synchronize about 2,000 songs, and hangs for no apparent reason. (Is there a theme here?)- Speaking of the application support, don't count on HP's store to have much, either. The majority of the applications are for their smaller devices, or don't work at all.The best summary I can give for this tablet is that it is the \"Field of Dreams\" tablet--the general method HP chose to follow with this garbage is that if they build it, applications will come. Instead of enlisting developers to make decent applications, they're counting on those of us who buy the device to bring developers. Good luck. Weighted agains the i-devices, and Android tablets, HP doesn't have a chance. They have, in fact, now stated that this devices is for \"enterprises.\" I hate to burst their aging bubble, but it is unlikely that enterprises are going to be any more happy with a crippled device than consumers are.

The brightness is set to max and the video was shot in a room with drawn down shades. As you can see, the brightness is rather inadequate.Review:I bought my 32GB TouchPad plus sleeve bundle at my local cost-co.  I have been very, very disappointed.First off, I was shocked that this tablet was as integrated with Google services as Android (I had a few of those, including a Xoom wi-fi). Indeed, HP goes so far as to block you from adding, say, Bing as the web browser search engine.  The location services are provided by Google and if you do not agree to share your data with Google, you cannot use location services at all.  This is just plain evil. The whole WebOS experience feels just like a variation of Android.Second, as many people have complained, the power button is problematic.  The first time after it shut itself down completely (probably after some update; I have no idea), I held the power button down for 10 seconds yet the darn thing wouldn't power on, even though it was connected to my UPS and being charged/powered by AC.  I had to try a few times to get it to finally power on.  Occasionally pressing the power button doesn't wake up the TouchPad from sleep.  There's definitely something not right with the power button.Third, the entire WebOS 3.0 is difficult to use.  Get this: the getting started guide cover just the very basics yet takes 18 pages, and there's a separate navigation guide without which you're likely to have trouble using the device.  Like Android, the lack of user-friendliness and refinement can be seen everywhere.  For example, to add a bookmark in the slowish browser, you have to tap a small clock-with-bookmark button (who would have thought?) at the top of the screen, then, get this, tap a tiny add button at the *bottom* of the dialog box, while there are other buttons at the top of the dialog box that do other things!  It's difficult to describe the frustration and annoyance of this nice touch to the user interface.  Compared to WebOS 3.0, the iOS is 100 times easier to use and Windows 7 is 70 times easier.As another example, there is a \"just type\" field in what's called the Card View (basically like the task switcher in Windows), and, as in Windows, you're supposed to type something to either search for it or launch an app.  But there're so many options attached to the field, so you're forced to go through a list of things to decide what you want to do.  Only a diehard geek would love this.  Why can't HP just limit the choices so one doesn't have to read down a list of a million items just to do something?The icons on the home screen (Launcher) are ugly, and the virtual keyboard, while it has a row of numeric keys at the top which is good, does not give you good feedback so you're never sure if you typed the right thing.Fourth, the TouchPad lacks quality.  For one, it often rotates the screen view on its own while my arms and hands haven't moved a bit; extremely annoying. Something is wrong with the orientation sensor (or whatever you call it).  For another, the home button (called Center button by HP) is difficult to press, partly because it's stiff and partly because of its small, elongated shape.  Also, as with my Nookcolor (but not a problem on any iOS device or the Xoom I returned), it's difficult to plug in the micro-USB connector at the bottom. BTW the connector feels very flimsy so every time I plug it in, I fear it's going to bend or break especially as each time it takes several tries to fit the plug into the USB jack.Fifth, the TouchPad feels heavier that it actualy is, because of its squarish shape. It reminds me of the new small Nook.  At first glance the squarish shape is cute and seems better, but in reality (and I'm sure Apple's designers found this out years ago) the square shape forces you to use both hands (unless you have giant hands like the Hulk) to hold the device - using one hand makes the device feel like a big rock.There're many, many other problems, but in the end, the lack of a friendly user interface and the unforgivable tie-in to Google's offerings (plus the high price for a wi-fi-only tablet) mean I'm going to return it to cost-co soon.  I just can't stand this POS for another week.My final advice: if you want to buy this, buy from a store with a good return policy that refunds you money even after you've opened the box and used the tablet. Judging from professional reviews on the web (I should have paid more attention before I bought mine and experienced so many frustrations), you'll probably want to return it.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP Disappointment (AGAIN) - Touchpad", "Author": "Ulices Diaz", "ReviewID": "R2Y8SXVXYW636W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this since last year and it was a great disappointment.  It was very sluggish, heavy and thick.  It was awkward to hold and there are not that many applications.  The Skype built in functionality was non-existent.  I could not for the life of me make a video call.  Finally, my greatest complaint is that the fingerprints were very evident all over the device; on the screen and the back.

I was really impressed that I, a very \"non-techie\" person, could get the TouchPad up and running almost immediately.  The first snag was quickly cleared up using a on-ine chat feature.  The charging cord is too short, but that can be lived with.  The buttons all blend into the case and, if you are anywhere sight challenged, it is a pain, but that too can be lived with.  The real problem came when I had to communicate with my HP 6500 OfficeJet.  I got the error message that the system did not support this printer.  I could not solve this problem with the on-line chat function and I requested a telephone response, which I received the next day.  Anna, the Tech Rep, was very easy to deal with, but she had no answers.  Finally after about the 5th call she said that she had done all she could and the case was referred to engineering.  She also told me that the system was supposed to support any HP printer less than 5 years old, which my HP 6500 is, and she had found out that there were others complaining about the same problem.  I used the HP web site to send an e-mail to the HP CEO and I did get 2 callbacks.  Neither of the \"Executive Office\" representatives were of any help at all.  They made it fairly clear that I was really a bother and hoped I would just go away.  Well they will get there hope.  I will return the TouchPad to the vendor tomorrow and that will be the last HP product I buy.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP Is full of BULL", "Author": "Johnny Boatright", "ReviewID": "R2KDTW44D2KYIB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am so angry after waiting for the price to drop and then for HP to discontinue Have not even had it a month yet.....

I went to my local electronics store and purchased one of the 34gb HPs. I was very excited to get it up and running. However, when I got it home and plugged it in NOTHING! The only thing that came on the screen was a USB symbol. It would not go on or off. I returned it to the store and was given another one. We made sure that it worked before brought it home. It worked fine. The next morning, after a night of charging, same thing, the USB symbol. It would not respond to anything that I tried. Back to the store. They were very upset and would not let me have another HP Touch Pad, they just refunded my money. I purchased the I-Pad and I am very happy with it. I feel that the quality control at HP was skipped just to get the Touch Pan on the market.

Buying the new TP is as if we going back to the retro years when products are issued 2 iteration late. It is awfully heavy, sluggish, lacks of basic apps like calculation, file manager, etc. Only some 15 apps are preloaded, and if you want a calculation, it is 3rd party from the catalogue.Until today, I have not been able to find a media player on the TP or from the catalogue.There are too many unnecessary card interfacing that bogs down the time to execution. When I press an App, I expect it should be resolved quickly to the application, not waste my time to flip up a card, blink blink blink until the sun sets in.Even when downloading the catalogue, there was this unnecessary task of loading the entire catalogue before the page is shown. In the android market, it only loads in 2 pages followed with show more button.The accelerator is too sensitive and in some web page, the grey spot when page is turns becomes too evident. Graphic is not fully saturated.Honestly, one star out of 5 is a charity.

I purchased my first and last product from HP (laptop) years ago paying $1800.00 which included $300.00 for support and then the battles began.  One nightmare after the other with this company. I actually had Microsoft and HP tech support on a conference call so I could finally convince these idiots that the USB port was blown and no its not the software. Same thing with the intel wifi adapter, yes I finally got these things fixed however the aggravation is not worth it. I agreed to help a relative with a purchase through a membership warehouse and it was for a HP laptop, despite my advice she ordered it and when it arrived the case was misaligned and the area containing the HD was buckled exposing the inside to contamination. HP's solution find a best buy or some other store that sells HP products and see if they can fix it, or send it in for repair. This is before the laptop is even turned on.  Does this company have any kind of quality control at their factories in China?  I think not! Laptop went back, sister is now a member of the never buy from HP club!  Simply put this company got too big to care, so beware of what you are getting into when you are considering anything from HP>UPDATE:August 18,2011Hey all you fans of HP, who have commented on this review as being inappropriate, I am LOL as HP has taken a huge dump on all of you by dumping their entire line of consumer electronics.
