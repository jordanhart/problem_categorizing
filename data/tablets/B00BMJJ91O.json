I bought it on the strength of the NY Times story and paid about $90 including shipping for the red version. For $9.24 shipping it came UPS Ground from the west coast, in 8 days from placing the order.I've been using the Ematic for a day or so. It works; it does many things well or at least OK, but it's slow, very slow.Pluses:It's got mostly intuitive controls. It runs android apps. I like the integration with google applications and syncing with same on my other devices. It runs a Sonos app which is a big plus for us since we have it at our home.  (I tried a Samsung Chromebook; it won't run sonos as of early May 2013.)  Another plus is the Kindle app you download.  It lets me read the same books I have on a separate kindle, on ematic.  It works really well.Cons:  Slow, frustratingly slow, esp using the chrome browser.  The touch screen really lags in chrome; can be several seconds or more; especially frustrating when typing.  I wind up pressing several times and waiting.  There's no sensitivity controls for the touch screen that I can find.  I looked for them after learning the screen does not always respond to my taps. In some instances I find myself pushing on the screen rather than tapping since it appears not to respond. When typing, it frequently enters a foreign alphabet character, like an accented e or o.  I tried to see if Firefox would run faster than chrome.  I downloaded FF and got a format \"not supported\" message.  Not a surprise, but want to note that it runs android not other formats.  Screen contrast and sharpness are marginal.As others have mentioned, its not bad for having around the house as a tool to run a timer, do a quick check on mail or the net, read a book, etc.  Take it on a trip or use as a main device?  Not for me.You get what you pay for in this case. It's an inexpensive tablet. It works.  You'll probably be frustrated, as I am after only one day.  I'd suggest paying more and getting more.3 week update:May 24, 2013:  I've been using it for 3 weeks now.  I would return it if I could.  Works well as a kindle reader, Sonos controller, and some android games.  As a browser its so slow, its useless or freezes completely.  Available storage is so limited I continually get out of memory system notices. No idea how to remedy them, maybe buy a memory card? That wipes out the advantage of low price?  Won't really run other android apps like NYTimes, Wall St Journal, etc.  Just freezes.Can anyone else who bought one comment on speed, freezes, etc?  Did I get a lemon or is this just not an adequate tablet beyond the reader and sonos functions?", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good if you use Opera Mini browser", "Author": "Customer", "ReviewID": "R1462HOZOJD8K5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought this Ematic tablet today.  Chrome is too slow.  \"Opera Mini\" is the fastest browser for this tablet because it condenses websites before downloading them.  You can get Opera Mini from \"Play Store\".

Its $80 Price.By ROY FURCHGOTTIf you're not sure that you need a tablet, $200 is a lot to spend just to find out. But Ematic has reduced the risk with the Genesis Prime, a 7-inch Android tablet computer that lists for $80.You get quite a lot at that price -- with an emphasis on \"at that price.\"Keeping costs down means stripping out all of the frills. The tablet does come loaded with a recent version of the Android operating system, Jellybean 4.1 (only Jellybean 4.2 is newer). That means access to all of the Google services, like Gmail, Google Play, Google Now, Chrome, Maps and YouTube, as well as the most recent versions of third-party apps.The tablet's hardware is good but entry level by current standards. For instance, the 1.1 GHz processor in the Genesis would have been top of the line a couple of years ago, but in watching streaming videos over Wi-Fi, it lagged a little.The tablet is also Wi-Fi only, so if there is no hot spot, there is no Web access. The device has limited memory, with only four gigabytes on board. But there is a slot that can take a 32 GB micro SD memory card (that will add at least $20 to the price). Ematic also includes five GB of cloud storage with the tablet.The tablet has only one physical button, the on/off switch. The rest of the controls are on the screen. That has to save a few dollars, right?The screen itself is reasonably sharp, but very small type, like that on the apps page, breaks up a bit. And the screen has a subtle blue tint, which you probably won't notice watching movies but which is apparent on print pages with white backgrounds.The only camera is a front-facing VGA, so this is not the first choice for photo buffs. And the speaker is particularly anemic, although when using headphones the sound quality was good.Battery life isn't stellar, with the manufacturer estimating a 4.5-hour play time.It would be easy to write off this tablet based on the specifications, but don't forget the one spec that really sets it apart-- the $80 price", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "$80 tablet, mixed feelings", "Author": "Jake Jacobs \"DiscDirect\"", "ReviewID": "R1TPUQPBER2HXA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have not had a tablet before.  Never even used one.  Had decided to buy the iPad mini when I saw the product announcement for this.  For $80, I decided to chance it.  I've now had it about 18 days.  It works.  It's small, it's lightweight.  Oh, also it's quite elegant looking.I've watched a bit of video on it on YouTube & Netflix. It looks good to me. Typing on the tiny keyboard is awkward @ best, but I imagine the iPad mini's keyboard would be as much of a challenge.  Instruction manual is VERY brief, & I wish there was more to it. In order to use Netflix, you need to download an application, but can't do so fr. N-flix site, must get the app fr. Google store (free). I've read e-mails, but can't figure out how to search my e-mails for a particular 1 (I can do this on my desktop), nor have I figured out how to send e-mails (this too, I can do on my desktop - I'm not a total moron). On YouTube I have twice found the search function for the site, but it isn't intuitive & I'm still not sure how to find it again. Also, the 2nd (last) time I found the search function, & entered my search item, nothing happened, so WTF?  &, of course, I don't know if these problems would be any different on any other tablet, @ least 1 w/a screen this small (7 inch, I think).  Sound from the speaker is very tinny, but seems quite good w/ear buds.The very first thing you're supposed to do when you turn it on, is connect it to your desktop in order to load device drivers.  I did, but no device drivers loaded.  A week later, I found out how to bring it back to factory settings, so I could try again.  Same thing - no device drivers.  My desktop doesn't recognize my tablet so I can't move files - I suppose this could be because I use Windows XP - but there's no way to know.I was alerted that there is a software upgrade available. I downloaded it, but the download didn't complete, & now I can't find it again.  Grrrrrr.I've gone to the ematic website from my desktop. Documentation that came with the tablet directed me to their site and a section of FAQ.  There aren't any FAQ.  There is a search function.  No matter what you enter, it returns an answer that nothing was found and directs you to submit a question, but the form for the questions refers to another company, not Ematic, and is for submitting warrantee claims for broken parts.  Their website says they'll reply w/in 24 hours.  They don't reply at all.For $80, vs. maybe $400 plus, it was worth the experiment, I think.  Again, I'm a novice @ this, so I may be missing all sorts of issues.  However, knowing what I know now, I'd spend more money and hope for a better tablet.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "awful tablet", "Author": "BLee", "ReviewID": "R3OTA0393G13LH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this tablet is virtually useless for browsing: incredibly slow and ceases to work altogether often. the display is poor, and there is very limited memory for apps: although there is a slot for cd card, the memory can only be used for data and not for apps. the only thing the tablet is good for is for playing mp3 music, and barely adequate for reading ebooks.I regret purchasing this product, and strongly recommend anyone to avoid it at all cost.
